 If you don't already have a webpage you want to insert the map into, you can use the following HTML5 template; save it as ‘map_page.html’ :




<!doctype html>
 
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>My OpenLayers 3 Map</title>
</head>
 
<body>
  <!-- Content goes here. -->
</body>
</html>


;
, Your webpage will need to include the OpenLayers library JavaScript file. To do this, paste the following line of code into your HTML file, inside the <head></head> area, on a new line below the <title></title>:




<script src="http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/build/ol.js"
  type="text/javascript"></script>




, OpenLayers will display the map inside an HTML element, so you need to provide one for it. Paste the following line of markup inside the <body></body>:




<div id="map" class="map"></div>




, You need to set how large the map will be when it is displayed, and you should use CSS to do this. You can add the following to the document <head></head>: 




<style>
  .map {
    height: 500px;
    width: 700px;
  }
</style>




, To start writing the JavaScript code that sets up the map, you'll need to add a <script></script> area to the <body></body> after the map container div. Also inside of this, you can create the map object by calling new ol.Map() like this:




<script type='text/javascript'>
  var map = new ol.Map({ });
</script>




, OpenLayers will render (display) the map inside an HTML element such as a div or a p. The value that you must pass to the setTarget() function is simply id of the element, which we set to 'map':




map.setTarget('map');




, An OpenLayers map's view is what manages what part of of the map you see. Create a new view object that centers on the coordinates (off the coast of central Africa):Note: Unlike the Leaflet mapping library, OpenLayers 3 deals with coordinates in the format .




var view = new ol.View({
  center: ,
  zoom: 1
})
map.setView(view);




, OpenLayers maps have layers which are stacked on top of one another, and are what you actually see in a map. There are three types of layers: Image, Tile and Vector. Tile layers are are the standard 'base' layers, and can come from map providers like Google Maps, MapQuest, or OpenStreetMaps. Each layer has a source, which tells OpenLayers where the layer information is coming from.




var tile_layer = new ol.layer.Tile({
  source: new ol.source.MapQuest({layer: 'osm'})
})
map.addLayer(tile_layer);




, In OpenLayers, maps can be 'zoomed in' to one of several levels, from 0 (the most zoomed-out) to around 20 (the most zoomed in). The zoom level is set on the view object, so we have to get that and set its zoom:




map.getView().setZoom(2);




, Below is what your webpage code should look like:




<!doctype html>
 
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>My OpenLayers 3 Map</title>
  <script src="http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/build/ol-debug.js"
    type="text/javascript"></script>
  <style>
    .map {
      height: 500px;
      width: 700px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
 
<body>
  <div id="map" class="map"></div>
 
  <script type='text/javascript'>
 
    var map = new ol.Map({ });
 
    map.setTarget('map');
 
    var view = new ol.View({
      center: ,
      zoom: 1
    })
    map.setView(view);
 
    var tile_layer = new ol.layer.Tile({
      source: new ol.source.MapQuest({layer: 'osm'})
    })
    map.addLayer(tile_layer);
 
    map.getView().setZoom(2);
 
  </script>
 
</body>
</html>

 Keep your hands/arms a bit more than shoulder width apart. Get a firm grip on the bar and look straight ahead of you to avoid straining your neck. Keep your body still and even, with your feet together. Your fingertips should be facing away from you.


If you're at a gym, the bar may have extra handles to support your hands.
 Keep your toes pointed as you do this. You may not be able to get them as high as you want them to be at first. Keep your back straight and avoid the temptation to hunch over or to curl in toward your legs.
 Once your legs have reached their maximum height and you feel that slow burn in your core, gently lower them down. Try going as slowly as you can to work your muscles even harder.









Make sure you lower your legs slowly so that you are doing the work instead of relying on the momentum of your legs dropping., As you get more comfortable, you can increase to 3 sets of 20 hanging leg lifts.









The hanging variation of the leg lift exercise is better for people with back problems because it does not put the same amount of pressure on your back as it does when you do them lying down.
 If these legs lifts are too challenging, you can raise your legs with bent knees instead. For this variation of the exercise, bend your knees and keep your legs together while raising your knees as high as they can go, nearly up to your chest. Then, lower your legs and start again. This exercise is a bit less strenuous for the abdominal muscles.

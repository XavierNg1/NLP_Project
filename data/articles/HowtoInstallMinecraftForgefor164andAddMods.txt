 If you haven't already, download launcher at www.minecraft.net/download. For cracked launcher please see tips. You can skip this step if you already downloaded Minecraft 1.6.4 - you can check it in the "Local version editor (NYI)" tab. If you see 1.6.4, go to next step.;
, Set version to 1.6.4. Click save profile, select your just created profile and click "Play". After the game is loaded, press "Quit game" button.
 Go to http://files.minecraftforge.net and find Promotions. Click on star as shown in picture.
 Select "Install client" and click "OK". Wait until libraries are downloaded. After finishing, a profile named "Forge" will appear in Minecraft Launcher.
 Now you can go to any site and download mods. Check if the mod is for 1.6.4 Forge. Not Modloader. 1.6.2 mods will also work.
 To install mods, just drop them in the "%appdata%\.minecraft\mods" folder (access it by pressing Windows + R then entering the path). If don't have any "mods" folder, go toÂ %appdata%\.minecraft and create one.
 Now you just need to open up Minecraft launcher, select the "Forge" profile and click "Play". Mods may not work if they are not compatible. For example, you can have only one mod editing the player model (also applies for Morph mod).

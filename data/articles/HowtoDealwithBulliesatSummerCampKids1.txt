 Being at summer camp may be difficult because you may not know the counselors or people in charge. You may feel comfortable approaching a teacher at school, but the strangers at camp can be daunting. Try to find one person you trust and feel comfortable approaching. This person can be your go to person if things get too difficult for you.If the bullying occurs and you are not sure who to go to, imagine yourself telling each person. How do you think they would react? Choose the one you can visualize yourself telling most comfortably.
You may want to confide in your parents if something happens to you at camp.;
, It is important that you don’t keep silent about the bullying. You should share with someone what is going on. Even if the end game isn’t to get the bully to stop, you can find a friend or ally in a counselor or other authority figure at camp to talk to.This person can be someone you can go to if you need to get away from the situation or feel safe.
Tell the person, “I am being bullied. This is a very difficult situation for me. I need someone to talk to. I don’t know what to do, but I feel upset and nervous. I was hoping you could help me with this situation.”
You can also talk to your parents. They can help you figure out how to tell a counselor or other camp authority figure, or take action themselves if you are having trouble getting support.
 If the first person you tell about the bullying doesn’t help, tell another counselor, team leader, or authority figure. Keep telling people until someone does something. You should not have to deal with bullying at camp, and the authority figures are there to help keep you safe.Tell the counselor, “I am being bullied. I have told other counselors, but nothing has been done yet. I feel scared, and it is negatively affecting my camp experience.”

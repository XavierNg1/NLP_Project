 Not only can fiddling with your braces damage your teeth and the expensive orthodontic equipment in your mouth, but it can also make your discomfort worse.;
, Is it while you are sitting down and watching TV? Is it while you are doing your homework? Knowing when you are most vulnerable to fiddling will help you address the problem.
 If it is at school, you might try a piece of paper. Think of small objects you can carry with you that will keep your hands occupied. Some suggestions include:


Rubik's cube
Worry stone
Handheld games
Deck of cards

, Placing sticky notes in places that are part of your normal routine will keep you aware of your problem and, hopefully, help you remember not to touch your braces.
 Aversion therapy is where you train yourself out of a habit with a negative stimulus, like snapping a rubber band lightly on your wrist whenever you reach for your braces., This technique is often used for people who struggle with nail biting, but it might help you keep your hands out of your mouth if you wear a bad tasting nail polish. Other options to coat your fingers:


Lemon juice
Chili oil (use sparingly)
Hand sanitizer

, Parents will be especially good at reminding you; if your braces break, they're the ones who'll have to pay to get them fixed.

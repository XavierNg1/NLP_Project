 If you look closely, at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off. Cut close to those tiny leaves, but be sure not to damage them.


Pinching encourages the plant's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves. This helps the plants grow bushy.Don't pinch on the lower part of the stem, or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy. You want them to get bushy, so pinch from the top.
 Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese.
 You'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh, so plan on storing some in the fridge. Wash the leaves, dry them well, and wrap them in paper towels. Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid.
 Freezing the leaves whole doesn't work very well, but if you puree it first or turn it into pesto before freezing, then you can store you basil in the freezer for months. Place the basil in a blender with a little water, lemon juice, and/or olive oil. Puree it until smooth, then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it.

 Bud blight, leaf spots, rust and mildew will occasionally afflict 'Limelight'. Bud blight causes brown flecks on the flower petals and mature flowers to rot.


When the weather has been cool and damp, brown spots and gray mold may appear on the leaves and stems. Leaf spots are caused by fungi that cause brown or black spots.Rust is also caused by a fungus that coats the leaves with an orange, powdery substance.
Mildew can become a problem for 'Limelight.' Powdery mildew makes the leaves appear white and powdery while downy mildew will cause yellow spots on the leaves with gray fluffy mildew underneath.
 All of these maladies are caused by fungi. To help prevent them, do not get the leaves wet when watering and water in the morning so that the leaves can dry before evening if they do get wet.
 If 'Limelight' gets any of these diseases, prune off the diseased leaves, flowers and stems immediately and put them in the trash. Disinfect the pruners by soaking them for 5 minutes in household disinfectant then rinse them off before using them to prune other shrubs.


Rake up any fallen leaves and debris from around the base of the shrub and dispose of that, too. Fungal spores live in the debris and will be splashed back onto the shrub when it rains.
 Bacterial wilt is another disease that can infect 'Limelight' hydrangeas. Bacteria infect the shrub at the base, interrupting the flow of moisture and nutrients to the rest of the shrub.


Unfortunately, there isnâ€™t much that can be done for the shrub if it becomes infected with bacterial wilt. The leaves and stems will wilt and the whole shrub may die within weeks. If this occurs, appropriate watering is all that can be done to help it. If the soil seems wet, let it dry before watering again. If it is dry, water the shrub more often.

 It is easiest to generate power with your bottom hand as close to the butt end of the stick as possible. This maximizes the power generated by the shaft. Your top hand should be a

round ten inches away from your bottom hand, or whatever feels the most comfortable.
 If you are shooting righty, place your left foot out front and vice versa. Point your shoulders at an angle close to perpendicular to your target.
 Be sure to step into your shot. It is important that as you step into your shot, you should point your front foot at your target. As you are about to release your shot, swivel your hips and push off the ground with your legs, maximizing torque. Also, be sure to rotate your shoulders with your hips to increase the power generated.
 Your release should be about three quarters, or halfway, between straight up and down and sideways. As you follow through, it is important to snap your wrists over to keep the ball from flying off target.
 Try taking at least 100 shots on both hands (righty and lefty) every day,Â at the least. Then, work on combining shot power and accuracy to become one of the best shooters on the field!

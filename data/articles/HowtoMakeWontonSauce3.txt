 Add water.
 Remove once simmering. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
 Use a colander, sieve, or muslin to strain the sauce into a bowl. Remove the spices (they can be thrown out or dried and used for something else).
 Add the plums and simmer on medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes. Once the mixture begins to thicken, it is cooked.
 Once cooled, blend or process the sauce into a smooth puree. It's fine to leave some plum pieces intact.

 If you are making a big adjustment in your life such as starting over from a long relationship or abandoning internet-dating for social scenes with more human interaction, then give yourself a lot of credit. Changing your lifestyle can be difficult at first, but setting the right pace by making obtainable goals will set you on the right direction.

Start by talking to at least one woman when you go out and build from that to talking to two or three on a given night., Investing your energy and time talking to women becomes difficult with rejection. Do not despair. Even the most well known celebrities and ladies-men face rejection.

Also, the more women you speak to, the more rejection you'll face; it's the inevitable. However, you will also increase your chances of succeeding by talking to more women., Kindness goes a long way when talking to people, and nothing is more of a deal-maker than a woman saying you are "nice"; that's code for "you're interesting".When you start talking to more and more woman in one social setting, people will notice, and it will resonate with other women.
 When you have entered a conversation with a woman, you might need to set the pace for getting contact information. Create a habit of asking a woman for her number before saying goodbye. Always ask even if you may not use her contact information. Good practices will turn into good habits. Remember, not every woman you approach might peak your interest. Speak to all sorts of women, even ones who are not your type, and be sure to ask for phone numbers.

Adding women to Facebook, Instagram, and other social platforms is a start but lacks that intimacy of personal contact info.

 Open a google search page by going to https://www.google.com in a web browser or open the Google app on your device and type internet speed test into the search field. This will bring up an "Internet speed test" window at the top of the Google search results.
 It's a blue button in the bottom-right corner of the "Internet speed test" panel., Google will measure your Internet connection's upload speed, download speed, and latency., In addition to telling you whether your Internet qualifies as "fast" or "slow", Google measures three aspects of your Internet's speed:


Mbps download - The number of megabits per second your connection is allowing you to download.

Mbps upload - The number of megabits per second your connection is uploading.

Latency - The number of milliseconds it takes for your Internet connection to respond to a command (e.g., a search query or a page loading).

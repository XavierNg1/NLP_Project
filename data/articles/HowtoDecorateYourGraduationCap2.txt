 Fabric pens are exactly what they sound like: Pens that can be safely and effectively used on fabric. They come in any color imaginable and have special features such as metallics, glitter or opaque. Fabric pens are used similarly to regular pens, with the exception being that you squeeze while you move the pen to release the color.Use caution when working with glue. If a fabric pen gets in your eye or is accidentally deposited onto skin, immediately use a water rinse to remove it., A glue gun is a practical way to neatly add on rhinestones. To apply, lay your rhinestones upside down on a piece of paper towel or cardboard.Squeeze a small amount of glue onto the back of the rhinestone. Count to three so the glue becomes tacky, and using tweezers, gently pick the rhinestone up and push into your desired spot on your cap.Rhinestones and a glue gun can be picked up at most dollar or craft stores. They come in a huge assortment of sizes and colors, so get creative.
If you donâ€™t have a steady enough hand for applying rhinestones, invest in a pre-made embellishment. These will often have several rhinestones in the shape of words or pictures with one, solid, tacky back, so they can be applied all together., Glitter paper is available at most craft stores and can be trimmed to fit the base of your hat. After trimming, apply glue with the glue gun or glue stick to the edges of your paper.Line up the edges with your hat and gently but firmly apply the paper to the top of your hat.


Not a fan of the glitter paper? This trick would work with any paper, including newspaper, wrapping paper, or maps.

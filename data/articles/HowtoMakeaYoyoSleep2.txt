 Gently twist your palm downward and let the yoyo fall. The yoyo should start to spin once it reaches the end of the string. It should not reel back up the string.
 Bend your arm backwards—as though you're flexing your biceps—until the yoyo is almost touching your shoulder. Prepare to push the yoyo away from you.
 Quickly extend your arm at the elbow. When the arm is fully extended, flick your wrist slightly downward and turn your palm to face the ground. Practice each motion individually until you can do it all in one smooth motion. If you have a normal metal-balls-with-springs-inside type of yoyo, the quick rotational energy will release the axle, and the yoyo should start spinning. Make sure that the yoyo doesn't hit the floor.


Note that you should let go of your yoyo as soon as possible after you begin the "throwing" motion.
Some find it helpful to lift their arm slightly after the release to prevent the yoyo from touching the ground. Be gentle: imagine that you are trying to move food from a serving dish to your plate without dripping anything.
 The motion of the yo-yo spinning at the end of the string is called "sleeping". As the yoyo slows down, the springs overtake the metal balls and squeeze the axle. Eventually, this causes the yoyo to stop spinning in place and begin to climb up the string.

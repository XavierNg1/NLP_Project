 Remember to eat a balanced diet. A balanced diet will provide you and your brain with the energy it needs to function properly. A balanced diet consists of a diet that is 45 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 35 percent healthy fats like avocados and nuts.Make sure you eat a balanced diet by eating a combination of oatmeal or whole grain bread with eggs, fruits, nuts, or avocados for breakfast.
 Whenever possible, buy fresh ingredients like fresh fruits, vegetables, eggs, and bread. Fresh ingredients mean nutrients, and nutrients mean good brain health.
 Buying fresh ingredients will ensure that you cook more often. By cooking more often, you will spend less money on pre-packaged, processed foods. To cook more often, set a cooking goal for yourself. Tell yourself that you will cook a fresh breakfast at least 3 times a week, for example. This can include cooking eggs, making oatmeal or an omelet, or even quiche for breakfast.


You can also prep your breakfasts the night or weekend before to save time. For example, you can bake your own whole grain muffins on Sunday night so you can have them available for the week ahead.
Try making overnight oats. Soak your oats in any kind of liquid, i.e., milk or yogurt, overnight. The oats will absorb the liquid. The most common method is equal parts rolled oats and milk or yogurt (or a combination of milk and yogurt).

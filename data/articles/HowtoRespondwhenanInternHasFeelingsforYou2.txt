 You may feel like the person asks about your personal life or wants to know more about you than you’d like to share. Make a clear boundary by saying, “I’d rather not discuss that.” Follow it up by bringing up a work topic to bring the conversation back to work-related topics.This can help redirect the comment while also showing that you’re being clear in your boundaries and it’s important to respect them.


Say, “That’s not appropriate for work. However, I do want to hear how your meeting went with our suppliers. Please fill me in.”

, If you are working on a project together, make sure that another person is with you while you work. If the other person leaves, say, “Well, I better get back to my other work now.” Involve other people if there’s ever a chance you may work independently together. You can say, “I think Ashlee could contribute well here. Let me ask her if she can help.”


Keep all professional time together professional and make it clear you want nothing beyond a professional relationship with the intern.
 If you must meet individually, meet in a public place such as a meeting room. If you meet in a private office, keep the door open or have a third party present.Keep any contact between you as strictly professional.


Safeguard yourself from any potential problems from the intern or other workers.
 The intern may invite you to join them after work for drinks or dinner, or to get coffee during the day. Spending time with you outside of work may be a way for the intern to develop a personal relationship with you. Decline these offers to avoid any confusion or mixed messages.


You can say to the intern, “I’d like to keep our relationship professional and not personal.”

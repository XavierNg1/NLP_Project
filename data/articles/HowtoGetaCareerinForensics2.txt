 Do you desire to learn and examine biology, behavioral sciences, chemistry, and mathematics?You should take top level biology, physics, math and chemistry courses while in high school. This will help you gain entry into a good university with a forensic science program.
 A future employer might judge you by the strength of the program and the prominence of the school. You should try to get into an undergraduate degree program in forensic science or in biology or chemistry if pursuing careers in medical examining or laboratory work. A degree in psychology is necessary to become a forensic psychologist.


Not all programs claiming to offer forensic science teach the necessary skills that one needs to be a forensic scientist. Be sure to check the details of the program before enrolling.The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences offers lists of accredited British universities and courses for forensic science: http://www.forensic-science-society.org.uk/Membership.
The Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission provides a list of accredited forensic science programs at U.S. universities: http://www.fepac-edu.org/accredited-universities

If you cannot get a degree specifically in forensic science, you also can procure forensic scientist jobs with degrees in biology, molecular biology, chemistry, forensic chemistry, or analytical chemistry.Some employers prefer hiring people with undergraduate degrees in “pure sciences” like biology or chemistry. Ideally, candidates have learned the necessary research skills in those courses and then follow up with a master’s degree in forensics., Consider enrolling at a university where you can minor in one of these subjects or minimally take relevant courses. This will point you towards a career in forensic law enforcement positions, and it will help you to understand the systems in which you will be working.

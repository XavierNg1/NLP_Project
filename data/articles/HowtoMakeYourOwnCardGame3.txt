 Even professional game makers usually start off with a dud. Before you seriously consider publishing a game, play it a lot. Ask other people what they think its strengths and weaknesses are. You might be biased toward believing that it is better than it is.When experimenting make sure that there aren’t any situations where the rules are unclear or simply don’t work. Be sure that games don’t go on for an agonizingly long time or that they don’t stop being competitive before the game is over.
When new people play the game, see if they can understand the rules. If it takes more than one game to understand how things work, the rules might be too complicated., If you want to mass produce your cards, a simple drawing won’t be sufficient, though it might be a good place to start. There are free software programs online that you can use to create jpeg image files that can be sent to publishers for easy and affordable production., There are now websites like www.gamecrafter.com that will produce card sets made from jpeg images that you send them. The process is affordable, approximately $7-$25 for a single card set. It can even cost less if you order in large quantities.Alternatively, look online for a list of board game conventions. Here you can meet some major publishers who might be interested in picking up your game. However, you will need to approach them with a very professional looking game in hand and a good pitch about what makes your game special.

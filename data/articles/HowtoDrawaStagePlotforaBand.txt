 You will be using symbols to indicate vocal mics from instrument mics, DI boxes, monitors etc. Both you and whomever is reading your stage plot need to know what all of these symbols mean. There are no official standards for stage plot symbols.;
, Outline, in pencil, the general area where each band member normally sets up. Keep in mind that a stage plot should be drawn from the audience point of view looking at the stage NOT from the band's point of view as this is likely to confuse the sound tech.
 Supposing that you have a keyboard player in your band who sets up down-stage-right plays an electronic piano and a synthesizer and sings some backup vocals, you should indicate in the lower left hand side of the stage plot a vocal mic, two DI boxes, three electrical outlets, a keyboard amp and a monitor


NOTE: it's a good idea to specify that of these two DI boxes one is for the synthesizer and one is for the piano

,, Once you have everybody's stuff on your stage plot you are in a position to know how many vocal mics you are going to need in total, how many DI boxes, how many monitor mixes and so on. It is good to list each of these as well as a total channel count at the bottom of the stage plot so that anybody looking at it can quickly determine what size of mixer you require, how many microphones, DI Boxes etc. they will need to provide.

 By training your horse to transition by listening to your voice, he will have to pay attention to what you're saying.

By using many transitions, your horse won't be able to zone out.
 By changing the direction your horse will have to focus on turning around when you ask, and stay alert for when you do ask., Free lunging is basically the same as lunging, but without the ropes. This will make it easier for the horse to ignore you, but once you can get his attention during free lunging, you will be able to keep more of his attention during riding and normal lunging.

Make many transitions and change the horse's direction frequently. Use a whip as a help (don't hit your horse with it, you should try to hit the ground if you want to speed him up or hold it in front of him for him to reverse direction.)
Your body language is also really important. By having an open position, your horse will know he's not allowed to come near and it will keep him forward. By taking a closed position, your horse will come up to you and hopefully even follow you if you walk around.

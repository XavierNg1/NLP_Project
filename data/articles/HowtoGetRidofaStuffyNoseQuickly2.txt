 Decongestants improve symptoms quickly, though they don't actually treat your cold. You can get decongestants as pills, tablets, or nasal sprays.









Do not take decongestants without talking to your doctor if you have high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat, difficulty urinating, or glaucoma.Limit your use of nasal sprays to 3 days. Nasal spray decongestants like naphazoline (Privine), oxymetazoline (Afrin), or phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, Sinex, Rhinall) can worsen congestion if over-used (a phenomenon called "rebound congestion”)., Your stuffy nose may be due to allergies if you have itchy, watery eyes along with a stuffy nose.Try an over-the-counter antihistamine like Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra, or Benadryl.Combination antihistamines and decongestants are also available and can be quite effective.

Antihistamines can make you sleepy, so don’t take them if you have to drive or work unless you know how they affect you., Steroids are powerful decongestants that your doctor can prescribe for you if you have severe or difficult-to-treat congestion. These medications are usually inhaled because taking them orally can cause unpleasant side effects. Discuss this option with your healthcare provider.Talk to your doctor right away if you’re using these medications and you get changes in your vision, nasal bleeding, crusting, or pain.
 Even when using over-the-counter medications, it’s best to consult a trained professional for suggestions on which medication is right for you and your symptoms. If you can be seen immediately, visit your doctor for a check-up and to confirm what’s going on. Or, speak to the pharmacist at your drug store – tell them about any medical conditions or allergies you have, and they will suggest the safest and most helpful medicine for you.

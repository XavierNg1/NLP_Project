 If things don't work as expected, you can test with Sendmail's test mode:

sendmail -bt
Here are some examples of things to try in test mode (make sure the domain is in class w:):

$=w
# is the map working?
/map virtuser joe@yourdomain.com
/map virtuser jane@yourdomain.com
/map virtuser @yourdomain.com
is the rewriting working? #** ,0 joe@yourdomain.com #** ,0 some@yourdomain.com

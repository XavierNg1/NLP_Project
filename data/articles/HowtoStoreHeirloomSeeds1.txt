 Plants with under ripe or ripe vegetables will not have gone to seed yet. A vegetable needs to completely finish a developmental cycle before the seeds are fully mature. As a result, you should wait until the vegetables are brown and overripe.;
, Cut the vegetable open with a sharp, clean knife and scoop the pulpy, seed-filled flesh into a bucket.


Note that for tomatoes, you can throw the entire vegetable into a bucket instead of scooping out the inside.
 After several days, it will begin to rot. As the flesh rots, the seeds will separate and rise to the surface of the water. Viable seeds, on the other hand, will sink to the bottom.
 Pour the water through a find mesh sieve, performing the action carefully to prevent the loss of seeds. Rinse the seeds by pouring new water into the bucket or by running them under water in a fine sieve.
 Spread the rinsed seeds out on newspaper or clean paper towels. Let them sit in a room temperature location for several days until completely dry. Move them around periodically to prevent the seeds from germinating, however.

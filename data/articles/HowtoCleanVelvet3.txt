 All velvet is not the same. You will need to dry clean some types of velvet, such as knit velvet and fine velvet with a plain weave.


You can machine wash some forms of velvet clothing, such as crushed velvet, though. Check the label, and it should instruct you whether the material needs dry cleaning.
If you are not sure, err on the side of caution, and dry clean the clothing. Dry cleaners will use special tools to get stubborn stains out of velvet., A steamer will eliminate creases in the velvet clothing. Alternatively, you could hang the clothing in a bathroom filled with steam from the shower.


To steam a velvet garment, turn it inside out. Point the nozzle of the steamer at the creases in the clothing.
Never iron velvet. You could easily burn the velvet or even leave a print of the iron on it. Furthermore, the velvet’s nap (sometimes called its pile) is delicate and easily crushed.
 Mix 1 teaspoon of delicate care laundry detergent with 2 cups of water. Dip a soft cloth into the water. Wring it out.Dab at the stains on the velvet clothing. Do not rub or press too hard or you could crush the velvet. Repeat the process until the stains start to diminish.
Now, rinse the cloth with clear water, and then dab the same spots on the clothing to get rid of all remaining soap or foam.
 You don’t want to crush the pile of the velvet. If you fold it, you will create creases.


Instead, hang the velvet clothing in your closet. Put tissue paper between the folds if you feel you need to fold velvet.
Shake the velvet clothing. If you spill something on the velvet, shake the clothing to remove as much of the moisture as you can.

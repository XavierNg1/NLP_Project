 Almost anything will work. Odds are if you shouldn't breathe or ingest it, neither should the fly. However, certain items found in your bathroom or kitchen will work better than others.


Windex is a pretty safe bet. As is Lysol, Formula 409, and Fantastik. Hairspray will work eventually, but you'll need to douse it thoroughly.
 Get as close as you can to it without scaring it away. Then bam! Grab that bottle and drown him in that toxic fluid! He never stood a chance.


Make sure he's dead and not just stunned. If you don't, he might end up reviving and taking off in flight. If you're using hairspray, this goes double. Make his pain as short as possible by doing a thorough job.
 You don't want a sticky mess on your wall from whatever you sprayed it with -- especially if it's a window (double the reason to use Windex -- no streaks!).


Of course, if you used Febreeze, good thinking! Now your house smells great, too.

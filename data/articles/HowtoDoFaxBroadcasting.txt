 Make sure that the network and server that will house the software has the resources necessary to support all the essential functions. If in doubt, consult with an information technology professional before making the purchase.;
, Depending on the features of the purchased software, it may be possible to pull fax numbers from sales databases, customer information found in a billing system or purchased marketing and sales lists. Since most fax software programs are configured to use spreadsheet programs as a source for the fax numbers, you may be able to either manually enter the data onto a spreadsheet or import the information from various sources to create your master source.
 Base the lists on whatever criterion is appropriate for your company. One list may be for prospective clients only, while a different list focuses on current customers. You can even create specific sub-lists that focus on specific demographics such as location or industry type. This makes it possible to use your lists for a general fax advertising campaign or one that is targeted to a specific audience.
 The idea is to make sure the document received by everyone on the list is structured to be easy to read and provides all essential information on as few pages as possible.
 During the process, double check to make sure the right list is selected by quickly reading through the names of the intended recipients.
 Most programs will process larger lists in batches, systematically rotating through the entire list while flagging numbers that are busy or that do not pick up. Those numbers are usually tried again 2 to 3 times before being returned as undeliverable. At the end of the transmission process, the software will provide a detailed status report to show both the successful transmissions and those that failed.

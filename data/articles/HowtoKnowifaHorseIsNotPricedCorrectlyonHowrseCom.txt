 Alternatively, memorize the right price for each horse type. That way, you will have a guide in your hands, or your head, at all times.;
, Go to the sales, and look at horses, try to tell if they are priced correctly or not. If you get most or all of them right, you have memorized the correct prices for a horse.
 Really look at the horse's potential, and notice its positive and negative sides. Then try to determine what price it should be.


Look at the training and its stars.
Don't pay any attention to names of horses. If a horse's name says "Fully Trained", the seller may be lying.
Examine the horse all over, and notice every detail. Even take a sneak peek at the bonuses.
Mental chants are great for slowing down your choice. "How slow can you go?" is a great chant to try.
 Remember that there are some things that may look rare but aren't.
 Even look at the bonuses. Scouring every little nook and cranny on a single horse may take hours, but it is worth it, so always remember to look everywhere for small hints.


The training and items tell you the most, although bonuses are a good place to start. For example: A golden apple may be rare, but a diamond apple is even rarer.
If a horse is a newborn, it might not have as much training. If you are selling a newborn, price it at 1,500 or lower. If it's a uni baby or has special things, sell it for equus not passes.
If you sell a full grown uni or pegasus, sell it for around 50,000. If fully trained plus unicorn or pegasus. If it's just uni or pegasus, sell if for a few passes.
If you are selling a normal horse, sell for around 2,000 equus. Never put it too high for the kind of horse it is.
Never sell your first horse. If you did quest, it's probably rare now. It is probably immortal and almost fully trained depending on how old you are on Howrse. That one's a keeper.
 You will eventually learn. Everyone becomes better if they practice.

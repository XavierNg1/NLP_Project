 They must have volume control, or else come with very loud speakers. Hide one in a place where the victim won't be able to see it, like under the bed, or hung on the inside door knob of the closet if they rarely go in there.
 Wait until you hear then snuggling into their bed (with some frustration, considering that it's short sheeted!), then switch yours onto talk. Take a deep breath, putting stress on the exhale. And another. They will hear suspicious breaths from somewhere in the room... so spooky!!!

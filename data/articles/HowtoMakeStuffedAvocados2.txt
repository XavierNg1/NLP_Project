 Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Wash 2 ripe avocados and cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop the pits out and throw them away. Use a small knife to slice the avocado flesh into cubes. Use a spoon to gently scoop the diced avocado into a mixing bowl.You can also scoop the flesh out from the avocados and dice it on the cutting board.
 Cook enough quinoa according to the manufacturer's directions to get 2 cups (370 g) of cooked quinoa. Put the quinoa in the mixing bowl with the avocado. Wash 1 medium-sized tomato and dice it. Add the tomato to the mixing bowl. Stir the mixture together.If you want a creamier filling, press down a little as you stir the mixture together. This will mash a little of the avocado.
 Divide the filling among the 4 avocado halves. Sprinkle 1 cup (150 g) of crumbled feta cheese over the tops of the avocados.You could also use blue cheese or shredded mozzarella cheese.
 Place the stuffed avocados in a baking dish and put the dish in the oven. Bake the stuffed avocados for 10 to 12 minutes. The cheese should be melted once the avocados are finished cooking.Sprinkle the avocados with salt and pepper before you serve them. You can also serve them with carrot and celery sticks.

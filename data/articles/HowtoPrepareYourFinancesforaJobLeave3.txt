 For most people, housing payments make up the largest expenses they have. If you are paying rent, rather than owning your residence, those monthly payments are effectively doing nothing for you. If possible, purchase a property and get a mortgage. In this way, your monthly payments will be building equity for you. At the end of your mortgage, you will own the property outright in your own name., As much as possible, try to align your mortgage to your target retirement date. That is, if you are relatively young and just starting out, then you may want to get a 30 year mortgage to last the duration of your career. However, if you can afford the monthly payments of a shorter mortgage, you will be setting aside money toward your equity at a faster rate., When mortgage interest rates go down, you should try to refinance. By refinancing, you will get a lower interest rate and reduce your monthly payments. You may also take that opportunity to refinance into a shorter term. For example, if you started out with a 30 year mortgage, you may be able to refinance to a 20-year or even 10-year mortgage, for roughly the same (or even lower) monthly payment amount. More of the money, that way, will be going to pay down the principal loan., When you do leave your job, whether for permanent retirement or as a temporary leave, you may want to consider changing your residence. Many retirees choose to move to a smaller house with a lower expenses and mortgage costs. You may also wish to move to a different part of the country with lower overall costs of living.

 Whatever website you use for reading and posting fan fiction stories, most likely http://www.fanfiction.net/, it's good to read other people's work before submitting your own. It's a good source of inspiration and gets ideas flowing. If you're planning on writing a Harry Potter fan fic, it's probably a good idea to read over a short story or series of one shots of Harry Potter before you begin your story.;
, Reading anything before taking on the challenge of writing usually helps.
 Preferably not fast music or heavy metal if it's what you usually listen to because it'll probably get stuck in your mind and distract you. Slow songs or trip hop genres are likely to get visual imagery and your train of thought on a better track.
 A lot of writers get their ideas for books from daydreaming, it opens a thread of thoughts where you can picture scenes or characters who want to come up with. It's good to imagine what the story is like before you begin it.
 This will give you a general map to follow when writing your story, a foundation that you can build scenes and details around.
 Don't worry about how it sounds yet, just pull the reader in describing the character's thoughts, a flashback, vivid scenery where the character is at, dialogue, or anything you like. Soon you'll find it easier to continue if you get into writing it.

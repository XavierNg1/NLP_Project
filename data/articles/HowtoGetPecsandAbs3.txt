 Protein is the main muscle builder in your food, so eat plenty, but not so much that you cut out carbohydrates, fat and other body fuels. Protein should be the foundation of each of your meals when you're trying to build muscle.


Choose hormone-free meat whenever possible.
Eat lean beef, chicken, pork, fish, and other healthy protein sources, like eggs and tofu.
Protein supplements, like creatine, can help muscle building as well.
 When your goal is to get bigger pecs and abs, you need a lot of fuel. That means eating five meals a day, not three, while you're in intense workout mode. You'll probably find it easy to eat this much when you're working out all the time. Be sure to stock up on healthy food so you never end up going hungry.


Don't eat a lot of empty calories from refined carbohydrates, sugar and trans fats. Stay away from snack food and fast food.
Instead, eat wholesome, high-calorie foods that fill you up and nourish your body. Get plenty of fruits and vegetables with every meal. Eat beans, brown rice, yogurt, whole grains, nuts, avocados, olive oil, and other nutritious foods.
 It's important to stay hydrated when you're working out and eating a lot of calories. Aim for 10 glasses of water a day, rather than the commonly recommended 8.
 Resting is just as important as working out when it comes to building muscle. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night, and on your rest days, do no more than a light walk, jog or another low-intensity activity.

 A radicand is a number underneath the radical sign.To multiply radicands, multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Make sure to keep the product under one radical sign.For example, if you are calculating 15×5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {15}}\times {\sqrt {5}}}, you would calculate 15×5=75{\displaystyle 15\times 5=75}. So, 15×5=75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {15}}\times {\sqrt {5}}={\sqrt {75}}}.

, To do this, see whether any perfect square is a factor of the radicand.If you cannot factor out a perfect square, your answer is already simplified and you need not do anything further.

A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer (a positive or negative whole number) by itself.For example, 25 is a perfect square, because 5×5=25{\displaystyle 5\times 5=25}.

For example, 75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}} can be factored to pull out the perfect square 25:75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}}=25×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25\times 3}}}


, Keep the other factor under the radical sign. This will give you your simplified expression.

For example, 75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}} can be factored as 25×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25\times 3}}}, so you would pull out the square root of 25 (which is 5):75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}}= 25×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25\times 3}}}= 53{\displaystyle 5{\sqrt {3}}}


, In some instances, you will need to multiply a square root by itself. Squaring a number and taking the square root of a number are opposite operations; thus, they undo each other. The result of squaring a square root, then, is simply the number under the radical sign.For example, 25×25=25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}\times {\sqrt {25}}=25}. You get that result because 25×25=5×5=25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}\times {\sqrt {25}}=5\times 5=25}.

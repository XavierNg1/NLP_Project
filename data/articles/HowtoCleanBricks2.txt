 Mold, mildew, or algae require different methods and chemicals than do rust stains or cement and mortar smears.



Mix chlorine bleach with water in a large bucket, using equal proportions.
Pour the solution into a pump type garden sprayer, and pump it up.
Wet a section of wall (or patio, if cleaning pavers) with a water hose.
Spray the bleach solution on the surface, beginning at the top, on a wall, soaking it thoroughly.
Allow the bleach solution to react with the stains for a few minutes, but do not leave it long enough for it to begin to dry.
Rinse a small section of wall to see if the solution is having the desired effect.
For serious stains, scrub the wall with pure bleach, using an acid brush on a broom-type handle.
Rinse the wall thoroughly with water. Be careful not to let the bleach solution dry on the wall before rinsing.



Buy an acid based masonry detergent or muriatic acid available at home improvement stores, hardware stores, or building supply centers. (Review the Warnings below before purchasing or using any muriatic acid solution.)
Fill a plastic bucket 2/3 full of clean water. Add acid at a proportion of about 1 part acid to 3 parts water, but do not fill the bucket too full, as you will not want this solution to splash out accidentally.
Wet the wall or other surface with a garden hose.
Brush the diluted acid solution on the wall, scrubbing as you apply it with an acid brush.
After applying and scrubbing with the acid solution, allow the acid to work for 10 to 15 minutes, being careful not to let the wall dry out.
After giving the solution time to work, rinse thoroughly with copious amounts of water.
, Use a siloxane or silicone sealant, applied following the manufacturer's directions.

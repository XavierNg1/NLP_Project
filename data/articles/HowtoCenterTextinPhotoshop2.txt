 If you're just trying to test things out, open up a blank new image and put some basic text on the page.
 You can also just press the T key to get to the text option. You should see a new bar appear on the top of you screen with font options, size, spacing, etc.
 With your text selected and your text took still on, find the set of three little sets of lines, meant to mimic lines of text on the page. Hover over the second one and it will say "center text." Click it to center the text.

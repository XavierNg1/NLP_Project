 A great way to dry out pimples is to use a sea salt face wash. This can work as an overall mask or to treat individual problem areas. Boil some water and then remove from heat. Once it has cooled some, measure three teaspoons of hot water into a bowl and add one teaspoon of sea salt. Stir them together until the sea salt dissolves.


Make sure you get sea salt instead of iodized salt. Sea salt is better for the skin.
You can make more of this is you want by increasing the amount of water and salt., Gently cup the solution in your hand and rub the liquid on your face. Avoid getting the mixture in your eyes because the salt will sting. Leave the mixture on for 10 minutes.


Don't leave it on longer than the required 10 minutes because it will dry out your skin too much.
If you want, you can also just treat problem areas with the wash instead. Take a Q-tip or cotton ball and soak it in the wash. Apply that directly to the problem pimples to get the same effect., Once the 10 minutes are up, rinse the wash off your face with lukewarm water. Make sure you avoid letting the wash run into your eyes. After it's gone, pat your face dry with a soft cloth towel.
 After you have washed and dried your face, you need to apply moisturizer to avoid excessive dryness. Make sure it is a non-comedogenic moisturizer, such as Clinique, Olay, Cetaphil, and Neutrogena.Don't overuse this method. One to two times a day is enough to work. If you do it more than that, you could dry out your skin too much, which can cause skin irritation and other skin problems.
 In addition to the wash, you can also make a sea salt paste for your face. This can be used on problem pimples to help dry them out and heal them faster. For this, use one teaspoon of salt to one teaspoon of hot water. Let the salt dissolve a little in the water and, while it is still kind of thick, apply the mixture with a Q-tip to problem pimples.


After about 10 minutes, rinse the mixture off and then apply moisturizer.

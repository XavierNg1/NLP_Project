 All bath salts start as sea salt, but if they're too processed, they can lose their beneficial qualities. Look for bath salts in packages that read "natural" or "pure." Those are the most likely to have retained their best ingredients., Pharmacies usually have high quality bath salts for purchase. Some spas do, too. If you can’t find them in a spa or pharmacy, look for reputable, natural brands in your favorite stores instead. Burt’s Bees and Roques Oneil, for example, are companies known for their natural products, and they both have a line of bath salts.Don’t buy your salts from places like smoke shops. They're not meant for use in your bath.
 The clearer your bath salts, the better. Clearer bath salts tend to have less additives and are probably more natural. Avoid bath salts that clump together in their container.

 Write out pi to however many digits you hope to memorize. After you've written it out, group the digits in even numbers by penciling in parentheses around them.


Start with groups that have four digits in each one themÂ : (3.141)(5926)(5358)(9793)(2384)(6264)(3383), etc.;
, The easiest way to memorize anything is by starting with a small group and working your way up. Like with weightlifting or sprints, you've got sets and repetitions, and you don't want to overwork yourself by trying to jam 100 digits into your brain all at once.


Start by memorizing four groups of four digits each. You can work your way up to ten groups of four digits each, one at a time, slowly. Then double your recitations to five groups of eight digits each. It'll be exactly the same number of digits, but you'll be able to up your memorization by adding larger "sets."

, Most memorization techniques or "mnemonics" operate under the principle that it's easier to memorize other things, like telephone numbers, than a complex series of digits. If you work up to grouping pi in groups of ten digits, you can organize the numbers into telephone number sequences that are more easy to memorize: Aaron (314)159-2653, Beth (589)793-2384, Carlos (626)433-8327, etc.


Giving them alphabetical names ensures that when you've memorized the first 260, you can start over and complete a whole "phone book."

, Try using names with the number of letters that correspond to the first digit in the sequence: Amy (314)159-2653.


Also try using real names and associating real things with the name on the list, or even fake things about each person. The closer you can link the numbers to the list of names in your mind, the easier it will be to remember the numbers.
You can also combine this technique with the major system and linking techniques discussed below.
 Carry the cards around with you as you go about your day, working on your recitation. When you can comfortably recite each group, continue adding another until you've reached your goal.

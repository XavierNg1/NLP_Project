 Will you be hanging it from the ceiling like a chandelier or as a centerpiece on a table? How you plan to display the piece will dictate exactly which supplies you will need.
 Before you can create the light source youâ€™ll need to have an idea of the surrounding design. Is it modern or art deco or is your room design more traditional or even shabby chic?, A massive candelabra might be fun and lend for more drama but does the room size support it? Make sure you size the lighting source to fit the room before you attempt to create it., Clear glass may look fantastic but you may want something funkier and go for colored or stained glass. You should also decide on the bottle shape since bottles come in just about every size and shape.

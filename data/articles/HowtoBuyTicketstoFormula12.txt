 Spectator seating areas will be placed strategically in areas of interest around the track. Most will have large screen televisions facing the seating area so that action on other portions of the track can be followed. Grandstand locations and television screen locations will be shown on the track map.


Decide to sit in a grandstand seat. The grandstands are named to identify the specific seat location. Each venue will specify if seating is open for free practices. For most races, grandstand ticket holders must take their assigned seats.
Get in closer to the action. Each venue has an area called the Formula 1 Paddock Club. The Paddock Club is on the second floor of the building that houses the racing team pits. From the Paddock Club, you can look down at the action in the pits or watch the entire race from an open balcony. Food and drink is included for the entire day.
Tour the pits. Formula 1 has no such thing as a pit pass that allows free entry to the pits. Paddock Club attendees are typically offered short escorted pit walk tours at pre-arranged times.
 Tickets to a Grand Prix race are available as a package for all 3 days, but less expensive packages are available if you do not wish to attend all 3 days of the event.
 Tickets are available directly through the racing association that operates the track or by tour operators. The official Formula 1 Internet site offers such tours, as do other specialty on line tour operators. The tours operators usually offer hotel deals and transportation between the hotel and the track. The price of the event ranges, but typically starts at $1,000 USD (800 Euros) per day per seat.

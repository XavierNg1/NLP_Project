 When buying a beginner banjo, you want to purchase the right style of banjo. There are basically 4 types of banjos, and each has a unique sound and playing style.;
,


Clawhammer banjos have 5 strings and an open back. They weigh less than other banjos because they do not have a resonator.
Frailing banjo style is played with the thumb and back nail of your first or middle finger. The banjo strings are spaced wider than other banjos so you can pluck the individual strings with the back of your finger or thumb.
Clawhammer banjos have a higher action, the distance between the strings and fret board, than other banjos.
 A Bluegrass beginner banjo has 5 strings and a resonator, which makes them heavier and louder.


Bluegrass banjo strings are closer together and the action is lower than a clawhammer banjo.
Bluegrass banjo style is played with 2 finger picks and a thumb pick. Picks slip onto your finger and produce a louder sound than a fingernail.
 Flat picks are the type of picks used with a guitar or mandolin.


Plectrum and tenor banjo style is used to play jazz music or rock and roll.
Plectrum and tenor banjos have 4 strings and come with an open back or with a resonator.
 Basically, these banjo styles provide the drum head of the banjo with the string count, tuning and neck length of the other instrument.

 Multiple moves can be performed with dumbbells to work out your entire core. One example of adding weight to a normal core exercise is weighted crunches. To do these, simply hold a dumbbell in front of your chest when you complete your crunches. The extra weight will make each repetition harder and increase the workout your abdominals get.Holding the dumbbell above your head will increase the difficulty significantly.
The more weight you add, the more your abs will have to work to complete each set.
Do two sets of twenty crunches.
 These are good exercises for working the oblique muscles that run either side your abs. Holding a dumbbell in one hand, lean to the opposite side.

Bring the dumbbell down so it is on the outside of the shin of your right leg.

Try not to allow your back to bend and concentrate on your core.

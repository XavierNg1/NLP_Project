 Meeting your garbage man and helping them lift up your curbside trash can is a great way to show appreciation. While the workers can handle it themselves, knowing that their community wants to support them with a simple gesture can go a long way in their morale.;
, There's nothing that says 'thanks' like a plate of cookies or a cool refreshing drink for them as they are working. Preparing foods easily packaged, in plastic bags and takeaway cups, keeps them on schedule while giving them something they can enjoy.
 Tape a thank you note, or a greeting card, on your trash can lid so it can be clearly visible on your trash can. Make sure it is clearly labeled so they can see it before it becomes more garbage!

, A great way to show appreciation for the waste industry is to make efforts to responsibly handle garbage. Donating goods, recycling renewable resources, and correctly handling hazardous waste is not only good for the garbage man, but also the environment!

, Raising awareness is always a good start to showing appreciation, and using social media it can be quite easy to raise awareness and, hopefully, give garbage men and women an easier time at their jobs.

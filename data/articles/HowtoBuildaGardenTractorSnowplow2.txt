 You’ll need to find something to form the shovel or blade of your snowplow. Items you can use to make this include:


A half oil drum or piece of flat steel sheet about a quarter inch thick.
 If using a steel sheet, cut a piece about twice as wide as your tractor and about one and a half times as tall as the front of the tractor. Using a piece of chalk, mark out five sections of equal height along the vertical length of what will be your plow bucket.


You’ll want to fold in the top and bottom quarters of the bucket to create curved edge to scoop the snow.
 You can bend this sheet by scoring the metal (cutting a shallow groove in it, not all the way through). This will enable you to bend the steel into shape by hammering it between pieces of wood.


Once bent, weld the sheet into place at the bend to make sure it retains its shape.
 If you don’t have sheet metal, you could try using an old oil drum cut in half or something like an old hot water tank. Oil drums are likely to be lightweight, which means that they will work better for a lighter frame tractor. They will also cut through the snow well but they are also likely to buckle under pressure.


Remember that there will be sharp edges where you cut so make sure to store it where someone, like a child, will not be able to reach it.

 Visit your local supermarket and get some 10 packs of Wrigley's gum, each pack containing 5 sticks. You may have to visit many stores to see them all. Note that some of them say "EXTRA", but are still made by Wrigley's. The only popular flavors that come in that size are:


Winterfresh
Watermelon
Big Red/Cinnamon
DoubleMint
Classic Bubble
Juicy Fruit
Be sure to sell sugar free gum as well.;
, Some examples include:


Polar Ice
Wild berry Frost
Peppermint
Spearmint
Citrus mint

, Calculate what would be a profitable but not sky high price to sell it at. 25 cents a pack is good. You still might be able to sell a pack for 50, but people might think itâ€™s a rip-off and repeat customers are less likely- slow and steady wins the race. Don't sell your gum at prices like 13 cents, make it multiples of 5.
 Go to school the next day completely prepared. Bring lots or quarters and other coins in case the first customer pays with a dollar and only wants one pack.


No special "exceptions". If you choose to sell your gum at a quarter a pack, that's a quarter for everybody, not 25 cents for your classmates and a dime for your best friend. Be fair.
 For example, Asia has some really long lasting gum that is unique to them. Bring it to another area, and people will be willing to pay a lot more for it.
 People may try to steal your profit or your stock, so you should always remember to store and keep your money in discreet, safe, and secretive places and put your stock in a place that you can check all the time.

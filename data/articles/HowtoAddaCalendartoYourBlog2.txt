 You can create 3 types of calendars with the following calendar tools.


Personal: the personal calendar allows you to schedule personal tasks, publish local events on your blog and check the weather to make sure there will be no conflict in your plans due to weather conditions.
Group: you can give your blog visitors some permission to edit the group calendar. This type of calendar is ideal for planning parties, sports events and other social gatherings.
Organization: the organization calendar is suitable for office events. It allows workers to participate in forum discussions so they can decide when they want to arrange a company event.

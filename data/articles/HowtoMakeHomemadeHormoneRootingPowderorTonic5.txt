 Some gardeners claim that honey contains enzymes that may stimulate root growth in plants.However, its most useful virtue is as a sanitizing agent which may provide sufficient cleanliness to give the cutting a healthy growing start to allow it to grow its own roots without needing anything else.Honey contains both antibacterial and anti-fungal properties.,


Remembering the mantra that less is more, take care to not overdo the honey, as the sugars in honey may have a counterproductive effect if too much is used.
 Plant as appropriate in the appropriate medium of choice (see below for help).
 The honey will help the cutting to stay moist and acts as an antiseptic.

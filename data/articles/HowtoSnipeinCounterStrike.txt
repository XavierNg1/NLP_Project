 Different snipers have different preferences, but the most widely preferred sniper rifle is the AWP (Arctic Warfare Police) for its high power which results in a one-shot kill almost every time but remember that it is very hard to shoot when the enemy is near to you. Alternatively, you can choose the semi-automatic sniper rifle, which boasts increased fire rate at the cost of power.;
, Each map has its own set of vantage points and sniping locations. Choose a location that provides good cover, but a wide view of the battlefield.
 Your team provides good suppressed fire, so utilize it. While your enemies try to kill your teammates, you can snipe them from far behind. Remember to stay behind, as snipers tend to get killed quickly in the heat of battle.

,, A sniper isn't a soldier who runs or jumps into a battlefield. In fact, you have to try to stay out of the battlefield as much as you can. Your rifle gives you the advantage of shooting from a distance. So don't get too close to the enemy. Wait until someone walks by, and shoot. It's not exciting, but you can get a lot of kills without dying.

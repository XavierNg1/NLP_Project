 To motivate yourself to keep saving, you may trying rewarding yourself with something small every time you save some money. This could be eating a favorite snack or treating yourself to a drink. Make the reward small and affordable. You do not want to end up spending all of your savings on your reward.For example, you may reward yourself with a small candy every time you contribute a set amount to your savings account. Or you may allow yourself a night out once you reach 50% of your savings goal.
 You can also reward yourself by giving yourself a free enjoyable experience at home. This could be a long bubble bath or a night in watching bad television. Think of activities that you enjoy and make them part of your reward for contributing to your savings goal.You may also reward yourself by spending time with friends or taking an hour from your day to do a hobby you enjoy, such as reading or painting.
 To motivate you to reach your savings goals, plan a big reward for when you deposit the final dollar into your savings account. Maybe you have a celebration at home with friends or perhaps you go for a night out. You may celebrate by rewarding yourself with some quality time with your partner or by planning out the trip you have been saving for together.


Whenever you find you are struggling to meet your savings goals, remind yourself of the big reward waiting for you when you reach your goal. Sometimes, the accomplishment of reaching your savings goals can be reward enough, especially when it allows you to something you have always wanted to do.

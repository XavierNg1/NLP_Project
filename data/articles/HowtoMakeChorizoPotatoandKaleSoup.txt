 Scoop the meat from skillet, leaving grease in skillet, and mix it in with the potatoes. Potatoes should be almost finished.
 Rinse and chop the Kale. In the skillet with the grease, saut√© some chopped onion, and minced garlic until onion is transparent at the edges. Add the Kale for one minute. Drain grease, and add Kale mixture to the potatoes and chorizo.
 Mix well and continue cooking until potatoes are soft but not mushy. Serve with a dollop of sour cream.

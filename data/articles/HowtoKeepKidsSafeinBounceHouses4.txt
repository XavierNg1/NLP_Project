 Though no one wants to think about their children getting hurt, adults should be prepared for any injuries that occur. Have a first aid kit nearby and determine which adults know CPR or have first aid training.


Know which adults are doctors, nurses, or medical personnel and ask them if they are willing to help in an emergency.
Discuss with other parents any emergency protocol in case of an injury.
 If a child happens to get hurt in the bounce house, the child should be removed immediately. A parent or adult should enter into the bounce house to help the child get out.Make sure you know what has been injured before removing the child. For example, if the leg has been injured, help the child walk so they do not injure the leg anymore.
 After the child has been removed, assess the injury. Determine the severity of the injury so you know whether the child needs medical attention.If the child is in severe pain, or has any kind of abnormality in the limbs, he should be taken to the emergency room.
If the injury appears to be minor, keep the child out of the bounce house. If any first aid is needed, attend to the injuries. Monitor the injury to see if it worsens. If the pain is bad the next day, take the child to the doctor.

 Wipe your oil rubbed bronze fixture with just water on a soft cloth. Often water is all that is needed to clean this type of finish.


Consider carefully before you use another cleaner besides water. Because of its changing color and quality, oil rubbed bronze needs as little cleaning as possible to maintain its shined finish and natural patina with age.
Try water first, and always test another cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area of your fixture.Dry the fixture immediately with a clean, dry cloth.;
, Dampen a soft sponge to remove hard water stains. Buff dry with a soft cloth.


Don’t use steel wool or very scratchy, abrasive sponges or cloths. Also avoid bleach-based or other harsh cleaners.
Observe your fixture after you have rubbed gently with a damp sponge and dried it. If spots reappear, repeat the process or consider a vinegar solution if the stains are very bad.
 Mix one part vinegar with one part water for use on more difficult marks on your bronze finish. Do this for any hard water deposits that just water won’t remove.Test the vinegar mixture on your fixture first by dipping a q-tip into it and applying it to the metal to determine what effect it will have before you use it on the entire surface.
Gently rub the vinegar mixture onto your fixture with a soft cloth, or soak a paper towel in the mixture and leave it on the fixture for about 15 minutes.

 If there is one that seems so cute and you really like it, buy it. Don't go thinking, "Well, maybe I'll find a cuter one tomorrow." You would be putting that Webkinz down, and chances are you won't find another quite like it.;
, Do not rip the ribbon that holds the adoption code! Once you are home, get ready for the real work.
 This could take hours, but you should not break the ribbon and patience is just a part of being a good owner. After getting the ribbon off, use a pair of scissors to cut the little plastic tag that holds the code on.
 You should name your pet wisely. It cannot be changed, this can be very confusing for you.
 Get a piece of paper, a Sharpie, scissors, and a marker in your favorite color. Cut the piece of paper in a circle or rectangle. Make a little hole in the top middle. Color the "tag" completely with the marker. Once dried, with the sharpie write the name of your Webkinz. Slip the ribbon through the hole you made, and tie it around your Webkinz neck. You now have a collar!

, Your Webkinz needs to own it's bed, or it's own little home. The home could be a space under a coffee table hidden in the corner of your living room, etc. Get blankets and a tiny pillow for the bed. Decorate with your favorite color. Base the theme on the color. For example, let's say you decorated with the color hot pink. Then, base the furniture and stuff on roses. See what I'm getting at?

, Celebrate it's birthday and cuddle with it while watching a movie, etc. Decorate your Webkinz with cute earrings, collars, and bracelets.

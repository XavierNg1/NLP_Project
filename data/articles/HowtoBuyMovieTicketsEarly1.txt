 Oftentimes, theaters will list their phone number online as well as their current and upcoming movie showings. Choose which showing you would like to go to from their online schedule.


If you are going to larger theater chain, such as AMC, be sure to obtain the number of the theater that is located nearest to you.
Once you've chosen your theater and showing, jot down their phone number.;
, Let them know exactly which movie and what time you would like to go. Some theaters only allow you to buy your ticket a certain number of days ahead of time so be sure to inquire about any specific regulations.


If the theater requires you to wait to reserve a ticket then be patient and call back as soon as you are allowed to (for some theaters, this may be the day of the showing). You can even set a reminder on your phone if it’s for a movie you think will be particularly crowded and difficult to get a ticket for.
Blockbuster releases that are in high demand may have available tickets and showtimes up to a month in advance,so don’t be afraid to ask if there’s an upcoming movie that you’re dying to see and want to reserve tickets for far in advance.
 Some theaters will allow you to reserve your ticket ahead of time and you can pay when you arrive while others will require your credit card information over the phone to charge you at the time of calling. It’s best to have that information readily available so that you don’t lose your spot.


If you don’t have a debit or credit card, ask to borrow a friend or family member’s and then pay them back in cash.

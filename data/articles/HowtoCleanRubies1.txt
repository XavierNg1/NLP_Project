 Add a couple of drops of gentle liquid soap with warm, not hot, water and let the stone soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Be mindful if you’re cleaning multiple stones or pieces at once as to not overcrowd your cleaning dish., Using a soft bristle brush or cloth, gently rub the stone to loosen up any debris or dirt from the stone and setting. Don’t scrub too hard and avoid getting too deep between crevices so the ruby doesn’t become unsecure.
 Take a good look at the stone to see how much more cleaning it needs. If it looks shiny and clean, swish it around in the water solution one last time to get rid of any lingering dirt. If it’s still a bit dirty, refill your bowl with clean water and solution and let it soak one more time before scrubbing again.
 Wipe the stone clean with a dry, lint-free cloth. Place it on a rag or cloth to let fully dry before wearing or storing.

 Use either of the pointer star methods to help you.
 The most accurate way to do this is with a quadrant or sextant, which lets you read the angle off its curved section. This angle measure is the same as your latitude north of the equator.


If you donâ€™t have a quadrant or sextant, you can approximate the angle by extending your fist to the horizon and stacking fists hand-over-hand until you reach the North Star. Your extended fist is approximately 10 degrees of angle measure.

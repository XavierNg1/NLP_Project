 You already have a lot of operating costs with a vehicle, licensing, ingredients, etc. The marketing should be principally word-of-mouth, social media and leaflets or business cards. It's unlikely you'll be buying TV ads at this point.


By all means develop your own website. This is a great way to promote the business, share cupcake thoughts and stay connected with your customers.
Start a Facebook or Twitter account, so you can be part of the social media crowd.
Describe your products tantalizingly but honestly, so that customers know what to expect.
 If you roam a lot, post a schedule and location directory on your website and Facebook/Twitter sites. Encourage people to follow you or to request emailed updates about location changes or events you'll be attending.

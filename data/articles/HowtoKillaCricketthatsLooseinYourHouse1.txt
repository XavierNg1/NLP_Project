 Purchase a few sticky traps (typically meant for rats or mice) and place them around your home wherever you believe there might be crickets. The crickets will walk over the trap and get stuck.Placing a bit of cornmeal in the center of each trap will help attract the crickets to the traps.;
, Take a can of beer and empty the contents, leaving behind just a few drops. Leave the beer can lying on its side in the area where the crickets are. The crickets will be attracted to the beer and will crawl in the beer to get to the drops left inside, and get stuck inside.If you like to fish, you can take the crickets youâ€™ve caught and use them as fish bait. Alternatively, you can cut the can open outside and release the crickets if you want to.
 This method will allow you to catch crickets without purchasing commercial sticky traps. Take a clean glass jar and place a generous spoonful inside the jar. Add a bit of water to make the molasses just a bit more runny. Place the open jar in the area where you have heard/seen crickets. The crickets will be attracted to the molasses, and will jump into the jar to get to it.The stickiness of the molasses will make it difficult for the crickets to escape.
Be sure to clean out the jar regularly.

 If the sick person has any kind of virus, you don't want to expose yourself to it. Put on some disposable gloves. If necessary, use extra protection, like a hygienic mask.;
, Vomit often has large chunks of food in it. These should be wiped up immediately using paper towels. Transfer as many large chunks as you can to a garbage bag right away., Vomit is often acidic and requires a enzyme-containing cleaner. You should be able to find enzyme cleaners online or at department stores. Spritz some of the cleaner on the vomit. Then, use a damp rag or paper towel to gently scrub the vomit off the floor.If you don't have an enzyme cleaner on hand, you can use dish soap. While it's generally best to use a stronger cleaner, dish soap in your kitchen can work in a pinch.
 If there's any bits of vomit remaining on the floor, soak them up. Liquid residue may linger after cleaning, for example. Press a paper towel or clean rag over the spot to remove any lingering traces of vomit.

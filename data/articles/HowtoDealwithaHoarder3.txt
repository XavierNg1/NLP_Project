 There are many complex factors that contribute to hoarding behavior, but many hoarders have common risk factors. Hoarders often have a family member who is also a hoarder, experience a brain injury, or undergo a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one. Some hoarding behavior also results from co-occurring mental health conditions, such as:anxiety
trauma
depression
attention deficit disorder or hyperactivity
alcohol abuse
being raised in chaotic homes
schizophrenia
dementia
excessive-compulsive disorder
personality disorders

, It may be emotional or embarrassing for the hoarder to have a family member sorting through his things. He may be more open to having a professional organizer or an objective outsider help.
 Cleaning alone will not solve most hoarding problems. Individuals suffering from hoarding disorder often need a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), skills building, and medication.The particular method of CBT used with hoarders is called exposure and response prevention, which desensitizes participants to the things that they fear and reduces their responses to that fear.Medications prescribed for hoarders are often SSRI antidepressants that are used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder as well. Some of these medications include Anafranil, Zofran, Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, and Paxil., If you live with the hoarder or if he is a family member, you may both benefit from couples therapy, family therapy, or group therapy.Attending therapy together may encourage him to go to his therapy sessions.
 A physician may be able to give you advice about how best to work with a hoarder or convince him to seek help through therapy. Some communities also offer assistance for hoarding or mental health issues through their public health agencies.


It may be necessary for public health or animal welfare agencies to intervene with the hoarder.

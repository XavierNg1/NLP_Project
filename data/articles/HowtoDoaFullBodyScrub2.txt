 Baking soda is a common all purpose ingredient that can be used everywhere from your toilet bowl to your hair. Simply buy or find baking soda somewhere in your house.
 All you need to do to create a paste is to add water. Fill your palm with baking soda and add it to a bowl. Then slowly mix in water, one tablespoon at a time.For deeper exfoliating properties, add granulated sugar.
For an aromatic effect, add 3-5 drops of witch-hazel extract.
 This process will remove the dead skin from your body. Start with your toes and work your way up to your scalp. Use your hands to rub the lotion into your skin. You can either apply the solution during your shower or before.For better results allow the scrub to settle into your skin for two minutes before you wash it off.
 Turn on the shower and let the water wash the scrub away. There isn't any need to use soap, a washcloth or loofah. Guide the water with your hands in a massaging way.


This is suppose to be a gentle process. If you want a deeper scrub then use sugar, but never be too rough on your skin.

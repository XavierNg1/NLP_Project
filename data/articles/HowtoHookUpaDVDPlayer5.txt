 DVD players need a power source in order to work, so double-check that the player is plugged into the wall or a power strip.
 DVD players will display on one of the Input or Auxiliary channels. They will not show up on Channel 3 or 4 like some VCRs.


Some TVs will label the Input channels based on the type of input, such as "HDMI", "AV", and "COMPONENT." Refer back to Method one if you have a question about which input type you are using.
 Sometimes, old cables can become frayed and the plugs can start coming loose. This can lead to a poor or nonworking connection. Try a new cable to see if your problem can be fixed.


Note: There are a lot of companies that market extremely expensive cables. For the most part, you will not see any significant difference using high-end cables. This is especially true for HDMI, where a $5 cable will perform the same as an $80 cable.

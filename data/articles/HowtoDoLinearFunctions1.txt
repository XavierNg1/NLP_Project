 Linear functions are typically written in the form f(x) = ax + b. The a represents the gradient of the line, which gives the rate of change of the dependent variable. This is also known as the “slope.” The b represents the y-axis intercept. It is the value of the dependent variable y or, in other words, f(x) when x = 0.


Say, for example, that you have a function f(x) = x + 5. This is a linear function in standard form.





;
, You know your graph will be a straight line because you have a linear function; therefore, you really need only two points. In general, though, you should find three points instead, to check for accuracy.


In the example above, you might choose to use -1, 0, and 1 for your x values. Solve as shown.
 Plot your points on the coordinate system, using the values you got from solving your three equations.


In the example above, your graph would look like this.
 For any two points, there is only one way to connect them with a straight line. Use a ruler to join them with a straight line. Note that if you graph three points, and they don’t all lie on the same line, then you’ve made a mistake somewhere. Go back and calculate again.


In the example above, your graph would look like this.

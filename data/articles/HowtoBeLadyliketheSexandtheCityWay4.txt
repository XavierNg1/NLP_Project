 Samantha sees what she wants a goes for it. Be passionate not emotional. Rage about things, lust after things, don't day dream about what might of been and wait for life to give you what you what, take it!

, Samantha gets to the point when talking and doesn't believe in dropping hints to get what she wants. There's no need to be aggressive, but don't simper or pout to try to get your way if you want to be ladylike in Samantha's way.
 Samantha is the type of lady who doesn't doubt herself. Don't be a wall flower at social gatherings, stride into rooms with your head held high. Make an entrance, don't just walk in, head down, trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself.

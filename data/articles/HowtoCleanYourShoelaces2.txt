 It is much easier and more effective to clean your shoe laces once they have been removed from the shoes.
 Dried caked on dirt and mud should come off fairly easily with a little bit of scrubbing.
 The water will be used to saturate the laces. Soap helps loosen particles of dirt from the fabric of the laces for easier cleaning.
 Allow the material to become thoroughly soaked. The shoelaces will likely swell and any surface grime will detach. Stir them around a bit if youâ€™d like to promote this action.
 Be mindful of the aglet as these can crack or peel off if handled roughly.
 If dirt remains, repeat steps 2 through 6 until laces are thoroughly clean.
 To avoid damage to the aglets and shrinkage of the laces, do not put them in a dryer. This can damage elastic fibers or structures that make the shoe stay laced longer. It may take several hours for your laces to dry completely., If the aglets were damaged in the cleaning process, you can use a piece of scotch tape to wrap the ends of the laces and make them easier to fit through the eyelets.

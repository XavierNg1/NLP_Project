 Spray the inside of your slow cooker with cooking or baking spray so that the crust doesn't stick. Lay one refrigerated pie crust into the bottom of the slow cooker and use your fingers to press the edges of the crust up the sides of the slow cooker.Traditional pecan pie works best in a round slow cooker, but will still work if you have an oval slow cooker.
You could also lay parchment paper inside the slow cooker before you lay down the crust. This will make it easier to lift the pie out, but may make the crust softer.
 Place all of the filling ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir them well until they're combined. Reserve about 1/2 cup (65 g) of the pecans for sprinkling over the top. You'll need to mix together:3 eggs
1 cup (225 g) of sugar
⅔ cup (200 g) of dark corn syrup
⅓ cup (75 g) of butter, melted
⅛ teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1½ cups (190 g) of chopped pecans

, Spoon the pecan pie filling onto the crust in your slow cooker. Arrange the remaining 1/2 cup (65 g) of pecans over the top of the filling. You can sprinkle them or create a decorative design with the pecans.You can leave the decorative pecans whole if you want a striking presentation. Keep in mind that whole pecans will be trickier to cut into than chopped ones.
 Cover the slow cooker with its lid and turn the cooker on to HIGH heat. Bake the pecan pie for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until the crust turns golden brown and the filling bubbles around the edges. If you lined the slow cooker with parchment, carefully lift the pie up and out. Or slice individual pieces and lift them out. Serve the pie with vanilla ice cream.If you're cooking the pie in an oval slow cooker, you may need to adjust the heat or time. Try cooking it on LOW for the recommended time.

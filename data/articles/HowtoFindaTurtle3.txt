 If you have lost a turtle in your home or yard, create a solid perimeter that keeps the animal from escaping further afield. Close doors, move furniture, and try to keep a good idea of where the turtle might be.


Restrain any large pets that might try to prey on the turtle. This includes dogs and cats., Check every room. Turtles can move quickly when they want to do so, and the animal may have roamed further than you expect. Look underneath furniture, and do not make any assumptions about where the turtle might be. Expect it to be most active during the day, and to sleep at night.Make sure that the turtle hasn't fallen down stairs, or fallen from a high place. Block off these danger zones, if you haven't already.
Listen for movement. If you have tile or hardwood floors, then you might be able to hear the quiet scratch of the turtle's claws as it walks.
 Try leaving food and water out for your turtle so that it emerges from its hiding spot. Keep that part of the house quiet so that the animal feels safe. Expect a turtle to survive on its own for one to two weeks, indoors â€“ but try to find it as quickly as possible to minimize any danger!


Remember: turtles don't usually drink from small dishes of water. They drink water as they are immersed in it.

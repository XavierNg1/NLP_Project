 On some phones, there will be a physical button that takes you straight to your contacts. That will be indicated by a label on the main menu that says contacts, near the button that opens it. On some, you'll have to scroll through the menu to find the contacts application. Smartphones will have an app for contacts, or it will be an option in the phone menu.
 Once you've opened your contacts, find the name of the person you'd like to send a message to. You should be able to either search (entering the first letters of the person's name) or scroll to find who you'd like to reach.


On a non-smartphone, you'll hit the "Okay" or "Select" button.
On a smartphone, you'll generally just tap the person's name to open the contact details.
 Look for something that says "send message" or, on a smart phone, a message icon (usually a cartoon-like speech bubble icon). Selecting this option should take you to a window where you can compose your message. Type your message and select send.

 He will only ever be your friend: The key here is to be oblivious. When he starts dropping hints about how good you two would be together, just shrug it off with a laugh. If he tells you about how much he likes a 'girl,' but she does not seem to notice, just nod sympathetically and say "that sucks" or "that's too bad, you really deserve better." Then, quickly change the subject.;
, He will start to realise that you value him as a confidante and he will be even more reluctant to wreck things by needlessly confessing his feelings.
 When guys fall in love or 'like' they put the girl on a pedestal. To him, everything about you is perfect. You must destroy this pedestal and quickly. This could mean really embarrassing things like letting him see you without makeup (if you always wear it) or tell an inconvenient truth like "I can't wait to move away after school/college/this job finishes and travel. I'd hate to get tied down!" Pretty much do the opposite of what you would do or say to a guy you have a crush on.
 Just say you're too busy or you might be feeling really sick or you've already made plans. If he's really persistent, you might have to be cruel to be kind. Tell him you're going on a date.
 Regular outings like shopping or team sports is great; that's the sort of thing you do with your regular friends.
 If he is upset or angry or hurt, you are welcome to comfort him. Avoid hugging or anything too emotionally attached.
 Tell him the dreaded "I'm sorry, but I only like you as a friend." Let him lick his wounds then practice steps 2-6 consistently. If he is still persistent, then its time to stop seeing him for a while.

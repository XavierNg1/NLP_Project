, A simple solution is to use your windows' Hosts file, which controls how web page requests are handled. This is not thought of as being a complete solution, and family hackers may get around it. See External Links for a guide on editing your Hosts file.
 Checking web pages against a list of known bad pages can offer a measure of protection for your family. This does not offer you controls, nor can you influence the nature of blocked sites. Take the following steps to set up a proxy.
Open Firefox's Options which you can access under the Tools menu. Ensure the Generalor Advanced tab(depends on the Firefox version) is selected and click on the Connection Settings button (see the screenshot).





Click on Manual proxy configuration, and type the following in the HTTP Proxy field:www-filter.csufresno.edu
In the Port field, type:5050

 Web filtering software can extend your control:

Restrict computer use to certain times or days.
View a list of visited websites.

Some programs to consider are as follows:

K9 Web Protection - a free family tool.

SafeEyes - This is what some schools are installing.

CyberPatrol - Perhaps the most used program at home. This program also can control access to programs installed on the computer.

ContentProtect - Includes a remote control feature.

Integrated Tools - If you are a AOL, MSN or Earthlink subscriber, or you own Norton Internet Security or ZoneAlarm Internet Security, you already have some parental control tools, as they are integrated into the software

 Be sure to discuss things other than schoolwork. Outside of the classroom or study sessions, relate to people about topics that interest everyone involved. If you don’t know how to start a conversation, it is always okay to ask others questions about themselves. For instance, you could ask them what they did over the weekend, or ask their opinion about a movie you haven’t seen yet. , Know-it-alls are often that way because they want to be defined as the smartest person in the room. A club, sport, or hobby will give you something more to focus on than just being the smartest. It will also give you something to talk to people about.
 Know-it-alls are often so fiercely competitive at trying to be the smartest that they can be selfish and even sometimes rude. Smile and make eye contact with people when you pass them in the hallway. Ask them how they are doing, and listen to the answer with your full attention.
 Like admitting mistakes, being able to laugh at yourself requires you to be able to gracefully accept a shortcoming or minor falter. Maybe you just found out you have been mispronouncing a word or song lyric for years—no one will think less of you for this, but they may find it funny. Learn to relax and laugh with them.
 “Obviously” makes it sound like everyone should already know the thing you’re saying, and can make people feel bad. Definitely pay attention to how you talk to people, and be careful with these two words.

 Many people with depression fall into the trap of comparing others’ vacations to theirs. You may look at the vacationers around you and wonder why you’re not enjoying yourself as much as they are. Placing pressure on yourself to enjoy what you think you should can make you feel worse. Instead, realize you probably aren’t seeing the bigger picture.


Vacations aren’t great for everyone all of the time. The family you see enjoying themselves on the beach may have just come back from having a huge fight. Or perhaps the kids just had a major meltdown that was extremely stressful. You’re likely having just as good of a time as they are, you just happen to see them during a good time., Unfortunately, depression doesn’t magically disappear when you go on vacation. In fact, sometimes it may make its presence known even more during this time. Letting go of that expectation and facing reality may make your vacation that much more enjoyable., Not every vacation day will be filled with feelings of happiness. You may have some days when the depression takes over, no matter how gorgeous the scenery is. Be gentle on yourself and realize that these moments are just a part of your life, and you will get through it.


One way to make the bad days a little better is to be open with those around you. Tell them, “I’m not feeling very well today, so I need a little space,” or whatever it is you require. Being honest with what is going on instead of trying to hide how you really feel will make it easier on yourself, and those around you.

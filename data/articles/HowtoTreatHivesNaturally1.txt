 Anyone can get hives. About 20% of the population have experienced them at some point in their lives.During an allergic reaction, certain skin cells, such as the mast cells that contain histamine and other chemical messengers like cytokines, are stimulated to release the histamine and other cytokines. These increase the amount of leakage from the tiny blood vessels in the skin and cause the swelling and itching that is so characteristic of hives., The first step in treating hives is to ensure you are away from the source of the allergic response. If you know what it is, which is how most cases of hives are, remove the substance that is causing the allergic reaction from your skin or environment. Common allergens that are easy to determine are poison ivy, poison oak, insect bites, wool clothing, a cat, or a dog. Avoid these or any other known allergen as much as possible.


In some cases of chronic hives, you may have to do some detective work to determine what your specific hive trigger is. Other common causes are food, medication, chemicals such as acetone, a polymer such as latex, an viral, fungal, or bacterial infection, pet hair or dander, plants, and physical stimuli such as pressure, temperature, and sun exposure., There are some cases where environmental agents can cause hives. If you react to pollen, avoid being outside in the morning and in the evening when pollen levels are at their highest. Keep your windows closed during these times as well and avoid drying clothes outside. Change into “indoor clothes” as soon as possible and wash your “outdoor clothes” right away.


Using a humidifier in the home can be helpful as well.
You may also need to avoid other common air irritants such as insect sprays, tobacco smoke, wood smoke, and fresh tar or paint as much as possible.

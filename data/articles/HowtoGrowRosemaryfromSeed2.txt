 The pot should have at least one drainage hole to prevent the roots of the plant from becoming waterlogged. Clay pots work especially well.
 A light potting mix, preferably one that mixes potting soil with sand or vermiculite, will do best to maintain proper moisture conditions.
 The hole should be approximately the same size as the seedling tray slot that the rosemary currently sits in.
 Gently squeeze the sides of the tray until the plant and soil can be wiggled free.
 Pack the soil around the stem to hold it in place.

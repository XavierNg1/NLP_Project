 Algebraic notation (AN), developed by Philipp Stamma, is the most common used worldwide system of chess notation and replaced the descriptive notation. You should learn both so you know what players refer to. Refer to Read Algebraic Chess Notation to see the other form.;
, The squares are named by the primary piece. From left on the White side the pieces are Queen's Rook (Castle), Queen's Knight, Queen's Bishop, Queen, King, King's Bishop, King's Knight and King's Rook.
 R is for Rook, Kt or N = Knight, B = Bishop, Q = Queen, etc. P, of course, is for pawn, while in algebraic pawns are recognized by the absence of a letter.
 In Black, the King is on the left while in White the King is on the right.
 If you have white, and you want to move the pawn in front of the King's Bishop ahead one space you would write "King's Bishop Pawn to King's Bishop Three." In the graphic King's Bishop would be in c1 and it would move to the space labeled c3. It's so much easier to say "Bishop to C3."

, Similarly, if a knight captured a bishop, it would be KtxB or NxB.
 It's simply called "Castling Queenside" or "Castling Kingside."

 Breaks in the surface of a glass, china or ceramic dish will allow food and drink to enter, leading to deeper, more difficult-to-clean stains.
 Sudden changes in heat can cause tiny fractures in the surface of ceramic dishes or china. You should avoid causing this by warming the dishes (for instance, by placing them near or on a warm oven) before serving hot food on them., This will prevent any food or drink remaining on the surface of the dish from setting in. Coffee and tea cups are especially important to clean immediately, since stains from these beverages tend to set in more quickly, and be much harder to remove. If you intend to store leftovers for a while, put the food into a container or dish you don't mind staining before putting it in the fridge. , Washing and rinsing dishes in water that is too cold makes it more difficult to remove grease, or food particles from a dish during washing, potentially leading to staining. , Using too much detergent in your automatic dishwasher can result in water marks.

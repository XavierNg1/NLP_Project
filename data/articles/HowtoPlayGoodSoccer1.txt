 This may seem like a waste of time, but it will help if you know what to do during a game. The general rules for soccer are:


You are not able to use your hands unless you're a goalkeeper.
The game must start with a kickoff from the centre line.
The ball is out of play once it has fully crossed the sidelines.
A goal only counts if the ball goes over the goal line and without an offside play.
If your team kicks the ball out of the sidelines, the other team throws it in (and vice versa).
If your team kicks the ball out of play on the line behind the goal, the other team gets a corner kick. If the other team kicks it out, your team gets a goal kick.
When doing a throw-in, both feet must remain on the ground and your hands must go behind your head.
Offsides aren't allowed.;

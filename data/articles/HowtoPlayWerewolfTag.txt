 3 or more is needed.;
, Take three slips and label one "Werewolf", the other "Hunter" and the last "Healer." Label the remaining slips "Villager."

, Do not let anyone see your slip! Read it and put back in. The Werewolf is the person who counts and then tags others to make them werewolves. The hunter can tag a werewolf and kill it. However, the hunter can also be tagged. The Healer can tag a werewolf and make them a normal villager, however can only do this once. The Villager is simply a target, and does not have any special abilities.
 The villagers (including the Hunter and Healer) hide. The Werewolf tries to tag everyone before the Hunter kills them, and the Hunter and Healer try to stop the werewolves. If the Hunter kills the werewolves, the villagers win. If the werewolf infects everyone, the werewolves win. Once the game is over go and draw again.
 The vampire does not reveal their slip like the werewolf, but hides. The vampire tries too tag everyone and make them vampires. Vampires can't tag werewolves and werewolves can't tag vampires. Hunters cannot kill vampires but Healers can heal them.
 Then the game proceeds normally. Hint: Hide alone in this version to avoid being a werewolf.

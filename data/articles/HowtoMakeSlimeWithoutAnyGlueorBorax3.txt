 Mix one box of cornstarch with 1 to 2 cups (0.24 to 0.47 L) of water. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until you achieve the consistency of honey. Using different amounts of water will change the consistency as needed.If you want to color the oobleck, add food coloring to the water before mixing it with the cornstarch.
 Once you have a good consistency, pour the oobleck from the bowl onto a flat surface. Observe how the oobleck behaves compared to other liquids. As you pour, it becomes a slimy and sticks to itself., Oobleck slime changes depending on the forces present. Try picking up the slime and hitting it. You’ll notice that applying force to the slime makes it harden.

 The condition of the patient’s skin should be steadily monitored. In particular, blisters and pressure sores may develop. Check the patient’s legs, heels, and bottom for sores or discomfort from maintaining a constant position. Place a rolled up towel or pillow beneath the patient’s heel to relieve undesired pressure. Further, encourage the patient to slightly adjust their position once per hour.If using adhesive, watch out for a rash or other allergic reaction, as the pressure induced by traction may cause a reaction in patients who do not know they are mildly allergic.
Remove and reset the weight, including the stirrup, once every few hours to check skin condition.
Change wet sheets immediately.
 Neurovascular issues and/or compartment syndrome may develop from overly tight wraps. Watch out for signs that blood circulation has slowed, such as discoloration or numbness. Remove the wrap and reapply if any neurovascular signs change during application of skin treatment. Contact the orthopedic team if circulation doesn’t quickly return., Though they are mostly immobile, try to keep the patient active. Have them sit up when able and read, do crafts, play games, or watch TV. This will improve comfort as well as hygiene. Further, constipation may also occur from immobility.If the patient reports constant pain, ensure medication schedules have been kept, and contact a doctor if you feel those schedules may need to be revised.

 Try to stay as active and as socially engaged as you can.

 As social creatures, finding others who truly understand what you are dealing with can be a significant comfort. Support groups also help you not to feel so alone. The people in the group may be able to offer advice and coping techniques.To find a support group for people dealing with chronic pain, start by looking at the groups at the American Chronic Pain Association or the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association.

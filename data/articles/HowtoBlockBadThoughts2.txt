 However, that doesnâ€™t mean you necessarily have time to do that in any given moment. Create a "worry period," a set time each day when you are allowed to worry. Consider the rest of your day a worry-free zone.Set your worry period for the same time each day and early enough that it won't make you anxious right before bed.If a bad thought comes into your mind, notice it and tell yourself you will worry about it later. You can even keep a notebook to jot it down or simply say to yourself: "I want to remain calm. I will come back to this later." It may or may not come up again.If the thought returns, make a tick next to it in your notebook. Say to yourself, "Yes, I will get to you, just not right now."
Go over your list during your designated worry period. If the bad thoughts or worries still bother you, then go ahead and worry about them, but only for the set worry period. If they no longer bother you, cross them off and move on.Postponing your worries will break the habit of dwelling on bad thoughts and disrupting your day, but at the same time you're not battling to suppress or block the thought.If the thought continues to arise repetitively, you may need to discuss it with a mental health professional.
 For instance, when the unhelpful thought occurs, make a mental note that it did occur. It might be something you say out of habit to yourself, or it might be something in your environment, something someone said or did, that triggered a bad memory.


When people remember the bad memory AND engage in it, they relive the memory, emotions and all, unless they are are aware that they are being triggered.
Once you become aware, you can work on postponing the bad thought, as described above. You can acknowledge that yes, bad things have happened in your life, and you understand why you were reminded of this memory in this instance, but you practice (or at least consider) putting it aside for the moment instead of reliving the memory all over again.

 Currently, you can get the Belkin double lightning adapter for 40 USD or the Apple Charging Dock for 50 USD.


The Belkin lightning adapter will require headphones with a lightning cable. If they use a normal 3.5mm audio connection you will need an additional adapter.;
, With the Belkin adapter this means connecting the adapter’s male end into the phone’s port. With a dock, the phone seats upright onto the top lightning connection.
 On the Belkin adapter, connect your headphones to the first lightning port. The Apple dock has a standard 3.5mm audio port for headphones.


If you have headphones that use a 3.5mm connector instead of a lightning connector with the Belkin adapter, then you will need an additional lightning to 3.5mm adapter.
 Connect a lightning cable into the lightning port (second one for Belkin) and connect the USB end to a charging source (computer, wall charger, extra battery, etc.).


Your iPhone will chime and display a lightning symbol on the battery icon when it is successfully charging.
 You can now launch the Music app on your phone and listen to music while the phone charges.

 Home school may be an option because your grades are down, you're being bullied, social issues (making friends), or the kids and/or teachers are making you feel unsafe. Remember this for when you explain why you would want to do this with your parents.;
, Look into all the different homeschool options. Find out how much it costs, if you would have a facilitator in your city, and so on.
 People transferring out of the system aren't used to having to take the initiative in finding friends, so save yourself the trouble while you can.


Ask them to try to persuade your parents.



Get books by authors such as Grace Llewellyn, John Gatto and John Holt, and ask your parents to read them.
 Leave out the better things. Such as "Mom, I can not stand to be in school anymore, so many kids there are into drugs, and I don't want to be in that situation." Follow that with what will be fixed when you're homeschooled. Also tell them that you can do online school, where you have actual teachers. Your grades will go up as a result of a better environment, and you'll be getting more sleep so you'll be more fun to be around.


Put it in writing. Write them a letter and make a copy or two. Or if you want to be fancy, make a Powerpoint and present it to them.
 If you're having loads of trouble in school and can clean up your act enough to be a respectable student, do it, but don't overdo it or your parents might not take you that seriously.
, They may think it is unfair that you are doing home school if they stay at normal school. They may try to convince you that this is not a good idea. Just 'stick to your guns', so to speak.



Be ready for a bumpy start; virtually nobody finishes homeschooling the same way they started.
If nothing else works, and you're old enough to make the decision (teenager), and you still want to homeschool then consider refusing to attend school and issue your parents with an ultimatum.

 Visit drive.google.com and log in with your Google account. You'll be taken to your Drive files.;
, You'll find this in the upper-left corner.
 This will allow you to upload a single file to drive or an entire folder.
 You can upload virtually any file to Google Drive, up to 5 TB in size.The amount you can upload depends on how much space is available in your Google Drive account. All accounts come with 15 GB of free storage.
 You'll see a progress bar in the lower-right corner that will let you know how far along the upload process is. The time the upload takes will vary depending on the size and number of files you're uploading, as well as the speed of your connection.


Uploads are almost always significantly slower than downloads.
 Once your files are uploaded, they'll appear in "My Drive." Files will be floating in this folder, and any folders that were uploaded will preserve their structure. You can drag and drop files in My Drive just as if they were on your computer.

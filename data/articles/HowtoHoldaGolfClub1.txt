 If you’re right-handed, this is your right hand, and vice-versa if you’re left-handed. Grab the shaft where it connects to the grip and lift the club up at a 45-degree angle.








This isn’t where you will ultimately hold the club with your dominant hand, but it allows you to properly grip the club with your off hand first.;
, This is your left hand if you’re right-handed, and vice-versa if you’re left-handed. Keeping your off hand relaxed and with the palm facing you, lay the grip of the club across the inside of your fingers in the area where your first knuckles and palm meet.









The butt of the club should be extending just past the base joint of your pinkie.
 Curl the bottom three fingers of your non-dominant hand around the grip. Set your thumb flat across the club. You want to roll your thumb over towards the opposite side of the grip, while curling your forefinger around the grip. You should be able to see the knuckles of your index and middle fingers.








If you have secured your grip properly, you should feel every part on the underside of your bottom three fingers making contact with the club’s grip.
You’ll know you have a proper grip when you can feel the base, fatty part of your thumb on the handle, and not overlayed on your forefinger.
 Imagine a clock with the club head pointing at twelve. Curl your fingers over the grip like you did with your other hand. Wrap your pinky finger into the space between the forefinger and middle finger of your non-dominant hand. Point your right thumb toward eleven on your imagined clock, and lay it flat on the grip of the club.








You can also interlock your pinky finger with your forefinger and middle finger if that feels more comfortable or natural to you.

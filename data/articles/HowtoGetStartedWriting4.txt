 If you are struggling to get started on an essay or paper, use a cluster map. Write down the main topic or theme of your paper. Then, cluster ideas and thoughts around the topic or theme. Circle each idea and draw a line from the idea to the main topic. Put down as many ideas as you can think of around the topic or theme. Then, read it over and pick ideas that you find inspiring to start your paper.For example, if you are writing about the theme of loss in a novel, you may write down character names and scenes in the novel that illustrate this theme, clustering them around “loss.”

, You can also brainstorm by making a list of possible ideas for your writing. Include bad ideas as well as good ideas. A big part of brainstorming is letting ideas flow without judgement. Once you have made the list, you can read it over and see if any ideas stand out to you or inspire you.For example, if you are writing a position paper for a class, you may make a list of possible positions on an issue you can take for your paper.
 Sometimes, brainstorming with others can be more effective than doing it on your own. Talk to others around you about your writing ideas and see what they have to say. Tell them what you are thinking about writing and ask them for feedback or guidance. Often, chatting with others about your ideas can force you to verbalize them and think them through out loud.For example, you may speak to a peer about your ideas for an essay for class. Or you may talk to a writing professor about your thoughts for a short story.

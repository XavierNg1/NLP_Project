 Open your web browser and navigate to the PayPal login page.


You can also request a password reset from the PayPal mobile app. You cannot change your password in the mobile app, however.
 A popup appears prompting you for the email associated with your account.


On PayPal's mobile app, click "Forgot" and you will be directed away from the app and over to the PayPal mobile site. From here the remaining procedures are almost identical.
 Click "Continue". Any email attached to your account will work here (either your primary or secondary email will do).


If you cannot remember the email you used to create the account, click “Recover it?” in the email field. This will redirect you to another page that will prompt you for up to 3 email addresses you think may be associated with your account that PayPal can check. If PayPal fails to find an associated email, contact PayPal support by phone at 1(402)935-2050.
 You can get a verification code sent as a text message, email or automated phone call. Select your method from the menu, and click "Continue" This will send you a security code via the method you selected.
 On the next page, enter the security code you received and press “Continue”. Your code will expire within 5 minutes. If your code expires, you'll need to request a new one.
 Create a new password (must be at least 8 characters and a mix of letters and numbers or special characters). Enter the password a second time to ensure there are no mistakes.
 Press “Update” to complete the password reset. Navigate to the PayPal login screen and enter your email and new password to confirm the changes are successful.

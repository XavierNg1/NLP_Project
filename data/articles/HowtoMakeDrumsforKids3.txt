 This drum is made from a cardboard carpet tube with a plastic flower pot stacked on top. You can get a cardboard carpet tube free from any carpet store.


The carpet tube should be three to four inches in diameter.
The bottom of the flower pot should be four inches in diameter.
 You need thick, pliable plastic material to make the head of this drum. A beach ball works perfect, but any thick and flexible plastic material will work.


A balloon is too thin.
 Use scissors or a small hand saw to cut the carpet tube to be 12 inches long. Make sure you cut the tube straight and not at an angle so it will attach flat to the flower pot.
 Start by using scissors to cut the plastic blow tube off of the beach ball, and then cut the ball open so it can lay out flat. Cut a square out of the beach ball that is as wide as the beach ball is. This will give you enough to cover the top of the flower pot and have extra around the sides.
 Get an embroidery hoop the size of the top of the flower pot. Take apart the embroidery hoop and stretch the beach ball square onto the bottom of the embroidery hoop, stretching as you go. Put the top of the embroidery hoop back on the bottom, and make sure the beach ball is very tight in the hoop.This is the drum head

, Put the drum head on the top of the flower pot and secure it using packing tape. Use enough tape to securely fasten the drum head to the flower pot.
 Set the flower pot onto the top of the cardboard tube. Use packing tape to secure the flower pot onto the cardboard tube.
 Use decorative material to embellish your new African drum. You can use yarn or twine to wrap around the packing tape to hide it. Attach feathers and beads for a unique, traditional look.

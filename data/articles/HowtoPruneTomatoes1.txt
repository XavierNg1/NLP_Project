 Before you make any cuts, figure out whether you're growing an indeterminate or determinate variety of tomato plant. Indeterminate varieties grow like vines, and they must be trained upright on poles and pruned in order to grow correctly. Determinate varieties contain themselves before they grow into a bush, and they naturally direct their energy toward fruiting without needing as much intervention. Here are the common varieties of each:



Indeterminate: Big Boy, Beef Master, Black Prince, German Queen, most cherry tomato varieties and most heirloom varieties.

Determinate:Ace 55, Amelia, Better Bush, Biltmore, Heatmaster, Heinz Classic, Mountain Pride and Patio.;
, One way to know when it is time to start pruning is to wait for the stems and leaves below the first set of flowers to turn yellow. When you notice this color change, you can start pruning.
 Look for the tiny new branches sprouting in the spot where a branch meets the stem on an indeterminate plant. These are called "suckers" and they're what you want to remove. Suckers left to grow will take energy from the rest of the plant and cause the plant to bear fewer fruits. This isn't always a bad thing, but strategically removing suckers will help your plant bear large fruit all season long.
 It is a good idea to start pruning your tomato plants early, as soon as there are flowers on the plants. At this point, the plants should be between 12 and 18 inches.

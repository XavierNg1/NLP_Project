 The frequency, in part, is affected by whether you are feeding your baby breastmilk or formula. Babies who are breastfed during the first three months of their lives will generally pass stool right after being fed. This means that a breastfed baby could pass stool 8 to 10 times a day.A baby who is fed formula will generally pass 1 to 8 stools a day for the first week of her life. After the first week, a formula-fed baby will pass between 1 and 4 stools a day.
Over time, you will see a pattern in your child’s habits of passing stool. Knowing this pattern will help you to recognize when the stool is more frequent than normal. When your child passes more stool than normal in a day, it is considered diarrhea.;
, Children who are breastfed generally have loose, yellow, or yellow-green stool.Keep in mind that green stool is just an indication that your child is drinking breast milk.Children who are fed formula generally have paler stools that may look a bit like peanut butter.
If you notice that your child’s stools are a different color than normal, then it may be an indication that your child has diarrhea.
 While stool is generally pretty stinky, take note if your child’s stool smells much more intensely than normal. Very intense smelling stool can be an indication of diarrhea., Diarrhea is more watery than normal stool, is comprised of more water than solid parts, and can cause a big mess.


Other signs that often accompany diarrhea include fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain.

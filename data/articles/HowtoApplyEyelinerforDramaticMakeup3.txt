 This will create an intense, darker look. Bottom eyeliner can smudge, giving the appearance of dark circles, so it should be applied very carefully. Apply it from the outer corner inwards, stopping three-fourths of the way in. Blend it out gently, so that the line doesn’t appear harsh. You want your eyes to look beautiful and dramatic, not exhausted!








After you’ve finished applying your bottom eyeliner, dip a cotton swab in makeup remover and clean up the skin underneath.
 White eyeliner is great for making your eyes appear bigger and brighter. There are several different ways you can apply it. Applying it to the bottom waterline will make your eyes appear bigger, and you can still use a regular eyeliner underneath. Dot a bit of white eyeliner into the inner corners of your eyes and blend it out gently with your finger tips to add some brightness and glimmer to your look.








If you’re feeling really brave, completely line your eyes in white eyeliner solo. It’s certainly not an everyday look, so it’s perfect if you want the drama!
Don’t feel obligated to stick with white. Try out pastel, bright, and even metallic colors for ultra-dramatic looks.
 The possibilities are truly endless. You can do an upside down cat eye, where you fully line the bottom lash line, rather than the top, and extend it upwards. You can double wing your eyes, adding an additional, smaller wing below the traditional wing. You can try applying your eyeliner extremely thick, in a bold stripe across your lash line. For a super intense look, try tracing your eyeliner along your crease line as well as your lash line!Truly, there are no rules when it comes to applying eyeliner. If you want a bold, dramatic look, don’t be afraid to get creative and take some beauty risks.

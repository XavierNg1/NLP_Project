 You have friends, right? If you do, hang with them. Friends often lead to happiness. If you don't have friends, make some. Don't be afraid of meeting people. Some are nicer than they appear, trust me. Don't judge someone for their style. I have actually met some pretty nice "preps". While we're on the subject of 'Don't judge people by their appearance', not everyone you meet is going to be attractive to you. And that is okay, that's how this screwed up world works. You have an opinion, hooray for you! Just because someone wears skirts doesn't make them a slut, just like if someone wear black lipstick- it doesn't make them hate everything. That's personality, not appearance.
 Is it playing video games? Listening to music? Hanging with friends (refer to step one)? Just find something that you enjoy doing.
 If you don't like being alone, spend less time alone. Keep in mind that you don't need a significant other to survive. Maybe in the old days, but is this the old days? No. Your family is always there (unless you have horrible family members, than there's friends and counselors and therapists).
 As much as you'd love to believe it, drugs and alcohol and hurting yourself don't help. So please, before you make regrettable choices- keep it in mind; It only makes matters worse.

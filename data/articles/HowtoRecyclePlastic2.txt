 Many cities and towns now have recycling drop-off points or even curbside municipal recycling collection. However every community is different, so call your local government and ask what facilities and options are available in your area.
 In some communities you can set your recycling out just like your trashâ€”all you need to do is sign up for the program and get your recycling bin.


Sometimes, like garbage collection, this will require a one-time or annual fee, but it makes recycling so easy the expense is usually worth it.
If you live in an apartment, you may have building recycling bins already. Ask your super.
 In areas that don't have curbside pickup, there are often large recycling dumpsters around town, usually at public places like schools, churches or municipal buildings.
 Search online or call your local officials to find the centers in your area. If a center accepts plastics, you can pretty much always bring your recycling directly to them.


Some recycling facilities will pay a couple cents per item that you drop off. You can make a few extra bucks by collecting recycling from your friends and neighbors and bringing it in.
 Some recycling centers will do the sorting and cleaning for you, so you can just dump cans, plastics and papers all together. With others you will need to separate different materials and potentially remove paper labels. Follow the rules as best you can.

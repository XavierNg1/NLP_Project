 Consider what your characterÂ´s primary problem is going to be in the story. Use the first few pages to introduce the character to your audience and then introduce the problem he or she has to overcome during the story.;
, Show them when you introduce your main character.
 Then, after a few subtle foreshadowing clues, have the character show his or her true colors. This works especially well with villains. Likewise, another good way is having other characters tell second or even third hand information about your character before you even show him. Then reveal him to be different from how others see him.
 Is she a silent, calm, serene girl, who likes to listen to dramatic music? Is he a gentle, friendly guy, who likes to play a villain? Adding in these genuine human elements will help bring them to life and will encourage readers to identify with them more.
 This will show the reader how well the character copes under pressure.

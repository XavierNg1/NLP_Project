 If you donâ€™t qualify for a mortgage loan on your own, you could find another person who qualifies for the loan and who is willing to co-sign it. Taking this step might convince the lender to allow you to take on the mortgage loan without your current co-borrower. Your co-signer should have a strong credit history and sufficient income to qualify for the loan., If the lender agrees to it, this method will get the current co-borrower off the hook and allow you to take out another joint mortgage loan, except with a different person. It is important to remember, however, that circumstances may always change in the future. If you later want to remove the new co-signer from the joint mortgage loan, you will end up in the same situation that you are now. Likewise, if you fail to make the mortgage payments as agreed, your co-signer will be held responsible for the payments.
 If your lender is agreeable, you can enter into a new mortgage contract along with your co-signer. This will absolve your current co- borrower from responsibility for the new mortgage loan, but will make your co-signer equally responsible for the loan.
 You and your former co-borrower will need to sign a new deed that transfers interest in the property to you and your new co-signer. The deed may need to be recorded at various government offices, depending on the laws of your state.

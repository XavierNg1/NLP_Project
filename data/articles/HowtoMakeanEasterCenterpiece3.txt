 This can be a cute and simple addition to the table if you have a nice egg carton or basket.


For the basket, simply arrange the eggs neatly. They can be plain or dyed, as preferred. Place in the center of the table.
Fill each hole of the egg carton with dyed Easter eggs. You can sit them on Easter grass in each hole if wished. Place the open egg carton onto a display plate or tray and add a few fluffy chicks around the tray. Place in the center of the table.

 By starting the song in a lower key, you will be better able to reach the higher notes.Learn the song first, including the words and melody. Then sing the same melody but beginning at a note toward your lower vocal range. It may take some practice to remain in the new key.
 Singing high notes from your throat will only strain to your vocal cords. Use your stomach to push air through your throat as you sing the high notes. This will give them more power without straining you.
 As you inhale, your stomach should rise first followed by your chest. This is called "support" of the voice.
 As notes get higher, the sound waves they create get shorter and closer together, requiring less power to generate them. Focus the most vocal power on the low notes and decrease it as you sing higher.

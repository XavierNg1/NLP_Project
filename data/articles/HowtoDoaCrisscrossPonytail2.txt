 A multi strand crisscross ponytail takes a little more work than a single strand ponytail, but its intricate and sophisticated look is well worth the effort. Begin making this hairstyle by pulling back the hair behind your ears in a low ponytail, while keeping the two sections of hair that frame your face loose.If you have smooth, straight hair, mist the two loose sections with hairspray to give them more hold and texture.
 After you make the ponytail, take the left section of loose hair and separate it into a bottom layer and a top layer. Take the top layer of the left section of hair and cross it over to the right side of your head, holding it about 1 Â½ inches (3.81 cm) above the ponytail. Pin the hair with a bobby pin where you are holding it to secure it.
 Do the same thing as you did on the left side with the right, separating the right section of hair into two layers, and pinning the top layer directly underneath the already-pinned section of hair.
 Take the remaining hair of the loose left section and pin it directly below the pinned hair of the right section that you just secured.
 Finish crisscrossing the hair by pinning the rest of the right section of hair over hair elastic to hide it from view.








Once you have finished pinning the hair, the pinned strands should almost look woven together in a very elegant way.
 Once you have finished crisscrossing and pinning your hair, take the ends of the sections, which should be hanging free. If you have long hair, wrap the strands around the hair elastic, then pin them at the back of your head near the base of your ponytail. If you the strands are short, pin the hair to the back of your head without wrapping them around the hair elastic.








Mist your completed hairdo with hairspray to give it better hold.

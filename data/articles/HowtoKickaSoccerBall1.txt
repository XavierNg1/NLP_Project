 Locking your ankle ensures that your foot isn't flimsy and doesn't move at all when it contacts the ball. The foot needs to control how the ball moves. For an inside of the foot pass, the toes should point up to lock the ankle. For a shot, on the other hand, the toes should point down to lock the ankle.








The only way to achieve no spin is to lock your ankle. If the foot is flimsy, the ball will make equally flimsy movements and motions.;
, Never pass on your toe. Soccer players pass using the inside of the foot because it uses a wider surface area and makes for the most accurate kick.









The downside to this kick is that you don't get as much power out of it. Still, it is definitely the most accurate way to pass.
 Turn your planter foot (the foot you are not using to kick) so that the inside of your shoe is facing the ball. Remember, your planter foot will point to where the ball ends up. If you want to kick the ball straight ahead, plant that foot facing straight ahead.
 Follow through with your foot close to the ground. For short passes and passes on the ground, you only need to follow through a few feet. Don't lift your foot far off the ground.








Notice the spin on the ball. An inside of the foot pass should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, you need to lock your ankle, or you might have moved your passing leg in the right trajectory.
 Lean your body back and follow through with your foot in the air. This time, extend your foot fully, and follow through so that your foot ends up several feet in the air. Make sure that if you're passing in the air, you keep your foot closer the the ground than you would for a ground pass so that the ball will go into the air.








Again, notice the spin on the ball. Just like a pass on the ground, a pass in the air should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, make sure you're locking your ankle and watching your passing leg.

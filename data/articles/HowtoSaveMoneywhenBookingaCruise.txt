 The longer you can book your cruise trip in advance, the better. You will save considerable amounts by doing so, up to 30 to 40 percent. If possible, try to book a year ahead for the best savings.;
, You are more likely to make savings as a group booking or a large family booking than as an individual, pair or small family. Consider linking up with friends or neighbors, or go for an event such as a wedding, anniversary or graduation.


Events such as weddings, etc., tend to have good promotional prices for the package deal.
 This will provide a good discount, as less people will be traveling. However, be well aware of the climatic conditions at the destination ports and be properly dressed before disembarking.
 Higher deck cabins are usually the most expensive ones. Moreover, sea views are usually obtained at a surcharge, along with balconies and access to outside decks from the cabin. You'll save a lot more by remaining on the medium to low areas of the ship decks and by not getting a sea view. You can go up and see the sea any time you like.
 You may find it cheaper than using search engines or other travel sites.

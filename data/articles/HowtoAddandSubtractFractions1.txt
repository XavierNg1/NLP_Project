 If the denominator of the two fractions that you are adding or subtracting is the same, put the same number once as the denominator for your answer.


In other words, 1/5 and 2/5 does not need to be written as 1/5 + 2/5 = ? It can be written as 1+2/5 = ?. The denominator is the same, so it can be written only once. Both numerators then go on top.;
, The "numerator" is the top number of any fraction. If we take the above example, 1/5 and 2/5, 1 and 2 are our numerators.


Whether you have it written 1/5 + 2/5 or 1+2/5, you answer should be the same: 3! After all, 1 + 2 = 3.
 Since you're working with one constant denominator, don't do anything with it! Don't add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Just leave it be.


So, using the same example, our denominator is 5. That's it! That's the bottom number of our fraction. That's half the answer already!

, Now, all you do is write out your numerator and your denominator! If you've followed the above example, you'll find that the answer to this problem is 3/5.


What was your numerator? 3. The denominator? 5. Therefore, 1/5 + 2/5, or 1+2/5, equals 3/5.

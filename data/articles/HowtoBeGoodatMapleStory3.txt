 Each class is different in the advancement, so do some research to find out how to go about it.
 You can choose 2 professions and the professions are Mining, Herbalism, Alchemy, Accessory Crafting, and Smithing.


Mining and Herbalism are gathering skills. Mining is required for Accessory Crafting and Smithing, while Herbalism is required for Alchemy.
Smithing allows you to make weapons, armor, projectiles, and androids. This is a good skill if you're low on funds for weapons and armor.
Accessory crafting gives you the ability to make earrings, belts, pendants, and rings. If you're lucky enough, you may get a finished product with Hidden Potential.
Alchemy lets you make potions, fuse items, and extract items for item crystals. If you're mainly away from the keyboard, set up an extractor and let people pay you to use it. If you set up a 1 meso extractor, you may get free fame.
 The Mushroom Kingdom Theme Dungeon is a great place to train. You also get a glove with 1 weapon attack and 2 magic attack after doing the storyline! Kerning Square is another place to train, you also get a nice medal. At level 55, head over to Chryse. You can get level 70 weapons after defeating the boss.
 The monsters have more HP, but you get more EXP and Hidden Potential items.

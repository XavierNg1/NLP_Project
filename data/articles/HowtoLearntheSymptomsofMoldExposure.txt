 Molds are fungi that flourish in damp and warm environments, both inside and outside. Mold is most likely to be found in your basement, kitchen or bathroom, and the best way to control and to prevent mold from growing is to control the moisture in your home. Mold can, however, grow on anything with a high cellulose content, such as paper and wood, and it can grow outside on organic materials, such as compost.;
, There are many symptoms of mold exposure, so if you do have moisture problems in your home, you should consider mold as a primary culprit. The most common symptoms of mold exposure are similar to allergy symptoms:


Watery eyes
Sneezing
Skin disorders (such as itching, redness and open sores that donâ€™t heal)
Headaches

, Prolonged exposure to mold is dangerous, and symptoms will become increasingly serious the longer you are exposed. If you or anyone in your household experiences the following symptoms, mold could be the cause:


Nose bleeds
Difficulty breathing
Nausea
Constant headaches
Unexplained fatigue
Lack of appetite and unexplained weight loss
Vomiting and diarrhea
Swollen glands (neck and armpit)

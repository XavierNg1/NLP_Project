 The gaming receiver uses a USB 2.0 connection. If it doesn't fit into the front USB slot in your desktop computer, try the back slot.
 If you have the installation disk that came with your Xbox controller, you can insert that disk into your computer and begin installation that way. If you do not have the installation disk that came with the controller, you can download the driver here


For either the installation disk or the digital download, follow the same steps as provided in Steps 1 and 2 of Method One.
 To do this, you may:


Hold down the Guide button on your Xbox controller, as well as
Turn on the receiver by pressing the connect button, as well as
Press down on the connect button on the back of the wireless controller.
 When the light stops flashing and turns a steady green, the controller is connected.

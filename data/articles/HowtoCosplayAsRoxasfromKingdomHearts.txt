 Find good pictures, preferably game art. Get as many good ones as you can.;
, The outfit is made up of lots of things you could find in just about any clothing store, so don't worry too much about finding the parts.
 They are composed of two parts. The first part is a regular pair of black pants. The second are actually beige cutoff pant legs that appear to be fastened to the black pants by several silver buttons. Think of a variation on those cowboy pants you see sometimes. Once you have the beige cutoff pants attached, you're ready to move on.
 Roxas wears things in twos. The first part of his jacket/shirt combo is a black zipper-up sweatshirt. The zipper piece is a complex shape that resembles four arrows or even a shuriken. Look for a sweatshirt with a gray ribbed cuff at the bottom by the waist. The second part is a white short sleeved sweatshirt with a zipper, and various black patterns on it. The sleeves have a black cuff. Near the chest are blocky patterns that match front-to-back. A little bit of the collar sticks out, kind of like if you were to pop the collar and have the two parts stick out.
 If you can find a black athletic wristband and sew in the white squares with white lining.
 He has two cloth "rings" on his left two fingers, the index and middle finger. These can easily be made out of some cloth.
 Possibly a size 15 or more. They resemble grey oversized running shoes with several red straps on the top. Look for ones with a big sole.
 Roxas has unusual hair. While not quite as spiky as Cloud's or Sora's, Roxas' hair is pretty wild. Most of it is spiked, but the spikes curve upward, some point straight up. Use lots of styling glue/gel for this. Don't worry if your hair isn't the same color. Dye it if you like. Again, refer to the pictures.
 Roxas seems to prefer Oathkeeper and Oblivion, but it's up to you if you'd like to include one with your cosplay outfit.

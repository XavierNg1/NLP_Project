 Decide what kind of fruit syrup you'd like to make. Wash your fresh fruit and trim off any stems, peels, or ends. Roughly chop the fruit and place it in a large pot. Keep track of how many cups of fruit you use. To make a fruit syrup, you'll use four parts fruit, two parts sugar, and one part water.For example, if you want to make a blueberry syrup, you could use 4 cups of blueberries, 2 cups of sugar, and 1 cup of water. Or if you're using the metric system, try 400 g of blueberries, 200 g of sugar, and 100 ml of water.
Consider making syrup using strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, rhubarb, or oranges.;
, Add two parts of sugar for every four parts of fruit you prepared. Stir in one part of water and turn the heat on to medium. Let the fruit mixture bubble gently. Simmer the mixture and stir it occasionally until the fruit is completely softened and has released extra liquid. This may take anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the type of fruit you're using.The liquid in the pot should thicken and become syrupy.
 Place a fine mesh strainer over a measuring jug or bowl. Slowly pour the cooked fruit mixture into the strainer. The syrup should drain through the strainer. Discard the solids that are left in the strainer., If you'd like to add fresh herbs or spices to your syrups, you can stir them in now. Consider adding a few pinches of ground cinnamon or nutmeg. If you want to add herbs, consider adding:Thyme
Basil
Bay leaves

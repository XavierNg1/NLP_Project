 Find the center of the cord by folding it over on itself. The middle point is where you'll want to start wrapping the handle. Place your knife on top of the cord so that the cord is close to the blade., Wrap the loose ends of the cord around your index finger and thumb. This will make twisting the cord easier. While still holding the cord in one hand, rotate your wrist so that the cord also wraps over itself. The cord should overlap itself to make an X., Continue to twist in the same direction so that your cord gets twisted again. It should look like a knot near the top of your knife handle at this point., Use your finger to keep the fake knot that you created in place while you turn the knife over. You'll have to repeat the process on the other side of the knife., Repeat the twisting steps so that there is an identical makeshift knot on the opposite side of the one that you just created. This is what your wrap will look like all the way down the handle., Continue down the length of the knife handle, twisting the cord over itself so that there are small makeshift knots running down both sides of the knife handle. Make sure that as you do this the rope or cord is as tight as possible. Continue to do this so that the cord is wrapped closely to itself as you make your way down the handle., Once you're done wrapping the cord all the way down the handle, you can feed the cord through any pre-drilled holes at the bottom of the knife before tying your knot. If there are no holes, simply tie a knot at the end of your excess cord. This will keep your handle wrap in place.

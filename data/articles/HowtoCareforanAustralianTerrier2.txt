 Aussies were bred to be hunters, so they’re liable to chase after any small animal that crosses their path. This mad pursuit can be especially dangerous if you live near a road. To prevent them from getting lost or running into traffic, be sure that they’re always in a confined area.Any outdoor areas where you let them loose should have a fenced border with no gaps or holes. Be sure to constantly check your fenced yard for holes that your dog may have dug since Australian Terriers have a real penchant for digging.
 Australian Terriers are loyal house dogs who love being around their people. Do not house them outdoors or keep them outside unattended for long periods of time.Aussies are especially social and devoted to their owners. Don’t get one unless you plan on being around more often than not.
 Aussies like to have their own den, so it’s recommended that you have a crate where they can rest and sleep. Make sure that it’s one designed for small breeds and just big enough for them to stand up, lie down, and turn around in. Put soft, clean bedding in the bottom to make it a comfortable home for you pooch.Since Australian Terriers like digging and chewing, crates can also provide a great place to keep canines under wraps when you need to go out. Be sure to leave them with toys, water, and treats, and never keep them in there for more than a few hours at a time.

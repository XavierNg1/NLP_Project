 A flatter bowl/dish works best as it is then easier to crush the butter.
 At first it will seem like there is way too much power for the amount of butter but as you carry on, the texture will change to become perfect.


Don't be tempted to add more butter or any sort of liquid (such as milk or water) as if you do so, by the end, the overall consistency will be wrong. Alternatively, you can use an electric whisk.

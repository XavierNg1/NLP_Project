 There are all sorts of supermarket loyalty programs. Many provide in-store, member's only pricing or reward you for your purchases in the form of coupons or reduced fuel costs. The best ones for you depend on your particular purchasing behavior, so first determine the types of things you purchase most often.


For instance, if you drive frequently, consider joining a supermarket loyalty program that offers cheaper gas prices if you do your grocery shopping at their stores.
Similarly, do you buy a lot of a few particular products? If you buy a lot of dog food or diapers, consider joining a loyalty program at a store that offers lower prices on these items for members.;
, Many supermarkets simply offer the lowest possible prices without the marketing strategy of a loyalty program. In fact, much of the standard pricing of items at stores with loyalty programs is higher than it is at stores without loyalty program.

Often, even the “members only” pricing is comparable to the prices at other stores, and your overall grocery bill is likely not going to differ too much.
 You can always shop at supermarkets that do offer loyalty programs without joining the program. Further, many programs offer opportunities to join, but also opt out of things like "partnership services" or "special offers.”Before turning in your application to a loyalty program, ask a customer services representative at the store about whether and how you can opt out of any features of the program.

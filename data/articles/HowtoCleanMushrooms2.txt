 Run some warm water over a paper towel. Wring out excess water and fold or crumple paper towel to create an edge you can grip while wiping the mushrooms.Using warm water will help loosen caked-on sediment.
 Use the damp paper towel to wipe along the outside of the cap and stem, including the underside. Pay particular attention to areas where dirt or discoloration appears thickest. Wet a fresh paper towel once the first becomes dirty. Wiping mushrooms down by hand can be useful if the type of mushroom you're cleaning has a broader surface area that would make working with a colander difficult.








This method works best on larger, smooth types such as porcini and portobellos that won’t require you to clean dozens of individual mushrooms by hand.
Many experienced chefs prefer wiping mushrooms to rinsing them, as they feel it better preserves the mushroom’s flavor.
 Place the clean mushrooms on a cutting board or sheet of paper towels to dry. Cut away any stubborn dirt or mold on the mushroom.
 If the mushrooms you’re cleaning have a ruffled or uneven texture, use a specially-designed mushroom brush or ordinary toothbrush to infiltrate deep crevices and scrub away dirt. Wet the bristles of the brush and use small, delicate motions to clean the cap and stem of the mushroom.








Mushrooms brushes have soft bristles and are designed specifically to scour dirt and grime from vegetables without damaging them.Should you decide to scrub mushrooms with a toothbrush, make sure it has never been used before, and has bristles soft enough to work on the bodies of delicate mushrooms.

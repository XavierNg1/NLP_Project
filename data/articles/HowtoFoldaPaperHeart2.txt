 The ideal size for this strip of paper is 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 11 inches (28 cm).The dimensions needed for this strip of paper do not need to be exact but you should try and keep the same ratio between height and width for optimal results.
 Create a 45 degree valley fold, bringing the lower left corner up until it touches the upper edge of the strip. Crease this fold.
 Always bring the corner towards the opposite edge. Youâ€™ll need to alternate with each fold; your second fold will be bringing the top corner to the bottom edge while the third fold will bring the bottom corner to the top edge.The length of the strip should becomes notably shorter as you fold.
 Using scissors, cut off the excess length. Leave a portion of the excess length that measures roughly half the width of the triangular folds., The lower right corner should be brought up so that it meets the right edge of the folded triangle. Crease this fold.
 Start by bringing the upper right corner down, sliding it into one of the existing layers of the folded triangle. As you push, the rest of this section should be completely tucked in, leaving you with a triangle., Turn the triangle so that the longest edge is on the top. Use scissors to snip off the corners, rounding them off.


Note that the paper will be very thick at this point and it may be hard to cut through.
The longest edge should not be the newly-tucked in portion of the triangle.
 Pinch the heart lightly, putting your index finger on one of the rounded corners, and your thumb on the other. Use your thumbnail to indent the middle of the top edge. This will give the edge a slight curve, completing your lucky heart.

 If you find an opportunity to roll the dice while the other players are talking, do not call for their attention just so they can watch you roll. Let them stay distracted, and roll the dice. Before anyone can see the numbers, move your marker wherever you want it.Be sure you know how many spaces you move so when your opponent asks you what you rolled, you can give them an answer that matches the spot you moved to. If a player questions your move, just keep a straight face, and keep with the lie.
 Instead of showing off these cards when you draw them, act pleased with whatever card you get, and collect what amount is requested on the card, even if the card is telling you to pay. Then, quickly put the card back into the pile and move on., If the other players are not paying attention to their properties, or where you land, let it go unnoticed. The official rules explain that you will not have to pay if your opponent has still not noticed by the time two other people take a turn.Try to get the next two players to take their turn by complaining about how the game is moving too slowly. This will hopefully speed up the game so you won't have to pay!
Keep the owner of the property you landed on distracted. Tell that person a funny joke, or tell them a long story until the next two turns are taken.

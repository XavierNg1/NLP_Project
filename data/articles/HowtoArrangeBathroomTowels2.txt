 Position a large, open cabinet with multiple cubby holes against one wall of the bathroom. Reserve several of the cubby holes for towels. You can either organize the towels by giving each family member his or her own cubbyhole—in which case, each would store a body towel, hand towel, and washcloth—or you would store the towels away by type—one cubbyhole for body towels, one for washcloths, and so on.


In the remaining cubby holes, you can store additional bathroom necessities.
 Storing rolled hand towels and washcloths a glass bin or bowl gives your bathroom the ambiance of a relaxing spa or hotel, especially if you use white or ivory towels. Arrange them artistically, so that the tops of each towel peek out from the bowl, instead of merely stacking the towels inside.
 If these towels are for a guest bathroom, you can add a welcoming touch of elegance by tying your rolled towels together with a glossy satin ribbon. White or pastel ribbons have the most soothing effect and, therefore, are generally most suitable for the bathroom. The ribbons also catch your guests’ eyes, making it easy for them to locate the towels they need.


Pile the rolled towels up in a miniature pyramid. Place two towels on the bottom and one on top, centered between the other two.
For an additional artistic spin, you can place the towel pyramid atop a small square mirror.
 The principle is similar to placing rolled towels inside a glass bowl. Instead of a sterile spa environment, however, placing your towels in wicker baskets creates a country-style setting. Tying a bow on the basket is a simple way to further decorate the towel space without making it difficult to unroll the towels.

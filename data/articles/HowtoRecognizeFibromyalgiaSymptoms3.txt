 Believe it or not, it often takes some patients - even with the help of doctor - up to five years to recognize that they have fibromyalgia. This is because so many of the symptoms mimic other health issues. Getting a proper diagnosis as early as possible, however, will help you better be able to address the condition.Increased understanding of fibromyalgia has led to steadily improving methods of recognizing and treating the condition.
Your doctor will be most capable of helping you determine the best approach to countering any symptoms you may be enduring.
 Along with the help of your doctor, make sure no other common health issues may be causing your symptoms.Rule out rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. These types of diseases all begin with generalized aches and pains, but will require different treatment than fibromyalgia.
Address any mental health problems. Depression and anxiety can often lead to physical symptoms such as aches and pains that are hard to diagnose as well.
Rule out neurological disorders too. The numbness and tingling that you may associate with fibromyalgia may actually be caused by other serious issues, such as multiple sclerosis.
 While fibromyalgia has no definitive cause and is hard to treat, a disease called small-fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN) is a specific medical condition that is easily misunderstood as fibromyalgia.Some patients who have been formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia have been found to actually be suffering from this disease, which causes damage to the nerves within the skin.

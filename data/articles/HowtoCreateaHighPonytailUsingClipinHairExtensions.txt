 The smoother and softer the hair is to begin with, the easier it will be to style.;
, Think about where you want to place them on your head, rearranging as you go if necessary.
 You should have one in the front, one in the middle, and one in the back of your head. Pull the back section into a small ponytailâ€”this will serve as the base for the ponytail you create with your hair extensions.
 Flip your head upside down, and then clip in the large extensions that go below your crown. You will need to clip in the extensions below your crown upside down so they lay flat when you pull them up into the ponytail.
 Go around the original ponytail, spacing them out as evenly as you can.
 Once your extensions have been clipped, use the remaining sections of your hair to disguise them. Pull back the middle section and gather it around your ponytail, then do the same with the front section. Secure this with a hair tie and bobby pins if you like.
 Pin back flyways and add accessories, or hairspray if you want your hair to stay perfectly in place. You're done!

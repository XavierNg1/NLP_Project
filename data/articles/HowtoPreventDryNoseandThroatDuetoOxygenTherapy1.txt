 Whenever your lungs are not taking in sufficient oxygen for your body, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. Conditions that impair lung function and necessitate oxygen therapy include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (typically due to smoking), chronic asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, and heart failure.


To determine whether you need oxygen therapy, your doctor may measure the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood (your PaO2). A PaO2 below 7.3kPa (55 mmHg) indicates that oxygen therapy is necessary. A PaO2 between 7.3 and 7.8 kPa (55 to 59 mmHg) and additional symptoms of inadequate oxygenation (leg swelling, increased red blood cells, pulmonary hypertension, or an altered mental state, for example) also indicates that oxygen therapy should be prescribed.;
, Depending on your circumstances, you may either receive oxygen therapy in a hospital setting or, if you have a chronic condition, at home. There are three basic methods of oxygen delivery:


By face mask. In this kind of oxygen therapy, you wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth, and oxygen is administered through it.
By nasal cannula. In this kind of oxygen therapy, small tubes are placed in your nostrils, and the oxygen is administered through them.
By a trans-tracheal tube. In this kind of oxygen therapy, an incision is made in your skin, and a tube is placed directly into your trachea to deliver oxygen.
 If you have oxygen therapy, you are likely to develop dryness in your nose, mouth, and throat. You may also experience nosebleeds, headaches, fatigue, infections, and skin irritation. Don’t let these side effects keep you from getting the oxygen therapy that you need. Many of them – including dryness in your nose and throat – are preventable.

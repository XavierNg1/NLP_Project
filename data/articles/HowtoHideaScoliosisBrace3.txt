 This is especially recommended for people who where the Chêneau brace or a brace which reaches high into the armpit. A tank top which rises higher will protect your armpit and make you more comfortable. You also want to avoid ribbed tanks or seams which might dig into your skin when your brace is tightened.Buy several tanks when you find one that works, so you will have enough to change out every day.
Try Under Armor or Gap’s Modern Crew Tee.
 When the weather is cool, hoodies and cardigans are a great addition to your wardrobe. The thick material combined with the length of hoodies are a perfect cover for any brace. They are also worn over other shirts, which give you the extra buffer between the brace and the exterior layer.
 The outer layer of a jacket or sport coat can add class and style while covering the shape of the brace. If the curvature of your spine is creating uneven shoulders, you can also add a shoulder pad to the inside of on of the shoulders of a jacket to balance out your stance., If you want to wear a tighter dress or a tunic tank, you can add a second, flowing layer, like a light cropped sweater, over the top to cover any lines of the brace and still allow you to comfortably wear the tighter layer underneath.

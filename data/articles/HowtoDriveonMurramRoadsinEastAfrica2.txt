Many murram roads are heavily cambered to protect them from heavy rainfall. This means that the usual place to drive is in the center of the road for maximum comfort for passengers and driver.
Predictably this causes a problem when faced with a vehicle travelling on the opposite direction.
 If you do, the other driver will assume that you are willing to give way and will just keep on coming, straight at you in the center of the road. Possibly even driving you into the side of the road.


The usual way of passing could be compared to playing chicken.
Approach the other vehicle head on slowing down considerably to little above walking pace and at the last moment gracefully pull over to the side and the other vehicle will (hopefully) be doing exactly the same. Allowing a safe passing with neither vehicle being forced into the ditch or side of the road.
,, Slow down on poor murram surfaces.
 Otherwise, stay well behind any vehicles in front or even consider pulling over for a minute to allow their dust to clear before proceeding.
, Many do not allow them.

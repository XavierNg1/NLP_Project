 If you clear a ball faster you have more time to score. Every second counts. Improve your running skills e.g run a short distance every day. It works!

, This helps you clear the ball and make a quick counter attack.
 This way, you will reduce the chances of being fooled by the opponent's tricks.
 Always shoot the ball towards the wings.
 The attackers will push down the wings. At that time, you're the person who could decide your team's fate!

,, Take good tackles for granted. Do more of them. Make sure you stay with your mark.

 Chrome polish is the most expensive of the methods for removing rust, but a quality product will make removal quick and easy. A light penetrating oil such as WD40, CLR, or CRC can be used instead, and is typically the cheaper option.
 Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal.


If the dirt is very difficult to remove you can also use vinegar to clean the surface of the chrome. Vinegar is a mild acid and will help in the process of rust removal as well.
 Spread the cleaning substance over the rusted area on the chrome and make sure it is coated completely to avoid scratching the surface.
 Soft brass wool or a brass wire brush is best for this purpose, since it is less likely to cause major scratches. If you cannot find brass wool, use the finest steel wool available, preferably grade #0000. Coating it with additional chrome polish will also help prevent scratching.
 Gently rub using a circular motion while making sure that the surface is moist at all times. Do not apply pressure while rubbing or else you will damage the surface.


If the area gets dry then be sure to add more oil or chrome polish. Rubbing dry chrome with metal wool will scratch and damage the surface.
 Rinse off the metal polish and removed rust by washing the area with water.
 If the surface of the chrome is not completely free of rust spots then use additional chrome polish to try to remove the spots using the same method.
 Water spots show up very easily on chrome surfaces so it is best to dry the chrome completely to make it shiny and brilliant.


Make sure to put a coat of polish or wax on the chrome to keep the rust from reforming.

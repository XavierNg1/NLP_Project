 You need a plan for how you will use your study time. Determine the amount of time you will spend studying each specific subject. Next, determine the topics that you will study, and split the time accordingly.


For example, maybe you are devoting two hours to study for an English class. You might want to devote 30 minutes to studying grammar, 30 minutes to studying literature, and one hour to writing topics.
Study the most difficult subjects and topics at the time you are most alert and attentive. The easier subjects won’t require as much energy., Your brain needs time to process and rejuvenate when obtaining a significant amount of information. Avoid studying for longer than two hours at a time without taking a break. Ideally, take short five minutes breaks after each hour of studying and longer breaks after longer stretches of studying.


For example, if you plan on studying for six hours, take a 30 minute break at the halfway point.Reward yourself during breaks. Grab a quick snack during your short five-minute breaks, and do something enjoyable during your longer break. You’ve earned it.
 There are probably a lot more things you would like to do instead of studying. However, honor your study time by setting strict time limits and sticking to them.


Set an alarm or alert to help you keep track of time. You can also simply write the times down and post it where easily visible.

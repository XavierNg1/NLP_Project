 You can use any type of milk you want for these popsicles - whole milk, skim, goat's milk, coconut milk, almond milk, and so on. Stir your milk and water together.If you want extra creamy popsicles, swap out the water for whole milk, half and half or heavy cream.
 Pour the cocoa and sugar into the bowl and stir with a whisk until they are completely dissolved in your milk and water mixture.


You can substitute honey, stevia, agave nectar, or any other sweetener for the sugar.
Instead of vanilla, try using almond extract, a few drops of peppermint extract, or another flavoring.
 Get creative and use ice cube trays if you don't have popsicle molds.
 Let them stay in the freezer for 3 hours or overnight, until they're completely hard.

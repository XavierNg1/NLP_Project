 Before you begin with the upgrade, keep in mind that it might take some time before the download is finished. It is therefore best to prepare your device before you start downloading.


To make sure that there will be no interruptions, plug in your device to a power source that will keep your device powered-up for the download time.
 The iOS 8 system update takes up about 1 GB of space, but iPhones and iPads needs to have 4.6 GB of free space before they could download iOS 8. It is better to first back up your files using iCloud or iTunes and remove your files to free up your device space.
 If, for some reason, you cannot upgrade your software because you cannot find a good Wi-Fi spot, the Wi-Fi connection is slow or intermittent, or you just don’t feel secure upgrading your iOS via Wi-Fi, you can just use your computer or laptop to update your software via iTunes.


See to it that you have the updated version of the iTunes in your computer or laptop. On Mac, go to the iTunes menu and select “Check for updates.” On Windows, access the Help menu then click “Check for updates.”

, Use your USB cable to connect your device to your computer or laptop. If the iTunes did not open or launch automatically, find your iTunes icon in your computer or laptop, and click on it.
 When you have opened the iTunes, select your device. Your device should be shown in the tab on the upper part of the screen. Click on your device.
 After clicking on the icon of your device, you will see a Settings tab. Locate the Summary pane, and click on it.


Inside the Summary pane, you will need to locate a tab with the words “Check for update” on it. Click on that tab, and your iOS device will begin updating to iOS 8.

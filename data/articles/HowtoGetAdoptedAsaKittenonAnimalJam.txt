 Foxes or bunnies look best as kittens, and your fur should be somethings like orange, brown, white, gray, black, or the secret icy blue. Your eyes should be yellow or green.;
, You can also dress up. Don't be too owner-like, but you can wear blankets, hoods, or bonnets.
,, There are four types of owners. Owners that are just one person who wants a cat, owners with a child who wants a pet, and owners with a huge house of pets. The one you should look out for is the animal abuser owner; they will say things like 'Kicks kitten and makes sleep outside in cold rain'. If that happens, leave them.
 Most likely, you will get a bowl for water and a small room. Don't be too kitten like "Claws couch" or "Rips pillow" or your owner will tape you in a box and say "Sends naughty cat to pillow room".
 If your owner is the kind who is one person who needs a cat, maybe play fetch-the-yarn with them. If you are being owned by the owner's son or daughter, cuddle with them and purr. If you're just in a house full of pets, play tag or catch with the other pets.
 When your owner rewards you a treat or something, reward him/her back. Give them a lick on the cheek or say "purrs softly".

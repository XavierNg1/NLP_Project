 You want to start with tangle-free hair, but it doesn't have to be straight or especially neat. Part of the fun of the bohemian look is that it looks a little messy. In this case, flyaways and loose strands are a good thing!;
, This style looks best with hair that's parted to one side. Part it where you naturally do or move your part a few inches to the right or left for a more dramatic look. Run the tip of a comb along your part to make sure it looks nice and neat.
 This bun looks beautiful right at the nape of the neck, or you could place it higher up on your head. Another great choice is the side bun, which dresses up the look a little to make it fitting for a cocktail party or even a wedding.


Hold your hair in position with one hand to keep it in place. With the other hand, use a hand mirror with your bathroom hair so you can view the back of your head and see what the placement will look like.
 You want one that's fairly tight so your hair won't fall out of the bun. For now, just wrap it around your hair one time., Instead of pulling your ponytail entirely through the holder, stop pulling it through when about half of your hair is still hanging down. You'll now have a looped bun held in place with the ponytail.


This is a good time to check and make sure your ponytail is tight enough to hold the style. If you have long or heavy hair, take a second ponytail holder and wrap it around the looped bun to hold it in place.
 Lift up the part of your hair that's sticking out and wrap it around the ponytail holder so that the holder is no longer visible. Use bobby pins to secure the hair in place.
 Finish the look by pulling a few strands of hair out of the bun to frame your face. A few wispy strands will make this style look even more bohemian. Use light hold hairspray to keep the style looking fresh.

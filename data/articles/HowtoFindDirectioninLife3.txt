 You don't have to be absolutely certain that this is the "right" path. Trust yourself, and trust that you will be able to escape any given set of circumstances if you no longer feel that you are moving forward. Make your choice and see where it goes. Throw yourself into a job, a journey, a practice, or a community that inspires a flare of passion within you.


Do not be afraid to make sacrifices. Do not be afraid to commit. Remember that no commitment is permanent. You can always drop out and change direction.
 If you're always halfway in and halfway out of a commitment, then you won't be able to say that you have given a direction a fair chance. Suspend your doubts for a time, and focus on the joys of doing exactly what you are doing.
 Follow your dreams despite the ups and downs of life. Let your passion and your intention guide you as you build momentum in the right direction. Direction is knowing where you're going. Trust yourself.Persevere even if nobody else believes in you. This not to say, however, that you should ignore good advice.
Have confidence in your abilities. Follow through on your decisions.
 Accept that you will change, that your needs will change, and that your purpose will change.Pursue your choices wholeheartedly, but do not let yourself become trapped in a situation that doesn't fulfill you. Every so often, ask yourself whether you are still engaged and invested in what you're doing. Perhaps you need to change direction, and perhaps you merely need to adjust your sails.Ask yourself:

"Am I growing in the ways that I want to be growing?"
"Am I happy? Am I satisfied?"
"Does this direction feel worthwhile?"
"What can I do to make things better?"

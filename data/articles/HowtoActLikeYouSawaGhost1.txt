 This dream should involve a ghost; for example, you might say, "I had a dream of a boy dying because he was in a car and the gas ran out in the middle of the train crossing. Then the boy was crushed by the train!;
, Say that in a next dream he was talking to you and he was mad/sad or happy and warning you of something.

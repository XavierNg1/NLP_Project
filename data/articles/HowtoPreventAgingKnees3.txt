 There are a variety of skin treatments that can be used to promote smooth and tight skin on the knees. These include acid treatments to remove dead and damaged skin, as well as moisturizing treatments to keep skin soft and elastic over time.An alpha hydroxy acid treatment can be very effective in getting rid of old and dried up skin on the knees and elbows. There are a variety of these products available over the counter and they should be applied as the packaging directs.
 Exercising the muscles in your legs can increase the skin tension all over your legs. With increased muscle mass, your skin will be better supported and the areas around your knees should firm up.For example, focus some time during your daily workout on exercising your quadriceps. Pumping up these muscles, located directly above your knees, should tighten up the skin on your knee as well.
 Losing a large amount of weight at one time can create a lot of saggy skin all over your body. This sagginess can even affect the look of your knees.Instead of going on a crash diet, focus on losing a pound or two per week, so that your skin has a chance to catch up and tighten on its own.
However, if you are losing a dramatic amount of weight, there may be too much skin for your body to absorb. In cases such as this, the extra skin will not necessarily tighten on its own.
 If you are concerned about the look of your knees then surgery is an option. Plastic surgeons use liposuction and lasers to reduce the amount of loose skin and fat on your knee, leading to tighter skin in the area.Unlike the other options for preventing aging knees, plastic surgery does present some health risks to you. Discuss the possible risks from anesthesia and surgery with your doctor before getting this medical procedure.

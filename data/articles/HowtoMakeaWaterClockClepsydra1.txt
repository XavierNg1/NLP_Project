 Use sharp scissors to cut a disposable plastic water bottle into two pieces. The top should ideally be only slightly shorter than the bottom.


Note that you can create a larger water clock that tracks more time if you use a larger bottle, like a 2-L (2-qt) soda bottle.;
, Use a bradawl or other tool with a sharp, narrow point to pierce the lid of the bottle, creating a small hole with a diameter of roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).


The hole should not be much larger than this, since a bottle with a hole that is too large will lose water too fast to be effective as a water clock.
Alternatively, if you do not have a tool that can create a hole in the hard plastic lid, you can use a plastic cup instead of the top part of the bottle. Pierce the bottom of the cup with an embroidery needle or sewing needle to create a small hole.
 Flip the top part of the bottle over so that the cap faces down. Slip this top part into the bottom portion of the bottle so that the cap rests 4 inches (10 cm) or so above the bottom of the lower half.


Make sure that the cap does not touch the bottom of the bottle. The higher up it is, the better, as long as you can create a snug fit.
If using a plastic cup instead of the top portion of the bottle, rest the cup inside the lower half of the bottle with the bottom of the cup facing down.
 Pour water into your water clock and start timing the flow of water.


Use a permanent marker to mark, on the lower half of the bottle, how much water falls within one minute. Repeat this for the second minute, third minute, and so on, until all the water originally poured into the upper half has dripped out.
 You can use it to measure the passage of time over several minutes.

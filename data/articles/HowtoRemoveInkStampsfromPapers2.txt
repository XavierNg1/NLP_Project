 Turn it to the desired page. Make the page as flat as you safely can get it. Avoid cracking the spine.
 Make sure the page is at least as thick as the pages at the beginning and end of a typical library book. You can use this method on white or colored paper. You could also do this on the inside cover of the book. If the page is thin like computer paper or notebook paper, use another method.For extra protection, it might help to place several sheets of scrap paper under the page you’re working on.
 You can find these in specialty craft stores or online. Look for a blade that’s completely flat on one side with a deep bevel on the other. This will remove the ink stamp while protecting the page from damage.Don’t use an X-Acto knife or butter knife. It will remove the stamp, but it will also damage the page.
 Position it the same way you would hold a pen or pencil. Place your grip towards the bottom of the blade. You can position the blade vertically, horizontally, or at an angle., Start with a letter or small design element in the stamp. Gently follow the shape of the letter or element as you scratch. Move in a back-and-forth motion with the tip of the blade. Be patient. This method can be time-consuming, but you will get professional results.For example, if you’re removing a capital L, move the blade vertically on the long stem and horizontally on the shorter stem.
 As the letters or lines begin to lighten, try to erase them. Erase gently. Move in a regular motion as if you were erasing pencil marks. This will prevent damage that could come from additional scratching. Continue the process. Keep scratching out individual letters or design elements with the knife. As they lighten, you can use the eraser to remove what remains., When all marks are gone, touch up the formerly stamped area with the eraser. Use quick, yet gentle, strokes. Brush away any residual debris with the back of your hand.

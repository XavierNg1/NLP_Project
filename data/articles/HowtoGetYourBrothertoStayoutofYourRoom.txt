 If you don't have one, buy one. Ask your parents to help place it on the door.;

If you're able to set the rules, simply tell your brother he is banned from entry. Place a sign on the door making this clear.
If you parents need to make the rule, explain the facts without whining. Tell them that he messes up the room, disturbs you when doing homework and breaks things, etc.
If you have to tell your parents a lie, try to make it realistic. It's unlikely they'll believe a five year old would throw a grenade at you.
 If he is quite young, tell him there is a ghost in your room. If your brother is older, put up creepy pictures around your room (but not so scary you can't get to sleep yourself). Or tell him that you'll do "girl" things if he comes in.
 For example, if he's older, put up pictures of his ex or a lost favorite pet of his.
 Leave uneaten food around, piles of mess and stinky things. Of course, you won't exactly be a chick magnet but you will probably stop him from wanting to come in.
 Give him toys, candies or money to stay out of your room. Tell him he won't get any more if he comes in again.
 See how he feels if you go into his room, completely ignore him but mess up his things, sit on his stuff and act as if it's your space.
 Fake illness, sneeze and cough a lot, and get into bed. He will be unlikely to want to catch whatever you have got.

 One of the most basic tips to get greater distance is to anchor (firmly press into the ground) your foot and your body behind the ball. The foot you must anchor is the foot that is behind the ball. For right handed players it will be the right foot, and the left foot for left handed players. If you lift your foot too soon when swinging the club you will lose power and distance in the shot., If you can’t touch your elbow to your hip, at least keep your arm close to your hip. By keeping the right arm close to the hip, you ensure the body will drive your arms and club through the ball impact. This will decrease the chances of your hands negatively influencing the shot.Keep your left arm close to your hip if you’re left-handed.
 Relax and keep your grip light. At the top of your backswing, make a slight pause and maintain a light grip through the swing. To keep a light grip, relax the muscles in your forearms and also your fingers. If you do this, you will create a faster, brisker swing release through the ball impact. This will result in a longer drive.Take deep, even breaths to help relax.
 By energetically rotating you hips on the downswing you will bring your core muscles into play. This will increase club head speed, and therefore will result in a longer drive. Make sure you do this in a controlled manner. Keep your foot anchored to prevent slicing the ball.Slicing the ball is when the golf ball curves dramatically from the left to the ball after a shot.
 Do this to achieve a longer drive. A common failure amongst golfers is bringing the driver too far back during the backswing. This causes a loss in control of the club. A powerful, more controlled swing can achieved by controlling your wrists and rotating your body into the shot, thus resulting in a more distance.Your hands should be level with your shoulders when you bring the club back.

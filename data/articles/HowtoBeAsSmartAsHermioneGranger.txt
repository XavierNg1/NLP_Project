 When you have free time, study. Hermione would totally agree. Always make sure you study before a big test, and read anything that will help you gain knowledge.;
, Schedules for homework can help you know what to do. You can sort things out and when you're done maybe you can do some more studying!

, If you want to do it, you're bound to get it right. If you don't want to do it, then you'll have a hard time.
 If you have your mom or dad or an older sibling check your answers, you'll get the answer more often. They'll probably tell you what's wrong, what's right, and help you with what you need help with.
 The best way to get things right is to pay attention in class. By listening, you will have enough knowledge to get the top marks. Don't pass notes or chit-chat in class: be the one who knows everything.
 That way, you appear to know everything. This will also help you understand the topic better, and therefore you will find class work and home work less difficult.
 Don't be worried someone might think you're a nerd, because nobody thinks Hermione is. Besides, being smart will help you on your way to success.
 Hermione never breaks them. Make sure to read the rules for anything and follow them as well as you can. You want to be the teacher's pet!

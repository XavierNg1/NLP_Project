 Adjust any of these ingredients to taste, and tie this bundle up securely.
 In a medium saucepan, add four to six cups of fresh apple cider, the spice packet, and 1/4-cup of real maple syrup. Warm over medium heat until the cider is hot, but not boiling, and then let it steep until it's "mulled" enough for your taste.
 In warmed mugs, add the cider, a cinnamon stick garnish, and serve on a plate with a slice of orange or fresh, warm pumpkin bread.

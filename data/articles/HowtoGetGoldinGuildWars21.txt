 On each of the games maps, there are three different types of resource nodes which yield crafting materials. These nodes are mining, woodcutting, and herb gathering nodes, requiring a pickaxe, axe, and sickle respectively. These things can be purchased at many of the games traders. The further in the game a player gets, the more advanced their tools need to be. They break after a certain number of use so keeping track of how worn they are is important.;
, Players will pick up pieces of armor, weapons, and salvage materials throughout the game which seem to have little value. In fact, these can be broken down using salvage kits, turning them into crafting materials. Salvage kits can be purchased at most major traders.
 After a player accrues enough crafting materials, they should sell them, but rather than selling them to some NPC whose going to give them a few coppers at best, they should sell them to other players. The best way to do that is by visiting a Black Lion Trader in one of the major cities. From there the player can sell their variety of crafting goods to other players in a quick and easy fashion.

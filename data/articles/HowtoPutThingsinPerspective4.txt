 One step to maintain perspective is to to create attainable goals, rather than focusing on too big or unreachable goals.


For example, if you need to lose 100 lbs and you can not quite put that in perspective or believe it, try breaking it down into smaller goals. For example, try starting with losing 5lbs a month.
 You cannot move on and put your life in perspective without first forgiving yourself. Acknowledge what you struggle with, and then work toward forgiving yourself.


For example, if you feel like you are holding on to a past mistake, you can try writing down what it is you need to forgive yourself for. After this acknowledgement, think about the associated feelings with this past action. Take small steps from this to let go of these feelings and get a fresh perspective.
 If you find yourself stressed and out-of-perspective because of drama in your life, try and remove yourself from dramatic situations.


Avoid hanging out with friends who like to cause personal drama.
Consider changing careers to maintain a healthy outlook on life.
Surround yourself with people who make you feel good and encourage the positive.
 To maintain a healthy perspective, you should always remember that you are your own person. You, and no one else, are responsible for your own actions and reactions.


Take time to pamper yourself. Take a day off and do something you enjoy. This will help you realize you can make it on your own.
Think about what YOU want to achieve out of life, and not what someone expects you to do.

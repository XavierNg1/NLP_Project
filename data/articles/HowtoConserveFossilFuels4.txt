 Educate them on the benefits of recycling, conserving energy, and eco-friendly transportation options. Appeal to their concerns as parents, older siblings, or aunts/uncles. If they don't consider themselves environmentalists, ask them to take these measures so that the children in their lives will have a decent future.
 It only takes two minutes to send an email to your state and national representatives, but why stop there? Attend town hall, city council, and school board meetings to voice your concerns in public. Ask your senator/representative/MP why they voted to expand oil drilling. Tell your city council you'd like to see a bus or light rail system. Ask your school board to adopt an anti-idling policy on school grounds., Search online for organizations urging corporations to divest (remove their money) from pipelines and other fossil-fuel projects. This includes banks, credit card companies, and boards overseeing pensions. If your bank or credit card company funds these projects, tell them you will do business with more responsible companies if they don't divest.

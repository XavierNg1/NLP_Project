 You don't need an entirely new wardrobe to look completely fabulous. Just get a few new tops and accessories if you can't afford to splurge on hundreds of dollars worth of apparel. As long as you have some nice, well-fitting jeans, you're good.;
, No one wants to see your underwear, and if you grow too fast, pay attention to when your pants become too short.
 Have a morning routine that goes something like this: shower, wash and moisturize your face, brush teeth, put on your clothes, put on make-up (if you choose to wear it), and eat breakfast. Make sure your teeth are always clean and your breath smells fresh. Shower daily.
 Although inner beauty is much more important, what you look like on the outside is the first impression people will get from you. So always look neat and tidy.
 You'll be popular if you're meant to be. Just be nice to everyone and be very social. Even if you are not popular, make sure the friends that you do have are good ones. Remember to choose your friends wisely!

, It doesn't make you seem cool, it will just cause bad grades and a bad impression.
 If you forget your homework or don't complete an assignment you'll only embarrass yourself. Aim for perfect attendance!

, Don't rush into relationships if you aren't ready and its' really not a big deal at all if you don't date anyone.
,, If you forget it, you'll have to go to the office and it's a huge mess.

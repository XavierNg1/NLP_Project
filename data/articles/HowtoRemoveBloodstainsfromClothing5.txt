,, Using cold water, make a paste of 2 parts baking soda to 1 part water. Apply directly to the stain and let sit for up to half an hour.
 By this point, your stain should be super gone. If the paper towel or cloth saturates, trade it in for a new one.
 If a bit of the stain is being stubborn, throw it in the laundry with a cup of vinegar.It will rinse the stain out and is good on all colors.









Air dry the clothing. It's still best to avoid extreme temperatures right now, in case any of the stain is still present and it's hard to tell in the soaked cloth. If it's still present, simply move onto another method!

 The bread slices or pieces can be baked and crushed into breadcrumbs. These will keep up to three months in an airtight container. This can be used to coat fried foods, in stuffings, added to an omelet, as a topping on savory dishes, etc.


Fresh breadcrumbs (not toasted/heated) are a great addition to meatballs, meatloaf, and vegetarian loaf (lentil-, legume-based, etc.).;
, Bread turned into puddings is an age old tradition. Not only does it use up the bread but it's delicious. Here are some suggestions:



Bread and butter pudding or plain bread pudding

Bread and butter pudding with Baileys
Hot bread pudding
Chocolate bread pudding
Croissant bread pudding
Bread pudding in a mug

Apple raisin bread pudding.
 Dice the bread slices into cubes and fry in oil. They can now be sprinkled over soups and salads as croutons. Again, these will keep in an airtight container for up to two weeks.
 Serve for breakfast. Some recipes for this method include:


French toast
French toast sticks
Eggnog French toast
Strawberry stuffed French toast

Oven French toast.
 This will soak up the soup and you won't notice any more staleness! Bread can also be added to a soup as you're making it, to thicken the soup. This is good for thickening broths, and if you puree bread into a soup, it will turn the soup creamy and alleviate the need to add real cream.
 There are a number of sauce recipes that use bread as an ingredient.

 Cut two lemons in half. Squeeze the lemon juice into a baking dish. Put the rest of the lemons into the dish. Fill the dish a third of the way with water.If you don’t have lemons, you can use another type of citrus, like oranges.;
, Turn the oven on to 250°F (121.1°C). Leave the oven on for 30 minutes.Leave the dish in the oven for longer than 30 minutes if there is a lot of build-up in the oven.
 Remove the dish from the oven after 30 minutes. The lemons act as a natural degreaser and will cause the build-up in the oven to loosen up. Use a scouring pad to remove the loosened build-up. You may need to use a spatula to remove larger chunks of build-up.Wait a few minutes for the oven to cool down before you clean.
 Use the leftover lemon water in the baking dish to rinse off the oven. Dip a sponge in the water, and wash off the remainder of the grime. Continue to scrub until the oven is clean. Use a towel to dry off the lemon water.Smoke may emit from the oven while you are cleaning. Open a window and/or turn on the oven fan if this occurs.

 While it’s important to maintain your long-distance friendship, it’s also equally important to forge new friendships with others. Consider joining a sports team at your school. There are a host of benefits of to participating in athletics. In addition to engaging with a team and making friends, kids who are involved in sports also make smarter social choices, have better grades, and even develop better leadership skills., If you are not athletic, joining another kind of extracurricular activity may be ideal. Doing this can keep you otherwise engaged and distracted from always missing your friend. Also, participating in clubs and organizations helps you learn marketable skills that can look good on college and job applications.What’s more, regularly meeting up with other students in your school can help you build new bonds with people you may not have hung out with previously.
 Yet another beneficial way to make more friends and make a positive impact in your community is volunteering. Doing community services helps you develop better social skills because you get to meet up with people who share common interests. However, you also develop greater empathy because you are often assisting and interacting with people who come from all walks of life.Check out volunteer opportunities by contacting local religious groups, political groups, or community organizations to see if they have positions available.
 Sometimes, making new friends comes down to saying “yes” to different invites you receive from classmates at school or from people in your extracurricular activities. At the same time, you can also open up your home to invite a few friends over after school or on weekends. Check with your parents to confirm that this is okay first.

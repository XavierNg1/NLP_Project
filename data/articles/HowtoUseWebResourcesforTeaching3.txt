 Use the audio or video recording capabilities of your computer or electronic device to document your teaching. Save the file with the title of your lesson and upload it to a web host. This will make your lesson available to fellow teachers and curious web-browsers. It also offers a convenient resource for students who are looking to review course materials or catch up on material they missed due to absence.


Free audio recording software is available at http://audacity.sourceforge.net/

If you would only like this material to be available to a limited audience (such as your enrolled students), encrypt your recording with a password.
 You’ve benefited from web resources, now it’s time to pay it forward. If you have a lesson plan or handout that worked well, make it publicly available on a personal website or teaching forum.


If you’re comfortable with people adapting and/or adding to your lesson, post it on a site like Reading International Wiki. This will turn your materials into a collaborative writing project and put them in the public domain.
 Pick one that’s related to your field, and join the conversation. It’s a great way to hear about how other teachers have used online resources in their real-life classrooms. Share your findings and bounce ideas off colleagues. It could even lead to an exciting collaboration!


Most websites and organizations dedicated to teaching have their own associated forums and/or listservs. If you have go-to teaching website or a group that you’re already affiliated with, that’s a good first place to look.

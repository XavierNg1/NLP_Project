 If the products are not given, you can predict them using other methods (article coming soon).


Fe(s) + O2(g) -> Fe2O3(s).
 The total amount of individual elements comprising the reactants should equal the amount of individual elements comprising the products after the coefficients are placed. If a coefficient is one, you do not need to place a number.


4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) -> 2Fe2O3(s).
 Include proper units. Place "m =Â ?" under the compound or element you are solving for.

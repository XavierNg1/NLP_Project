 At the supermarket, be sure that your bacon is the very last item you select before checking out.If you pick up your bacon at the beginning of your supermarket trip, it’s potentially developing bacteria while you are checking the other items off your list.
 Do not use previously opened bacon that has already been stored in your fridge. Cured meats like bacon can spoil or develop bacteria at temperatures higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so be sure to prepare your bacon for individual freezing immediately after purchasing it., While this step might seem obvious, it’s still important. Even beyond washing your hands before and after you prepare your bacon, you should also wash your hands at any point after touching the bacon and before touching any supplies.


For instance, if you need to grab some more wax paper or a freezer bag, don’t forget to wash your hands first. Otherwise, your roll of wax paper or box of storage bags will be contaminated.
 It’s important to disinfect both before and after you prepare your bacon for freezing. Any bacteria that is on your counter can be transferred to the wax paper and onto your bacon.
 Be sure to check the “use by” date and the number of days recommended for refrigeration, as well. While freezing keeps your bacon fresher longer, you should definitely freeze your bacon prior to the expiration date. Likewise, if you needed to store the bacon in your fridge before freezing it, be sure to freeze it before the end of the suggested refrigeration period,which is seven days.The longer bacon is stored, the less flavorful it will be. For best quality, store your bacon in the freezer for no more than one month.Three months is the recommended maximum storage time., Always thaw food in the refrigerator or in cold water. If using cold water, replace the water at 30 minute intervals. Do not thaw bacon at room temperature.

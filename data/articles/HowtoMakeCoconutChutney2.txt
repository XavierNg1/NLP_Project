 Heat 2 teaspoons of sunflower or coconut oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add 15 to 20 whole curry leaves. Fry them for 1 to 2 minutes or until they crisp up.Use caution when frying. Use oven mitts to handle the pan and be careful around the hot oil.
 Carefully pour the oil along with the fried curry leaves into a small food processor or heat-proof spice grinder. Add the remaining ingredients into the food processor. To make one medium bowl of quick coconut chutney, you'll need:1/2 cup (46 g) of fresh or frozen grated coconut
1/4 cup (47 g) roasted chana dal (bengal gram)
1/2 inch of peeled fresh ginger
1 green pepper (hari mirch), chopped

, Cover the food processor or grinder and blend the chutney until it's the consistency you like. You may want to add between 1/2 cup (118 ml) to 3/4 cup (177 ml) of water which will make it smoother. Taste the coconut chutney and add salt to your taste.Serve the chutney immediately since it won't last more than a day. You can make this coconut chutney ahead of time and freeze it.

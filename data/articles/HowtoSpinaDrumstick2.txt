 Matched grip position is the starting position in which you hold your drumsticks. Grip the stick by hooking your pointer finger around the stick, and grasping the stick with the pad of your thumb.You should be holding the stick approximately 4 inches from the bottom of the stick.


Then wrap your other three fingers around the drumstick. The drumstick should be gently (but securely) resting in the palm of your hand.
 Normally when drumming, your hands (and sticks) are in a horizontal position. For the spin, turn your hand so youâ€™re holding the drumstick vertically., Remain holding the drumstick with your pointer finger and thumb. Put your middle, ring, and pinky fingers behind the stick while still keeping the drumstick vertical., With your three fingers behind the drumstick, push the bottom the drumstick forward (so the top of the stick comes toward you).Your middle finger is going to be doing the majority of the pushing. As the drumstick begins to spin, release your thumb from the stick and allow the stick to spin over your pointer finger.


As the stick finishes spinning around your pointer finger, release your middle finger from the stick, and the drumstick will then finish spinning around your pointer finger.
 The stick will make one full rotation until it is back in its starting position. As the stick comes back to its starting position, catch it using all of you fingers and thumb.


Once back in the starting position, you can continue to spin the stick.

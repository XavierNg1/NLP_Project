 Using a sharp knife, cut the meat lengthwise into long chunks. Use either a meat cleaver or another chopping style knife. The slices should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick on all sides, so if you have a thicker cut of meat, trim it down to this size.








The pieces can be as long or short as you want.
 Now cut the strips lengthwise again to half of their current size. You want the strips to be thin before you start mincing the meat further. Lay the cut strips out in a single layer on a cookie sheet.
 Just as you would when mincing meat with a food processor, chill the meat before you begin to cut it. Youâ€™ll get cleaner cuts and better chopping with cold meat. Chill for at least 15 minutes to firm up the outer edges without freezing the meat solid.
 For fast and efficient mincing of the meat, use two sharp knives that are meant for chopping. The sharper the knife and the bigger the blade, the easier it will be to chop the meat. If you only have one knife that is good for chopping, perform the next step with one knife., With a knife in each hand, chop down onto the meat repeatedly with hammer-like motions. Scoop the meat into a pile, and turn it in a circle as you go. Continue chopping, piling, and turning the meat unto it reaches a consistency of tiny pieces.








If you are mincing a lot of meat, you may want to perform this step two or more times with a portion of the meat. If you try to chop too much at once it will not work as well.
Always practice safety when you are chopping meat with sharp knives. Be sure to keep both hands out of the way of the knife in the other hand.

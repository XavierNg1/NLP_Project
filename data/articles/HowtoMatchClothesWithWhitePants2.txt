 This will create a look that is classy and fun at the same time. You can dress up the outfit by wearing a pair of black or gray sandals, and wearing some silver accessories, such as a long silver necklace or hoop earrings. This is a stellar look because the tight black shirt will create a nice contrast with the wide-legged pants. You'll still be able to show off your curves about the waist while covering your legs a bit more.


A cute belt can add some flavor to this outfit. Since your waist may be visible or somewhat visible because of your tight top, you can think about wearing a simple black belt.
 This will create a more formal look. You can match this outfit with a pair of stilettos or even some strappy heels. Any color of shirt will do: a darker color will create more contrast, and a softer light shade such as pink or light purple will create a more subtle, flowing look.
 This is a great look for the cooler months. You can wear a regular v-neck sweater, a turtleneck, or any other kind of sweater that doesn't hang too loosely. Remember that since the wide-pants are more loose, a tighter top will create the most balance for this look.


You can rock this look with a pair of ankle boots with a narrow heel. For a more casual look, a cute pair of clogs will do the trick if it's not too cold.

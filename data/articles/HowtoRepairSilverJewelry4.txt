 These cloths are made specifically for cleaning and polishing silver. They don’t require any liquid cleaner or polishing agent. Just use the cloth to gently buff away tarnish and restore the jewelry to its natural shine., Liquid polishing agents and dips are harsh chemicals that could damage plated silver. They need to be used in very well-ventilated areas, as well, as the smell could be hazardous to your health. You also may have to dispose of these chemicals carefully, as they are considered hazardous.These heavy-duty cleaners can also cause your jewelry to tarnish more quickly, as they could strip the protective surface off.
 If the polishing cloth doesn’t do the trick, you can try using things from your kitchen to clean your silver jewelry. A little bit of phosphate-free dishwashing soap and warm water, for example, could help. Or, try using a paste made from baking soda and water. Apply a small dollop (about the size of a pea) to your jewelry and use it to buff away tarnish.Always rinse your jewelry after using any kind of polish, homemade or otherwise. Rinse it briefly, then dry it with a clean cloth. You don’t want any polish to get stuck on the jewelry anywhere and harden.
 Certain gemstones may require special attention when cleaning. If your silver jewelry contains fragile pieces like pearl, you will want to make sure you only use cleaning or polishing agents that are safe for these parts of the jewelry., Put a little bit of toothpaste on a cloth. After wetting down the piece of silver jewelry, rub the toothpaste gently into it using circular motions. Rinse the jewelry again. If the scratch is still there, repeat the process. If the scratch doesn’t go away after a few tries, it may need to be taken to a jeweler for repair.


Don’t use toothpaste that is for tartar control or has a whitening agent. These ingredients are too abrasive and may actually end up damaging the silver.

 Remember that the more kids added, the more water will be displaced by their weight. To avoid spills over the top, aim for less water than you'd use for one kid.


Add some bubble bath or even bath bombs for bathing enjoyment.
A bathmat suitable for lining the bath will help to prevent slips.;
, Add rubber ducks, toy boats, floating toys, etc., to the bath. Ensure that all toys added are safe for the kids and are waterproof or for water use.


Put the toys in one by one.
 If the kids don't want to get in, encourage them by suggesting that anyone in the bath will get a special mermaid drink, becomes a mermaid or is captain of the bathtub vessel.


If they don't want to be seen naked, give them their swimming costume. They'll still get clean, so don't make a fuss.
 As you do so, turn it into a story. For example: "'And the fairy said to the spacemen, I do hope you have washed behind your ears in twenty seconds or we won't be able to visit the chocolate planet!".
 Small children should never be left unattended in a bath, so you're on watch until the last of the bathwater has been drained out.


Prevent fighting in the bath. If the kids start hitting one another, pull them out of the bath and onto the bathmats on the floor. Explain that this is not to happen. If they enjoy the bathing, explain that bath time is over should bad behavior continue. If they hate the bath, explain that treats won't happen if they're badly behaved.
Small splashes are okay. Large splashes are a nuisance, so ask them nicely to stop. Explain that big splashes get you wet and mess up the bathroom floor.
 Spills over the bath and onto the hard floor spoil the fun and may end in injury.
 Make sure the towels are soft. Have bathmats on the floor for the kids to stand on.


If you have small toweling dressing gowns, have the kids put these on instead; they'll dry without trying.
 Sing a few songs while waiting for each child to finish and have the children waiting sing along.

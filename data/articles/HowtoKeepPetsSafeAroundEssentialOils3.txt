 While you should avoid using essential oils on animals other than dogs and horses, even those pets cannot deal with every essential oil. The clearest example of an essential oil to avoid using on any pet is tea tree oil.A concentration of tea tree oil higher than one percent could cause severe illness or death, so it is best to avoid using it in general to avoid this risk.It is very important to get professional advice when considering the use of essential oils so that you can avoid using oils that could be toxic to your pet.
 While most essential oils will not kill your pets, many of them can be irritating or can cause adverse health effects, such as intestinal distress. Research what types of essential oils and what types of application you can use safely before applying essential oils to your pet.There are a wide variety of essential oils that can be irritating to the skin and can be dangerous to your pet's liver if ingested, which can happen if your pet licks it off after you apply it. These can include cinnamon, oregano, clove, wintergreen, thyme, birch, eucalyptus, tea tree, pennyroyal, and thuja.
 Just because an essential oil is not inherently toxic to your pet, that doesn't mean that it is helpful in all forms and applications. If you are using a product that contains essential oils and your pet is having an adverse reaction, for instance it has developed a rash, discontinue use of the product and avoid using that essential oil in the future.Avoid applying a one hundred percent solution of any essential oil onto your pet. Essential oils are meant to be used at a low concentration, especially on pets. If you use a very high percentage solution of any essential oil, it may be more irritating than soothing to your pet.

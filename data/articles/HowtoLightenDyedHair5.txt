 For best results, you’ll want to be able to apply the peroxide to your hair via spray bottle. Pouring it directly from the bottle over your head will leave you to guess as to how much of your hair has been affected.


Peroxide is definitely the least predictable, and likely the least optimal option available to you. It doesn’t work against the dye and chemicals already in your hair, but instead adds another one. Use it with caution.
 Use the “mister” setting, if you have the option, as opposed to the “stream” setting. Spray the hair you wish to lighten from a distance of about a foot away, using a hand or cloth to cover your eyes.


Peroxide is safe to get on your skin, but can cause burning in your eyes.If you get some in them, flush them with cool water.
Going outside in the sun can cause further lightening, but can also dry your hair out. Be aware of the effect sunlight will have if you choose to go outside with the peroxide in your hair.
Use pins or clips to arrange your hair, so that you only spray the hair you want to.
 Excessive peroxide use can easily lead to a brassy, orangey hair coloration.


A deep conditioning is recommended if your hair feels dry after the peroxide treatment.

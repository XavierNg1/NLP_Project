 Be careful that you only make as much as you want to use.
 It should be soft and runny, but not boiling. Take it out and stir it, and put it back in for about 15 to 30 more seconds.
 You don't have to use the whole packet, so add a little at a time until you reach the desired color.  It doesn't have to be Kool-Aid––Crystal Light and other drink powders work just fine.
 You can use old lip balm containers, plastic jewelry boxes, pretty much anything that is clean, food-safe and easy to store. Put the container into the refrigerator and let it cool for 30 to 45 minutes.

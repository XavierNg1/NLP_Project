 Just like in the Elman Induction method, it's best to have the participant sitting or reclining. This helps facilitate relaxation and makes it easier to perform the induction technique., The most common tasks to focus the participant's attention are closing her eyes and pushing down with her hand. Hold out your hand towards the participant while sitting next to or in front of her. Tell her to push down on your hand while simultaneously closing her eyes., While the participant is pushing down on your hand with her eyes closed, you will need to abruptly pull your hand away. Her hand should keep pushing down for an instant, which creates what is called a "startle response." In that instant, the participant should become highly susceptible to suggestion.Because this technique involves a physical action which can startle the participant, you should not use the Hand Drop Induction method on anyone with shoulder, neck, or back problems, or any kind of heart problems., In that brief moment of being open to suggestion, you should say the word "Sleep" in a firm and authoritative tone to your participant. This should be followed by immediate suggestions for deepening her state of sleep and relaxation.Suggestions for deeper sleep should be short and easy to deliver. Try something like, "Relax and go limp. Continue to relax deeper and deeper with each and every breath.", Much like the Elman Induction method, the Hand Drop Induction is often accompanied by a process of counting down. Tell the participant to begin counting down from 100, and that with each number she counts down, that number will dissolve and disappear.At this point the participant should be in a hypnotic state and highly open to suggestion or instruction.

 If a shy guy likes you, he might not be able to walk right up to you and start a conversation. Instead, he might only be able to say hello. If he waves at you, nods, or musters a quiet "hi" (especially if he's not doing this for other people), he might have the hots for you., Fortunately for shy guys, talking in person isn't the only way to communicate. If he tries to communicate with you on social media (or by text message, email, or paper notes), even if he doesn't talk with you much in person, it could be a good sign., If you are standing around with a group of friends and this shy guy walks up and starts talking to them, it could actually be a good sign. It is possible that he is just working up the courage to talk to you by talking to you friends., When he does try to talk to you (or ask you out), pay full attention to him. It might be very difficult for him to start interacting with you one-on-one, so try to be patient and focused for him! Remember: if he is awkward it probably just means he is nervous.You show you are paying attention to him by:

Nodding when he speaks.
Maintaining eye contact.
Providing verbal cues (things like "sure," "yeah," "totally").
Responding when it's your turn to speak.
Avoiding looking at your phone.

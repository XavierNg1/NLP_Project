 Decide which flower you're going to make, either the daisy or the poppy:







Daisy: Cut each cup into "equal eighths" to make the petals. Cut the end of each petal with shears to make an edge.

Poppy: Don't cut. Simply cutting away the plastic egg holder from the egg carton will allow this piece to open up enough to appear like the flower already.;
, Once you've made the hole, push the toothpick through the pinhole. This forms both the stem of the flower and provides the holding piece for when shaping the petals with heat., Also remove anything that is flammable away from the workspace area, then light the candle. Working carefully over the candle, start to shape the form of each flower that you're creating, using the candle heat to melt the petals into an appropriate form. Don't actually touch the flame or the plastic will burn â€“ just aim the flower close enough for the heat to melt it. The following photos show a range of petal possibilities created just by moving the flower piece carefully over the candle flame:






























, This tape is to prevent the stem from being spray-painted in the next step.

 Using the spray paint in the color of your choice, gently spray each flower all over. Again, ensure that this is done in a well-ventilated space and be sure to cover the workspace adequately to prevent possible staining.,, Dab a small amount of paint into the center of the flower and the results should look as follows:







The daisy center.






The poppy center.
 The flowers are now ready to be used as wished.

 If you have a smart cover for the device or some other wireless keyboard connected to the Surface, the charms menu can be obtained by pressing âŠž Win+C. If you don't swipe in from the right side of the screen to obtain your bar.

,,, There are only a small handful of programs that can receive these screenshots. You won't need to be signed in at first to the service, but it's better to be signed in when creating the screenshot.


Just a few of the items include such popular software titles that can obtain screenshots as the Windows 8.1 Native Mail app, Facebook, Twitter and Skitch Touch. For the full list of programs you have on your account that can receive screenshots from the device, you can see this list in your Microsoft Surface's Microsoft account settings.
Authorize whatever apps to your accounts as each program needs in whatever format it requires, if asked to do so. Realize that if you aren't signed in at first when you go to take the screenshot, and you go to send the screenshot, you'll have to go back and have it take another one and that you'll need to re-open the process from opening the Share charm again.

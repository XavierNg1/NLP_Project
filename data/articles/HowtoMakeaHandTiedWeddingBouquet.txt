 Suitable foliage includes camellia leaves, eucalyptus gum, box, ivy, nandina and leather fern.


A mixed bouquet looks best when there are three or four varieties of flowers plus foliage.;
, Remove the thorns and strip off the lower foliage from the bottom half of the stems.

Hold the stem between the thumb and first finger on the left hand about 15-20cm (6-8") from the base of the flower head.
With the right hand, add about 4- 6 clusters of foliage evenly around and just below the flower heads to fill the spaces between them. Criss crossing the stems on an angle and turn the bouquet in your hand as you lay in the foliage.
Secure the stems in position by placing the end of a piece of string or florist tape and wind it around a couple of times. Do not cut the string or tape yet.
 Turn the bouquet in one direction and secure all the stems in place with a couple of twists of string or tape as before.
 Keep the bouquet a gentle rounded shape across the top like an upside down saucer. Criss cross all the stems and give the bouquet a quarter turn as you add more blossoms. Secure stems in position with string in the same place as before when necessary.
 You could add wired camellia leaves around the edges, or use pieces of foliage having the tips extend out about 5-7.5cm (2-3") past the edges of the flowers. Secure all the stems together with string winding it firmly around several times in the same place as before, cut the string and tuck the end in.

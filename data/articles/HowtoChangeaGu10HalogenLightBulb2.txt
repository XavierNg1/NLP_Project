 Remember, the electricity being off is important for safety.
 There should be two plug bits on this ring if it is a specific type of halogen bulb. Squeeze them together and the ring will fall out.


Use a ladder or chair if your light fixture is too high up for you to reach. Make sure you can comfortably move your arms about as this task will require some dexterity.
 You will want to push a good inch and a half of the straw up into the gap. You will then want to take the straw and move it around the circumference of the light bulb. You may need to do this a couple of times. For best results, treat the straw like an old fashion can opener by working all the way around the edge of the circle multiple times. You need to do this because a clip holds the wires that hold the bulb into place in the top of the light fixture. The straw causes the clip to release the wires which allows you to grip the bulb. Remember, this isn’t the case for every single GU10 Halogen lightbulb. However, if you are having troubles using your hands this could be a good solution.
 This is not as easy as it should be. The bulb's end is a white plug shaped mechanism. You will need to grab the socket in one hand and the bulb in the other. Then push the bulb (gently!) into the socket and turn counter-clockwise. Use the same techniques that you would use to open a child locked medicine bottle. , There isn't a visible difference between a good bulb and a burned out bulb. Don't risk confusing the two.
 See those little holes in the middle? There are four of them. You want to line the new bulb's plug so that it fits into the larger holes. Then you turn it clockwise until you feel it "snap" into place. , As you do this, work the bulb back into the fixture.
 All you will have to do is push it back in on top of the light, just like the way it was before. After that, everything should be as good as new and you’ll be able to use your lights again.

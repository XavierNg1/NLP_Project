 Even if you're not that great of an artist, people like avatar art. Go to the forum section. Go to Gaia gaming > Minishops > Art shops. Or, go to chatterbox if you want gold then and now., Look at pricing too. A very simple basic sketch can cost from 250mill - 3 bill, depending on the skill. Don't overprice your art just because you want something that's overpriced!, If they decline the trade or just refuse to pay you, you can file a complaint about scamming and get your gold back and possibly a ban on the account., The kinder you are to customers, the more likely they'll refer their friends to your art shop. A reputation as an artist is very important!

 The strength and simplicity of the metric system stem from the fact that the units are based on multiples of 10. Therefore, converting from one unit to another is simply a matter of moving the decimal point the correct number of spaces. To use this shortcut tool, you need to know the exponent measures of the units involved.The meter is the basic unit of length measurement in the metric system. Written as a base 10 exponent, 1 m=100 m{\displaystyle 1{\text{ m}}=10^{0}{\text{ m}}}.

The nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. Written as a base 10 exponent, 1 nm=10−9 m{\displaystyle 1{\text{ nm}}=10^{-9}{\text{ m}}}.
 For moving decimal places, “LARS” is a handy memory device. It stands for “Left-Add, Right-Subtract.” This tells you what to do with the decimal point if you wish to either add or subtract to change exponents. If you want to convert your measurement from a small exponent to a larger one, you will be adding units to the exponent, and for each one addition to the exponent, you will move the decimal point one space to the left. Moving from a larger unit of measure to a smaller, you will be subtracting exponents, which will involve moving the decimal point to the right.For example, consider converting kilometers to meters. A kilometer is 103{\displaystyle 10^{3}} meters, but the single meter is 100{\displaystyle 10^{0}}. Thus, you want to subtract 3 in the exponent, so you will move the decimal to the right three places ("Left-Add, RIGHT-SUBTRACT"). Therefore, if you begin with a measure of 1.234 km, you would make the following change to meters:

1.234 km ............(original unit)

12.34 .................(move decimal one space right)

123.4..................(move decimal two spaces right)

1,234 m..................(move decimal three spaces right)




, To convert from nanometers, which are units of 10-9 m, into meters, which are units of 100 m, you are moving from -9 to 0. This requires you to add 9. According to the LARS mnemonic, adding 9 units in the exponent means moving the decimal place 9 spaces to the left (“Left-Add”)., For this example, suppose you have the measurement of a germ at 2,600 nm. You need to move the decimal point 9 spaces to the left. Since this is a whole number with no decimal point showing, you can insert the decimal at the end of the number and then count the spaces to move it. When you run out of numbers, you will fill in all remaining spaces with zeroes.Write 2,600 nm as “2,600. nm” with a decimal point. Then move the decimal as follows:

260.0………. (one space left)

26.00……….(two spaces left)

2.600……….(three spaces left)

.2600……….(four spaces left)

.02600………(five spaces left)

.002600…….(six spaces left)

.0002600……(seven spaces left)

.00002600…..(eight spaces left)

.000002600…..(nine spaces left)

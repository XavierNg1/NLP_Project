 One meter is a length measurement, equal to 3.28 feet.You can test this using a meter stick and 1 foot (12 inch) rulers. Lay the meter stick on the ground, and place the rulers end-to-end next to it. Three rulers (3 feet) will almost be as long as the meter stick. If you add a fourth ruler, you'll be able to measure that extra distance: 0.28 ft, which is a little more than three inches.


If you need to be super precise, you can use 1 meter = 3.28084 feet. Because this is extremely close to 3.28 feet, though, you'll almost always want to use the simpler number to make the math easier.
 Since one meter = 3.28 feet, you can convert any meter measurement into feet by multiplying it by 3.28. If you're not sure how to do this, read about multiplying decimals. Here are some examples. If you want, you can try to do the multiplication on your own and see if you get the right answer:


1 meter x 3.28 = 3.28 feet

5 meters x 3.28 = 16.4 feet

2.7 meters x 3.28 = 8.856 feet


, For most math problems, all you need is the answer you got in the last step. But if you are curious how long something is, an answer like "8.856 feet" might not mean much to you. Try taking the decimal point and everything after it, then multiplying that by 12 to turn it into inches. This works because 1 foot = 12 inches. It's a conversion just like the one we used for meters and feet. Here are some examples:


3.28 feet = 3 feet + 0.28 feet. Because 0.28 feet x 12 = 3.36, that means 3.28 feet = 3 feet and 3.36 inches

16.4 feet = 16 feet + 0.4 feet. Because 0.4 feet x 12 = 4.8, that means 16.4 feet = 16 feet and 4.8 inches

8.856 feet = 8 feet + 0.856 feet. Because 0.856 feet x 12 = 10.272, so 8.856 feet = 10 feet and 10.272 inches

 When you get your pet home, place it in its proper cage or area and let it get used to its surroundings. For reptiles and small animals, put them in their cage and let them have some time to themselves to explore their new house. For dogs or cats, let them roam around your house and get used to the unfamiliar area (or at least a pet-proofed portion of it).;
, After a while, let the animal get used to your presence. Walk by cage slowly and quietly to show your reptile or small animal that you're not a threat. Spend a little time in the same room as your cat or dog.
 Like they say, the best way to an animal's heart is through its stomach. Hand-feeding your reptile or small animal establishes a form of trust between you. Show your cat or dog that you are the one preparing and providing its food.
 Stroke your lizard's head or your small animal's body gently and slowly. This shows that you mean no harm. Pet your cat or dog's body, or any other place they like to be pet. It's not a good idea to pet a dog on the head, as this is considered a threat to them if they don't know you well and haven't learned your body language.
 Fully support their body and sit in a chair or anywhere comfortable. Walking around with them will mostly likely make them nervous. Let your cat relax next to you or walk your dog.
 It will help establish a strong bond.

 Your ear warmer should be a fashionable accessory that works with the rest of your clothes. When choosing an ear warmer to wear, select one that will match the colors you're wearing. While picking the same colors works, it's not the only way to coordinate your colors. Make sure that your ear warmer and clothes stay within the same family of tones. If you wear earth tones, make sure that your ear warmer is also earth toned.
If you like loud and fluorescent colors, make sure that you get an ear warmer that matches it.
Families of color include pastels, earth tones, or jeweled tones.
Another easy way to coordinate your colors is to look at a color wheel and find a complimentary color, or a color that lies as a direct opposite on the wheel.

Opposites on the color wheel include greens and pinks, yellows and violets, and reds and blues.

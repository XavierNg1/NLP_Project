 Although doctors mainly depend on family and medical history to diagnosis hand pain, they also use physical examination to identify contributing factors.


The doctor can analyze the degree of damage and motion loss, and use other tests to create a diagnosis.
These diagnostic tools may include an X-Ray, magnetic resonance imaging “MRI”, or other blood tests that measure the Rheumatoid Factor “RF”, as well as other antibodies found in the circulation as a result of autoimmune disease.
 Inflammation of the joint and the soft tissues during arthritis causes irritation and soreness of the soft tissues that are indicators of arthritis.


This is accompanied by fluid that escapes the joints and causes localized edema and swelling.
 Pain in the joint due to the inflammation process and accumulated fluids puts pressure on the nerves in the soft tissues, and indicates arthritis.


This causes intervals of pain that can be sharp, especially when moving the joint.
It can also cause dull pain, especially when you are resting.
 Motion limitation can result from stiffness, due to cracking of the joint cartilage during arthritis.


Because of the loss of the synovial fluid, joints are not smooth you may experience chronic stiffness.
This may be most obvious in the morning, and gradually dissipate during the daytime.

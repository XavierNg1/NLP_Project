 Eating a lot of food at once causes stress on your stomach that may be causing stomach pain for you. To reduce this stress, try eating small frequent meals spaced throughout the day.For example, instead of having a big lunch, try breaking your normal lunch into two separate meals. Have one at 12pm and the other at 3pm. You can do the same with your breakfast and dinner as well. Try to eat a small 200 â€“ 300 calorie meal about once every three hours during the day.
 Eating too close to bedtime may be putting pressure on your stomach as you try to sleep. To eliminate this potential cause of stomach pain, stop eating about two to three hours before bedtime.If you are used to having a bedtime snack, try having a cup of herbal tea about an hour before bed to help you relax.
 Eating your food in a hurry can put extra pressure on your stomach as well. To eliminate this potential cause of stomach pain, try to take your time when you are eating your meal. Chew slowly and pay close attention to what you are eating.Try putting your fork down in between bites or take a sip of water after every few bites.

,, It's better to be 'alone' in the picture. People want to know who YOU are, not your friends.
 Or a headshot versus a body shot. Is that picture of you or your back yard? Again, limiting the distractions is a good thing.
 (You flipping off the camera because you are nervous isn't as funny as you think it is).
 Like garish clothing, hats, sunglasses, etc.


Photos that represent the 'real you' can wait until people get to know you.
 You don't have to have the serious, pouty look of someone modeling for a magazine.
 That glow from your monitor does nothing for your coloring.

 Make sure you know which model iPad you are using, since they have different types of ports (places to attach cables and other devices).


If you using a first, second, or third generation iPad, you'll need an iPad Camera Connector. (This is included in the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit.)
If you are using a fourth generation or later iPad, you'll need a Lightning to USB Camera Adapter.
 Make sure the camera is on and set to the correct mode for exporting images. A list of the camera's photos should soon display on your iPad.
 You can select Import All to transfer the whole camera's contents.


Most cameras will prompt you to "Keep" or "Delete" the photos on your camera. If you select Delete, the imported photos will be removed from the camera or SD card.

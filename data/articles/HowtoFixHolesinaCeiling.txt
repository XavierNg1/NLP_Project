 Many brands of spackle or putty come premixed in disposable containers, and can just be opened and used. Drywall compounds are also available that can be mixed in a small, disposable cup.;
, Strip away any old paint or loose and flaking spots of drywall. If the hole was created by a screw or other attachment that affixed something to the ceiling, make sure all of the attachment pieces have been removed from the area, including inside the hole.



If the hole is larger than half an inch, use an adhesive mesh tape on the hole. Scrape the area around the ceiling hole, and apply the tape in strips that run at least 1 inch (2.5Â cm) past the hole before preparing the area for spackling.
 Make sure the ceiling hole is wet, but not dripping. This will ensure the drywall spackle can easily attach to the hole, and stay in place.
 Use a putty knife to press the spackle inside and around the hole. Smooth the putty over and beyond the hole. The spackled area should be at least twice the size of the hole. Continue to spread the spackle over the hole until a flat surface has been created that is consistent with the ceiling.
 Leave the area open and untouched overnight to dry thoroughly.
 Rub a piece of sandpaper over the hole several times, applying pressure on the spackled area until the spot is level with the ceiling.

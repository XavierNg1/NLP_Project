 You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the chain around your neck and adding an inch. When youâ€™ve got the right measurement, cut the chain. Then cut another chain which is longer than the first.
 Use a jump ring to link together one end of each chain and a lobster clasp. Close the jump ring with a pair of needle-nose pliers.









Jewelry-making supplies like lobster clasps and jump rings can be purchased online or from craft stores, or you can recycle them from old jewelry., Thread both chains through the loop on the pendant. If the loop is not big enough, attach a jump ring to it and thread the chains through that so the pendant can slide easily.
 Fasten the smaller of the two chains around your neck using the lobster clasp. Using a mirror, adjust the length of the second chain until it hangs the way you want it to. Cut it to that length, and attach it to the first chain with a jump ring.

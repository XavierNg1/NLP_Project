 Do not put more than three strings of mini-lights end-to-end.;
, These are three (or more) outlets on a stake that you push into the ground. Some models have timers which can be set for a period of hours or from dawn to dusk. This is useful with Christmas lights. Assuming you have two outdoor electrical outlets, plug a power stake into each one. That gives you a total of six outlets.
 Each outlet should have a maximum of three strings plugged end to end. Six outlets accommodate a total of eighteen strings.
 The key is to never plug more than three strings of min-lights together.

 The cherry treeâ€™s leaves are toothed. They are oval shaped, and they have a point at the tip.There are serrated margins on the leaves. The leaves are 2 to 5 inches long. Most cherry trees have large, shiny green leaves arranged alternately on branches. The bottom leaves are usually medium green. Up higher, the leaves turn paler yellow.
In the fall, cherry tree leaves turn yellow with a hint of red. Cherry trees are deciduous, so they lose their leaves in the fall.
 The cherry tree's bark is commonly brown, gray, or a shade in between. The bark of a cherry tree has what are called horizontal lenticels. These are marks in the bark that look like small cuts that are darker or lighter than the rest of the bark.In some cherry trees, the bark peels back in places. Underneath it, you can spot a darker mahogany color.
Cherry tree bark is not shaggy, but very hard, making it useful as building material. The bark is softer toward the top of the tree.
 Mature cherry trees take on an umbrella shape. The branches are "spreading," meaning the top of the tree looks wider than the bottom. In contrast, plum trees look round or oval, and pear trees look oval or teardrop-shaped., Fruit trees are often grafted so they will produce fruit. On cherry trees, you'll find the graft placed on the trunk, near where the first branches emerge. Other fruit trees usually have grafts on the branches, making them look knotty.

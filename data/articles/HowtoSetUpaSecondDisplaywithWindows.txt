 You can use a computer monitor, TV, or projector as your second display. Plug it to a power source and turn it on.;
, Your second display will only work if it has a DVI, VGA, or HDMI port. Check the back of the unit to see if it has one of these. Your PC or laptop should also have these ports available to connect them.
 Get the appropriate cable and connect the ports of your second display and your PC or laptop. Both ports should match and be compatible with the cable; otherwise, they won’t connect. A DVI cable head has a wide opening with pins inside. An HDMI cable head has a thin opening, which looks like a USB head. A VGA cable head has box-like opening with pins inside. Make sure the connection is firm and secure to avoid disconnections and interruptions when using the second display., Windows will automatically detect the second display connected to its port.
 You can use the second display in different ways. You can duplicate the contents of your PC or laptop screen, extend the screen, or project the screen through the projector. You can do this in two ways:


To quickly select the display, press the Windows logo and “P” keys on your keyboard to bring out these options. A box will appear on your screen. Click the option you prefer.
To manage the display from the Screen Resolution screen, right-click on your desktop to bring out the context menu and select “Screen resolution.” The Screen Resolution configuration from the Control Panel will be brought out. Find the “Multiple displays” option and click the drop-down list of options, which includes “Duplication,” “Extension,” and “Selection” of monitor. Select the option you prefer by clicking on it.
 Once properly configured, click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the menu. You can now use your second display and enjoy a larger or extended screen for work or play, or project your screen to a bigger audience in meetings or lectures.

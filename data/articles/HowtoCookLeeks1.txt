 When you're shopping at your local farmer's market or in the produce aisle of your grocery store, you should look for leeks that are firm, white, and unblemished, with tops that are evenly green, without any bruises or blemishes. Purchase only as many leeks as you need, because leeks will keep in the refrigerator for only a few days.








Leeks with a diameter of 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) or less will be more tender, and larger leeks tend to be tough.
Choose leeks of similar sizes to ensure even cooking.;
, To cut the leeks, cut the roots from the bottom of the leeks and then remove the leafy tops where the firm, white part of the leeks starts to turn green.
 Separate the sections of the leeks as you're rinsing them to wash off any dirt that is trapped in the leeks.

 This method only works if you know that player’s username for NFSW.
 You can launch the game from the Start menu or desktop, if you created a shortcut there during setup.
 Enter your username and password into the fields provided, and click “Sign in.”


After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to start. This will load and display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 Alternatively, to display the screen, you can click the “Friends” button at the top of the NFS World screen.
 This will produce a dialog box where you can type in your friend’s username.
 Type in the friend’s name on the text field, and click “Send.” You will receive a notification that a friend request has been sent to the driver. Wait for them to respond to it.


When and if the player accepts your friend request, you will receive a notification on the Requests tab on the Social screen.
The driver you added will then be included on your NFSW Friends List (viewable by clicking the Friends tab on the Social screen).

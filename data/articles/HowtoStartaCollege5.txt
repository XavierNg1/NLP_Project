Offer admissions and financial assistance information. You might wish to offer a scholarship to entice people to apply. Be sure that such an offer fits within your budget.
Hold information sessions and events to draw interest.
Advertise online and offline through newspapers, magazines, posts, blogs and flyers. The scope of your advertising is dependent on your budget.

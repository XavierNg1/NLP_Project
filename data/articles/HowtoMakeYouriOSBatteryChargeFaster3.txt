 The more apps you have installed on your iOS device, the more power is consumed. Apps tend to drain the power of your Apple device even when not in use due to some background process they need to run, in order to function properly.


Press and hold the home screen of your iOS device to enter the “jiggly” state. Tap the “x” close button on the upper right corners of applications that you don’t need to uninstall it permanently from your unit. This should allow your battery to absorb power quicker during charging.
 Bright screens consume a hefty amount of your device’s battery power. Even if you’re not using it, just simply lighting up the screen of your iPhone to check for text messages consumes considerable amount of battery power.


Tap the Settings app icon from the home screen of your device, scroll down the Settings menu, and tap “Brightness” from the list. Tap the slider at the top of the screen, and move it to the left to decrease the brightness of your screen.
 If there’s no need to use your device while charging, you can simply switch it off. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the top side of your iOS device to turn it off. Charging your phone while it’s switched off speeds up your charging time by up to 20 percent.

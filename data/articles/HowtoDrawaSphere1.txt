 This is a basic method for drawing a sphere, so minimal materials are needed.Sketch pad or paper
Pencil
Cotton balls or tissues
Circular object;
, You can use a small bowl, a glass, a mug, or another object with a circular shape or base.Tracing the circular object allows you to focus on shading the sphere rather than on learning how to draw a perfect circle.
 Once you decide the angle from which your light source will come, draw an arrow toward the circle from that direction.


You will later leave an untouched spot on the sphere, below that arrow, to signify the highlight from the light source.
 You will add additional layers of darker shading in later steps.


Leave the circular or oval-shaped spot untouched, below where the arrow points from the direction of the light source.
 Gently rub over the light shading, taking care not to smear the graphite out of the edges of your circle.Remember to leave your highlight spot untouched, so also take care not to smear graphite into that area.



This shading is called the mid-tone. Around the middle of your sphere, you should have about medium tones of shading.
 Again, take care to avoid smearing the highlight spot and smearing outside the edges of the circle.,


As you get further from the light source, the shading should get darker. However, they should not be as dark at the space directly below the sphere.
 Use your cotton ball or tissue to do this.



Shade the border moderately dark, and taper it into a crescent shape before tapering off on the other side. Keep this darkest area of shading close to the bottom edge of the sphere; it should be no more than Â½ centimeter in thickness.
, You might also have stray line marks that went outside the edges. Take care not to erase anything within your sphere.

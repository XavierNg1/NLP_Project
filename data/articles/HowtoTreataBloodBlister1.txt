 Start by eliminating any pressure and exposing the blister to the air. You want to make sure nothing rubs against it, or presses down on it. Exposing it to the air allows it to start healing naturally. If it is not under any pressure, it will stay intact and the chances of it tearing or bursting and becoming infected are lessened., Ice packs can be applied to the area for 10 to 30 minutes at a time.You can do this to reduce the pain and to cool it if it is warm and throbbing. Icing the blister can be done regularly too, not just immediately after the injury.


Don't place ice directly on the skin, since this can cause a cold burn. Instead, place a towel between the ice and the skin to protect the injured area.Gently applying Aloe vera gel to the blood blister can ease pain and swelling., It may be enticing, but popping the blister can lead to infection and delay the body's natural healing process. If the blood blister is in a place that normally gets pressure, try not to put extended pressure on it.

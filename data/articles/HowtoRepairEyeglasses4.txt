 Eyeglass repair kits are readily available at drugstores and contain everything you need to make a repair--screws, a tiny screwdriver and sometimes a magnifying glass. A newer version of the kit contains longer screws meant to be easier to handle. You insert the screws into the hinges, screw them in and then "snap off" the bottom of the screw to fit the size of the hinge.


If you're finding it difficult to line up the hinges on your temple piece and front piece, it could because a hinge mechanism inside the temple piece hinge is holding it back. To correct this, use the hook end of a paper clip, insert it through the temple hinge hole and gently pull it out. To keep the hinge hole in place, insert a second paperclip upright and into the "gap" created when you pulled out the hinge hole. Line up the front piece and temple piece holes and insert and tighten the screw. When you're finished, remove the paperclip from the gap and the hinge hole will slide back into place creating a firm fit for your glasses. , When a screw falls out of the hinge that holds the front and temple pieces of your glasses together, use a toothpick to temporarily take the place of the screw. Line up the temple hinge holes with the front holes and push a wooden toothpick through them as far as it will go. Break or clip off the excess.
 Strip the paper off of a twist tie (the kind that come on a bag of bread). Line up the hinge holes and thread the twist-tie wire through them. Twist the wire in place until the temple feels secure. Cut off the edges of the wire so you don't get scratched. You can also use a small safety pin (the ones that are sometimes used with clothing price tags). Insert the pin through the holes to hold the side in place.

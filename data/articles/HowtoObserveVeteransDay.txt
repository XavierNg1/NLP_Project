 Hang the American flag to show your patriotism. Many people will remember veterans who served in war by seeing the flag swaying in the breeze.;
, Remember that they fought for your freedom and are the reason you are here today. Thank them for serving the country.
 You may want to submit a letter to the editor, or even write a poem and submit it to a contest about why you love your country, and what freedom means to you.
 You could do it with your own family, or you could invite the whole community with all the veterans.
 It can be something as small as setting aside five minutes. Just take a moment to appreciate what veterans have done for us in all of the wars our country has had.
 A poppy is a special symbol for veterans.

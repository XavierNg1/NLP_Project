 Right-click on the image and select Image, then Transform, then either Flip Horizontally or Flip Vertically. Alternatively, you can click the Flip icon in the Toolbox. Under Tool Options, you can choose whether to flip horizontally or vertically.
 To perform basic image rotations, right-click the image and select Image, then Transform, then select whether you want to rotate 90° clockwise, counterclockwise, or 180°.
 If you’d rather rotate the image at a custom angle, right-click the image, then select Tools, transform Tools, then Rotate. This will open the Rotate tool, where you can set the angle of rotation either with the slider or by entering a number. You can also move the center point of the rotation by entering the coordinates or dragging the circle in the picture.

 Lots of communities have mommy groups that hold regular get-togethers. Your children will be the same ages, and you can share advice and stories about raising your kids. You may be able to find a mommy group through your hospital or pediatrician, church, library, community organization or local university., Introduce yourself to parents at the park, playground, dance class, and soccer practice. In order to keep yourself from being isolated, you will need to find other parents with schedules like yours. You can still connect with your working friends, but they won’t likely be available on weekday mornings. Having other stay-at-home parents in your circle of friends will help keep you in a social network.
 When you find other families with young children, schedule playdates. Invite the other parent and child to your house. Once you get to know each other, you might find yourself scheduling a weekly playdate. You might even be able to trade off childcare.
 Find a nonprofit organization or other charitable cause whose mission you support. Schedule regular volunteering at this place. It might be an animal shelter, an arts organization, a nature conservancy or other organization. This will help you connect with others who have like-minded interests as well.


You may choose to volunteer at places that are child-friendly. This can be a great experience for children to learn about giving back to the community and helping others.
You might also want to volunteer at your child’s school.
 You might also find it useful to have a community of friends online. You might not always be able to see each other in person, especially when one kid has the flu or another kid is taking a nap. But staying in touch online can give you another social outlet to share stories and solicit advice.

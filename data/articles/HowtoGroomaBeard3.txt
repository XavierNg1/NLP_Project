 After applying beard oil, use a quality comb or brush to distribute it evenly throughout your beard. Comb gently to style your beard into place. Daily brushing keeps your beard looking neat and also helps to train the hairs to stay down. Don’t forget to use a comb for your mustache, as well.


If needed, use a small amount of medium-hold wax to keep your mustache in place.Use a soft-hold balm or pomade if you want to sculpt your beard shape further.
 If you’re using styling products like balm or pomade, apply these when your beard is still damp, then blow dry it into place. For additional volume, angle the blow dryer under your neck and direct the air upward.


Once your beard is fully dry, angle the blow dryer downward to set the hair into its final place.
Finish up by gently combing through to get rid of tangles. Then use a boar bristle brush to make sure everything is in place.

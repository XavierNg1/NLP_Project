 Lightly pat them down with a cloth or paper towel. Always clean "dirty looking stained" ones under cold running water and lightly dry them with a paper towel.;
, There's two methods of doing so:


Place the mushrooms in a large freezer bag or container. Add about 3 ounces to 1 pound mushrooms. Coat thoroughly; avoid soaking.
Use a glazing brush to brush on extra virgin olive oil.
 Large cap mushrooms, such as Portabella, can easily be grilled on top of the grill. For smaller mushrooms, such as shiitake, there are lots of methods to use:



Skewer them onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers. Make sure the mushrooms are all the same size to get the best results of cooking.
Use grilling baskets. Grilling baskets allow mushrooms of any size to cook thoroughly and it's simple to remove the basket as a whole from the grill. This method also prevents mushrooms from slipping through the grill grates.
Create a foil basket to saut√© them. Cut out a good size of foil (6 to 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters) and lift the sides. Crumble up the tops and place the seasoned mushrooms inside.
 Cook them for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on size. Turn them frequently to cook all sides. To avoid sticking, be sure to brush them lightly with olive oil while grilling. Remove from the grill when the mushrooms are light golden brown.

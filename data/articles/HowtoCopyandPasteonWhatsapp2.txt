 The WhatsApp icon looks like a green box with a white speech balloon and a telephone in it.
 This will open the conversation in full screen.
 This will highlight the chat.
 This button looks like an upright rectangle with another rectangle behind it. It's located in the upper-right corner of your screen, and it's the second button from the right on the toolbar next to the Forward button. Tapping on it will copy the highlighted chat to your clipboard.
 You will see a pop-up option to Paste.
 This will paste the copied chat into the text field.


If you copy more than one line of chat at once, you will also paste the timestamp for each chat when you tap the Paste button. If this is the case, you can remove the timestamps manually in the text field.
 This button looks like a tiny paper plane icon to the right of your message. Tapping on it will send the copied chat to your friend.

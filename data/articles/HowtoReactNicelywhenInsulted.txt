 This is the situation:


Bully: You are so freaking ugly.
You: Really, because that isn't what people usually tell me. Thank you for making me more aware of my surroundings.

Hopefully, the bully or whoever it is will just walk away. Or maybe they think they are tougher than you so they say another insult. Such as:


Bully: Nerd.
You: Thanks.
Bully: You are such a freak.
You: *laughs creepily*;
, Bullies insult you to get you upset and see you go crazy, but if you're happy about it or just don't care, what's the point, right? They have no motive. If they see you're not bothered by it, even enjoying it, they'll leave you alone. It's not fun for them anymore.
 Just ignore everything they do and say and walk away. This will show that you couldn't care less about their opinion of you. All they want is a reaction, so don't give them one.
 Politely tell them that you don't mind their comments, but never resort to violence in return. This makes you look as insecure as the bully is.
 This will scare the bully because you told someone more powerful than they are. Tell someone they know not to disrespect. Also, by telling a trusted adult you are calmly showing the bully that although it's not bothering you, you know it's wrong and you're not afraid to do something about it. What bullies call "Tattle-telling" will make you look strong, not weak.
 The bully is thirsty for a reaction, they want entertainment. If an audience is there that's even better. By not giving them a show you are not letting them win.

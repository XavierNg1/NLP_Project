You’ll only be deactivating your account for this particular team. If you are a member of another Slack team, you can still sign in with your account for that team.
 This is for security purposes. Type the password you used to access this account and tap Confirm Password to continue. Another confirmation screen will appear., You have now removed your account from this team.

You can be added back to the team in the future by contacting a Team Administrator.

 The main ingredient in a lye relaxer is sodium hydroxide. This type of relaxer is ideal for super curly or coily hair, as it will act on the hair quickly and have a dramatic relaxing effect. It can also be very harsh on your scalp so exercise caution when using this type of relaxer on your hair. Avoid leaving it on for too long, as doing so could damage your hair.A lye relaxer will still be harsh, but relatively gentler on your hair than other types of relaxers. The hair absorbs and retains moisture more effectively when you use a lye relaxer, thus reducing breakage and making hair stronger.
 Lye relaxers are often sold in a large tub for commercial or professional use. The active ingredient also works very quickly so it may be in your best interest to enlist the help of a professional. Someone who is trained in using hair relaxers professionally will be able to help you work quickly, protect your scalp, and get the most effective results., When purchasing a lye relaxer, it is most likely going to have a higher pH level than other types of relaxers. A higher pH level means that the formulation is stronger, which is why lye relaxers are generally reserved for professionals. Lye-based relaxers will also rinse off without leaving a residue, unlike no-lye relaxers, which means that they can leave the strands of hair less damaged, healthier, and shinier.

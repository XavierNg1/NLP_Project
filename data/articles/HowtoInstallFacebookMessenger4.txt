 You can use the Messenger website to access your messages from any computer.


The messenger.com website is the only way to access Messenger from a computer. Do not download any Messenger programs created by other people, as these are unofficial and put your account at risk.
 If you're already logged into Facebook in the same browser session, you'll see the "Continue as Your Name" button instead. Click "Switch Account" if you want to log in with a different Facebook account.
 You can do pretty much everything you can do in the mobile apps on the website as well. Your conversations will be listed on the left side of the screen. Clicking one will fill the center frame with it, and you'll see contact details on the right.

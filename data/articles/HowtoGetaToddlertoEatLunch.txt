 This way, announcing it is time for lunch won't come as a complete surprise.;
, When lunchtime has come, cheerfully declare that it is time to eat. Make sure to sound excited, as this will decrease the likelihood of a fight from your child.
 Give choices ("Would you like applesauce or yogurt?") to make him or her feel more involved and in control of the process. Don't make anything that takes too long to prepare, as a child's patience is limited.
 Count how many strawberries your child has on his or her plate or how many green items are being served. Ask questions involving the child's favorite people or characters ("Does Spiderman like eating sandwiches as much as you do?")

, Put a little on their plate and eat some yourself. After they've seen it a few times (or several times), they'll try it.
 Give them a washcloth to wipe down the table, or have them throw their napkin away. This will benefit the child's self-esteem and help you in the process!

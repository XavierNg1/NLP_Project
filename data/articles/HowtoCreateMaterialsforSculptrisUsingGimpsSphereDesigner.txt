 Ctrl N or File >> New... Make it square. 640 X 640 is a good size. If you want, you can make the background a pretty bright color using the bucket fill. This will make it easier to separate the sphere from the background later.;
,, Make your changes and play around. Once complete, click on OK. Note, in this sphere, there is a small area around it. You will need to get rid of that for the sphere to work properly in Sculptris.
 Then click on Select >> Invert.
 Shrink down the selection. 10 is a good amount.
 This will get rid of the extra.

 Stalkers may create a fake account impersonating someone else in hopes of getting close to you. If you get a new friend or follow request, don’t accept it. Delete it or do not click on it. Don’t message them and say, “Who is this?” or, “Do I know you?” as this can open lines of communication with someone who might be your stalker.Let your friends know about your stalker and that they might reach out to them to get to you.
 If you know the person who is stalking you, ask them to stop. Request one time in writing for them to stop their behavior, then do not interact or speak to them again. Save any correspondence in digital and hard-copy forms.For example, say, “I don’t like the messages and comments you send me. I am asking you to stop. Thank you.”

, Don’t interact in any way with your stalker. Whether you know them in your everyday life or you only know of their internet activity, stay away. They might try to escalate the situation or say things they know will upset you or intrigue you in order to get you to respond or write back. Don’t take the bait.Do, however, keep a written record of anything they have sent you, including texts, messages, pictures, threats, etc.
 If you know there's a stalker viewing your accounts, and you're aware of the stalker's account(s), block them! The block feature on every site is different, so you may not be able to hide everything, but it can do something to stave them off.Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, Youtube, Instagram all have options to completely block a person or a profile.
If they create new accounts, block those, too.
 Some social media accounts have a messaging feature, and strangers can use this to contact you. You can turn off messaging applications and block people you are not connected with. This means that even if they create alternate profiles they still cannot contact you.

For example, Facebook has a feature in which people who are not friends cannot message you or send you a friend request.

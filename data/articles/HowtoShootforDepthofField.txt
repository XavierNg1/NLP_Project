 You will always have some type of DOF in your shots so make it work for you, not against you.;
, That is the quickest and easiest way to get the right depth of field.



Aperture






A smaller aperture (F/22) will increase the DOF and a larger aperture {F2) will decrease the DOF.

One way to make sense of the 'aperture dilemma' is to put it into a fraction. One half (F2) is going to be much larger than one twenty-second (F22).




Focal Length






Shorter focal length (50mm) will increase the depth of field and longer focal length (200mm) will decrease it.

Note: The lens lengths are given as examples and not what would define the focal lengths.




Focusing distance






Greater focusing distances (shooting further away from you) increase depth of field ), while shorter focusing distances (shooting closely, like in macro) decrease it.
 Set the focusing ringâ€™s infinity mark (sideways 8) opposite of the selected aperture mark on the depth-of-field scale. The depth of field will then run from half the focused distance to infinity.
 Some cameras come with the ability to preview your image and showing your DOF. Take advantage of it, if you have it.

 If the merchant charged you for an item you did not purchase or charged you more for an item than you agreed to, then try to find your receipt for the date on which the charge was made.


You can also dispute a charge if you have a complaint about the quality of goods or services that you received. Technically, this is not a “billing complaint.”Nevertheless, you may request a “charge back” from the credit card company.A “chargeback” is effectively a refund.
To request a chargeback for goods or services, you must have spent more than $50 and the purchase must have been in your home state or within 100 miles of your home., After you realize that the charge has been caused by a merchant’s error, you can contact the merchant immediately to inform them of the mistake.Although you are not required to contact the merchant, merchants will often fix the transaction by issuing an appropriate refund., Always try to remain calm when disputing a transaction charge. Never raise your voice.While some errors are easily resolvable, others may require some additional investigation.
 If you are unable to reach an immediate resolution with the merchant, then you should immediately contact the credit card issuer by calling the phone number on the back of the card or on your billing statement.Don’t wait too long for the merchant to issue a refund. If the refund isn’t immediate, then move on to your credit card company.
Once contacted, your credit card company will contact the merchant on your behalf in order to reach a resolution., You should follow up your phone call with the credit card company by writing a letter. If you are challenging the quality of goods or services, then you should make sure that your letter includes:the request for a chargeback
your account number
the specific amount on the statement that you decline to pay
the steps you have already taken to try and settle the dispute

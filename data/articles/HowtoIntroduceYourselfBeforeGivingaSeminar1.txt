 Time allocation should conjure up images of Goldilocks. It has to be just right. Too long and you waste the audience's time. Too short and the audience is disoriented. In general your introduction should be under 30 seconds.


This is not a time to rattle off your entire resume. Or regale people about your weekend escapades.
Always remember your audience is made of busy people. They took time out of their day to come watch you talk. Respect that time by not wasting it.;
, Decide ahead of time and state in your introduction if you will allow interruptions during your talk, or if you would rather questions be held for the end of your seminar. Either way, make sure you budget your time so that there is time for questions. Budget about 10% of your allotted seminar time for questions.


This means that for an hour time slot, you should budget 10 minutes for questions and 45-50 minutes for the seminar.
For a 15 minute time slot this means that you should budget 1-2 minutes for questions and 13 minutes for your talk.
 Now before you can formulate the rest of your self-introduction you must identify the goal of your seminar. There are three main categories of seminars, 1) The Job Seminar 2) The Teaching Seminar 3) The Persuasive Seminar. Each of these seminars has very different goals. Identify which category your seminar fits in best:



The Job Seminar. Your seminar is a job talk. Where the goal is to look impressive, qualified and professional.

Teaching Seminar. Your seminar is primarily for educational purposes. Where the goals are to inspire, inform and educate your audience.

The Persuasive Seminar. Your seminar is a "call to action" or "sales pitch." Where your goals are to persuade, motivate and befriend.
Your seminar may fall into more than one category but there should be one that fits best. Identify it and the goals. We will discuss how to use these goals to choose material for your self-introduction below.

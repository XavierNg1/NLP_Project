 You will need a good substrate (cocoa fiber works well), and a hide of some sort for it to go in. Tokay geckos are strictly nocturnal.;
, Buy cricket food or put a few pieces of dog food in with the crickets.Dust crickets with a vitamin and calcium supplement at least every third feeding

,, Also, spray water all around the tank daily.Get a hygrometer -- the humidity level should be between 60-80%.
, Sure, some can be dog tame, but most likely they will remain quite wild for their entire lives. You can try working with them to "tame" them, but don't get your hopes up. Tokays are amazing geckos that are beautiful and males can be vocal as well. They are a great lizard for someone who wants a lizard to look at, but not handle.

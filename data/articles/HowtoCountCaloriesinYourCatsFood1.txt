 In order to determine the number of calories in your cat’s food, you should look at the food label to see if the calories are listed. Cat food companies are not required to put caloric information on the label. That being said, some brands will include caloric information. This is often the case for foods that are marketed as “light.”, If you cannot find the caloric information printed on the label, then you can calculate the number of calories yourself. For example, use an online calorie calculator to determine the number of calories. In order to do this, you will need to look at the “Guaranteed Analysis” section of the food label. Here you will find all of the nutritional information regarding the percentage of protein, fiber, fat, minerals, etc found within the food.You will then input these numbers into the online calculator found here: http://fnae.org/carbcalorie.html

The calculator will determine the number of calories per 100 grams of food. It will also provide you with information concerning the percentage of carbohydrates.
 In some instances you can find the caloric information regarding your cat’s food by searching the specific product page on the manufacturer’s website. In many instances the manufacturer will list the caloric information on the website, rather than directly on the label.You can also email or phone the manufacturer to inquire about this information., Generally, dry cat food is more condensed and contains more calories than wet food. This means that your cat could get the same amount of calories by eating a small amount of dry food and a larger serving of wet food. In most cases, the calorie count for dry food is anywhere between 350 and 500 calories per cup, whereas wet food ranges from 120 to 190 calories per cup.Different proteins also have different average calorie levels. For instance, chicken-based foods typically have more calories than turkey, fish, or beef-based cat foods.

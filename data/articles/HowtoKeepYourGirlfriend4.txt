 Keeping a girlfriend means beginning to think about how you will share your life with her. As you plan your own future, think about how she’s going to fit into it. Share some of your thoughts with her, and she will share some of her thoughts about the future with you too., Your goals aren’t the only important ones in this relationship. Since you’re equal partners, give her support as she works towards her own goals. She has things she’d like to accomplish in her life too, and having your love and support will help her achieve them., Inevitably, you’ll have to sacrifice some of your own needs and wants to accommodate hers. Be ready to make some compromises – and know which things you absolutely won’t compromise on. Sharing your life with someone is a balance, but be honest about your top priorities too.
 When your girlfriend feels safe, she will trust and respect you, and she will be more committed to staying with you. Whether it’s feeling secure in terms of your love for her, financially secure, secure in working towards her goals, or secure about herself, help make her feel safe.

 For each batch, you should only use about 1 quart (1 liter) of whipping cream, 1/4 cup (59 ml) sugar, and 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract. You should also make sure that the whipping cream is very cold before starting each batch.
 Pour the whipping cream into a large metal or glass bowl. Use an electric mixer at high speed to beat the cream for several minutes, just enough for soft peaks to form.
 Continue beating with the electric mixer at high speed for several more minutes until stiff peaks form.
 Complete the remaining three batches, cover, and chill up to 2 hours.

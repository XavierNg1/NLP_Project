 Whether you plan to grill a steak or use a pan, there are some cuts of meat that are better done using the right technique. The amount of time you have will also determine what steak works best.


For example, if you want a quick meal you can use a pan for a skirt steak rather than try the same technique for a porterhouse in the same window of time.;
, The tenderness of the steak relates to how much work the muscles must work in its lifetime. So a muscle that does little work, like those in the back close to the spine, will be very tender as opposed to a muscle in the legs. The muscles around the loin, backstop, ribs are the most tender and, therefore, considered high-end.High-end steaks include the ribeye, the strip, the tenderloin, and the t-bone.
 Marbling is the amount of fat in a steak. Steaks are graded by their tenderness and marbling. The scale ranges from Prime steaks, which have a great deal of marbling in a cow younger than 42 months, Choice steaks, followed by Select steaks, and all the way down to the lowest grade of Canner steaks.Marbling shows up as the interstitial fat that looks similar to white spiderwebs within your steak. The more of these spiderwebs you see, the more marbling it has.
Marbling not only affects the tenderness but also the taste. The more marbling a steak has, the greater its tenderness. However, everyone has their own preference in taste. Some people may find too much marbling too rich in taste.

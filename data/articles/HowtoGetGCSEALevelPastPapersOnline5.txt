, One of the boxes there should be entitled "Past papers". You need to click on whether you are a teacher or a student, although it won't make a difference, except that only teachers with a valid password can access the most recent papers, as schools use those themselves for testing/mock exams. The student page can be found here.
 A Levels will be under either "GCE (Curriculum 2000)" or "GCE from 2008", or you can find GCSEs and iGCSEs from the year they were first examined, e.g. "GCSE from 2001".
 You won't be taken to a new page, but the past paper search facility you just used to put in a qualification level will then show a list of subjects.
 Here you can narrow your search by either choosing a document type (mostly just mark scheme or question paper) or an examination series. If you would like to go back at any point, there's a lighter blue button in the top left hand corner of the little past paper search facility. Alternatively, you can just click the orange bar labelled "Show all results", which is a complete list of documents.
 Whether you chose to see the complete list, or narrowed the search a little, it should come up with a list of PDFs. You can click on them and they will open, as usual, but there is also an arrow button on the right side of each paper listing. If you click on it, the paper will download directly.

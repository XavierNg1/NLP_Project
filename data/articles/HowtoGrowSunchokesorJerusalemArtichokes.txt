 You will want to pick a spot in your yard that gets at least partial sun, full sun being best.;
, Sunchoke really thrives in almost any soil, but like any plant, will flourish in optimum conditions. Use a good organic soil mix, peat moss, organic compost, and food grade diatomaceous earth in roughly a 45-25-20-10 mix.
 You will need to decide if you will plant in the ground (not suggested) or in containers. A raised bed garden is ideal, the length of the fence. It helps the plant from spreading and also creates a living privacy fence rather quickly!


Once sown in soil, sunchoke is almost impossible to eradicate. Please plant responsibly.






Your container should be well drained and at least 2' deep and equally as wide. Keeping in mind how tall the plant grows, you may need to invest in a weighted pot (or pour in some concrete) so that it doesn't get too top heavy and topple over.
 Choose any rhizome that is not dried out and free from disease and parasites. Sunchoke will grow from even the smallest discarded bit so you should experience almost 100% germination and a healthy plant with seed rhizomes no matter the size. Plant 2"-3" in the soil and cover.
 After you have planted the rhizomes in the soil, you will want to water thoroughly until some drains through the bottom of the container. Sunchokes, like sunflowers, appreciate water, although many people have had success growing in dry climates. 2"-3" a week should be fine.
 It should only take about 3 days for the rhizome to start sprouting roots if the soil is warm, about another week to start popping up little stalks.

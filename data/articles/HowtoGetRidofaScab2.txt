 Picking at your scab is a no-no, since this can cause scarring and make it take even longer for the wound to heal. If you want some relief from the itching that will also help get rid of the scab, try gently massaging it with a bit of petroleum jelly or moisturizing lotion. You can do this each time you put a new bandage on., For some instant relief, soak a clean cloth in plain warm water. Let it sit on the scab for fifteen minutes, but don’t rub or scrub. This will provide relief from the irritation that makes you want to pick the scab. The water will also moisturize the scab, helping it to heal faster., Epsom salts make your skin taut, minimizing scabbing. They may also relieve tenderness and redness associated with the scab. Dissolve a few cups of epsom salts into a warm bath and soak the scab.After soaking in the epsom salt bath, gently pat the scab dry.
 Mix some baking soda with enough water to make a paste. Apply the paste over the entire scab and let dry. When you’re done, rinse it away with warm water. This will tighten the scab and draw it gently from the skinYou can do the same thing with potassium alum, a naturally occurring form of aluminum salt, and is widely used as a deodorant and styptic (or astringent). Look for it at your local pharmacy.
Alum tightens the scab by constricting the surrounding blood vessels, ultimately loosening the scab from its mooring on the skin.
 Several common products can kill germs, helping the wound to heal and the scab to clear up. Just soak a cotton ball or swab in the product, then dab it on your scab. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse and apply a new dressing. Try:Tea tree oil
Honey
Aloe vera gel
Apple cider vinegar (1 part vinegar to 10 parts water)

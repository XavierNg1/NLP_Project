 Draw a circle and an upward-facing, curve-edged triangle overlapping it. Sketch guidelines for the facial features going both horizontally and vertically.;
, It should be rectangular for the most part, with flat ends but a slight arc at the top.
 Draw two almond-like ovals for the eyes and dots for the pupils. Add curved lines on top of each oval to serve as the eyelashes. On the side of the triangle from step one, add a curved line for the ear and a smaller one inside that. Add another curve for the nose.
 Draw three circles with different sizes as shown, so she kind of looks like a snowman, and extra circles for her chest. These shapes will guide you when you outline her later.
 Add small circles for the hands and four ovals for the fingers (remember, Amy Wong only has four fingers).
 (These should be about the length of the rest of the body; Amy has very long legs.) Add smaller ovals for the feet.
 She usually wears a hoodie with sweat shorts and a pair of boots.
 Make sure no excess guidelines remain. Don't forget to detail her lips or belly button!

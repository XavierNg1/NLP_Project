 Rust is a chemical process in which iron oxidizes and begins to flake away the metal. This is caused by water that soaks into the metal or comes in contact with the metal frequently over time.









Try to keep the metal in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture buildup.
Always thoroughly dry metal after it comes in contact with water.
 If you plan on painting your metal, use a paint primer to help the paint to stick and keep the metal away from moisture.









If the surface of the metal is smooth, you can use any spray-on primer.
A rough metal surface needs to be primed with a “filler” primer which will work to fill in any divots or pocks in the metal.
 Paint, in addition to a good primer, will keep metal away from moisture. Make sure you use a high quality paint for the best results.









Spray paint works well for metal, but applying paint with a brush will help it to stick better.
Seal the paint with a clear top coat to reduce the rate of oxidation.

 Grab your butane lighter, Zippo and a small flathead screwdriver.;
, Use the screwdriver to remove the wheel from the butane lighter. Keeping your hand over the top of the lighter gently pry the wheel pin out of the plastic frame.
 After you have one side of the wheel free gently pull the wheel out of the other side. The spring that holds the flint taught will launch the flint up so keep the light in your closed hand.
 The flint you get from the butane lighter may be a little big for your Zippo so you'll need to cut it in two. Just lay the flint down on a cutting board, take a sharp knife and set it in the middle of the flint. Start rolling forward and back, scoring the flint. When it gets a nice start, put your hand on the back of the knife and keep cutting. Your hand will help catch the pieces when the knife cuts through.
 Now it's time to put the flint in the Zippo! Remove the insert from the case, use the screwdriver to remove the spring. Pop the flint in the hole and replace the spring. Tighten the screw just tight enough, but not too tight you don't want to end up stripping it.
 Refill your Zippo with fluid (if needed) and replace the insert in the case. Give it a strike and you are back in action!

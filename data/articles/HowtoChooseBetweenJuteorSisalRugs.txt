Sisal has a natural color which is off-white and creamy. It comes from the long green leaves of the cactus plant agave sisalana and is stronger than other natural fibers. Because of its strength, it's used to make rope as well as being used in cat scratching posts. It's also a popular choice because of its durability.
Jute is a soft and waxy vegetable fiber which is taken from the stalks of the Corchorus plant. Generally beige or golden in color, the natural variation in shades means that once woven, each jute rug is distinctively different. Because the fibers are left to soak and soften up in water for many days before being processed, jute feels soft to the touch, like cotton.
Woven jute looks chunky and can be used to great effect to add texture to a room. It complements hardwood floors and looks fabulous with smooth leather sofas. It's also a great choice for a vacation beach house.
Sisal has more of the appearance of textured yarn and with its coarse, slightly scratchy feel, is ideal as an area rug for a high-traffic area. If you're planning on walking on your rug with bare feet, then jute is likely to be the better choice.;
, When compared to synthetic rugs, jute rugs are very durable but they are not a good choice for areas of heavy traffic. They are better for dining rooms or bedrooms, where footfall is considerably lighter. Sisal rugs are better for busy entrance ways or halls which experience heavy footfall, as well for in a living room.
 Jute is generally cheaper in price than sisal, which is higher quality and lasts longer. Both types of rug require very little maintenance since they don't absorb dirt, and need little more than a quick shake or gentle sweep.
 Jute rugs are eco-friendly since they are a renewable source and are also biodegradable. Sisal area rugs are flame retardant, anti-static, and absorb sound, which makes them a great choice for kids' playrooms.

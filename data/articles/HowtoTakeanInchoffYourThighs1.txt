 Due to how our bodies are made, itâ€™s simply not possible to burn body fat in one specific area. So rather than focusing on reducing fat in your thighs, think about committing to a full body workout that allows you to lose weight in all areas of your body, including your thighs.Burning fat in the inner thigh area is difficult, and may take time. Be patient and set realistic goals for your overall weight loss. Slim thighs are possible, but it will take time to achieve them.;
, Run on the treadmill for 30-45 minutes, go for a long spin on the exercise bike, or complete a solid session on the elliptical machine.The most effective cardio workouts for reducing large thighs is to do work on your cardio through running, jogging or spinning for a long duration of time, as this will allow you to burn fat and not put on too much muscle or bulk. If you are running or jogging outside, avoid hilly terrain as this will cause you to build up muscle on your legs.If you are working out on cardio equipment like the elliptical or the stationary bike, keep the resistance and the incline low. Aim for a moderately high intensity on the machines to maximize the amount of fat you burn.
Use a heart rate calculator to determine how intense your workout is and to ensure you maintain an even pace throughout the cardio workout.
 These exercise, while great for building thigh muscle, will only help your thighs become larger, not slimmer.Focus on burning fat on your body and then build your thigh muscles gradually.
 Once you feel you have lost an inch or two off your thighs through a long distance cardio workout, start to integrate resistance training with weights into your workout routine.Start with lighter weights on exercise machines like the leg lift, leg rotations, and leg presses. Do more reps on each machine with less resistance to build up muscle slowly.

 Take 2 baby gem lettuce heads and remove any dead or wilting leaves. Wash the lettuce to remove any dirt between the leaves. Chop off ½ inch off the stem of the lettuce, and cut the lettuce into quarters vertically. Then pat the lettuce dry., Wash the green onion and cut off the white ends. Take two cloves of garlic and mince them finely. Cut the bacon into cubes if not already cut. Peel and dice the shallots., Place a large pan over low heat. Add the chopped shallots, garlic and bacon cubes. Heat them until the fat of the bacon begins to run, then turn up the heat to high until the bacon is crispy and the shallots and garlic are soft and cooked. Then lower the heat., Keeping the shallots, garlic and bacon in the pan, add the butter. Swirl the butter until it has mostly melted. Then add in the green onion stalks, spreading them out so that they don’t overlap. Cook the green onion until it is soft., Add the lettuce quarters into the pan. Pour in 150 ml of chicken or vegetable stock. Cook the lettuce until it is soft, and then turn the lettuce over using a spatula. Then add the 100 grams of peas. Allow the ingredients to simmer until the peas have cooked, which should take one or two minutes.
 Use a slotted spoon to dish the vegetables onto a serving plate. If possible, heat the plate up beforehand so that the vegetables stay warm.
 Take the crème fraiche and drop it into the pan with the stock and bacon fat. Simmer the mixture until it has reduced and the consistency is more like a sauce., After the sauce has reduced, spoon the cream sauce over the vegetables. Put some sauce in a small bowl in case you wish to add more later.

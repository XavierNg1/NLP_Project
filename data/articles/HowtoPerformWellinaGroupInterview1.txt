 If you can, get a few friends or family members to role play a group interview with you. Give them the job description and a bunch of questions. Encourage them to ad lib as well as ask the questions. Divide them into competing interviewees and interviewers. As well as trying to answer questions, watch how others answer questions and the sorts of dynamics you might encounter in a group interview situation. While it's not the real thing, if your friends/family play along properly, you may discover some useful information and approaches.

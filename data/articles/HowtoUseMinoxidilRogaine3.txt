 While it seems counter-intuitive, shedding hair means that new growth has begun. This may last a few weeks, but it is just temporary: the shedding hair is older hair that would have fallen out, making room for the newer, healthier hair., New hair growth usually takes about four months, though some have results earlier than that. New hair growth may be soft and downy, like peach fuzz.


Eventually, new hairs growing in will be the same color and thickness as your normal hair. To maintain this growth, you will need to continue using minoxidil.

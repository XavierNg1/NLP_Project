, It's located to the east of Heahea City on Akala Island. Use the Charizard Glide to get there faster, if you're not already there.
 Go into the sand clouds to encounter a Pokémon, which will be either Staryu or Sandygast. If you use up all the sand clouds without finding a Sandygast, exit and re-enter the area to respawn the sand clouds.
 Since it'll be fairly low level, you can use a Nest Ball for an easier catch. If it's nighttime, you can also use a Dusk Ball.

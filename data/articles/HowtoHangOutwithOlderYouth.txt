,, Say "Hey, I heard you like fishing. Do you want to go with me and my friend this weekend?" This lets you establish a connection (even if they can't hang out with you right away, you have something to talk about) and shows you're fun and have something to contribute.
 (No sucking up!) Say: "I saw the still-life painting you did in Art class. Wow! Those peaches you drew looked so real and delicious it made me hungry!".

 Suggest activities, find cool music, or introduce your friend to new people. And be sure to have this person's back like any other good friend.

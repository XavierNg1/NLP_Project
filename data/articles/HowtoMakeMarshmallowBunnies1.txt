 To start, take a pair of scissors. Use this to cut your marshmallows cross wise. Cut them into four even pieces. These should resemble diamond shapes, which you will use for bunny ears., Cut about half inch pieces from the flat ends of larger marshmallows. Cut these ends into two semi-circles. These will be attached as legs., Place your white candy melts in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave them on high for one minute and then stir. Continue to microwave the candy melts for 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until your candy melts are melted into an even paste., Place your pink sugar in a small bowl. Press the sticky sides of your bunny ears into the sprinkles. This will coat them with pink., Connect two whole marshmallows by coating the flat side of one with melted candy melts. Press the round side of the other marshmallow onto the flat side of the other. The marshmallow connected at the round side is the head. The other marshmallow is the body., Add the ears to either side of your bunny's head using candy melts as glue. Add the feet to either side of the bunny's body, securing them with candy melts. When you're done, you should have a cute marshmallow bunny.

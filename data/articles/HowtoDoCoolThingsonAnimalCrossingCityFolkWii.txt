 If you have a good friendship with him/her they will wave back. If not they may just bow their head or not do anything.;
, Go to Tom Nook's shop and buy two shovels. bury one and then the next day dig it up. it will have turned into a golden shovel. this is far better than the ordinary shovel as it can do more things.
 One rock in your village each day is full of money. go to a rock, and dig holes all around you so when you hit it you don't go backwards. If you hit the right rock and a bag of money comes out, keep hitting. The more you hit the bigger amount of money will come out. And do it fast because it you don't do it fast enough, it won't work.
 You must have a good amount of bells to do this. Make a hole in the ground with the golden shovel and bury how many bells you want in it. Hopefully it will grow. The more money you put in, the better the chance it will have money on the tree. For example if I put 1,000 bells in, it has a 1% chance of money grow on it. But if I put 10,000 bells in, there would be a 10% chance of money growing on it. If money grows on the tree then it would have the amount of money you put in in each bag. Also money will only grow once on it.

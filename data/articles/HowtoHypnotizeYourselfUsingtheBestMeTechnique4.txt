 As with your safe space, be as specific as possible. Where were you? What were you doing? Who was with you?

, Start by imagining yourself in the past. What do you see? What do you hear, feel, smell? What were you doing? Saying? Visualize the moment so clearly that it feels as if you are willing it into existence.
 As you allow yourself to sink into the scene you have created, you will re-experience the emotion. Let yourself feel it again as you relive the moment., When other thoughts intrude, gently push them away and return to your scenario. If they persist, imagine putting them on a TV screen and clicking off the TV, or putting them in a drawer and shutting it., Memories connected to strong feelings are very powerful. Reliving this memory with its attendant emotions of confidence and happiness will make you feel as if you are inevitably heading for success. Embrace this feeling. Expect to succeed. Act, think, and feel as if you cannot fail.
 Once you have recreated this experience, think of a word that describes it. Focus on that word while you recall the scene and the feelings it creates. In the future, you will be able to use this word to bring those feelings back when you need them., You will gradually return to your normal state of consciousness by the time you reach five.


One – Begin returning.
Two – Focus on your emotions: happy, confident.
Three – Focus on your breathing, the sensations of your body, the feel of the floor or chair beneath you.
Four – Become aware of the room around you. The sounds and smells.
Five – Open your eyes. You are back, feeling confident of success.

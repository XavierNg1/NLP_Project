 This method works for any device connected to the web, including smartphones and tablets. Do a web search for “convert XXX to jpg online” (where “XXX” is the type of file you’re converting from) to browse through options. Sites like Online-Convertcontain lists of all of the file types it can convert to and from.


Make sure any site you choose is capable of handling your image type.Some image types, such as .RAW files, are harder to convert online due to their size.
If you’re using a mobile device, use Wi-Fi instead of your data plan. Image files can be huge.
 In your converter, find the button that says something similar to “Choose file” and locate the file you wish to convert. Note that many converters have maximum file sizes.


Read through the terms or usage policy before uploading.
Some converters allow you to enter a URL, which is great if your image is online.
 Most converters will have a dropdown menu or button to press where you can select “JPEG” or “.JPG” (these two options will do the same thing). Some converters also allow you to modify the size and quality of the file on this screen.
 Find the button that says “Convert” or “Save” to start the conversion. This could take several minutes. The image will either download automatically to your default download location or you’ll be prompted to choose one. Once the process is complete, your image will be converted to a JPEG.

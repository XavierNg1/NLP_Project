 When the game begins you don't have much energy, so don't waste it all in a spur of the moment treasure hunt. Decide where you want to begin (preferably a smaller island if you have less energy) and work your way up from there.;
, You cannot use a shovel for everything. Some items, such as trees and ferns, require a machete in order to hunt in them. Other items, such as rocks, require a pickax or dynamite, depending on the size of the rock. Know how much each item costs, and plan your searches accordingly.
 The money you have can be used to decorate your home island, or be spent on buying tools or gems. Make sure you buy what you need first, or you will find that it takes much longer to hunt for treasure.
 By doing this, you gain a few XP (experience points). You can also harvest gems from their gem trees.
 There are five (5) items in every treasure collection. Each treasure you find goes into a collection. Some collections have rare treasures, others have common treasures. After you have completed a collection, you have to option to turn it in and earn bonus coins and XP.

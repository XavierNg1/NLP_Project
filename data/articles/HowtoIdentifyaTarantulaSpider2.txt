 However, some adult tarantulas can be less than 0.5 centimeter (0.2 in)!


The body length and height can be up to 3” (76 mm).
The leg span can be as much as 3 to 5” (76 to 127 mm).;
, However color is extremely variable, and many other distantly related spiders are the same colour as many tarantulas

, A tarantula like all spiders has a frontal segment (opisthosoma) connected through a narrow waist to the abdomen which is oval-shaped.
 This would be a huntsman. Another often confused are Wandering spiders, where two of the eight eights are lower down and closer to the mouth parts than the remaining eyes

, The direction the fangs bite can be very diagnostic - if biting 'backwards' (paraxial) then this reduces the possible identity to just several broad groups (spider families) which includes tarantulas.

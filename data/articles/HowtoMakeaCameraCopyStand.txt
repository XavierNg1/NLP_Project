 For example, if the wooden stand has a diameter of one inch (2.5 cm), find an acrylic pipe with a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8cm).


Measure a section about two inches (five centimeters) long.



 


Cut off that section with a saw.
 Sand off the edges using a fine file. Sanding the edge will make it easier to slide this component., You'll need a large bolt to hold the camera stand assembly in place. In our example, a bolt three inches (7.5 cm) long will work well.,,, These holes will allow you to alter the height of your cam stand. Start with a wooden rod, ideally about 30 inches (76cm) tall.

Fit the acrylic pipe over the wooden rod, and adjust until it is flush with one end.






Mark the wooden rod where it is exposed by the hole in the pipe.






Make additional marks on the rod at 1 inch (2.5cm) intervals from this mark, along the entire length.






Drill holes at these marks, using the same diameter as the bolt.
, The hole should be at right angles to the bolt hole position.


The camera screw should be able to attach to your camera tripod head.
 This is the most important component, and must be mounted firmly for the camera to stay attached.

Position the base of the camera tightly in the hole you just drilled, with the screw pointing outward.






Fix it in place with a generous amount of gorilla glue or other strong glue that will bond to the acrylic pipe. For best results, let the glue dry overnight.
 If your wooden rod is shorter than 30 inches (76 cm) long, slot it into another length of pipe to raise it to the full recommended height.
 The base provides support for the entire assembly. This is a square wooden plank, with dimensions 5 in x 5 in x 1 in (12.7 x 12.7 x 2.5cm).,, Hammer it down.
 Screw the tripod head into the camera screw., To use the copy stand, just move the acrylic pipe to the desired height and screw in the bolt. Attach the camera, and you're ready to shoot.

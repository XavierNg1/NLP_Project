 First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Now place two sticks of butter in a medium saucepan and melt that over medium-high heat. Stir in the cocoa and water and continue to heat until the liquid begins to boil rapidly., While the chocolate heats up, pour your flour, granulated sugar, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl. Stir until they are evenly mixed. Once the chocolate boils, pour that in, too, and mix them all together., Pour your buttermilk into a second mixing bowl, add the baking soda, and stir to combine. Then pour that into your chocolate-flour mix and do the same. Once you've emptied the second mixing bowl, crack your eggs open in that, beat them together, then pour and stir them into the first bowl's contents. Finally, stir one teaspoon of vanilla extract into the cake mix, and it's good to go., Grease the bottoms and sides of two round 8-inch (20 cm) cake pans. Divide equal portions of your cake mix into each one. Place them in the oven once it reaches desired heat and bake for approximately 25 minutes., While the cake bakes, grab a new mixing bowl or clean out one of the used ones. Then beat together your confectionerâ€™s sugar and whole milk, plus 4 tablespoons of butter 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir in food coloring to create whichever shade of purple suits you., Once your cake is done, remove it from heat and set it on a wire rack. Once it cools off enough for you to touch safely, top each round with frosting. Set one top of the other. Dust with cookie crumbles and top it with pansies.

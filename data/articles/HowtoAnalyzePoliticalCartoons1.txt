For example, a whirlpool may be used to denote the problems of getting involved with the messy political situation in Syria.
 The cartoonist may label certain elements in the cartoon. This will help identify the different pictures and ideas in the cartoon. Labels are often paired with symbols.


For example, the whirlpool that symbolizes Syria may be labeled as such.
 The cartoonist may compare two things that are not alike. This technique may be used if there is a complex topic or idea that is difficult to understand. By comparing it to something else, it can be easier for the reader to understand.


For example, if a political figure in the cartoon is pouring money into a toilet, this may mean that this politician’s policies on government spending are wasteful.
 An artist may use irony by using words or pictures to describe the opposite of what is, such as what should be. This is usually done with humorous effect.

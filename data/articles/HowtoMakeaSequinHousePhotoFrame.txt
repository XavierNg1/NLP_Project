 It must be a vertical photo, as the house frame is tall, not wide.;
, This sets the width.
 This forms the house floor. Glue to the two lengthwise craft sticks.
 Angle two craft sticks at the top to form the gable (triangular part) of the roof. Overlap one craft stick on top of the other, to make a point. Glue in place, both where the point meets, and where the craft sticks meet the lengthwise sticks.
 The glue will go on the front of the photo and on the back of the frame, then press the two together.
 Glue sequins around the entire frame. The most effective look is to mix up many colors and the sizes of the sequins. Or, you can keep to one hue if you prefer.
 If the photo is of a person, write the name in; if it's a special place, such as a vacation spot, write the name of that place.
 Here are some ideas:

Glue magnets to the back of the photo frame. This is good for displaying on the refrigerator.






Glue a yarn or string hanger to the back. Hang from the wall or a window.






Simply lean the frame against a wall or shelf.

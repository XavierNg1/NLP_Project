 It's very likely an older child will be embarrassed about their parents and older siblings being involved in private matters such as these, as children get older they become more skittish about their older siblings and parents helping out with personal hygiene such as bathing, getting dressed, and other things along these lines. Before the diapers are put on for the first time, it would be a good idea to have this conversation with the child or children a few days beforehand, such as after the diapers and plastic pants are ordered, that way they are prepared. The parents can put their mind at ease and let them know that in some cases even incontinent adults need assistance diapering themselves for various reasons.


Let the child know that the reason you're diapering them (as well as their older siblings if you decide to have them help out too) is that using safety pins can be somewhat tricky—it can be difficult using the pins and there is the potential for sticking one's self. Tell them that over time they'll be able to do this on their own.
 Tell them what to expect when the parent or sister puts the diapers on them - and do it some hours before their first diapering.Tell them also how they can cooperate to make their diapering as easy as possible. Let them see and touch the cloth diapers and plastic pants they are going to wear and let them ask any questions they may have and listen to their concerns.
 There are a couple of prefolds that are easiest to use for pin-on style diapers—the “angel wing” fold and the “newspaper” fold. For parents new to using safety pins these seem like the most hassle free methods. Each of the methods are described below.
 The child needs to be positioned so the child has enough padding in both the front and back.

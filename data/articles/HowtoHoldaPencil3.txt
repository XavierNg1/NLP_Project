 Avoid making a fist––a small ball should be able to slide into the cupped hand shape. Otherwise, the grip will be too tight and restrictive.









One method suggests that the two fingers need to bend back toward your palm while the other fingers do the maneuvering work. For children, it can be helpful to give them a ball or similar item to hold in these two fingers while the other digits hold the pencil.
Another method is to have these fingers work as supports for the writing fingers––just be sure they're bent. It's a good idea to try both ways to find what works best for you. You may find that the positioning is impacted by whether you're holding the pencil for writing in either a slanted or a perpendicular way (see next).
 Write while holding the pencil slanted or perpendicular (exactly upright) to the table. See which approach best suits your writing needs.
 If you find that your elbow tends to wing out, practice writing on a vertical surface, such as on a whiteboard or on paper on an easel. Writing vertically will automatically force your elbow, arm and writing hand into the correct alignment.

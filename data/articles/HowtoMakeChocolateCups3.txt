 After the chocolate cups have frozen, peel off the cupcake liner from around them. This leaves you with a perfect chocolate cup!


Do this slowly and gently so as to not break the thin chocolate.
 If you wish, create or buy a tasty filling to put inside your cups. You can also just enjoy the cup on its own as a thin and crunchy chocolate treat. If you cook something like a mousse to put in the chocolate cups, wait until it’s cool before spooning it inside. If you pour something hot into the cup, the chocolate will melt.
 After you have filled your cup with your filling, serve it or put the filled cup in the refrigerator. Even in cooler climates, chocolate can soften quickly, so don’t delay in serving. , Immediately refrigerate any unused cups, as these will begin to melt or soften quickly and may not keep their shape even if frozen later.

 The nutrition panel on food packages has all of the information that you will need to calculate calories from fat. The panel is black and white and it should say “Nutrition Facts” at the top of it.Find this panel and then find the number of fat grams per serving.


Write down how many grams of fat are in this food. For example, if the food has 3.4 grams of fat in it, then write this number down.
In some cases, the nutrition panel will also provide a number for the calories from fat. If your panel has this information listed, then you will not need to calculate any further unless you want to find the percentage.
If there is no nutrition panel, then you can try to search for the nutrition information. Try visiting the product’s website if the item is prepackaged. If you got the item in a restaurant, then check the restaurant’s nutrition information. If the item was homemade, then try checking recipe websites for the nutrition information of similar recipes.;
, To get the number of calories from fat using the fat grams, you will just need to multiply the total fat grams per serving by 9. This is because one gram of fat contains 9 calories.For example, if the food has 3.4 grams of fat, then your equation might look like 3.4 X 9 = 30.6. This food would have 30.6 calories from fat.
 After you have calculated the number of calories in the food that are from fat, you can convert this number to a percentage. To get the percentage of calories from fat in a food, just divide the number of calories from fat in one serving by the total number of calories in one serving.For example, if the food has 260 calories in a serving and 30.6 calories from fat, then your equation might look like 30.6 / 260 = 0.1176
To turn this result into a percentage, just move the decimal two spots to the right or multiply your result by 100. For example, 0.1176 X 100 = 11.76% or about 12%. This means that the food has a fat percentage of about 12%.

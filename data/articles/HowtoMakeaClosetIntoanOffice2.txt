 If you have a small closet, consider looking online for a Murphy desk that drops down and can be folded up when not in use. Otherwise, you can measure your area and place a desk of any kind that fits in the space, including modular designs, classic styles with plenty of drawers and plank desks that will fit plenty of electronic devices.
 The kind of shelving that you choose is mostly based on what you plan to store in the office, such as documents, books or office supplies. It is a good idea to choose shelving with dividers so that you can separate your projects, just as you do at an office.


Try to install shelving as high as you can in your office. You must maximize your storage space, if you want it to be a useful area. Many closet offices can fit 4 or 5 shelf levels from desk level to ceiling.
 This is especially important if your desk does not come with drawers. Open or file cabinets can store things that you want hidden.
 Most closet office spaces do not get the benefit of natural light. This means that you should provide overhead light. Install a pendant light, small chandelier, a touch light or expand on the current closet light with a beautiful fixture.
 You will need to measure the desk before you buy the chair so that you are sure it will fit. Most people do not choose desk chairs because the casters tend to stick out, so choose a chair with a cushion on it or add a pillow for lumbar support.
 Choose a few accent colors and make the desk into something that reflects your personality. Paint the shelves and/or desk or put up wallpaper before you move your supplies in and buy coordinating office supplies.
 You can now make last minute adjustments and use your new home office.

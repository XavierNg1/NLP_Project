 Be extra cautious during your regular shower routine. Minimize using soap and shampoo near your face. Getting these products in your eyebrow piercing can cause irritation.When shampooing your hair, it can help to tilt your head back while applying the shampoo. Leave your head tilted backwards throughout the entire shampooing process to keep shampoo away from your piercing.
It may be best to refrain from washing your face for a few days after getting your piercing.
 If you use makeup or facial moisturizers, do not apply them near the piercing. These products can irritate or contaminate a piercing. Makeup brushes also may contain bacteria, so applying makeup near your piercing poses a risk.Try taking a break from makeup for a few days after getting your eyebrow pierced.
 Keep all bedding clean, especially pillows, while the piercing is new. Change your sheets more often than normal as your piercing heals. For the most part, sleep on the opposite side of the piercing to prevent contamination.

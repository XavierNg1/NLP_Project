 Airborne units are the air-based transportation and attack units. They are made in the Airbase. Tap on the Airbase to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission, on your Battle Stars, or on your available gold coins.
 There are four different Airborne units in the game.


A Sky Hook can transport infantry and vehicles quickly to different locations on the map. It is a non-combat unit. It costs 100 gold coins.
A Chopper is the most flexible airborne unit available, able to attack all types of targets within its range. It costs 300 gold coins.
A Fighter is the ultimate anti-air unit, able to attack and take down all types of airborne units. It can only attack airborne units. It costs 200 gold coins.
A Bomber is the ultimate air unit against all types of units, except for airborne units. It’s basically the opposite of a Fighter. It costs 350 gold coins.
 Tap on the unit you want to build then tap on the “Buy” button with the amount of gold coins needed to make it.


You can only buy a unit that you can afford. The selected unit will immediately be generated from the Airbase, ready for use.

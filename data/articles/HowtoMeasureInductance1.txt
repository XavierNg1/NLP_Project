 Keep the cycle of the pulse below 50 percent.;
, You'll need to wire a current sense resistor into the circuit, or else use a current probe. Either should be connected to an oscilloscope.
 The peak current will be measured in amperes, while the time between pulses will be in microseconds.
 For example, if a voltage of 50 volts is delivered every 5 microseconds, this figure would be 50 times 5, or 250 volt-microseconds.
 Continuing the above example, if the peak current was 5 amperes, the inductance would be 250 volt-microseconds divided by 5 amperes, or 50 microhenries.


Although the math is simple, the setup for this method of measuring inductance is more complex than for other methods of measuring inductance.

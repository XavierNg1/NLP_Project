 The objectives you hope to achieve will guide your decision as to which educational institute you'll be sending your doggy to. Do you want them to:


Not bark at visitors?
Not beg for food from the table?
Not be so territorial / temperamental?
Get along better with other pets?
Not to chew on furniture or shoes?, There are two kinds of schools for dogs: boarding schools and training schools. Both kinds of schools provide your dog with training and "manners" to keep them well-behaved. The main difference is that the boarding school will keep your dog overnight for an extended stay; the training schools will only take your pooch for the day.


How much reform your dog needs is the determining factor in choosing one or the other type of dog school. A pooch in need of serious reform might do best when separated from you and their usual routine for a few days. A dog who needs only minor correcting is probably better left at the training school.
If your main motive for signing the dog up for school is to keep them occupied for hours, a stint at training school for the day is your best option.
 Ask your vet for a referral, or consult your other dog-owning friends to see if they sent their dogs to any local schools, and ask for their opinions on the value they felt they received from each school. You can also check reviews online to see what various people thought about the education their pups received.

 As with homemade treatments with natural ingredients, there is very little scientifically-backed evidence for the effectiveness and even the safety of homemade acne and blackhead treatments. You should talk with your doctor or dermatologist before attempting a homemade treatment â€” you could end up seriously damaging your skin, which could lead to far worse problems than a few blackheads.
 One recommended treatment is the application of highly diluted boric acid mixed with water. Boric is a mild acid that you can buy from the pharmacy. Mix one and a half cups of hot water with half a tablespoon of boric acid powder. Dip a face cloth into the solution and dab this onto your skin. You can leave this for fifteen or twenty minutes to work.There are no studies supporting the use of boric acid for acne. There is evidence to suggest that it does have antibacterial and antiviral properties; however it has not proven to be effective for acne.
Although diluted formulations are known to be safe for abrasions and treating vaginal bacterial disease, boric acid if not diluted properly can cause severe skin and eye irritation.
In addition, there are a few case reports of patients who used an ointment containing boric acid that caused an acne eruption.Be aware that boric acid is a pesticide and be toxic to infants if inhaled or ingested., This method is supposed to pull the plug of oil and dead skin out of your pore. Epsom Salts can be a good exfoliant.Mix a teaspoon of Epsom Salts with four drops of Iodine in half a cup of hot water. Stir until all the salts have dissolved and the temperature has dropped a little.Once the solution is at a safe temperature, apply to your face with cotton balls and let it dry. Then wash off and pat your face dry.


Again, there is no evidence that this method actually removes blackheads. If left on your skin for too long or overused, iodine can cause severe skin reactions, or may put you at risk for hyperthyroidism.

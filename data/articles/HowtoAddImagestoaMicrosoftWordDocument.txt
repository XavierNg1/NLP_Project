, Word's insertion cursor, a vertical blinking bar, will appear at this point. When inserted, the picture's bottom left corner will be at this point.


If you do not select a point, the picture will be inserted wherever the cursor is currently located.
 The "Insert Picture" dialog is where you will select the photo you wish to insert in your Word document. The method differs in versions of Word that use the older toolbar and menu interface, such as Word 2003, and the newer ribbon interface, such as Word 2007 and 2010.


In Word 2003, select "Picture" from the "Insert" menu and then select "From File" from the "Picture" submenu.
In Word 2007 and 2010, select "Picture" from the "Illustrations" group in the "Insert" menu ribbon.

, Newer versions of Word offer more options for modifying your photographs than do older versions, bordering on the options available in Microsoft Publisher. The 2 most likely modifications you will want to make to a photo in a Word document are resizing and cropping.


To resize a photo, click it to display sizing handle dots. Move your cursor over 1 of the dots, so that it changes to a 2-headed arrow. Drag the handle toward the center of the picture to make it smaller and away from the center to make it larger.
To crop a photo, click it to display the sizing handle dots, then select the cropping feature from the "Picture" toolbar in Word 2003 or from the "Size" group in the "Picture Tools Format" ribbon in Word 2007 and 2010. The cropping handles change shape, and your cursor changes shape to a cropping tool. Place the cropping tool over one of the handles and drag the handle inward until the area you wish to crop disappears.

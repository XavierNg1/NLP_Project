 To do this, imagine a line from your back foot to your front foot, and it runs parallel to the sideline.;
,, Use your secondary hand to hold the throat (top of the grip) of the racquet. Let go of your secondary hand when you swing.
 The more you swing down, the more you should tilt your racquet up, so it can clear the net. Also, lean forward for more power. If you don't lean forward the ball will drop into the net.
, After finishing the swing, your hips and and feet should be a bit square. A hard hit would make your shoulders almost face the net.

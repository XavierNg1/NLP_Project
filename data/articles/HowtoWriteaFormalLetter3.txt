 Make sure to fold your letter in one try as a letter with many creases and re-creases looks unprofessional.


If you are using a rectangular standard envelope, fold your letter into horizontal thirds.
If you are using a square envelope, fold your letter in half horizontally and then in half vertically so that is forms a rectangle that can fit into the square envelope.
 Seal the envelope by licking along the seal line or peeling off the strips covering the sticky part of the seal (depending on what kind of envelope you have bought.)

 Make sure your stamp is worth the weight of your letter.

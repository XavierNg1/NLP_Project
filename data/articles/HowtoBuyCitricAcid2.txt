 Citric acid is available as a monohydrate and in anhydrous form. Anhydrous means there is no water, so the citric acid is more powdery than the monohydrate form that has water.Anhydrous citric acid is usually used in bath bombs, but the monohydrate form will also work.
Unless the project specifies the use of one form over the other, either one should work.
 Anhydrous citric acid may be available in the soap making section of craft stores as it is a common ingredient in fizzing bath bombs. Call the store before going there to make sure they have the quantity in stock you need.

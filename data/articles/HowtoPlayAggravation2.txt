, Remember to match the color of your marbles with the base that you put them on., Since all of your marbles are still at base, you must move them out to begin marching around the board.,,

Note: If you do roll a 1 or 6, it is not necessary to move one of your marbles from base to start if you already have other marbles out on the board. You cannot do both; you must choose either to start a marble or move an existing one.
 Again, you must roll a 1 or 6 to start this marble again. Marbles can be aggravated on any space except on their base or home areas., You may now hop around the star spaces in the direction of the arrows. You must also leave the star spaces by exact count.



Ex. Your marble is three spaces away from the star spaces. You roll a 4. You may not enter because you must enter the star spaces by exact count. You must continue around the corner as usual.
Ex. B: You are two spaces away from the star spaces and roll a 2. You may move that marble up to that particular star space. On another turn, you roll a 3 and move three spaces in the direction of the arrows in the star spaces. Since you must also exit the star spaces by exact count, you must wait until your next turn to exit. After moving your three spaces around the star spaces, on another turn you roll a 4 and move four spaces into the nearest track.




Ex. You are two spaces away from the star spaces and roll a 3. You may move three spaces from the space you are standing, to the star space, then to the center Super Shortcut space. On another turn, you roll a 2. You move from the Super Shortcut space and proceed to continue moving around the star spaces. On your next turn, you exit the star spaces.
 You must land in one of your home spaces by exact count.

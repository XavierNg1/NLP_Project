 It's not really recommended to use the Tiger for kittens as they are quite big. Seals and Bunnies will make you look like a kitten.
 This will make you look cute.



In the Pillow Room, say: "I'm a cute little kitten/grown-up kitty with a ripped collar. Adopt me!"
Consider also wearing a Fox Hat if you're a seal. This will make you look more like a cat.
 Use one or two of the following colours for your body: brown, grey, white, black, orange. Use one of the following colours for your pattern: brown, grey, white, black, light orange. Use one of the following patterns to determine the type of cat you are: lightning (tabby cat), spotted (tortoiseshell cat), no pattern (plain cat).

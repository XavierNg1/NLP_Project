 Think of a word that means the same as the word you’re trying to learn. Then think of a song or quote that includes the word you already know, and switch the words. Sing or say these to yourself over and over again until you get them into your head. An example might be:“I’ve obtained you, babe” rather than “I’ve got you, babe”
“What’s the big notion?” rather than “What’s the big idea?”

, Search for your word in the search engine function of online video sites. It can be really helpful to hear the word spoken, see the footage, and be able to link the word and the video. If you play the video enough times, you will start to hear the word in your head in the voice of the person on the video. This can help you differentiate it from all the other words you’re studying., Record yourself saying the words, then saying them in a sentence, or as part of a song or quote. Listen to your recording repeatedly. For many of us, listening to something over and over works even better than using flash cards.
 Using the list of vocabulary words you need to know, have a friend ask you what one means and then use it in a sentence. It’s a good way to force yourself to prove to someone else that you know the words, and saying it out loud can help in the memorization process.

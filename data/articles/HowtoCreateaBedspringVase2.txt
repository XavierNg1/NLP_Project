 This helps the bedspring to be spray painted easier. Dust it with a brush or something light to remove the dirt.
 Do it carefully because the springs might snap.
 Instead, you can also sand the tip of the rough edge. Do this to the side where the base if not going to stick to.
 For now, we will use a simple round metal piece with a lifted rim. If you want, you can use a strong scissor across the can (at least 1 inch will do in height). You could also get a strong metal piece and cut it then bend it so the edges are there. Another option is plastic etc. just cut it into the desired size and super glue or solder another plastic rim around it.


The edge or rim is needed so when you put the flowers in, the flowers won't fall out.
If you want, you can remove it's rust, spray paint and primer it on a large work space.
Do the same thing to the bed spring. Color it with any color as desired.

Don't forget to let them dry.


You can spray paint it multiple times with different colors so each spring is a different color.

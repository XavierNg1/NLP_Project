 Take three ice cubes from your freezer and place them in a sealable plastic bag. You may want to double bag the ice cubes to ensure the plastic doesn’t tear as you press the cubes into the gum.A sealable bag is your best choice because it will trap the water as the ice cubes melt.
You may want to place a rag between your hand and the ice cubes to make it more comfortable.;
, Touch one of the ice cubes through the plastic onto the gum. If it’s warm out, you may need to switch to the other ice cubes as the first cube melts or breaks apart. Keep the ice in contact with the gum until it freezes all the way through and is hard to the touch.The gum needs to freeze all the way through to stop sticking on the other side.
Get more ice cubes if you need to.
 Instead of using ice cubes, you can also use canned air. Insert the straw nozzle from the canned air into the gum and spray. Remove the nozzle and the edges of the gum as well until the piece of gum is frozen solid.Be careful not to insert the nozzle too deep so as to pop the gum and make a bigger mess.
Be careful, the temperatures coming from the canned air can be cold enough to hurt you.
 Once the gum is completely frozen, use a butter knife to scrape it off of the upholstery. Most of the gum should come off in one piece, but there may be bit of gum or residue still stuck to the seat or carpet.Try to pick out any bits of gum that remained, or reapply ice to them to freeze them as well.
Once the gum warms up, it will be hard to remove again.
 Once the gum itself is removed, use a carpet or upholstery cleaner to clean the area and ensure there is no stain left behind after the gum has been removed.Follow the directions on the upholstery or carpet cleaner of your choice.
Ensure all the gum is gone before using the upholstery cleaner.

 FreeMind is a free mind mapping site online- however, you could just use a piece of paper. After mindÂ mapping far enough, you'll have a consistent amount of topics to blog about.;
, You probably won't have a ton to write about if your blog is entitled 'Pet Rocks Through the Ages,' but if it's called "Classic Gardening," you'll have plenty to blog on.
 If you don't have a creative streak, then you could always post news articles on the blog- those will always be interesting to readers.
 You don't need to talk about that new high-tech keyboard that Lenovo just came out with- instead, find a cool feature on your own gaming keyboard, and blog about how impressed you are with it. It doesn't need to be huge to blog about- find small things that you know others might appreciate.

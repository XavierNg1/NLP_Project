 The Kangal's gait is fluid and relaxed with strides of moderate length. When running, the Kangal has a single track gait. This means that the Kangal's legs converge to a single line as it runs faster. Kangals also have a high endurance and are fast and agile.When viewed from the side, the top of the head, neck, and back of the Kangal form a straight line. This gives it an appearance of stalking.
 Because Kangals were traditionally used to guard livestock, they possess a temperament that is typical of these types of dogs, i.e., territorial, alert, and defensive. However, although Kangals are guard dogs, they possess a calm and reasonable temperament. They are also very intelligent and independent.They are not naturally aggressive dogs, however, they can be bold, dominant and territorial if challenged.
 A Kangal breeder should be able to distinguish between a pure bred and a non-pure bred Kangal. Ask your local Kangal breeder for clarifications concerning the Kangal’s physical appearance and temperament.

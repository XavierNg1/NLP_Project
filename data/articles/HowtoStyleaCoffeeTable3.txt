 Keep all of the smaller items you want to display together in a tray. For example, you could use a rustic wooden tray to display vintage collectibles. Keep the tray organized by only displaying a small number of items. You can also put any remotes in the tray to keep them together and help them blend into your decorating scheme.For a very modern look, use a tray with a mirrored bottom with a set of small, sleek vases, gilded anemones, or glass balls.
Consider hiding the remotes in pretty boxes in the tray.
 Display items that will tie into your decorating theme. For example, if you have a nautical theme get a blue or white tray. Include pretty shells, lovely driftwood, pieces of sea glass, and even consider sprinkling some sand on the bottom of the tray.If you have an art deco look, find a tray in rosewood or shagreen and display items that have a 1920s feel, like glass beads, an old metronome, and postcards.
For a country cottage feel, use a wicker tray and display small bowls of potpourri or small animal figurines.
 Add candles to your table as a decorative and practical item. Light them to create ambience or even to scent the air. Display candles that can stand alone or in candle holders. Make sure that the candle holders complement your tray if you place them there., Display items that are important to you, like special antiques or vases. Keep items from any collections or hobbies you pursue in your tray, like elegant knitting needles and interesting yarn. If you have a striking art object, you can place it in the tray by itself or as a focal point in the middle or on top of other items.

For example, arrange a pair of small clocks surrounded by pocket watches in a tray.
Surround a tall piece of art with items that are lower, like a tall sultan canister with some shorter canisters or glass bottles.
Consider making a very special objects dâ€™art the only item on your coffee table -- without the tray.

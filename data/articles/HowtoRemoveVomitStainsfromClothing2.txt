 Apply a generous layer, enough to cover the stain to about 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) thick. The baking soda will absorb the smell and also help lift the stain from the fibers.
 The baking soda will begin to fizz. Rub the stain with your fingers or a toothbrush. Try to rub out as much of the stain as possible.


Rinse the baking soda/lemon juice mixture from the clothing with warm water.
 Before soaking, agitate the detergent by rubbing it with your fingers, scrubbing it with a toothbrush, or rubbing the fabric against itself.


Allow the garment to soak for at least an hour, maybe more if the stain is very stubborn.
Rinse the clothing with warm water after soaking. Treat the stain with dishwashing liquid once more, then wash as normal.

Any financial account numbers. If you must include financial account numbers, use only the last four digits.
The names of minors. If you must note the minor involved, use the minor’s initials only.
Dates of birth. If the individual’s date of birth must be included, only include the year.
Home addresses. If the individual’s address must be noted, such as in a criminal case, use the city and state only.
 To make sure you caught all the information that needs to be redacted, you may want to ask a trusted individual to verify that you did not miss any information. Sometimes, having another set of eyes on the document can also help to catch any information that you may have missed.

These individuals are trained to do redactions and can verify the document for you to ensure it contains no errors or mistakes.

 Each hospital and birthing center will have different regulations regarding who can and cannot be in the delivery room. Some may only allow two or three people at a time while others do not have a limit. Some may permit children while others will not allow them in until after the birth.You might want to ask them:


“How many people can be in the delivery room during birth?”
“Do you have restrictions on who can be in the delivery room with me?”
“Do you allow children into the delivery room?”

, If you are planning to have a C-section, understand that usually only one person will be allowed back with you. Even if you are not planning to have one, choose a person, such as your partner or your mother, to join you in case you need a emergency C-section. By planning ahead, you will make sure that the right person can join you., Sometimes, there are events that prevent people from making it to the hospital in time, so find someone else to step in if need be. Ask these people ahead of time to be your back up delivery crew just in case your preferred team cannot make it. For instance, you might ask your best friend, “Just in case my partner can’t make it to the hospital in time, can I ask you to be on call?”

, Your doctor should be aware of any birth plans that you have. Once you have chosen who will be your support, inform your doctor. You should also tell your doctor who your back up is. This will ensure that the right people have access to the delivery room when it is time.You might say, “I want my husband and my sister there, but if they can’t come for whatever reason, my neighbor will be there instead.”

 If you demonstrate symptoms or suspect that you may have a LD, the first step toward seeking help is to contact your personal doctor. Your physician will discuss your options with you, and more specifically, look for any further symptoms.If necessary, your physician can point you in the proper direction for further screening.


This is not a diagnosis, but rather, only the first step of several that are required to be properly diagnosed.
Being properly diagnosed includes initial consultation, screening, and then final diagnosis.
 Screening is an informal process that takes place between you and a LD advocate. After you have been screened, your advocate will inform you whether-or-not you should pursue further diagnosis.


Screening is relatively inexpensive.
It consists of observation, an interview, and brief testing.Mental health clinics and state rehabilitation agencies can provide initial consultation.Mental health clinics and local universities often times provide assessments that are priced on a sliding scale., This does not necessarily mean your medical physician--most general practitioners are not licensed to diagnose LDs--but instead, a clinical or neurological psychologist.After your advocate is finished evaluating all of the information, you will need to meet with him or her again in order to discuss the results.
 During this meeting your advocate will diagnose and provide you with a written report that details your specific LD. This report will provide learning specialists with the information that they need to provide you with any further help.


This report can also be used to make a request for special accommodations at school or work.
 When you return to discuss the results of your evaluation, be sure to ask your advocate about anything that is unclear to you. Are there any terms that you do not understand?
Are you unclear as to what to do next? Or what your advocate expects?

 If you want to avoid creating an account altogether, you can still view and browse YouTube’s content using the search bar and recommended video lists.


A Google account is not necessary to view/browse videos with the mobile app either.
Age verification is done using the birthdate on your Google account, and thus is required to view age-restricted videos.
 You can use YouTube’s gaming service to watch live streamed games and gaming related news.


Chat and subscriptions require an account to use.
 Click the “Share” button, located below “Subscribe” under a video to bring up a menu with various links to social media sites as well as a shortened URL for easy sharing.


On mobile devices, tap the video while watching to bring up the options and tap the “Share” icon (curved arrow) in the upper right corner to bring up a menu of options to share that video.
You can link to a specific time in a video by appending the video’s URL with “#t” followed by the timestamp. (For example, “#t=1m50s” will link straight to 1 minute and 50 seconds into the video), You can use a TV-optimized version of the site when connecting your computer via HDMI or other tv connection. If you own a chromecast you can cast videos from your mobile device by tapping the “Cast” icon (screen with broadcast waves) in the upper right corner of a video.

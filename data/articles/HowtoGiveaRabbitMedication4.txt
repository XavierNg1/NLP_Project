 Sit down with your rabbit on your lap, facing away from you. Using your non-dominant arm, hold your rabbit under your arm like a football. Your rabbit is likely to stir, so be ready.
 While maintaining pressure on the rabbit (to keep them still) with your arm, use that same hand (your non-dominant hand) to hold the eye open.
 Apply a line of ointment along the edge of the eyelid with the other hand (your dominant hand). You may need someone to help you the first time you try this.Be sure to review the medication's packaging to know exactly how much to use, and how often to reapply.
Repeat on the other side, if necessary.
 To insert eye drops, hold your rabbit in the same way, and open the eye. Place the drops inside the rabbit's bottom eyelid. Once again, review the medication's packaging to know how many drops you need, and how often.Repeat on the other side, if necessary.

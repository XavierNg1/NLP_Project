 While performing this task, be careful not to disturb the hierarchy of the layers.


Go to the "Layers" panel and click a square in the second window from the left to hide, or unlock, the layer.
If you want to keep all the layers in their current positions while you're working on your target layer, go to the "Layers" menu and click "Lock Others." You also can use the "Alt+click" command in Windows or "Opt+click" with a Mac OS to bring up the menu. Click the square to the left of the layer you want to release. When it is unlocked, the square will be empty. A locked layer will display an icon showing a pencil with a red line through it.
To unlock all the layers, choose the "Unlock All Layers" command from the "Layers" menu.
Remember to lock the all the layers when you have finished making your changes.

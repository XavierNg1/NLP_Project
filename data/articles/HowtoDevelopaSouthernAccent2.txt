 Every way of speaking and culture has its own sayings and colloquialisms. Try to learn some southern ones. Here are some examples:


“Bless her/his little heart” sometimes means that someone is incompetent or that they did something sweet or thoughtful.
“Dad burn it!” essentially means, “Gosh darn it.”
“He chews his own tobacco” means that the person is independent.
“He could talk a cat out of a tree!” means that the person is persuasive and convincing., For example, instead of saying, “Are you ready?” you would just say “You ready?”, Here are some examples:


It can be a substitute for “already,” as in, “I done let the dog out this morning.”
It can also be used emphatically, as in “I done cannot do this anymore.”
It can also mean “did,” as in, “I done my math homework tonight.”(This is archaic Southern; more educated contemporary Southerners don't say this.)

, There are lots of grammatical structures unique to Southern speech, and these are two examples. Use them when appropriate!


Use “might could” or “might should” when you want to imply both that someone could and should do something. As in, “You might could put another log on the fire.”
Use “y’all” instead of “you all.” As in, “Y’all should come here and look at this dawg!” ( Common) or "Y'all uns" almost said as one word "Y'all-uns need to stop that racket right now" - often towards children.
 "Sir" and "Ma'am" are common, especially with child to parent (regardless of age), people in authority, people older than you, or people you don't know well. "Pardon me," "'excuse me," "Thank ya," or "Thankee much" are also common. "Yessir," "Yessah," and "Yes'm" are often meshed into almost one word.

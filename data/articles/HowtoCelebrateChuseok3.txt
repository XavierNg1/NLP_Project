 This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon.


There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.
 It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.
, These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.

 Let one side of the infinity scarf rest behind your neck.
 Adjust the scarf so that the majority of the fabric is hanging down in front of your body. The scarf may hang low, depending on the length of the scarf., Readjust the scarf so that the seams are no longer visible.








If you have a single perpendicular seam connecting the fabric into a loop, hide it at the base of your neck.
If there are seams along the inside of the scarf, position the scarf so that these seams are against your body instead of facing out.

 This program can be downloaded for free from the official website. It can even be installed as an app on phones!

, Buy credit from Skype or get a subscription. Calls to phones cost money, but are much cheaper than calling from a land line.
 If you are using a computer instead of a phone, you will need to make sure you have these things or you might not be able to hear your call and they won't be able to hear you!

, You will still need the number to call using Skype.
 Open the program and click the call phones button (usually on the left). Click the call button once you've entered the number. It will not call until you do this. Enjoy your call and hang up when you are done by pressing the hang-up button.

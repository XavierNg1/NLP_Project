 Place 4 cups of buckwheat (660 g) in a large bowl. In a pot or kettle, heat enough water to both cover the buckwheat and fill an additional three to four inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm). Once the water reaches roughly 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 degrees Celsius), pour the water into the bowl. Pour a ¼ cup of apple cider (59 ml) in with it. Then let the buckwheat soak and soften for 8 to 24 hours., Once the buckwheat has soaked, pour the bowl’s contents into a strainer over the sink to get rid of the water/vinegar mix. Rinse the buckwheat and allow it to drain. Then transfer it to a high-speed blender., Throw in 3 cups of water (710 ml), ¼ cup of liquified coconut oil (54 g), ¼ cup of tapioca starch (40 g), 6 drops of liquid stevia, 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1.5 teaspoons of sea salt. Blend on pulse until the batter becomes smooth.If needed, liquify your coconut oil by heating it in a small saucepan.
 Coat the inside of your waffle iron with a thin layer of vegetable oil to keep your batter from sticking. Preheat the iron to its optimum temperature.Ladle about one cup of the batter into the iron for each waffle. Cook for three to four minutes.Waffle irons’ temperatures may differ from one model to the next. Add or subtract minutes as needed.

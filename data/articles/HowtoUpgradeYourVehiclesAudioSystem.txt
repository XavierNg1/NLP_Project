 You have your high-pushing tweeters, your high-mid fronts, mid-low rears, and low subwoofers.;
, This will pretty much make it feel like the artist is actually in front of you singing. Tweeters only handle a certain range of frequencies, eliminating bass, mids and lows, and providing clear, crisp highs. Tweeters go in your dash to provide a forward sound stage.
 They will cover vocals, especially the little bit of bass that vocals needs to sound realistic. They will also cover most of the music you will hear. These should be the highest quality speakers you can buy. Prices range from 30-150 USD for a pair.
 These will greatly improve the sound quality in your rear seat, but not as much since your sound stage will want to be pushed forward.
 Subs come in a big range and variety. They can be as small as 8" and as large as 15" or more. The differences can be very dramatic based on your car. a 15" subwoofer with the biggest amp money can buy will sound like garbage in a small civic trunk. A dual sub setup may not be the best solution if you are limited on space. ( A little math, a 15" subwoofer has a surface area of 176" while a 10" subwoofer has 78.5". So a larger subwoofer will greatly increase your surface area (15" has more than 2 10"), therefore increase the amount of air a sub can push, and increase bass.
 A simple 2 channel wired to your front speakers will improve your sound the most. A fatter wallet will purchase a 4 channel and wire the rear speakers as well. A subwoofer will not work without an amp.

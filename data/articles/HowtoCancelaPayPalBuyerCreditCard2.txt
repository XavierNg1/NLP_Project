 Without a phone service or customer support representative prompting you for account information, you will have to do some guess work. At the very minimum, your account number, account name, card number, and any other security details issued to you by PayPal should be in the letter.


A customer support representative may contact you by phone or email to ask for more information. Include these details in your letter.
 Your letter should mention that you are interested in cancelling your PayPal Buyer Credit account. If you are cancelling the account because of a negative experience, mention it in the letter. Include any details, like a transaction number, that serve as a reference for the event in question. If there is no event that caused you to cancel the account, there is no need to state why you are cancelling the account. However, since they may ask you for a reason, you can put one if you wish.


Some common reasons for cancelling credit cards are lack of use, having too many open accounts, and moving to a new credit card company.
 PayPal will address your inquiry regarding the cancellation of your account, and may contact you using the information you provided in the letter. Address the envelope to: PayPal Smart Connect, P.O. Box 981064, El Paso, Texas, 79998-1064. For added security, ask your post office about insurance, signature delivery confirmation, or a tracking number for the letter.
 It is possible that a PayPal agent will need to contact you for more information. Make this process easier by knowing where all your account information is and keeping it handy. Consider typing it all into a word document and saving it to your desktop. Or, email it to yourself so it is handy even when you're not on your primary computer.

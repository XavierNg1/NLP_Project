 Tofu is usually sold in square loaves soaked in water. You will need to set it on a stack of paper towels, press another stack of paper towels on top of it. On top of all of that, place a soup can or a book.;
,, Keep in mind that you do not have to fill up the entire bowl. You can turn the tofu around in there once you are ready.
 Do not go overboard with the salt. This tofu is meant to be flavorful, not sickeningly salty. Set the bowls by a frying pan filled with vegetable oil or canola oil.
 Unwrap your tofu and put the damp paper towels in the trash. Place the tofu horizontally in front of you. Cut the tofu into five or six strips. Cut each strip into thirds. From this point, you can cut the tofu as big or as little as you desire.
 It is okay if your tofu squares are still a little damp. Place the tofu on a plate and bring them over to the bowl of cornstarch, bowl of soy sauce, and the frying pan.
, You could dip it in the soy sauce for only a hint of flavor or leave it in for a while for a more pronounced flavor. The longer that your tofu is in the soy sauce, the saltier it will taste.
 Cover the whole piece with cornstarch.
 Flip the tofu with a spatula until it starts sizzling or until it becomes golden brown on one side. Repeat these two steps for all the tofu pieces.
 Do not refrigerate the fried tofu because they will not remain crunchy. Wait a few minutes for them to cool and serve them with ketchup, barbecue sauce, or lemon. Enjoy your tofu!

 Whether you take a walk, use yoga, go swimming or play a sport such as tennis, exercise can reduce your stress and help you feel more energetic and positive.


Involve your children in exercise when you can. It sets a good example for them, and gives you some family time that everyone can enjoy and benefit from.
 Procrastinating, rushing and forgetting are all stressful practices, especially as a parent.


Write down all appointment dates and times in a calendar, or program them into your smart phone. Review the entire week on Sunday night so you know what is coming up.
Keep mornings on schedule by preparing for them the night before. Select the clothes you and your kids will wear the next day, make lunches and set the breakfast table.
 You will feel less stress when your kids know exactly what is expected of them and exactly how you will respond if they misbehave.
 Fighting with your kids can be stressful, so decide what is worth fighting over. For example, fighting with your 4-year-old about her desire to wear a Halloween costume in July might not be worth the stress.
 Keep your kids on a regular routine every day so they feel secure and you do not feel stressed. Knowing what to expect can keep everyone relaxed and focused on the day.

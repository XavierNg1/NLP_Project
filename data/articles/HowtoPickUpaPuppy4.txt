 Puppies can and will get into everything. Therefore, you need to make sure your home is ready before you bring your dog home. That way, you protect both your new puppy and your home.For instance, you can start by sectioning off where the dog will be at first, using baby gates. You may not want a puppy in carpeted areas, for instance, as you'll need to potty train it.
Move any dangerous items out of the area. Take out any chemicals the puppy could get into or put them up high. Take out plants, rugs, and anything else the puppy could destroy or be harmed by.
Tape up any electrical so your pup can't chew on them.
 Before you go and pick up your dog, you need to make sure that you have everything you need for a dog. You'll need a food bowl, a water bowl, a leash, toys, and a crate, if you plan to crate-train your dog. A dog bed or a blanket dedicated to your dog is also a good idea., That is, establish who is going to feed him and when. In addition, decide who will walk it and clean up after it. Also, make sure you establish what rooms the puppy is allowed in.It's also important to determine which commands you're going to use. You don't want one person saying "Sit!" and another person saying "Butt Down!" for the same action because that's just confusing for the dog. Print out a list of commands to put on the refrigerator so everyone remembers., Crates give dogs a place to call their own. Plus, having a crate can help you train your puppy. If you decide to get a crate, have it set up before your puppy comes home.Pick a crate that's large enough for your dog to grow up in. When your dog is full-grown, it should be able to stand up, stretch out, and sit in the crate.

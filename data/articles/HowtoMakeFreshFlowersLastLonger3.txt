 Flowers need food, water, and a clean environment. As such, their water should have a little food, like sugar, and some bleach to slow fungi and bacteria growth. Here's a basic home recipe:


Mix together 1 quart water + 2 tablespoons lemon juice + 1 tablespoon sugar + 1/2 teaspoon bleach. Pour into the vase.
 This is to open the stems up to the water. Cut off the dried bottoms at an angle, the angle allowing them to take up as much water as possible.


Trim the ends, which tend to get gummy and closed, every three or four days to keep them fresh longer.
 Leaves left on the stems below the water level will quickly deteriorate and promote mold. Remove all leaves from the stems below the waterline.
 Top up with water as needed.

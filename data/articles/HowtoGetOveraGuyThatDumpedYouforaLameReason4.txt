 Acknowledge that it is sad, disappointing and painful when someone stops caring about you intimately after a close relationship. But you cannot change the person or change their mind. Remember that you are not the lesson he needs to learn; he has already made up his mind and trying to make him "see reason" is not your role. Ditch any thoughts of revenge or proving yourself irresistible; you will only confirm his decision.
 Maybe he liked you a lot but was confused at the time and truly not ready to commit; if so, at least he has had the courage to liberate you to move on. Be considerate of his feelings, he's trying to get over you too. And don't think that because he hasn't cried or looked at you, or seemed upset, he's forgotten about you. He's probably trying the best he can to distract himself from getting upset because he doesn't want to show his emotions.
 Don't go running after him and asking questions or give him a big hug. Just stick to the smiles and waves for now. Spend time with your friends, hobbies and family. Make some goals for your future. If it gets really bad, go for a trip somewhere to get fresh perspective. In time, you will heal and you'll be ready to look for someone who is ready to commit and leave the lame excuses behind.

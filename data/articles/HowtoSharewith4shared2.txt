 On a new web browser tab, go to 4shared’s website at http://www.4shared.com/ and log in using your registered email address and password.
 4shared’s landing page is your main folder directory for your 4shared files. You can find all your folders and files stored in your 4shared account here.
 Navigate through your 4shared folders by clicking on them until you’re in the folder where the files you want to share are located.
 Tick the tick boxes on the files to select them. You can select as many files as you want.
 Click the “Share” button with the link icon on the header toolbar. A small window with the different sharing options will pop up.
 There are several options on how you can share multiple files on 4shared. All of these are indicated by separate tabs on the small window that popped up.



Find the download links. Click on the Links tab. The Download links for all the selected files will be displayed. These are the links to the files’ download pages. Each of the files has its own download link. You can copy these links to your clipboard and paste them wherever you want to share them across. You can put them on your email, Facebook post, tweet, or instant message. Anybody who accesses these links can download your files.

Embed the codes. If you want to get the HTML codes for the download links, click the More Options tab. The HTML Codes and Forum Codes are displayed here. Each of the files has its own HTML and Forum codes. You can copy and paste these codes to your website, blog, or any forum, and they will properly appear there. Anybody who visits your website, blog, or forum can download your files embedded under the codes.

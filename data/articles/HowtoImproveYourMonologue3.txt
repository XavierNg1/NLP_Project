 Look for keywords such as "I don't care" this is found more often than you'd think, and shows that your character is very laid back, doesn't worry, and won't sweat the small stuff.
 Try it with your regular accent first, then research that accent and know that you only have to change a few letter sounds. For example: The doctor hates pears in Â a british accent would sound like: Tha Docta hates pehs. But most people would probably make it: Tha Dohctah hahtes pahrs. Remember not to over exaggerate the accent.
 A lot of directors look for movement more than words because it shows expression. don't overdo it but don't under do it either.
 don't show up for an audition dressed in a school uniform if you are auditioning for a rebel. Find what you would think your character would wear. However, if you are required by a dress code to stay in a school uniform, then it is acceptable.

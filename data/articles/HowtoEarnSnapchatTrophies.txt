 Trophies are emoji that are added to your trophy case on your profile. You can earn trophies by performing certain tasks in Snapchat, with more advanced trophies available for more time-consuming tasks. When you first see your trophy case, you'll notice that most are locked and hidden.


Your Snapchat trophies are only for your own personal amusement, and do not have any bearing on the app itself. Trophies do not give you access to more features or privileges, and no one else can see them but you.;
, You can see what trophies you currently have from your Snapchat profile screen:


Tap the Ghost icon at the top of the Snapchat camera screen.
Tap the Trophy button at the top of the profile screen.
Tap a trophy to see details. If there are multiple trophies in a set, you'll see lock symbols for the ones you haven't earned yet.
 Snapchat will occasionally add new trophies to earn, usually when a new feature is debuted. Check your case for new hidden trophies whenever Snapchat updates.
 One of the main trophy categories is based on your Snapchat score. The actual way the score is tabulated is unknown, but generally you'll get 1 point for each Snap you send and 1 for each you open. Sending a Snap to multiple people only counts as 1 Snap. The following trophies will unlock as you reach certain scores:👶 - 100
🌟 - 500
✨ - 1,000
💫 - 10,000
💥 - 50,000
🚀 - 100,000
👻 - 500,000

🌜 - Send 50 Snaps in Night Mode. If you're in a dark area, you'll see a Moon button appear at the top of the Snapchat camera screen. This will brighten what appears on the screen. The button only appears when it's dark enough, so you may need to move to a dark area to activate it.

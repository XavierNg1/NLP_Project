Good flea control sprays may have a chemical such as methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Follow the directions on the label to spread the chemical over carpeting and furniture. You’ll need to keep pets and family members away until the chemical dries.These chemicals may also work outdoors and can be used to eliminate flea colonies in your yard.

 After steam cleaning, it’s important for you to vacuum every other day for up to a month. Even a good pesticide cannot eliminate all the fleas.

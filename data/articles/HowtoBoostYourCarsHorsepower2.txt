 These devices modify the programming on your vehicle's computer, called "reflashing," to allow for more horsepower, torque, and sometimes better fuel economy. On a naturally-aspirated engine, the horsepower increase will be quite minor, but with a supercharger you can see huge gains in HP.


Some auto shops will advertise flashing options, saving you lots of money in the process. In practical terms, it's not something people often do themselves, so you might talk with a mechanic you trust about it if you're interested., Aftermarket power modules can be used in a similar way, sometimes offering up to 30 extra HP with proper installation.


To install, look in the driver's manual, a Chilton or a Haynes guide to see how to access the car's computer, then disconnect negative battery cable and unplug the wiring harness from the computer.
Plug in an aftermarket power module. Insert it between the wiring harness and the computer. Reconnect negative battery cable.
 On the upside, re-flashing the computer in your car can be a great and efficient way of upping the horsepower, giving you a powerful ride. On the downside, it's an expensive process that requires you already have a supercharged engine â€” another expensive process. Many performance modifications to an engine can also decrease its fuel economy, and reflashing also generally voids any warranty on a vehicle you've purchased. Know that if you choose to complete the process, it's on you.

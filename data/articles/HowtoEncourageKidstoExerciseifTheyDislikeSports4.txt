 Try to limit your child's use of the TV and computer to two hours a day. This will encourage them to participate in more physical activities rather than sitting around. To enforce this, don't put TVs in individual bedrooms and put the computer in a shared and open space. Set limits for teens on how often they can talk to their friends on the phone and texting., Start small and build up a routine. Begin by doing simple things with your children, like taking walks after dinner or tossing a ball around in the backyard. Make it a point to do it regularly and encourage fun so that it becomes something that they look forward to doing. Once it's embedded into a routine, they will be more likely to participate in the activity without even being asked., Exercise is a critical factor in a child's emotional and physical development and shouldn't be overlooked. Kids that don't exercise are more prone to health problems like obesity and emotional instability. Create a routine and stick to it. Don't make excuses for not exercising and make sure that you squeeze it into your schedule even if you have limited time., Children often take the lead from their parents, so it's important that if you want them to become more active that you also make it a point to be physically active. Exercise in your time off and actively participate in the child's sport of choice. If you have opportunities to practice at home with the child, take them.

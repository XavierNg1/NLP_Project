 In a medium saucepan, combine ½ cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, ½ cup (118 ml) of water, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of lime zest. Stir the mixture well to ensure that all of the ingredients are well blended., Place the pan on the stove, and turn the burner to medium-low. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, and allow it to cook until the sugar fully dissolves, which should take approximately 5 minutes.Be sure to whisk the mixture the entire time that it’s cooking to ensure that the sugar crystals don’t burn or stick to the pan.
 When the sugar has dissolved, remove the pan from the burner, and let it to cool completely, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Next, strain the syrup through a fine mesh sieve to remove the bits of lime zest and other clumps., After you’ve strained the cooled syrup, stir in ½ cup (118 g) of fresh lime juice. Mix well, and transfer the lime cordial to an airtight jar or other container. This recipe makes enough syrup for approximately four gimlets.
If you have syrup leftover, keep it refrigerated. It will last for up to a month in the fridge.

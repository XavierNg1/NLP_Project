 One way to handle milestones is to commemorate the memories. You can do this through a scrapbook or an online photo album. This helps you and your child celebrate each milestone and be able to look back on them fondly.


Make sure that you are in some of the photos too! Your child will also want to see pictures of you as they look through these albums.
You may also want to collect keepsakes and mementos from the milestones, like ticket stubs, items that are firsts, or anything else you and your child would like to remember. You can place these things in a scrapbook so you'll have it forever.
 You may want celebrate milestones by throwing parties or arranging ceremonies. Birthday parties are very popular, especially at ages like 10, 13, or 16. You may also have a party or ceremony for any milestone you and your child thinks is important.


For example, you may have a small ceremony for losing the first tooth, a special treat when a daughter starts menstruating, or a party when going from elementary to middle school or middle to high school.
These parties and ceremonies can help certain difficult times, like changing schools or menstruation, into a positive experience instead of a negative one.
 You and your child may not face every milestone in a positive way. If this is the case, you may want to see a therapist to help you or your child deal with the different growing up milestones. A therapist may be able to help you or your child talk through your feelings and process difficult situations.


For example, if you or your child have trouble with the idea of growing up and getting older, a therapist may be able to help.
If the issue is relatively minor, then you can also read books and articles to get some ideas about how to approach it.

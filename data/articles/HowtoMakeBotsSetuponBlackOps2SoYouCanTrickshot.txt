 The game type you're going to be using is Capture the Flag.;
, Here are the list of settings you will need.


Round limit: Unlimited
Enemy carrier: Yes
Auto return time: Unlimited
Pickup time: Instant
Return time: Off.
 The only thing you will change in this category is the mini map. It will be set to constant.
 The last things you will need to do is change the health down to "80%" (so that you won't get hitmarkers) and the respawn delay time to "off."

, To do this, you will need to run over to their spawn. Get their flag and take it to the spot on the map that you want them to "setup" at, and let them kill you.


This is where the "Return Time: Off" and the "Auto Return Time: Unlimited" features come into play, because the bots will stay near their their flag (trying to get it), and the flag will never automatically return to their spawn.
 After you hit a trickshot you will press pause and then end the game. Then your awesome final killcam will be displayed......Have fun and enjoy!

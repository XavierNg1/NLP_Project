 In a small bowl, mash the raspberries until they reach a jam-like consistency. Press hard to release as much juice as possible.


If desired, add sugar to taste.;
, Use a spoon to separate the raspberry solids from the juice. Put the solids into a tea ball or sachet. Secure the top tightly. Keep the leftover raspberry juices. Set the solids and the juice aside.


Add the orange zest to the tea ball/sachet, if desired.
 Use a large pot or tea kettle to heat three to four cups of water. Bring the water to a boil and remove from heat.
 Place the black tea bags or loose black tea in the teapot and add the hot water. Let the tea brew for for five to seven minutes. Do not let the tea brew for longer than seven minutes, as it may become bitter and overpower the raspberry flavor., At the same time, let the raspberry solids sit in the teapot with the black tea for five to ten minutes minutes. This will add raspberry flavor to the tea. The orange zest flavor will also release at this time.
 Pour the leftover raspberry juice into the teapot and stir well. This will add a stronger raspberry flavor to the tea.
 Use tea cups to serve your raspberry tea. If desired, add a mint leaf for garnish.


Some choose to garnish raspberry tea with a lemon or orange slice.

 A kerf is just a saw cut, and kerfing means cutting a series of these slits so your wood can bend. The result is much weaker than other methods of bending wood, but it keeps the wood permanently flexible along that curve.It is also the fastest approach, and does not require special equipment.
 The cuts must be against the grain to reduce the chance of splitting the wood. Use a table saw to make these cuts along the part of the wood you'd like to bend. Space your cuts evenly (and close together) with a jig, or use a visual indicator on your table to get a consistent distance between cuts., In order to bend your wood more than a slight curve, you'll need to cut almost entirely through the wood. Leave only a thin edge to hold the wood together.
 Bend the wood so the "spines" left by your cut touch, forming a single stress-bearing edge. You can now keep the bend in place by fastening the two ends of the lumber to a stable object. Remember that this is a weak bend, and do not rely on it to support much weight or stress.
 If you want to hide the gaps left by the saw, plug them with wood filler that matches your lumber. Alternatively, leave the wood as-is if you prefer the aesthetic, or if you would like to bend it to different angles.

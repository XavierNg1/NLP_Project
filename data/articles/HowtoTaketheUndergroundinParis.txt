 These can usually be found at tourist information- or post offices, the underground station information offices and sometimes hotel reception desks. Maps are also often displayed on the walls inside the underground stations.;
,,,, Asking the attendant at the station information office for the best ticket to buy is a good idea for first time users. Even if you don’t speak the language indicating what you want would probably be easily done considering where you are finding yourself. If an attendant is not available you will have to face the daunting looking electronic ticket machine. For your first time its probably best to simply follow the instructions and select a single journey ticket. If you don’t understand the language, ask a bystander for help by gesticulating at the place on your map where you want to be.
 On each service line, there are trains going in both directions and it is important for you to know in which direction you have to go to reach your destination. The name of the last station on the line is shown on the front of the train as an indication of the way in which the train is going.
 When the train arrives, wait for the door to open and the passengers to get off first before you get on.
 Preferably not other people.
 Get out at your stop or, if A and B are on different coloured lines, the station where you need change to a different line. If this is the case repeat steps 7 to 9.

 An SSRI can require several weeks to take effect, so you’ll need to monitor your cat’s behavior to gauge how well it’s working. After four to six weeks, you might need to bring the cat back to the vet to discuss switching medications or dosage.It usually takes no more than two tries to find an effective medicine and dosage. A vet’s first or second choice of prescribed medication is effective about 75 percent of the time., Call the vet and schedule an appointment if you notice any side effects after starting your cat on an SSRI regimen. SSRI can cause decreased appetite, lethargy, and stomach upset.More serious side effects include seizure, hyperactivity and, in some cats, hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to a drug., Because of its effects on neurotransmitter levels, stopping SSRI treatment can be hazardous to your cat’s health. You should wait at least four weeks after starting treatment before discussing cessation with the vet. Work with the vet to gradually lower dosages to wean your cat off of an SSRI.SSRI are often prescribed on a short-term basis. In many cases, dosage is gradually decreased and eventually eliminated without recurrence of any behavioral issues.

 Epilepsy is a common disease that affects 20 to 40% of gerbils. The disease is inherited from the parents. Gerbils who are bred from parents that have seizures are pretty much guaranteed to have seizures as well. If you can, figure out if your gerbil is an at-risk breed or from parents who have epilepsy.If your gerbil has seizures, reconsider breeding them so you donâ€™t pass on the gene., Gerbils experience seizures during a certain time in their lives. Generally, seizures start when the gerbil is around two months old. They sometimes increase in intensity until the gerbil is six months old.Often, a gerbil will stop having seizures after six months of age.
 Gerbils can have seizures if they are triggered by extremely stressful situations. Too much handling or inappropriate handling can be a trigger. They may also be triggered if something changes in their environment.For example, a gerbil may have a seizure if you change their living space or even put a new toy in their cage.
Loud noises or too much stimuli in the room can cause seizures. Consider keeping your gerbil in a low-traffic, quiet room if they have seizures.

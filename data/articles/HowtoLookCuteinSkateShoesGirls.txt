 What brand? DC? Look through your closet. What is the main color? Black, white, pink, green, etc. Do you like high tops or low tops? Buy a shoe that goes with your style and compliments the clothes that you already have. Don't buy a purple shoe if you don't have any purple shirts.;
, A cute t-shirt goes with any type of shoe, just make sure that the shirt is either a neutral color or has a color on it that matches your shoes. V-necks look very nice with skater shoes as well.
 Most people wear skinny jeans with their skate shoes, but if your a person who liked to be out there, then be out there! I personally think that high tops look best with skinnies and low tops can be worn best with skinny jeans , boot cut, flare jeans, etc.
 Nothing compliments skater shoes better than an over-shirt. A solid colored hoodie goes great with skate shoes, especially when the hoodie matched the main color on the shoe.
 Add a simple silver necklace or pretty braided bracelet and you'll be ready to go!

, If your body is more plump, try wearing your hair in a updo. Wearing your hair in a simple updo draws attention to the neck and makes it look longer, giving it a longer appearance. Whatever you feel looks best!

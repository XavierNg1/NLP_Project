 A cake stand can be turned into various different centerpiece styles, depending on whether you use one or more cake stands.


For a simple cake stand display, use one cake stand. Place Easter grass on the base and a bunny or chick figurine in the center. Add a few dyed eggs here and there around the outer edge of the stand.
For a more elaborate cake stand display, do the previous suggestion but rest the cake stand inside an egg wreath, with the eggs coming up to the base of the cake stand.
Make a cascading cake stand display. Place another cake stand on top of the base cake stand. Insert blooms into egg cups and place these at even intervals around the lower cake stand. Either repeat this formation for the upper cake stand, or add one larger arrangement in a low vase or bowl.
Place eggs in a glass bowl or small glass pitcher on the cake stand.
Place as many tall glasses as will fit on the cake stand onto it. Fill with water, then add a single long-stemmed flower into each glass. Be sure to make this one right on the spot of where you intend it to be, as it will be heavy. A variation on this is to place a glass vase in the middle with a larger bunch of flowers, then surround this vase with a series of glasses with single flowers.

 Just like with its console version, production of GTA Vice City installer discs for PCs have already been halted years ago, but you can also get used disc installers from eBay or other online selling sites for the same price as its console counterpart.


You can also download digital copies of the game installer from file-sharing websites, but you are strongly advised not to do so because this is a form of illegal piracy punishable by law, and most of these digital copies contain various viruses and spywares that can harm your computer.
 Place the installer disc inside your computer’s drive bay and wait for it to read the disc. Your computer’s installation wizard should open and install GTA: Vice City on your PC.


The installation process will take a few minutes depending on the processing speed of your computer. You’ll only need to do this once.
 Click on its shortcut icon from your desktop to launch the game and start playing Vice City on your computer.

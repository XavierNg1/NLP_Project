 Twist and twist again (depending on your hair length) around the pencil, and turning the pencil around.


Be careful not to turn the pencil too tightly, or it might snap!

, Stick it into the hair, pulling the tip out slightly the other side. Chic, and effective!


For a high ponytail, follow the same steps for the bun, but twist less, and not as tightly. Your hair will unravel with a lovely twist around the pencil, and quite high up. Lovely!

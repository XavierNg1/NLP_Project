 Decongestants can be purchased at your local drugstore. They come in several different varieties:


Decongestant sprays, such as naphazoline (Privine), oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan, Duramist), or phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, Sinex, Rhinall).Pill form, such as phenylephrine (Lusonal, Sudafed PE, Sudogest PE) and pseudoephedrine ( Sudafed, Sudogest).Do not take a decongestant spray for more than three days, as it may worsen symptoms. In addition, do not take oral decongestants for more than seven days without conferring with your doctor. Follow all instructions on over-the-counter decongestants.
 Antihistamines, along with other allergy medicines, are beneficial in relieving some congestion. Opt for antihistamines that also contain a decongestant so that you can treat sniffling and sneezing along with mucus and sinus pressure. Try these natural antihistamines for organic variety:


Stinging nettle. Some doctors recommend taking a freeze-dried preparation of stinging nettle, which is known for its ability to reduce the amount of histamine the body produces.Coldsfoot may be effective as a natural antihistamine. Europeans have a long history of using the plant to cure skin conditions. The leaves can either be ground up into a paste or coldsfoot extract can be ingested in pill form.
Basil may also work as a natural antihistamine. Heat a couple sprigs of basil leaves up under some steam and breathe steam in. Basil may help reassure the body that the histamines it's sending out can be reduced.

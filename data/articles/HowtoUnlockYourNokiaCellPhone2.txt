 If you cannot get your unlock code from your service provider, software is available on online for free. UnlockMe and Nokia Unlock Calculator are recommended options.
 If you choose Nokia Unlock Calculator, simply input your information and then select "Get Unlock Code" at the bottom of the page. Once you have retrieved your personal unlock code, you can go on to unlock your device.
 Once you have done so, key in your unique unlock code and then select "OK." If you have unlocked your phone correctly, then "SIM restriction off" will appear on your screen.

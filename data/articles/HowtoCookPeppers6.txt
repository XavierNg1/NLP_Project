 Cut the peppers into rings, slices, or bite-sized pieces. Small hot peppers are usually cut into rings, but larger sweet peppers can be cut into any of those three forms.


Make sure that the pieces are even in size. Otherwise, if some pieces are larger than others, they may take longer to cook while other pieces will already be done or overcooked.
 Transfer the pieces into a microwave-safe casserole dish and add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of water, just enough to cover the bottom without completely covering the peppers.
 Cover the dish and microwave on high power for 90 seconds to 2 minutes per 1 cup (250 ml) of peppers. Stir once in the middle of the process.


Most of the cooking action taking place results from the steam building up inside of the dish, so keeping the lid on is important in order to keep that steam trapped.
 Drain out any remaining water and enjoy the peppers alone or serve them with another dish.

 In the container from your food processor, mix 1 ½ cups (150 g) of fresh or frozen cranberries, half an apple that’s been peeled, cored, and roughly chopped, half a jalapeno chile that’s been seeded and roughly chopped, 2 green onions that have been chopped, 4 tablespoons (50 g) of sugar, 2 tablespoons (3 g) of chopped fresh cilantro, 1 tablespoon (5 g) of fresh ginger that’s been peeled and chopped, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime or lemon juice, and a dash of salt. There’s no need to stir the ingredients together because the food processor will do all the work.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender. Just add all of the ingredients to the pitcher.
You can adjust the amount of jalapeno in the salsa depending on how spicy you want it to be. Add less if you prefer mild salsa and more if you want a hot salsa.
 Once all of the ingredients are in the food processor bowl, pulse the appliance a few times. You want to process the ingredients until they are finely chopped and well blended, which usually means 3 to 5 pulses.If you prefer a smoother, more liquid-y salsa as opposed to a chunky style, you can pulse the mixture additional times until it has the consistency you prefer.
 When the salsa is completely blended and chopped, transfer it to a medium size bowl. Let it sit for approximately 15 minutes, so the sugar has some time to soften the cranberries. Serve the salsa at room temperature.If you don’t plan to eat the salsa right away, place it in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator.

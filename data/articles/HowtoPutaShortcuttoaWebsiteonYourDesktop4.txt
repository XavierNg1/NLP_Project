 You can add snippets of websites to your Dashboard, allowing you to easily keep tabs on your important content. You'll need to set this up through Safari.
 You'll be able to add just a portion of the website to the entire page, but it will be a static view (no scrolling).
 The website will dim, and your cursor will turn into a box that reveals the site.
 What's in the box will be displayed on your dashboard. Place the box in an area that you know will always display the content you're looking for.
 You can make the box any size you'd like within the confines of the window.
 You'll be taken to the Dashboard screen and your new website snapshot will appear. You can click and drag it to reposition it on the Dashboard screen.
 You can launch the Dashboard from the Launchpad in your Dock.
 Any links you click will immediately be opened in Safari. For example, if you created a snapshot of the main page of a forum, clicking any thread links will open that thread in Safari.

 For catching catfish, use smelly foods in a cheesecloth or a sealed container with holes in it. (This is for when you are fishing in shallow waters without a fishing rod.) The only kind of food you need to be careful to not fish with is trout and salmon, as they can promote the spread of what’s called “whirling disease,” which is a type of parasite that can kill a lot of fish., Simply crush them, add water and make into little balls. Then you fit them around the hook. Wheaties work well (called Wheatie balls). You can also use red soda instead of water, as it attracts the fish more.
 The biscuits are usually sold in any shop or supermarket. Also pick up the smelly bait, for example, maggots or chicken liver. Crush the biscuits into crumbles. Put the crumbles in a bucket or bowl. Add the other baits.


Next, add a small amount of water to make a slushy kind of ball. Mix them all together. You now have a cheap homemade bait that's ideal for attracting fish.
 Because it works as well as live bait but without the mess, it’s a time-tested favorite among fishermen. Simply thread as many kernels that you get onto the hook. Throw your line out, and prepare to catch a small mouthed fish, like bream, as soon as it hits the water.
 Chicken livers are one of the most popular bait choices for new catfish anglers, but they tend to be a little more popular than they should be. They will catch some fish but the hassle of using them is often not worth the return. Turkey livers, on the other hand, catch more fish than chicken livers and are much tougher, so they are a lot less hassle to work with.

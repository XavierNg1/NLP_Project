 Have everyone line up on the side of the trampoline, forming a single file.
 The first person will start by doing a move/trick. For example, a front flip, side flip, back bounce, etc.
,, This continues until a player does a move that is too similar to one already done, or can't think of a move. They are then out.
 The game continues until there is only one person left.

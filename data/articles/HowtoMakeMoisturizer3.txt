 Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water and place it on the stove. Set a heat-safe glass bowl on top and make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.


This is a beeswax-based moisturizer, so it is best to use it on the body and not on the face.
 Chop up the beeswax into smaller pieces first, then place it into the bowl. Turn the heat to medium, and wait until the wax starts to melt. Stir it occasionally with a spoon to help it melt faster. This will create the base for your moisturizer.
 Keep stirring until the coconut oil melts and gets evenly mixed into the melted beeswax. Coconut oil is naturally moisturizing, but some people find that it clogs pores. If you tend to get a lot of blackheads or acne, you may wish to omit it or replace it with shea butter.
 Keep stirring these until they melt and combine with the beeswax mixture. All three are wonderful for the skin. They are not completely necessary, but they can take your moisturizer to the next level.
 Carefully lift the bowl off of the saucepan and set it down on your counter. Stir in the sweet almond oil. If you can't find any sweet almond oil, try any of the following:


Apricot seed
Avocado
Jojoba

, You can use just one type of essential oil or a combination of different types. If you wish to use more than one type of essential oil, make sure that you end up with 10 to 15 drops total. For example, you could use 5 drops of lavender essential oil, 3 drops of frankincense, and 3 drops of rosemary. All of the below essential oils are wonderful for the skin.


Carrot seed
Clary sage
Frankincense
Lavender
Myrrh
Rosemary

, Avoid using a plastic jar, as the chemicals in the plastic may eventually leach into the moisturizer. The essential oils may also corrode the plastic as well.
 Store it in a cool, dry place, out of reach of sunlight, and use it within 6 months.

Menus. How cute would it be to have a Chinese take-out menu as your book-cover?
Magazines. Be a little careful in your use, as you do not want your math teacher to think you are reading a fashion magazine in class!

, Be sure to label your school books prominently on the front and the spine.â€”When you're racing to class it should be clear which book to grab.

 Here is a great time to show a bit of personality. Some art ideas include:


Using decoupage

Your own drawing and artwork.
A watercolor wash. (Done, of course, before you put the cover on the book!)
Collages made of magazine cut-outs.

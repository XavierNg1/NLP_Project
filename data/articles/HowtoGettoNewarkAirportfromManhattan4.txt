 This is the costliest option, and it may take much more time than the other methods â€“ especially if traffic is bad. The upside is that you won't need to take any public transportation, and you won't need to navigate the complexities of a multi-leg journey.Call a cab or an Uber, but only if you must. In most cases, this will be much more expensive than public transportation.
 If you have a car, you can drive through the Lincoln Tunnel, then get on I-95 South toward Newark. You will need to stop for a toll booth several miles after entering New Jersey.
 Take the right ramp from I-95 onto I-78W toward Clinton/Newark Airport. You'll need to stop for another toll booth.



Be aware that some taxis will not take you across state lines.

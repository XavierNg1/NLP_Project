 Whenever you're creating (or collecting) the eggshells, crack with care so that a large portion of the bottom half of the egg is left intact and unbroken. Keep the eggshells cracked side up in an egg carton, for ease of working with and moving about.
 Position the eggshells so that the inside of the egg is facing upward. Donâ€™t remove from the carton as the carton will hold the eggshells in place.


For more precision when working with a single egg, use an egg cup, as shown in the images. Return the filled eggshell to the carton when done.
 Center the wicks in the approximate middle of the eggshell.

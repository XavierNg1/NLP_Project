 You'll need a pretty good idea of when your favorite radio stations are holding these contests. Sometimes a station will randomly welcome callers to enter these types of contests. Choose a few stations and write down the times for when they begin the contest.;
, Be careful to save the number that the DJ lists for callers to call in on. If you get the wrong number, you could easily mistake it for a busy signal., If your phone doesn't have speed dial, then store the number into your favorites. This will increase the speed at which you'll be able to dial the number.
 Calling into the station at any old time could get you nowhere. Listen for the DJ to actually say we are now accepting callers for a chance to win yada yada.If you're caller number 4, 7, or 9 in the giveaway you shouldn't give up. Even if you're caller 9 and they're looking for the 10th caller, don't give up. DJs often get distracted and don't always answer the phone calls in the order they started ringing.
 Lots of people will also be calling into the station. Chances are that you'll call-in at the same moment as someone else. Hang up as quickly as you can and redial.


Remember that the phones inside the studios don't ring out loud and they just have a little flashing light. Don't give up when no one answers in 20 rings. They may be getting to you.
 The radio station usually starts accepting calls after the contest has been solicited and the new song or commercials have started. You should wait until they say they are going to play the music or news so that you have a chance for your phone to ring.

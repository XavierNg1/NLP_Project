 Incorporate a wipe-down of your garbage can into your weekly cleaning schedule. If you wash the trash can frequently, you may find that strong smells take much longer to build up. Start with an empty bin, then follow these steps (preferably outside).Wipe out any chunks with a wet paper towel.
Spray down with a bleach-based disinfectant, and distribute evenly with a dry paper towel.
Let the disinfectant dry. Ideally, place the can outside while this happens.
 After washing the trash can, you may notice that it looks clean, but still smells strange. You can deodorize without using household cleaners by making a solution of one part vinegar to three parts water. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture, coat the inside of the trash can, then wipe with a dry paper towel., Every once in a while--perhaps every three months--you should give the can a deep clean. Giving your trashcan a bath is time-consuming, but the squeaky-clean results are worth it. Make sure the trash can is positioned on a surface that you can flood with soapy water (like the driveway), then follow these steps.Squirt about 10 seconds’ worth of dishwashing liquid into the bottom of the bin.
Aim the hose into the bottom, and fill up the can until it’s about a quarter full. If you can “pressure wash” with the hose’s nozzle, so much the better.
Pour out the soapy liquid, then rinse with plain water and allow the can to dry in the sun., If you want to be really thorough about the cleaning process, pour a little bleach or bleach-based disinfectant onto a paper towel, then wipe down the inside of the trash can with it. This is only safe to do if the dishwashing liquid you used does not have a message on the bottle saying “do not mix with bleach.”

You cannot add extensions to Microsoft Edge, so you will not be able to block YouTube ads if you use Edge as your primary browser. You can use Internet Explorer as your YouTube viewer and switch to it whenever you want to watch a YouTube video.
 You can find this at the bottom of the Manage Add-ons window. This will open a new browser tab for the Internet Explorer Gallery.
 This should be at the top of the list. An installer will begin downloading.
 Follow the prompts to install Adblock Plus for Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer will be closed during installation.


If the installer isn't working properly, download the latest version from adblockplus.org and try again.
 You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to load Adblock Plus when you first start Internet Explorer.
 Adblock Plus's default settings should automatically block YouTube adds. Try loading a YouTube video to see if the extension is working.

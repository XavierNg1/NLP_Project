 Use colored paper to make a colorful frisbee. You will need to fold all eight sheets into claws to create your frisbee., Use tape to secure each claw together. Continue inserting the claws into one another to create an octagonal shaped donut.
 Use scotch tape or duct tape to give stability and strength to your paper frisbee.


Use tape to connect each claw together.
Wrap the entire frisbee using decorative tape to add stability and a design element.
 You should be able to get considerable distance with the ring shaped frisbee.


If you use duct tape to wrap the frisbee it should be used outside because it can be thrown a long way!

 Fold the bottom right corner over to touch the left side of the paper, lining up the sides exactly to form a triangle. If you are using an ordinary rectangular sheet of paper, there will probably be an unfolded "extra" section above this triangle. Cut or tear this section off. What you are left with is an isosceles right triangle, with one 90ยบ angle and two 45ยบ angles.


Construction paper will make a more durable clinometer, but you can use any sheet of paper. You may want to tape or glue the triangle together to make it sturdier.;
, Position a drinking straw along the longest edge of the triangle, or hypotenuse, so that one end extends slightly out from the paper. Make sure the straw isn't bent or crushed, and runs straight along the hypotenuse. Use tape or glue to secure it to the paper. You will be looking through this straw when using the clinometer.
 Choose the end of the straw that is level with the corner, not the one where the straw extends beyond the paper. Use a hole punch or a sharp pen to make a hole in the triangle near this corner.
 Push a string through the hole, then tie a knot or tape it to keep it from slipping back out. Use enough string that you have at least a few inches (several centimeters) dangling at the bottom of the clinometer.
 Use a metal washer, a paper clip, or another small object. The weight should dangle 2 inches (5 cm) or more below the corner of the clinometer so that the string will swing freely.

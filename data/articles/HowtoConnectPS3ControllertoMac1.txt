 If you have a PS3, disconnecting it will prevent your controller from attempting to connect to the PS3 rather than your Mac.;
, This is the Apple-shaped icon in the top left corner of your Mac's screen.
 This will open your Bluetooth menu.


If your Bluetooth detection isn't already on, turn it on by clicking the "Turn Bluetooth On" button in your Bluetooth menu., This should go in one of the rectangular USB slots in the side of your Mac's casing.
 This is the circular button in the middle of the controller; pressing it will begin the syncing process.
 Once the phrase "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller" displays with the word "Connected" underneath, your PS3 controller is connected.At this point, you can unplug the USB cable. Since the controller is connected via Bluetooth, you shouldn't have to use the USB for anything other than charging your controller with your Mac.
 Although there aren't many games released for Mac, your PS3 controller should work with any that are!

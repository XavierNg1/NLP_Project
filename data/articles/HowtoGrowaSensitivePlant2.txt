 Mimosa pudica or sensitive plants prefer warm, sunny, indoor locations (like in a window) with temperatures between 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C).


The sensitive plant can survive outdoors in the summer (in hardiness zones 9 to 11) but it has a tendency to spread and become weedy.
 The sensitive plant should be watered regularly to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Try to use loamy soil for improved drainage, as this can prevent root rot.


During growing season, fertilize the sensitive plant approximately every two weeks with a diluted high-potassium fertilizer.
 The sensitive plant is not particularly prone to disease, but it may become infested with some common pests, such as red spider mites, mealy bugs and thrips. These can be removed by spraying the plant with a direct stream of water.


Avoid using insecticidal soaps, as these can turn the leaves of the plant black.

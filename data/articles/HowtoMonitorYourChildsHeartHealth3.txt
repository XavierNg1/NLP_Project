 In order to measure your childâ€™s pulse, have them get in a supine position with their upper body slightly elevated. For example, you might have them recline in a recliner or lay in bed with pillows propping up their torso. This will ensure that blood is circulating properly through their body and give you an accurate measurement., Have your child slightly lift their chin so that their neck is exposed. However, they should not raise their head so much that the muscles tense. Then place your pointer and middle finger in the middle of their neck between their larynx and the sternocleidomastoid muscle., Press down slightly until you feel the pulse. If you do not feel the pulse or it is weak, move your fingers until you find it. Once you find it, count the beats for one minute. Repeat the process if you want a second set of results to compare.

 About a month before the surgery, your doctor may have you take supplemental iron to boost the hemoglobin in your blood system.;
, This will explain what you will be going through while you are in the hospital and what to expect when you go home for recuperation.[[Image:Deal With and Recover From Complete Knee Replacement Surgery Step 2.jpg}}, Post-surgery rehabilitation will be significantly easier if your muscles are stronger. Ask your doctor for exercises you can do at home to prepare, or consider working with a personal trainer or physical therapist. Physical therapy before surgery can allow you to gain control of your body faster (researcher Beaupre conducted a study in 2004 and found that everyone who exercised had shorter recovery times).{{fact|center]] These are the things you will learn during the seminar as well.
, That means donating blood for your own use, should it be needed during surgery, about two weeks before the surgery. Some surgeons use a bipolar sealing device that may reduce or eliminate the need for this step.
 He or she will check your general health, order blood work, a chest x-ray, and other tests to determine if you are healthy enough for surgery.
 Last minute details will be discussed and you will be asked to sign some papers, including a consent form, where you will give permission for the surgeon to perform the knee replacement.
 The anesthesiologist will most likely stop by to review your history and to discuss anesthesia options with you. A catheter will be placed in your bladder so that you won't have to get out of bed to urinate during the first day. You will be in the recovery room for several hours before you are moved to your room. It will be suggested that you leave your valuables at home--your visitors can bring them later, if necessary, along with your toiletries and other personal things. Remember though, you will not be able to keep an eye on them every minute. You may not feel like doing much except resting during that first day.
 Don't be hesitant to ask for it.
, This is often assessed by asking you to rate your pain according to a particular scale.


You may be able to receive visitors, depending on the hospital's policy.
You sometimes will remain in bed for the whole day; however some surgeons have you at least stand up the first evening of your surgery day.
If you are up to it, you can have a meal, probably a liquid diet to begin with. Solid food is usually offered once bowel sounds are heard.
You may be given anti-coagulants, such as heparin, to avoid blood clots in the surgical leg. Likewise, you will probably be given compression hose and/or "leg squeezers" (leggings with alternating on/off air pump) which also help to prevent blood clots.
Your surgical leg may or may not be placed on a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine, depending on your doctor’s orders and whether it is covered by your health insurance policy. The purpose of the CPM machine is to start your knee moving before you're out of bed, to decrease stiffness, and to prevent the development of scar tissue.
Some hospital settings allow for the self-administration of pain medication through an IV pump. This is called patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). When you have pain, you can give yourself medication by pushing a button on the PCA pump. The machine will not allow you to give yourself more than a pre-programmed amount so that you cannot overdose.
If you are having a hard time sleeping, ask for a sleeping pill.
 You will most likely start by simply sitting in a chair for a while. In most settings, you will be shown how to take a shower, either with or without accompaniment.


The physical therapist will teach you how to get out of bed using the log-roll maneuver, which will allow you to get out of bed without putting much stress on your knee. He or she will then teach you how to use a walker. On the first session, you may only walk 10 feet (3.0 m) before returning to your bed or chair. Sitting in a comfortable chair is an encouraged alternative to lying in bed that helps with your lung function and circulation.
 You might walk two to three times as far as the previous session. Pain medication may make walking (with assistance) easier and less painful. Keep in mind that more mobility brings increased circulation and faster healing. Use the CPM machine according to your doctor's instructions.
 Prescriptions need to be written, morning medications need to be administered, and other check-out procedures will take place. From the time your doctor writes the order for your discharge until the time you leave may be a few hours. Have clothing handy; make sure your pants will fit over a swollen knee. Your doctor will give you prescriptions for medication that can be filled at a local pharmacy--a family member can do that once you are resting comfortably at home. These prescriptions are for pain pills and other medications your doctor feels are necessary for your recovery.
 Have the seat slid back as for as possible and the back rest folded down, so that you can move your buttocks as far away from the door jamb as possible. Once inside, you can reposition the seat back to the normal position. Alternatively, you can slide in buttocks-first into a rear seat and keep your leg elevated for the ride home.


If you have no caregivers at your house who can help, you may be able to go to an extended care facility after the hospital discharge. This will give you more time to recuperate, so when you do go home you can tend to yourself more easily.
 When you feel rested, that is a good time to do the exercises you were shown by the hospital physical therapist. If your insurance company provides you with a home CPM machine, use it according to your doctor's discharge instructions. This will leave you little time for anything else, except perhaps a good book or TV.
 If the insurance company does not pay for physical therapy, consider paying for it yourself to minimize the chance of complications. You will need to set up session times with the therapist. The sessions will help you recover faster and more completely.
 Practice walking in a level and safe location and have someone with you during your first walks with the cane. If you have stairs in your home, the physical therapist at the hospital will have instructed you on the use of crutches, and will have tested your ability to negotiate stairs independently with your crutches. If you cannot manage the stairs with crutches, it's best to stay on a single floor, setting up a bed and bedside commode in a living room, for example.


Walking with a cane gives you much more freedom. Remember to keep the cane in the opposite hand from the surgical knee. When going up or down stairs, remember the surgical leg goes down first and the other leg goes up first.
 Being able to drive will depend on a number of factors, such as the frequency of pain medication, whether your car is an automatic or stick shift, and which knee was replaced.

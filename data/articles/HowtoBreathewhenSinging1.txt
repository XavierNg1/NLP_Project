 Take a deep breath, and then let the air out at a slow, even pace. Become aware of the rhythm of your breathing, and make it a conscious exercise. Learn to quickly inhale a large volume of air, then release it gradually as you sing.This will help you hold notes longer and more powerfully.;
, You can draw a much fuller sound from your abdomen than you can from your nose or your chest. Focus on your abdomen when you sing. Let your belly expand as you inhale. Allow your stomach to shrink inward when you exhale.Imagine a ring around your stomach and waist. It expands as you inhale, and it contracts as you exhale. Let each breath move the air from the bottom of your lungs, up through your chest, and then out of your mouth.Notice the natural rising and falling of your chest. When you aren't singing, this is perfectly fine. Only worry about controlling your breath in this way while you are engaged in the act of singing.
 Some singers try to "stop" their voice in between inhaling and exhaling – to take a breath after a sustained note. This interrupts your flow and can actually make for less efficient singing. Instead, focus on breathing “into” your note: try to silently exhale air just before you resume singing. Take deep breaths when you have the chance, but don't let them interrupt the song.


If you are singing a pre-written song, try to take the natural breaths in the piece. If you're performing with a group, make sure to communicate with everyone else: some directors and composers are very specific as to where you breathe.

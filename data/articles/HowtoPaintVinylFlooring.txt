 Start by cleaning the floor with a standard cleaning solution and a mop. Once the floor is cleaned, it must be stripped of its gloss. Use an ammonia-based solution, and clean the floor again. Allow the floor to dry completely.;
, This will ensure that the vinyl's natural shine is removed from the material. Stripping the shine will provide a smooth surface that can do a better job of absorbing the primer and the paint.
 Use a water-based primer that has a sealer included. Apply a thick coat with a roller brush. Cover the entire floor, including corners and edges. Use a brush to prime detailed areas around baseboards. Allow the primer to dry for 48 hours.
 This additional coat will help the paint stick to the vinyl flooring, which is otherwise resistant to paint.
 While the primer spends 4 days drying, go to a hardware store or paint shop to select a vinyl paint color appropriate for the flooring. Choose an oil-based paint, or porch paint that includes urethane.
 Use a brush or a roller to apply the paint to the floor. Paint with even strokes and cover the entire floor. Be careful around any baseboards or molding. Allow paint to dry.
 Two coats will ensure the paint lasts, and will give the floor a bright, even color. Allow the second coat to dry, and if desired, apply a third coat.
 The sealer will give the floor a clear finish, and will protect the paint. Use a paint roller to cover the floor with a polyurethane sealer. Allow the sealer to dry completely.
 Let it dry completely. For extra protection on the floor, apply a third coat of sealer and allow it to dry completely.

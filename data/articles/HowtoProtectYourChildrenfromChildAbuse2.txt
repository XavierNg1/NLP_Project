 Explain that it's not okay for others to touch their "bathing suit areas" (except in health cases, like diaper changing or doctor visits). Explain that if someone is touching them in a way that creeps them out, this is not okay.


When children get older, talk about how they might want to touch in sexual ways. Emphasize that this is normal, and it's okay if they have clear communication: their partner says "yes" and gives continuous consent, and both parties express any reservations or discomfort.
 If another person (child or adult) talks about their "bathing suit areas," pressures them, or tries to make them touch private places on themselves or others, your child should know how to say "no." Advise them to get away from the creep and tell an adult they


Ask your child to identify several adults they trust. That way, if you aren't around when they face a creep, they can go to someone else. Mention a few other adults they could go to if their list isn't very long.
 Just as it is wrong when kids hit or call names to other kids, it is wrong for adults to do this to kids or other adults. Make it clear that this is the fault of the perpetrator, not the victim, and that no one should have to put up with an adult bully.


Encourage the child to talk to someone if they are being bullied by an adult.
 These include:


People who lavish attention on them, to a strange or uncomfortable amount, and want to get very intimate
People who talk a lot about bathing-suit areas with them, or expose themselves
Adults who offer candy, ask them to get in a car or isolated place with them (sometimes saying "will you help me find my lost puppy?"), etc.

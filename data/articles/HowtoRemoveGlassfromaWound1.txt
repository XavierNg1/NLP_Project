 When only a small portion of glass is found in the wound, it can be easily removed at home.


Carefully pull it in the direction from which it entered.
Use tweezers that are sharp.
Don't apply too much pressure to the glass shard to avoid crushing it into smaller pieces.
If you don't have a steady hand, try having a friend remove the glass.
After removal, thoroughly wash the area with soap and running water.;
, If the glass is fully embedded in your skin, tweezers will be unable to grip its surface.


Use a small needle dipped in alcohol to remove the splinter.
Before removing the splinter, make sure that the area is cleansed using an antiseptic solution such as alcohol or betadine.
With the help of the needle, you can carefully and gently dislodge the glass.
Then you can fully remove it with a pair of tweezers.
After, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.
 If you canâ€™t remove the glass with tweezers or a needle, soak the area in a solution of one tablespoon of baking soda in warm cup of water.


This should be done twice a day.
Soaking will soften and loosen the skin, and draw the splinter to the surface.
The glass may eventually work its way out of your skin after several days.

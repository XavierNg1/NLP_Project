 Don't want to miss the trip do you? If your school is having meetings that will provide more information about the trip, attend them. If it's after or before school, see if you can have your parent(s) attend the meetings with you.;
, Sometimes schools have lists to say whether you can or cannot bring something.They will usually give you a list of what to bring or what you cannot bring. Especially for phones, electronics and/or snacks.
 Check the weather for your destination(s) for the day(s) which you will be there. Try using www.weatherbug.com, www.accuweather.com, or any other weather website applicable to your location.
 Include chargers, cell phones, iPods, money, stationery, books, etc. Try packing a small pillow or pillow pet and a small blanket (fleece maybe?). Sometimes your school gives you a list of necessary items so remember to pack those.


Remember not to pack things that can't be replaced or hold personal value to anyone in case you lose, forget, or have it stolen. If you do, put a lock on your bag so no one can steal your stuff.
If you're going to go swimming, remember to bring goggles, a towel, and your bathing suit.
Other things you could bring are fuzzy socks, a portable DVD player, drawing material, cards, and anything else you think you may need!
Keep in mind that your school might not allow electronics so check with your school's policy and ask your supervisors first.
 Don't forget the snacks and drinks!

, Put on fresh, clean clothes. And if you're a girl, do your hair and makeup. Leave for school/wherever you are meeting. Don't forget anything! Wear clean underwear. No one wants to be in an accident in unclean underwear.
 You want to start fresh on your trip and have loads of energy.
 This way you can get a good seat with your friends and beat the crowd while getting on the bus. Plus once you get there you won't have to rush or be scared that you'll miss the bus!

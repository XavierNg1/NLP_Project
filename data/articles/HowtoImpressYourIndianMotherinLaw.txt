 Talk to her a lot and the topic of conversation should be her life, her dreams, her childhood. Every person likes talking about themselves and having somebody to listen to these talks is the most happy thing for them. This will strengthen your bond and is the first step to blossoming a sense of friendship between both of you.
 Know about her taste and favourite dishes (enquire about these dishes, either from her or from some other member of the family). Food is a way to the stomach but sometimes can be the way to a person's heart too.

Your cooking (whether you are good at it or not) will really not matter, but your effort to cook for her do matter to her.
 Days when both of you are free or when she is a bit blue, go out with her. You can go out to the market, cinema, or some other place where she likes to go or is willing to go.

Take her for long drives, it may refresh her.
 Take her shopping, whether it's shopping for her or your own shopping, you can take her with you sometimes. It can be fruitful in cheering her up, and she will certainly notice your affection through doing this.

Buy her gifts, dresses, books or accessories she likes to have.
 While this can be difficult, try to praise her for her qualities or her expertise in cooking or some other act where she is good at. The third law of motion "every action has a equal and opposite reaction",If you praise her, she would also not hesitate to praise you in front of others.

 The very beginning of a basic chain stitch is easy â€” all you need to do is make a small, straight stitch in your fabric. The exact size doesn't matter, but it shouldn't be any larger than a quarter inch or so. This stitch will "anchor" the rest of your chain.To make a simple stitch, just bring the needle through the back of the fabric, then bring it through the front of the fabric near the first hole.;
, Bring the needle through the back of the fabric a short distance below your first stitch. This new hole should be in line with the first two (not off to either side.)

, Bring the needle under the initial stitch from the side. You may need to use the needle tip to work the stitch open slightly. Pull the thread through so that it's reasonably tight (but not so tight that the fabric bunches up.)

, Next, put the needle point through the same hole that you came up through in Step 2. Your stitch should look like a skinny oval or slit. You've just made the first "link" of your chain!

, Now, all you need to do is just repeat the steps above to continue your chain. Bring the needle through the back of the fabric at a spot that's about as far from your first link as you did before.
 This time, pass the thread underneath both threads in the "link" of the chain. Then, put the needle down through the same hole you came up through. Your chain should now have two links.
 Simply continue this pattern to continue adding links to your chain.

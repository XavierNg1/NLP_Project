 When your feet and ankles are properly supported, the muscles in your feet have less work to do. Supportive shoes also keep your feet and ankles in proper alignment, which helps prevent fatigue and cramping.If your feet have high arches, you’ll want shoes that also have a strong arch.
If your shoes don’t provide arch support (or provide too much for your feet) you can replace the insoles with ones that are appropriate for the shape of your foot.
 Even if the shoes are technically your size, they still may not give your foot enough space. You should be able to stretch or wiggle your toes a bit inside your shoes.High heels and shoes with narrow spaces for the toes can squeeze the foot and cause discomfort and cramping.
Visit your local shoe store for a proper fitting. Even if your shoes are a good shape, it’s possible that you’re not wearing the right size.
 It’s okay to want to wear high heels or other dress shoes from time to time. However, remember that these shoes are not for everyday wear or the cramps will continue.Even if you wear comfortable shoes regularly, it can still be good to switch between pairs from time to time.
If a pair of shoes causes you pain after half a day of wear, they should be discarded.

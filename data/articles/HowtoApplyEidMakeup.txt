 Eyes are the main beauty of a human being, so this is the area to focus on the most closely. For the daytime, choose soft, neutral colors that highlight in a natural night. For nighttime, the eyes can be bolder, and will look even prettier with a touch of shimmer or a metallic addition, such as gold.;
, Peaches, browns, and soft tones are good choices. Keep the eyeliner minimal or softened.
 For example, if your outfit is pink, spread a light pink eyeshadow over your eyelid, then go over it with a darker pink. Blend well on the crease, then finish your dramatic look with a dark red or purple on the corner of your outer eye.
 For the evening, add strong eyeliner. You may want to add eyeliner to make the look bolder, especially for the evenings. Use a soft brown colour on your waterline or a white, to brighten and enlarge your eyes. Also line the top of your eyes with black eyeliner.
 Gold eyeshadow is especially glamorous. Add a small wedge above the eyelash line, with the wider edge facing toward the side of your face, the narrow edge toward the nose. Silver or bronze are other choices that you might like to consider.

If you want to keep the look simple, go for a peachy pink colour.
Natural or naked lips are fine for day wear. Add lip gloss for shine.
 You may want to add a lip gloss or Vaseline on your lips to make them look glossier.

 Since you will probably only be in your base, the shotgun is a good choice because of its devastating close range power. That should be your main weapon. Your secondary weapon could be the Assault Rifle, because of its rapid fire and how it sprays bullets. Or you could go with the rocket launcher, which is good for blowing up warthogs that your enemies might take once they get the flag, but it can hurt you if you hit a close by target.;
, All levels are different, but for the levels where the teams have an inside fortress (Blood Gulch, Battle Creek, Ice Fields, Infinity, Hang 'em High, etc) you can wait on top of the base (but keep moving so snipers can't hit you) and shoot at approaching enemies or vehicles with your handgun, doing some damage to them, and then when they are heading into your base to get the flag, jump down into there and introduce them to your shotgun. Or, you can just wait inside the base, crouching and staying motionless until an enemy comes.
 Warn them if you see any enemies coming in advance, so they have enough time to go and defend the flag if you end up killed. Maybe ask for another camper to help you.

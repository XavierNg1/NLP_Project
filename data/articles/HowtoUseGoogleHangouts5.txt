 Open the Google Play Store on your Android device, or the App Store on your iOS device, and search for Hangouts. The app is free to download.


Many Android devices come with Hangouts preinstalled. It replaces the old Talk application.
 When the app loads for the first time, you will be asked to log in with your Google account. Android users can choose the account associated with their device; iOS users will need to enter their Google username and password.


When the app opens, you will see a list of your recent Hangouts.
 Add contacts from the list or search for people by name and phone number.

 Using plastic clear cups, draw scary ghost faces using a black marker. If you'd prefer not to draw on the cups, you can also stick different shaped black stickers to form a ghost. Decorate each cup into a ghost.
 In a bowl, use a hand blender to blend to heavy cream and powdered sugar until puffy and the whipped cream forms., In a blender, blend the ice cream and milk, one scoop at a time. Blend on high speed for about two minutes, until the milkshake is creamy and resembles a vanilla color., Remove the blender off the stand and pour the milkshake into each of the cups., Using a spoon, scoop a handful of whipped cream and top it off on each of the milkshakes., Place each cup on a large tray. Leave the milkshakes in the fridge to chill for about an hour, until the milkshakes become cold and the whipped cream thickens slightly., Remove the milkshakes from the fridge. Top with crushed chocolate chip cookies if desired. Enjoy!

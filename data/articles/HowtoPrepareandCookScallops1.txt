 Avoid shredded scallops or any that seem off-color or misshaped. This could indicate that they were frozen and then thawed or were mishandled. Frozen scallops lose a lot of their texture when thawed and do not always make an appetizing looking meal.


Buy 1/4 pound (113 g) per diner if serving the scallops as a main course, with perhaps a few extras to snack on later or for a more hearty appetite.;

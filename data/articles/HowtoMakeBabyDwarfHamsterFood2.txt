 Hamster mothers require 60% more protein than normal to make the milk necessary to keep baby hamsters health. Feed the mother hard-boiled egg, cooked but unseasoned beef and chicken, and mealworms., Allow a nursing hamster mom to have as many sunflower seeds as it wants. Also give her broccoli, sweet apple, cantaloupe, and peas. It is important that a mother be able to pass down substantial amounts of folic acid, Vitamin A, and Vitamin E to the babies through her milk., If a hamster is less than ten days old, it will probably die without mother’s milk. For that reason, it is imperative that you find a mother to adopt the infant. The mother, however, will only adopt a baby hamster if it believes that the baby is its own. You will need to trick the mother, else it turn against the baby and kill it.


Begin by warming up the baby hamster. Take it in your hands with a small towel. Begin rubbing the baby gently with the towel.
When rubbing the baby, be sure to remove all remnants of its mother’s nest. Any outside smells will alert the new mother to the fact that the baby is not its own. Take some of the nesting material from the mother’s cage and rub it over the baby to make it smell familiar.
Convince the mother to step away from its babies. Try giving it a treat. When it is away, put the adoptive babies with the nest with mother’s natural born babies. Be sure that the mother does not see the other babies being put into its nest.

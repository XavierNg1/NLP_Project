 Car floor mats are often made out of rubber. Especially up north where it can get rainy and snowy, the rubber mats provide good moisture protection for your interior and will dry faster than any other mat would do.


You should pick rubber mats of good quality or else you will end up getting holes in them, which can make the water go under the mat and onto the floor and your interior floor will start to rot.
If the interior floor starts to rot, this will create a really bad smell inside your car over time.
 Use a hose to simply wash the mats, but only on the dirty side of the mat. Don't make the mats wet on the downside.


The hose should help you remove the loosely gathered dirt or food on the rubber floor mats.
You could use a bucket of water if you donâ€™t have a hose, although the pressure from the hose is useful for dislodging loose materials from the mats. You could also go to a car wash and pressure wash them off.
 Mix laundry soap and baking soda with water. This will fizz and lift out dirt. If you don't have baking soda, just use any kind of liquid soap.


You could use spray soap or you could apply the soap with a wet rag. It's not hard to get dirt off of rubber floor mats, so usually soap and water is going to do the trick.
Apply more pressure to your water hose, and wash the mats as good and thoroughly as you can. You could also clean rubber floor mats with baby wipes and hand sanitizer.
 The mats should be dry before you put them back into your car, but if you are at a gas station washing them there, you may not be able to wait.


In that case, place all your mats where they are supposed to be, and put your air conditioning on full heat, and flip the fan switch to full power.
For the best and fastest drying, put the AC Location switch to feet warming, as this will allow the mats to dry out quickly.

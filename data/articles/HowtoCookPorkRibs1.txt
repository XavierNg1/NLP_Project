, You can start with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper and add sauce later, or use a dry spice mix that you rub over the ribs to season them overnight before cooking. Either method produces delicious, flavorful ribs, so it's completely up to you.









If you want to use a dry rub mix, you'll have to plan ahead a bit because the rub needs to seep into the meat overnight. Wrap the rubbed meat in aluminum foil and place it in the refrigerator the night before you want to cook the ribs.Here's a simple dry rub mix that will result in spicy, flavorful meat. Just blend the spices together and rub them on the rack:

2 Tablespoons salt
1 Tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

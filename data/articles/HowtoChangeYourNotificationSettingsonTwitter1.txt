, This tab can be found in the bottom-right corner of the app, and will take you to your Twitter profile.
 This will open a menu with a few different options.
 You'll be brought to a control center where you can modify all of your Twitter account settings.
 There are two types of notifications you'll be able to modify here: Mobile notifications and your Notifications tab.









"Mobile Notifications" controls the types of notifications that appear on your phone regardless of whether or not you have the Twitter app open.
"Notifications Tab" controls the kind of activity that pops up at the bottom of your screen when you're on the Twitter homepage.
 If you have mobile notifications turned on, this is where you'll see a list of all of the individual notification types you can toggle on or off. If you don't have them turned on, you'll see an option to enter your phone's settings to turn them on. Toggle each individual setting to turn notifications of that type on or off.









If you have a broad base of followers that you don't have much one-on-one interaction with, you may wish to turn off notifications when your tweets are retweeted.
If you frequently receive spam in your Direct Message, you may wish to turn off notifications when you're sent a DM.
If you're often mentioned in tweets that you aren't interested in keeping track of, you may wish to turn off notifications for when tweets you're mentioned in are retweeted or liked.
If contacts who you aren't close to are joining Twitter often, you may wish to turn off notifications for when somebody in your address book joins Twitter.

 Online auction websites, wholesale clothing retailers, and online shops often sell decent clothes at lower prices than what you might find in stores.

 Stores that offer free credit cards can quickly get you into debt if you are not careful, but many stores offer email subscriptions, frequent buyer punch cards, or similar perks without forcing you to sign up for a store credit card.

 Craft stores and fabric stores offer a wide selection of fabrics for a variety of purposes. Check the stores' clearance and sale sections before moving into non-sale items.

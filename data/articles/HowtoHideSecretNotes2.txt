 Corn starch ink is used in similar fashion to lemon juice ink, but is a little more complicated. Heat two tablespoons of corn starch and 4 tablespoons of water in a pot over the stove. Stir it into a smooth paste. Heat for 3-4 minutes. This method is harder to detect. Anyone trying to discover your message using heat will be foiled.
 A fine point should be used for this, such as a toothpick or the back of a paint brush. Dip the point into your ink and write your message. When it dries it will look almost completely clear and normal.
 Since passing a blank piece of paper would be suspicious, doodle, sketch, or write an unrelated note on your piece of paper. Preferably this will be done in a color that contrasts with purple (your corn starch ink will appear purple). , Pass your note as you would any other. Try to be discreet so you don't draw attention, but if you are caught it is fine. Anyone scrutinizing the note likely won't know how to unlock the message. Your intended recipient obviously should be informed of the decoding method in advance.
 A mixture of 1 teaspoon of iodine and 10 teaspoons of water is necessary to unlock the note and show the message. Dip a sponge or paper towel in the solution and wring it out so that the sponge or towel is damp, but not dripping wet. Wipe it over the page to cause the note to appear! Don't use a sponge or paper towel that is too wet. It can make the paper soggy and cause the note to run and be illegible!

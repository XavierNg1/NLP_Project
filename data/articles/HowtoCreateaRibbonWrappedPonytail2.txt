 Wrap a hair tie around your wrist first, then pull your hair into a ponytail. You can make it a low ponytail, a mid-height ponytail, or even a high ponytail. Use your hands and a hairbrush to get your hair as smooth as possible.








This look works great with curly or wavy hair!
The hair tie will be covered by the ribbon, so the color does not matter.
 Use your free hand to pull the hair tie off your wrist and onto the ponytail. Wrap it around your ponytail to secure it. You'll probably need to wrap it two to three times.
 Choose a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide piece of ribbon. You can also cut some pretty fabric into a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide strip. The ribbon needs to be long enough to wrap around the base of your ponytail a few times.








The ribbon does not have to be exactly 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). It can be a little narrower/wider.
 Cut a few inch/centimeter) long piece of tape, and place it lengthwise onto one end of the ribbon. Make sure that you are placing the tape on the wrong (dull) side of the ribbon. If you are using fabric, place it on the wrong side of the fabric.









Keeping the tape lengthwise will give your ribbon better grip.
For a neater finish, cut another 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long piece of tape, and place it against the very edge of your ribbon.
 Make sure that the shiny side of the ribbon is sticking out. Also, try to get it as close to your head as possible.
 Afterwards, you can left go of the end, and continue wrapping it.
 Press the taped part against the ribbon that is already there and try not to "drag" it.









Try to get the end of the ribbon under your ponytail, where it will be out of sight.
 The traditional ribbon-wrapped ponytail is nice and sleek, but this one has more of a vintage vibe. Gently pull on your ponytail to give it more volume. Don't pull too hard, however, or the ribbon wrapping will come apart.

 Before you clean the power base, it's important that there's no electricity running through your Nutribullet. Completely unplug the Nutribullet.Do not just turn it off, as it can still electrocute you if it gets wet.
 Get a rag wet under warm water and wring it out thoroughly. Use it to go over the surface of the power base and inside the interior. Remove any food that's built up or gotten stuck in the base of the blender.You can also use a citrus cleaner to clean the power base.


Citrus cleaners use the natural oils in citrus to remove deep stains or food buildup.
Citrus will also deodorize your power base.
Never submerge the power base into water.
Never put the power base into the dishwasher.
 Use a dry cloth rag to wash down your power base then allow the rest to air dry before using it again. You should wash your power base once a week, or whenever food spills onto the base.

 You want a 5 to 6-inch (cc to cc-centimeter) difference between them. The finished wreath will be about the same size as the large plate.


You can also use bowls for this instead.;
, Place your large plate upside down onto a sheet of poster paper or thin cardboard. Use a pencil or pen to trace around it. Put the plate away when you are done.
 Place the smaller plate down onto the center of the circle you just drew, and check to see if the thickness of the border suits you. If it is too thin, choose a smaller plate; if it is too thick, choose a bigger plate. Once you are happy with the size, trace around your plate, then put the plate away.
 Start by cutting out the larger circle, then the smaller one. When you are done, discard the inner circle so that you are left with a wreath shape.


Be sure to work on top of a cutting mat so that you don't ruin your table.
 Chances are, the leaves will be covering most of your wreath base. There may be some gaps, but this should not be a problem if the colors of your wreath base and leaves are similar. If your wreath base contrasts sharply with your leaves, however (ie: you used neon green poster paper for your wreath and your leaves are red and orange), then you might want to paint it to make any gaps less noticeable. You can paint the wreath base using acrylic paint and a paintbrush, or you can spray paint it instead.

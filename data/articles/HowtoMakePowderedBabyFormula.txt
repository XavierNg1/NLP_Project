 You may want to boil a good amount of water to sterilize, depending how much your baby drinks. Set the water aside for it to cool. Then pour the water into jars and/or containers. If you don't have the time to boil water, you can use sterilized water.;
, Depending on the formula brand and your baby's nutritionist instructions, most of the time you will be using "2 ounces of water to 1 scoop of formula".
, You can designate a place in the fridge for the bottles, such as the side drawer.
 Pour the exact amount of scoop(s) of formula into the water. When scooping, do not pack the formula down, just try to level it as much as possible.
 Make sure that there's no clumps in the mixture.

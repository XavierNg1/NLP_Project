, Next, take a lock of hair , hold it and tease the crown of your hair by running your comb up and down the lock of hair. Make sure to leave your hair smooth.Comb all around and be extra careful not to disrupt your curled ends. Bouffants, beehives and pixies and bobs were very popular during the stretch of the 60s, more so than the ultra notorious hippie do. Wigs were very very popular in the sixties for woman. It was normal to have a wig in ones house for a different look. False shed hair was saved for weeks into "rats" and added under beehives to make them larger.



If you are interested in the counterculture of the mid to late 60s, you can opt for straight or wavy, parted in the middle for the hippie look.

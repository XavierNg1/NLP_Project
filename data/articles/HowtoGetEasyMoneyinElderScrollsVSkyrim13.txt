,, Legate Rikke have a loop on programming that will say: You 2 stay here, right? But if you kill enough legionnaires before that, they will infinite spawn on entrance. The difference from other maps is that here the bodies won't disappear. So you will get a lot of corpses and a load of equipment. Wish you had those teleport scrolls from Morrowind, right?

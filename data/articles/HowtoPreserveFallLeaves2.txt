 Start out with leaves that are vibrant, and newly fallen. Coating the leaves with paraffin wax will preserve them at the height of their brilliant color. Dry them off with paper towels before you begin.
 You can buy a a 16-oz (453 g) box of paraffin wax at your local craft or grocery store. Melt it in a disposable cake pan by heating the pan on your stove over low heat.To make the paraffin wax melt more quickly, slice it into thick chunks and spread them evenly along the bottom of the disposable pan.
If you do not use a disposable pan, use a cake pan that you do not plan on using for cooking anymore. The wax can ruin the pan, so you should not use a pan that you frequently use for cooking and baking.
 Exercise caution, since melted wax is very hot. Transfer it carefully from the burner to your work table. Pay close attention to it to make sure that it does not get knocked over, especially if you have pets or small children.
 Hold a leaf at the tip of the stem and dunk it into the liquified wax several times.Make sure both sides of the leaf get coated in wax. Avoid getting your fingers too close to the wax. Repeat with the remaining leaves.
 Lay each wax-covered leaf out on wax paper until the wax hardens. Let the leaves dry in draft-free area for several hours. Once dried, they should lift off the wax paper easily. This method preserves the form and color of the leaves for a long time.


To be extra safe, line the counters with newsprint before lining them with a layer of wax paper. The double-layer minimizes the risk of getting wax drippings on the counter. If they get on the counter, wax drippings can be extremely difficult to scrape off.

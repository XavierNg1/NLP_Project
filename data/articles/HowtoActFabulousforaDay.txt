 Try wearing oversized sunglasses, a fashionable outfit, big hair, red lipstick, crazy fingernails, or a hat. You can personalize this part to make it match your style and what your going for. Try to really have fun with this part.;
, Now that you've got your look, you need a strut that says you're the real deal. The trick to nailing this is not about what you do with your feet, but what you do with the rest of your body. Try keeping your shoulders back and your head up while walking back and forth. For a haughty look try putting one hand on one of your hips and slightly moving your shoulders with each step. Watch yourself in a mirror to see what looks best. The main thing here is to look confident. Confidence is key!

, Again, the most important thing is that you sound confident. You shouldn't be using any "ers" or "ums" in your sentences. Don't stutter or mumble your words, remember to sound definite. Abstain from using slang, but that's your call. You can have lots of fun with this step too by thinking up what your fabulous self is like. Do you have an accent? Do you use french words on occasion? Do you really like to accentuated your consonants? Play around with it until you find the perfect voice.
 You are now ready to act fabulous for the day. To really make an impression concentrate on making everything you do deliberately fabulous. Try to cross your legs when you sit. Smile like you're on top of the world. Stick your pinky out when you take a sip. Laugh fabulously (you decide what that means). Whatever you do just remember to keep your head high, strut your stuff, and be confident. Once you're done being fabulous, you can sigh with relief and be glad that you can be regular great self effortlessly.

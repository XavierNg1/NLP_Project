You’re not counting individual strands, but you can get a sense of how dense your hair is by how much skin you can see.

Thick density: If you don’t see much scalp at all, you have thick hair density.

Medium density: If you see some scalp, you have medium density.

Thin density: If you see a lot of scalp, you have thin hair density.
 Go through this same process at another spot on your scalp. Your hair density may be different at other spots on your head.

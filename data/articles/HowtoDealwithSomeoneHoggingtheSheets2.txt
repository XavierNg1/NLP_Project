 Try to wedge yourself inside the sheets behind them, so that you can actually get some cover. This is great for free heat exchange, and it'll keep both of you snug. Be sure to pull your pillow close too, so that you're not pushing your partner's head off their pillow.


If your partner is in a deep sleep, be careful! They may not realize you're so close and might accidentally elbow you when shuffling in their sleep.
Overheating, pins and needles or difficulty with breathing can ensue if you're stuck in an awkward position or up too close with your partner under all those covers! Shuffle back to your spot if you're uncomfortable.

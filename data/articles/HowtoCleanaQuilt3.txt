 Washing your quilt only when it’s soiled will extend its life. Wash your quilt once per year, even if you use it daily. In between washings, air it outside on a drying rack.If your quilt is a decorative accent that is hardly used, opt for airing it out a few times a year instead of cleaning it.You may need to wash the quilt more often than annually if it’s used by children, pets, or if someone in the home has allergies.
 Try placing the quilt in a sealed bag with a bar of soap for a day or two. Alternately, you can try using a fabric freshener product; just make sure to spot test a small, inconspicuous area first for color-fastness., You can treat stains by gently dabbing them with white vinegar or a quilt soap, diluted with distilled water.Make sure to blot and not rub the stain. Put a white cloth below the quilt, then flush the area with cold water.Don’t use any soap or detergent that contains bleach.
If the markings are lines from the quilting process, you can brush off white lines or dab them with a damp cloth. Gray lines are usually pencil and you can remove them gently with a gum eraser., Rub a lint roller across the whole front and back of the quilt. This will remove lint, pet hair, thread tails and loose threads.If your quilt isn’t very delicate, you can vacuum it on the lowest setting, using a brush attachment covered with pantyhose., If your quilt is not in use, place it in a cotton or muslin bag. Make sure the quilt is clean before storing it. Remove and refold it monthly. Air out your quilt when you take it out of storage, outside or in a drier (on the low, tumble setting).For example, try storing your quilt in a cotton pillowcase.

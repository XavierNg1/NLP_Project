 Confide in a friend, family member, coworker, or staff person at your school. Tell them about what has been going on with you and this bully. Though it might be embarrassing for you, holding it in will only hurt you more in the long run.Go to someone like your Mom and say “Hey, can I talk to you about something? I’m having a hard time with this girl at school, but I don’t want you to call the principal. I want to deal with it on my own, but I need someone to talk to about it.”

, If you know that you will have to walk by the person who teases you or interact with them in any way, bring a friend along. Having others beside you who support you can be very encouraging. If you can’t bring a friend, then only interact with them in public or in the proximity of someone who will intervene.If you have to meet with this person, keep your office door open or meet in a public space.
 Being teased can sometimes make you feel so sad that you don’t want to be around others. However, know that isolating yourself will only make the problem worse. If you only hear the opinions of those who are mean to you, you won’t have any positive comments to counteract them. Spend time with your friends by going to the movies, going out to eat, or just chatting on the phone., Being teased can really take a toll on your self esteem. You might feel like no matter what you do to your appearance, you will still be teased for it. Remember that you are beautiful and wonderful and there isn’t a single person in the world who is just like you. Take care of your body and your mental health during this time so you can face your bully with strength.Exercise, eat healthy foods and meditate or pray daily. Be good to yourself.
 If the teasing is getting worse or violent in any way, report it immediately. Do what you have to do to protect yourself. Tell a teacher, administrator, or supervisor what is going on.

 Optimism about their exercise habits often leads people to pay more than they normally would on gym memberships.Because of this, it is important that you are realistic about how often you intend to go to the gym. You should also think about what things might prevent you from going.For example, if you know that you probably will not go the gym regularly, consider paying as you go instead of committing to a yearly or monthly membership.
Consider things like when you like to exercise and how far the gym is from your home and work.;
, If you're interested in classes such as yoga, step, cardio, boot camp, or aquafit, ask about the price before you join. Many facilities allow you to try the first class for free. If you have a specific exercise style or regimen that you are looking to do, find a gym that caters to that, instead of paying a higher price for a large gym full of features you won't use.For example, if you really want to lift weights, look for a gym that is dedicated to strength training.
 Look around online and compare the prices of different gym memberships. This will help you find the most affordable membership. While you are looking around at gyms online, check websites like Groupon, Living Social, and Gilt City for deals on memberships., Call your local gyms and ask for a non-commitment trial. Most gyms will give you a one or two-week free pass to use their facilities. Visit the gyms during the times that you would normally be working out to see what the crowds are like and if you like the facilities. It is better that you try out multiple gyms to find the one that you like instead of paying and cancelling multiple memberships.

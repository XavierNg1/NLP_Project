 If the illness is progressing from strep throat to scarlet fever, you child's temperature will often begin to rise. Scarlet fever is generally accompanied by temperatures of 101 °F (38.3 °C) or higher. Sometimes your child will experience chills with the fever., Sometimes scarlet fever may occur with a streptococcal skin infection called impetigo, and not with a sore throat.Impetigo causes redness, bumps, blisters or pus in the skin, usually on the child's face, around the mouth and nose., The characteristic sign that strep has evolved into scarlet fever is a red rash. It will look like sunburn and feel rough to the touch, like sandpaper. If pressure is applied to the skin, it might briefly take on a paler hue.


The rash will typically begin around the face, neck, and chest (most common on neck and chest), spreading to the abdomen and back, and, less often, to the arms or legs.
Along the skin creases in the groin, armpit, elbows, knees, and neck your child might develop lines with an ever deeper reddish hue than the rest of the rash.It is common to have a circle of pale skin around the lips., This is caused by the enlargement of the taste buds on the tongue. At first, the taste buds will be covered with a white coating. After a few days, the tongue will generally develop a red, bumpy appearance., As the red rash begins to fade, your child's skin may begin to peel as if after a sunburn. Be mindful; that does not mean that the illness is gone. You should still seek medical attention., You should take your child to a doctor whenever he or she develops reddish skin accompanied by a fever and/or sore throat.Although scarlet fever is easily treated with antibiotics, if it is left untreated, it can cause an array of complications.


Untreated, scarlet fever can cause kidney disease, skin infection, ear infection, abscesses of the throat, lung infection, arthritis,heart problems and problems with the nervous system (rheumatic fever).

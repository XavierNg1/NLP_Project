 Sod is grass that's been pre-grown and can be rolled out on existing dirt. Before laying your sod, you'll need to know how much square footage of sod you'll need. Use a tape measure to measure your lawn and deduct areas where grass won't grow, like driveways or blacktops., Irrigating your lawn with 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.63 - 1.27 cm) of water the night before you plant your sod will prepare the area and will promote the healthy growth of your Bermuda grass. Water should not pool on top of the dirt, but it should penetrate into it.If water pools on the surface of the dirt, it means you've watered it too much.
 Find the longest straight edge of your lawn and begin to lay down the sod. Roll out the sod, dirt side down and continue to push it until it's flattened out. Continue to lay down the sod, edge to edge, until the lawn is completely covered., If you come across an area where the sod doesn't fit, like a driveway or fountain, you can use a shovel to trim around the sides., Continue to lay out the sod in rows so that each row of sod touches the next. If you lay your sod rows too far apart, there will be holes in your lawn., Immediately after laying out all the sod, you'll want to water it thoroughly. Then, to maintain it, you should continue to water it every day in the morning. Keep foot traffic off the sod for at least a week after laying it to promote the health of your grass.

If you water sod evening, it will be more prone to fungal infections during the night.

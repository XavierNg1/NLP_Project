 Choose an adventure story or a book about a topic that interests you. Make sure you're excited to turn the page. Make sure you stay sitting up while you’re reading. If you let yourself get too comfortable, you could fall asleep.


Don’t read books with super small print. The strain could exhaust your eyes and cause them to close.
Take breaks periodically to prevent dozing off.
 Choose something you’re really interested in. You’re mind will be too consumed with your project to think about being tired.Some examples of fun projects you can start include:


learning a song
writing a story
building a model airplane
painting a portrait

, Imagine a location that you’d really like to visit. Write out a plan to take a vacation there. Think about everything you’d like to experience on your vacation. Decide where you’ll be staying and how you’ll get there. You’ll be too excited about your dream vacation to fall asleep.


Let your mind wonder. Don’t worry about being realistic. You can imagine anywhere you want to go.
 You can gain mental focus by sprucing up your environment. The act of cleaning itself will energize your body and mind. Having an organized, spotless environment when you’re done cleaning will help you think more clearly., If you’re at work, you can talk to some of the other employees about things that interest you. Share a few laughs. Tell some cool stories. An engaging conversation will keep you feeling wide awake.


If you’re alone, you can talk to yourself. This may sound crazy but it can be beneficial. You can solve problems and work through issues you may have out loud.

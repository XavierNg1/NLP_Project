 Anytime you begin interacting with a potential employer, spend some time researching them to figure out whether or not they’re legitimate. Here are some good ways to conduct this research:


Run a Google search on the potential employer’s name or company name to see if anyone has had any problems with them.
Ask about their track record through your state’s Attorney General’s office.
Search for the employer on the Better Business Bureau’s website to see if anyone has registered complaints about them.
 You should avoid giving out any sensitive personal or financial information online or over the phone, especially if you’re asked to do so as part of a job application process.


In most cases, legitimate employers will not ask you to do this.
 Avoid any potential employer that asks you to pay an application fee, that requires you to pay for a training course before you’re offered an actual job, or that promises you commissions in exchange for transferring money for them through your bank account.


Each of these scenarios is likely a scam designed to steal your money.
 Pyramid schemes will ask you to join a company or pay money into a company in exchange for the chance to make more money when new participants join or pay into the program in the future.


These schemes are often scams, so play it safe by steering clear of them altogether.
 If a potential employer does not provide a contract to finalize an employment agreement, it may be a scam.


Do not enter into agreements or share information with potential employers who refuse to offer you a formal contract.
 If you’ve received an email about a possible job opportunity that you didn’t previously know about or apply for, it may be a good idea to do some online research to see whether or not the company has issued a legitimate job posting.


This can help determine the validity of the job offer.

 If you can find a Bob-omb in the level of the Chargin’ Chuck, pick it up by press-holding B or 1.
 Keep pressing the B or 1 button to hold the Bob-omb as you approach the Chuck.
 Once you’re near, and there’s no object between Mario and the Chuck, release the B or 1 button. This will send the Bob-omb flying, hitting the Chuck square in the face and destroying it.

 This is really up to your preference; keep in mind that embellishing the pages as you go may cause you to spend extra time waiting for embellishments to dry.


Add any number of things to pages to embellish them, like paint chips, sticky notes, decorative tape, stickers, newspaper clippings, magazine clippings, et cetera.You can upcycle things that you already have, too, that might be in your junk drawer or awaiting being tossed in the trash. This might include things like wedding invitations, cards, old photographs, art projects, and more., This could be a variety of things:


Ticket stubs
Maps
Photographs
Letters
Articles
Poems
Post cards

, You can add them by gluing or taping them to the pages.


You can follow a particular theme or style, if you would like, or you can do true “smashing” by adding items without much thought for those details.
Have fun with gluing in items by putting them down at odd angles and using decorative supplies to embellish.
 If you would like to have a little more understanding of what the page is about when you look back at your Smash Book down the road, you can write in these details in fun markers.


You might also print them from your computer to save yourself time in writing and to use fun fonts.
Leave these out if you would rather not take the time on them. That is part of the flexibility of smashing.
 As you come across other things that you might want to add to your Smash Book, save them in a box or drawer. Then, you can add them to your Smash Book another time.

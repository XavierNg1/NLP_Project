 Take the clamps off once the wood glue dries. If there are any big chunks of glue on the board, lightly chisel them off now.
 This gives it an even, perfect surface. You don't need to take much off -- only a few millimeters. Run both sides through for a perfectly smooth board.









Taking off roughly a 1/8 on an inch from each side will generally get out any issues or imperfections., Now that all the strips are attached it is easy to get the board to the perfect size. Set your saw to your final length, here 16", and cut the ends of the board to your final length.
 After the planer, you shouldn't need to do a lot of sanding. Use 220 grit paper to smooth the board, round the edges, and take out any roughness created by the saw.
 This puts a protective coating on the board and makes it easier to clean and work with. Use a damp rag to wipe off the board, then dry it thoroughly. Working in small circles, apply the food-grade mineral oil to the board, using a rag to apply a thin coating across the entire board. Let it dry and your cutting board is ready to use.









The final board should have a light shine on it. Reapply the mineral oil if it seems rough, woody, or unfinished in places.
Linseed oil and beeswax are two common food-grade oils.

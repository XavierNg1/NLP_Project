 Oatmeal has soothing, healing properties, and letting your skin absorb oatmeal water in the bathtub is a great way to get softer skin. You may be averse to bathing directly in oatmeal, but there's an easier way to get the benefits of oatmeal:


Pour a cup of old-fashioned (not instant) oatmeal into the foot of an old pair of pantyhose and tie a knot at the top. You can also tie the oatmeal up in a piece of cheesecloth.
Fill the bathtub with warm (not hot) water and place the oatmeal-filled cloth in the tub.
As you soak in the tub, squeeze the saturated oatmeal over your body. Run it over your skin, concentrating on the areas that are dry or irritated.
 This spa treatment is designed to improve skin tone. Buy a package of unsalted seaweed. Fill a large bowl with cool water and place the pieces of seaweed in the bowl. Situate yourself on a towel and place wet strips of seaweed on your skin. Let them dry on your skin until they begin to shrivel, then remove them. Rinse your skin and moisturize with oil or lotion to finish.
 Masks are used on the face and body to smooth and exfoliate the skin. Buy a mask from the drugstore, or make one of these using ingredients you already have in your kitchen:


Make a honey lemon mask. Place two teaspoons of flour into a bowl. Add two teaspoons of honey and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Stir the ingredients together and apply the paste to your face or another dry part of your body. Leave it on for 30 minutes, then rinse off with cold water. Beware, however, that prolonged exposure of lemon juice on the skin may lead to a condition called "phytophotodermatitis," which produces a painful chemical burn on the skin.






Make a milk mask. After taking a shower, take a cotton ball and dip it into warm milk. Rub the cotton ball onto your face, and let the milk dry. After the milk has been fully absorbed into your skin, wash your face with cold water to close your pores. You can also add milk to your bath to soften your entire body.

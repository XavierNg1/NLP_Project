 This could be pay stubs, receipts or a credit card offer that just came in the mail.;
, Perhaps you receive a stipend of $500 per month, or $3.50 for a latte. In these cases, the dollar amount is the number to be annualized.
 For example, if you buy a latte every day, your time period is 1 day. If you receive a stipend every month, then your time period is a month.


It is important to keep in mind that "daily" time periods may depend upon the number of days you work in a week. For example, if you buy a latte 5 days out of the week, then your time period is different than if you bought a latte 7 days out of the week.
 If your time period is a month, then there are 12 months in a year. If you buy a latte every day, then there are approximately 365 time periods in the year.


If you buy a latte every day you go to work, 5 days out of every week, then you must figure out approximately how many days you buy a latte within a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so you would buy a latte 5 days out of every 52. Multiply 5 times 52 and you have 260 days out of every year.
 For example, if you annualize your stipend you multiply $500 by 12, and you would receive $6000 per year. If you annualize your latte purchases, you multiply $3.50 by 365, and you find you would spend $1,277.50 per year.


To figure out your annualized data for weekday latte purchases, then you multiply $3.50 by 260. You will find you would spend $910 every year on lattes.
 The formula is Annual Rate of Return = (1 + Monthly Rate of Return)12 ï¿½ 1. The number 12 is an exponent, rather than a number to multiply.


If you have a quarterly rate of return, you would use an exponent of 4 rather than 12.
For example, you want to calculate what an Annual Rate of Return (ARR) would be if your investments kept giving you an 8 percent return for a year. You must first convert your percentage to decimals, so 8 percent is 0.08. Your formula would look like this: ARR = (1 + 0.08)12 -1. As you begin to do the problem, it would look like this: ARR = (1.08)12-1. Then ARR = 2.51817-1. Then, ARR = 1.51817. If you convert it into a percentage, your Annual Rate of Return is 151.8 percent. This would indicate a very good investment, but most ARR are much lower than this.

 There are a number of websites that pull your data based on your search terms and accounts. They also give you reports based on your social media presence that you can bring to marketing meetings.
 Most online-only companies offer a 7-day to 1-month trial before you subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis. After a month, gather the data from each site and see which one did the best job at getting your information on your objectives.


Try Trackur, Radian6, Ubervu, Viral Heat or other websites. The social media monitoring business is just taking off, so there are a high number of options on the market. Do an Internet search for "social media monitoring tool," and you should see even more options.
Do an analysis of how each site gathers data, how it compares to the other sites and what fits your budget the best. Each site will differ in how they measure and track their data, so if they provide a customer service representative, quiz the person on how they gather data, what sites they focus on and why they would be the best choice for your company.

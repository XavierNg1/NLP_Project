 Use a shampoo made with natural ingredients that won't cause your hair to frizz up. Condition as usual, then use a soft towel to pat the excess moisture from your hair.
 Apply a smoothing serum to your hair from the roots to the tips. You can use a product especially made for straightening hair or simply an anti-frizz serum or gel., The straight, sleek style looks best when your hair is parted on one side or the other, rather than straight down the middle. Use a comb to part your hair smooth it down in the correct direction., Use a blow dryer and a round brush to blow your hair dry and smooth. Use the brush to pick your hair up at the roots, then run the brush through your hair as you dry it. Continue until all of your hair is completely dry.

Don't hold the hair dryer too close to your head, or your hair may frizz up and look less straight and sleek than you want it to.
Don't use a diffuser, since this tool prevents air from flowing over your hair in a direct stream, resulting in waves, not straight hair.
 Heat up and iron and use it to touch up areas that you weren't able to completely straighten with the blow dryer. Concentrate on the tips of your hair., This style looks pretty when the bangs are swept to the side opposite from the part. Use your finger or the end of a comb to move the tips of your bangs across your forehead., Hold it in place with a few squirts of hairspray. Add barrettes, a headband, or a hair clip for a festive final touch.

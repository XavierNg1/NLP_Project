 Don't wait around hoping to hear from him. Your life without him should be full and interesting. The biggest mistake you can make is to wait for a guy to make your life fun and exciting. That gives you way too much time to obsess about your crush and, frankly, makes you pretty boring. Get busy pursuing your own thing and it's likely he'll be wondering if he can tag along.


Showing that you are an interesting, independent person all on your own. He'll be flattered that you're spending time with him not because you need him to make your life exciting, but because you choose to be with him.
 Don't set yourself up for failure by pretending to be something you're not just to get a guy to like you. If he doesn't see through your act immediately, it will only be a matter of time before he finds out. Being comfortable with yourself projects confidence, which is irresistible.If you hate football but your crush is obsessed with it, don't pretend to be a fan. If you just don't know much about the sport, ask him to share his knowledge. If you're into it, then you've got another thing in common. If you're not, that's okay. Just be honest!
If your crush always dates girly girls but you're more of a tomboy, don't reinvent yourself just so he'll notice you. If you can catch his interest because you're interesting and funny, you'll know he's into you for your personality, and not just because you fit his "type."

, Obsessing over whether or not he thinks about you as much as you think about him is draining, can hurt your self-esteem, and can cause you to feel insecure.Crushes are supposed to be fun! Focus on living that full, interesting life, and you won't worry so much about what's going to happen next.


Don't let obsessing stop you from doing the things you love and turn you into someone else. Keep doing the things that make you you.

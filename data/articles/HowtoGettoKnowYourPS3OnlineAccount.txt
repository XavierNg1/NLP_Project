It'll ask you basic information about details and for your username and password. Certain characters can not be used within your username or password. When you make these two things make sure they're unique but that you can remember them. Also for your username there is 15-character limit so be sure to fit it in.

To describe to the whole friends deal, on Playstation Network, whenever you meet people online you can add them as friends on there which means that they'll pop up if they're online or offline and will be on your friends lists. You can do by sending them a friend "request".






For messaging. This can be done in a multiple ways. You can do it by sending messages in in-boxes(imitation of emailing). Or you can go into a text chat which is where you and an online friend(s) can chat with each other live.






Other things. You can also go on to the internet as well as play demos and go to the PSN Store.
 On top of the already good deal of PSN being free, PS released not to long ago that (now started) they'd release a PSN-Plus. Now this is a premium issue of PSN. Better yet, it only runs 50$ a year! So now gamers can enjoy their free account and get a benefit for a cheap prices of 50 bucks per year.

 If you don't, defeating Majora will be much harder.
, The battle will start.
 No matter what you use, you won't be able to do any damage by hitting it on the front. Wait for it to start spinning on the ground, then do a spinning slash to knock it down to the ground, followed by a quick slash on the back before it gets back up.


Alternatively, you can wait for it to dive down at you, then run out of the way while wearing the Bunny Hood, then shoot an arrow at it from behind. After you hit it about 3 times in either of these manners, the four guardian masks will come from their portals and begin attacking you with light orbs.
 Once the masks are gone, the mask will constantly use its fire beam attack.;
, If you want, you can deflect the attack with the Mirror Shield to stun the mask. Soon enough, he will be dead, but he then re-incarnates himself.
 When it's within range of your sword, slash it to make it stop moving, then continue to slash it with the Gilded Sword (or whatever sword you have) until it spins away again.
 Run up and slash it with your sword. This is the easiest form of the mask, and it shouldn't take very long to kill.
 He will use his newly grown tentacles to whip at you, and it's almost impossible to avoid his attacks.
, Hit him with any Light Arrows you have left. A good method is to turn into Zora Link, get close to him while using Zora Link's shield to block his attacks, and use Zora Link's magic barrier (press B while holding up your shield) to stun him when you get close enough. When he begins to dodge your attacks, try to stun him with any of Link's forms. Run up and hit him with your sword or any remaining items that can do damage. He will soon be defeated and you can view the ending of the game in peace.


To defeat all three forms as Fierce Deity Link, just use the same methods, only it will be much easier as FDL, because he has a more powerful sword than normal Link.

 Place the whole, uncut eggplant in a large paper bag and loosely wrap the excess paper around the side of the vegetable.


The paper bag absorbs moisture and, as a result, may reduce spoilage. Since paper is permeable, the eggplant can also receive adequate air flow.
If you don't have paper bags, you could wrap the eggplant in paper towels and place it into an unsealed plastic bag or vented bowl.
Do not place the eggplant in a sealed plastic bag since doing so can restrict air flow and increase decay.;
, Keep the eggplant out of direct sunlight and in a relatively cool spot.


The ideal temperature for eggplant is 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Refrigerators are too cold, but standard room temperature is too warm. Dry, well-ventilated garages work well in cool weather seasons, but cellars and basements might be better during warmer weather., Do not store eggplants together or with other fruits and vegetables. Keep each eggplant separate while in storage.


Many fruits and vegetables produce ethylene gas as they ripen. When exposed to ethylene, eggplants tend to ripen and spoil faster.
 When stored in this manner, most eggplants should remain edible for up to three days.


Ideally, however, you should use the eggplant within 24 hours for the best texture. Eggplants spoil quickly, even when stored correctly.

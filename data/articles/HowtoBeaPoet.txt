 The external links explain different types of poems and descriptions of each.;
, If you're going through a life (or love!) crisis, or maybe a problem such as an addiction, use your experience to provide a topic. You may want to begin with a title to focus your thoughts. Or just start with whatever is on your mind. Perhaps you are feeling sad or angry, or maybe you're missing someone or feeling other internal pain. Let your thoughts flow on the paper until you don't have anything more to add.
 (For example, if you want to write about doomed romance, you can get ideas from Romeo and Juliet.)

, Tell the reader what you did, what you touched, specific memories, or make comparisons to nature or the world. Readers are curious to learn about you, but in order to touch readers and make them care about your poem, you've got to relate your confession to someone or something else. Draw a connection between yourself and the reader, or better yet, a surprising connection that makes the reader think "aha!". That being said .
 Perhaps you see a bug struggling to get across a deep crack in the sidewalk. Describe the scene in words so that a reader has the feeling of seeing it for themselves. You can even add what the scene reminds you of in your own life.
 Poetry is about using as few words as possible, but using "beautiful" words to describe what you are writing about.
 Move sections around and see what version has the most impact.
 For instance, if you were writing about a bad love affair, a title like "Rotten Apple" might get any readers off in the mood you want.


However, don't add a title just to have one. Many fine poems are listed simply as "Untitled".

 If your feet get cold while exercising, you may want to find warmer socks. Thermal socks are a great choice as they keep your feet warm and dry through all types of cold weather.


Thermal socks tend to be made out of wool. If you have a wool sensitivity, look for a pair made out of synthetic materials.If you decide to wear thinner socks, you can layer an extra pair over the first pair for the same effect. This may be uncomfortable for running.
 Thermal socks are extremely thick, and you may find that your foot is cramped inside your normal exercise shoe. You may want to find a winter shoe that is one half size to one full size larger than your normal shoe. When shopping for shoes, try wearing a pair of thermal socks to see how they fit in the shoe., If you live somewhere where there is snow and ice, you will need to find a shoe with good traction. This may help prevent falls during cold weather. When looking for a winter shoe, check the bottom to see what type of traction there is.A good shoe for snow or ice will have traction on the bottom of the shoe that resembles studs or cleats.
If you enjoy hiking in high, snowy altitudes, you may want to look for snow cleats or crampons.
 If snow and ice are an issue for you, you may want to find a shoe that is waterproof. A waterproof shoe is generally more expensive. The material is heavier and less flexible, but it can keep your feet warm and dry in snowy conditions. Water can still enter the shoe through the sock.If you do not have much snow or rain in your area, you may not need a waterproof shoe.

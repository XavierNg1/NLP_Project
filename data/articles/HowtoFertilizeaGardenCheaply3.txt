 Manure is a great natural fertilizer for the garden. Use manure from cows, horses, pigs, and dogs. Make sure you age it for six months, as fresh manure is too overpowering for plants. Spread aged manure in a ¼ to ½ inch (0.6-1.27 cm) layer over your garden soil. You can also till it or mix it in by hand.You can buy aged manure at your local gardening center.
Put animal manure in the garden in the fall or winter, before you do any spring planting.
 Fish guts, bones, and heads are a great source of plant nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous acid, and amino acids. You can use fresh guts, bones, and heads from fish like tuna or salmon. Or, freeze fish parts during the year so you can make fish fertilizer in the spring.Collect fish parts from your own cooking or buy fish parts from your local fish merchant.
Combine 1 part fish with 2 parts water in an airtight container. Place it in a sunny spot far from your home to avoid the smell. Stir the mixture every two days for about two weeks. Then, apply the fish fertilizer to your garden.
You can also take the aquarium water from your tank and use it to fertilize the garden. Only use fresh water from a fresh water tank, not salt water.
Fish fertilizer is particularly good for leafy greens, beets, Brussel sprouts, and broccoli.
 Worm castings contain beneficial nutrients for the soil. You can buy worm castings from your local gardening store or start a worm farm and make your own. Spread the worm castings over the soil to fertilize it.Add enough worm castings to cover the soil completely in a thin layer.

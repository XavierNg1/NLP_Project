 Try to cut the flowers at a sharp angle so that water and other nutrients can be more readily taken up by the plants. This allows the plants to last for longer periods of time.
 Using a clean vase to store cut flowers is likewise recommended because doing so will help eliminate potential pathogens and reduce the speed of decomposition. Refreshing the vase’s water every few days or so will also help preserve cut flowers. While fresh water can be used on its own to keep the flowers alive, some of the following solutions can be more helpful for preserving the life of one’s carnations.
 A teaspoon or two of sugar can be added to the water but 7-up or Sprite also works. The sugar in all three helps improve the longevity of cut flowers. Mix the sugar and water together and then add the carnations.


Another option is using 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar and 2 teaspoons sugar in the vase water to not only keep out germs but also feed the plants.
 Using sugar and several drops of any type of alcoholic spirit in the vase water will help to keep the flowers fresh. The alcohol prevents bacteria from growing in the vase because it is a disinfectant.


A fourth solution is using a liter of water and ¼ teaspoon of bleach to preserve cut flowers. Sugar can also be added if gardeners wish to do so. The presence of bleach will help keep the vase water clean.
 Carnations have the ability to change colors if the soak in water that is dyed a certain color. However, this process works best with white carnations, as they absorb colors more easily than other types of carnations. To do this, add a few drops of food coloring to the water in your vase. Mix the coloring into the water and place your carnations in the vase.


Colored carnations can be turned orange or purple by using yellow or blue dye.

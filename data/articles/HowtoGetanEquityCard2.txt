 It’s possible to gain membership to the Actors’ Equity Association as a nonunion actor. In order to do so, you’ll have to have established your reputation somewhat, as contract offers are typically made during negotiations with the theater. Try out for as many roles as you can to improve your chances of getting noticed by the right producers and theater managers.

Scoring an Equity contract can be tough, as most contracts tend to go to actors who are already Equity members.
You may have a better chance of being offered a contract if you’re working for a theater that participates in the Equity Membership Candidate (EMC) Program.
 When discussing the terms of your employment with the theater where you’ll be performing, see whether they’d be willing to offer you an Equity contract at the end of the standard contract cycle. Getting an offer is often as simple as having the right experience and expressing interest in joining the ranks of the AEA.Equity contracts are sometimes awarded to nonunion actors if there aren’t enough Equity certified actors to fill the slot.If you work with a manager, have them help you negotiate your way into an Equity contract.
 Once you’re working under an Equity contract, you’ll be eligible to officially join the AEA. Complete an application and send it off for review, along with the one-time fee of $100. You’ll then be welcomed to the union and issued your very own Equity card.You’re only remain eligible for membership while your Equity contract is still valid.
As a member, you’ll receive union wages, health benefits and opportunities to take part in AEA exclusive auditions.

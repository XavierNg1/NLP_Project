 It doesn't matter what type of egg you use. Don't feel inclined to buy expensive, organic eggs, but you could. Jumbo eggs cost a little more, but are easier to work with.


You can even save the egg's insides for cooking if you don't want to be wasteful.;
, Take a push pin or nail and poke it through the bottom of the egg.After creating the initial puncture, widen the hole. Softly scrape the edges of the gap until it's around the size of your thumb's fingernail.
 Hold the egg over the sink as the insides drain out. You can catch the egg white and yolk in a bowl if you don't want to waste any supplies. If the yolk is stuck at the opening, puncture the yolk with a pin or nail. Allow the yolk to completely drain out of the egg's shell.
 Turn on the faucet to a mild stream. If the water is too heavy, the shell might crack or become damaged. Gently wash the leftover insides out of the shell. You don't need to be too thorough, but a basic rinse will do.
 Place the egg shells back into the egg carton. Make sure the hole you created is facing down. This will allow most of the liquid to clear from the shell. By the time you're done preparing the powder, your shells should be ready to go.









It'll take around 15 to 20 minutes.
Place them in a sunny spot of the house for a quicker drying time.

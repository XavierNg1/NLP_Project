 You should not store your fake eyelashes when they're wet. You may have to set them aside for an hour or so before they're ready to store.
 You should store your eyelashes in the box they originally came in. You do not want to leave fake eyelashes loose in a makeup drawer, as they can accrue dirt and debris. This can lead to an eye infection.If you don't have the original box, you can use a contact lens case. You can also purchase boxes for storing false eyelashes online.
 False eyelashes should be kept out of direct sunlight. This can change the color of the lashes. Make sure to store your eyelashes in a dark place to avoid warping the color.

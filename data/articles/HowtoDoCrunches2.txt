 Put your hands on your stomach or palms down at your sides.
 You can either have your knees bent at a 90 degree angle, or you can point your feet in the air with your legs as straight as you can get them.
 Be careful not to push down with your hands, back, or head. If you can't lift your hips using just your abs, you'll need to build more strength with regular crunches. Otherwise, you're just wasting energy while other parts of your body do the work.

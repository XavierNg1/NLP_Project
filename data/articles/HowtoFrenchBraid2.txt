 Just like you did for the normal French braid, brush through tangles to smooth out your hair. French lace braids can work down either one or both sides of your head, so need to part your hair. Use a center or side part, depending on what look you prefer.
 The size of this section does matter in French lace, as it determines the thickness of the braid. For a larger braid, grab a hefty section of hair, and for a dainty braid, grab a smaller piece. In general, it should be about one inch thick.
 As with the normal French braid, you need to divide your starting section of hair into three even pieces. Angle these pieces downward to frame your face, rather than pulling them toward the back of your head.
 Start the French lace in a traditional braid. Cross the "right" strand over to center, then cross the "left" strand over to center.
 In the French braid, you added hair from both sides of your head. In the French lace braid, you should only add hair from one side of the braid.








It doesn't matter which side you add new hair from. The important thing is that all new hair comes from the same side of the braid.
 As you move further along with your braid, it will start to form a crown or halo shape around your head. You can choose to braid over the top of your ear, or under it.









If you are making a single braid, wrap it all the way around your head. You will likely run out of hair near the ear on the other side of your head.
If you're making two braids, stop braiding when you reach the nape of your neck. Tie off the first braid with an elastic, then repeat the entire process on the other side of your head to create your second braid.
 Eventually, you will run out of loose hair to work into the braid. At this point, keep working in a traditional braid until you reach the ends of your strands. Tie off your hair with an elastic tie to secure your French lace braid.

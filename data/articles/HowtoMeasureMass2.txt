 You can measure mass using a balance. A balance is different from a scale because it uses a known mass to measure the unknown mass where as a scale actually measures weight.


Finding mass with a triple-beam balance or a double-pan balance is a form of measuring gravitational mass. This is a static measurement, which means it is only accurate when the object being measured is at rest.
A balance can measure weight and mass. Because the measurement of the balance weights change by the same factor as the object being measured, a balance is able to accurately provide the mass of an object regardless of the specific gravity of the environment.
 Inertial mass is a dynamic measuring method, meaning that it can only be accomplished while the object being measured is in motion. The inertia of the object is used to quantify the amount of matter.


An inertial balance is used to measure inertial mass.
Secure the inertial balance to a table.
Calibrate the inertial balance by putting the container in motion counting the number of vibrations in a specified time period, for example 30 seconds.
Place an item of known mass in the container and repeat the experiment.
Continue using several items of known mass to finish calibrating the scale.
Repeat the experiment with an item of unknown mass.
Graph all results to find the mass of the final object.

 In some cases, people with dual-sensory loss are accompanied by a partner trained to facilitate communication for the deaf-blind. This person will have sometimes formal education in deaf-blind communication, and will have developed rapport. It has been shown that the level of education in deaf-blindness has the greatest impact on communication with the deaf-blind., These may include hints in the form of:


Changes in body language
Pre-written notes or cards
Recordings or utterances
Changes in the person's breathing
Changing facial expressions
Physical actions (such as taking you to the fridge for food)
If they reach for your hands, this could be an attempt to communicate.
 Then hand it back, unless instructed otherwise. A person who is deaf-blind might communicate using written messages or pre-recorded messages. These are used to convey essential information about their activities. , Communication for the deaf-blind can be extremely difficult. The person may need considerably more time than you are used to in order to express what he is trying to say. By giving him the time to fully convey or to try different ways to express the idea, you can help facilitate interaction.

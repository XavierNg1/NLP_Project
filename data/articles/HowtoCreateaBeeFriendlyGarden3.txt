Put logs or tree stumps in sunny spots, especially those that have some shelter from inclement weather. If possible, use wood riddled with beetle tunnels.






Leave dead trees standing, if possible, where risk of them causing damage is low.






Stand up stumps or logs to mimic dead trees. Drill an array of holes 3/32 to 3/8 inches (.25 to .95 cm) in diameter and 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.25 cm) deep into the southeast side.


Dig a hole in a sunny site with good drainage. The hole should measure about 2 feet (60 cm) deep.






Blend fine, pale sand and some loam and fill the hole with the mixture.






Fill a planter box with the blended sand and loam as an alternative to digging a hole.

 Many of the new models require an external optical drive connected to the Lightning port. If you're using a tower, press the CD Open/Close key on your keyboard (above the Delete keyâ€”an upward-pointing arrow with a thin line below it), and the drive drawer should open up. If you have a drive, it will be able to burn a CD.





Still not sure? From the Apple menu, choose About This Mac. Click More Info to open System Profiler, then click on System Report.
Under the Hardware list, click on Disc Burning. If you see a drive there, and in the CD-Write: row it says -R, -RW, then you can burn CDs.
 Place a blank disc on the tray, and close the drive either by pressing the front face, or by pressing the Open/Close key. If you see a dialog pop up, choose Open Finder from the pop-up menu, and select "Make this action the default" if this is how you will usually burn blank CDs.





The disc will appear on your desktop.
 This will open a window that you can drag files and folders into. This will not remove the files from your computer, but will only copy them onto the disc.
 Arrange and rename the files as you want them to appear when you insert the burned CD. Once the disc is burned, the location and names of the files cannot be changed.
 From the File menu, select Burn , and then follow the instructions.

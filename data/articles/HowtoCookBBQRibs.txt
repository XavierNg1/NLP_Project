 barbecue ribs essentially come in two varieties. Spare ribs are fattier and take longer to cook. Baby back ribs are leaner and cook faster.

, The rub is a spice mixture that you rub on the rib rack to give it flavor. A typical rub for a 2 lb rack of ribs might consist of:









1 tablespoon (5 ml) cumin
1 tablespoon (15 ml) paprika
1 tablespoon (15 ml) garlic powder
1 tablespoon (15 ml) onion powder
1 tablespoon (15 ml) chili powder
1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown sugar
2 tablespoons (30 ml) kosher salt
1 teaspoon (5 ml) cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon (5 ml) black pepper
1 teaspoon (5 ml) white pepper

, A mop or baste is the liquid sauce that you coat the ribs with to keep them juicy and flavorful while they are cooking. Some people prefer dry ribs, without a mop.
 Ribs will usually come with a large membrane on the back, non-meat side of the rack. Most people trim the membrane and discard it because it is hard to chew and prevents the rub from covering the entire rack. Coat the ribs evenly with olive oil or vegetable oil (optional). Apply the rub generously onto the meat so that the front and back of the rack are completely covered.
 For baby back ribs, cook at the same temperature for 3-4 hours. Place the ribs on the grill so that they are not directly over the heat source.

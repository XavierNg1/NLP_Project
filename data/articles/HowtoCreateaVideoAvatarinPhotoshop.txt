,, You must make sure the "Width" and "Height" settings for this is 250 pixels each. The only other thing you will have to change yourself is the "Background Contents" to "Transparent".


You will be presented with a blank 250x250 pixels canvas to work with.
 Now under the "File" tab select "Place..." and then browse your computer for the rendered image that you downloaded.


Once placed, the rendered image will be in the center of the canvas and you will have to manually resize it.
, Pick a color that adds to your overall pictures theme, for example a "red grunge background". Place that background over your render resizing to cover the whole canvas.
 This should allow you to to see your rendered image layer that is directly under the background layer.
 To do so, think of an effect you wish to add to the avatar and Google "gif" (for example, "fire gif"). Once you download your desired effect GIF, open it into a separate file first.


You can play your effect GIF and see the number of frames that make up the GIF; the example fire effect gif has 25 frames.
 Create the exact number of frames that your effect GIF has using the "Duplicate selected frames" button. Set the time of each frame to "0.1 seconds" and the loop from "Once" to "Forever".
 Then select all the frames in your avatar and "Paste Frames".
 Resize all frames of the effect GIF to fit the avatar to your preference and change each effect layer in each from from "Normal" to "Soft Light".
 You may change the font, size, and color in the "Character" tab. You should move your text around until you find your desired location for placement.
 You have just made your very own video avatar using Photoshop and all there is left to do is to go under the "File" tab and "Save" the PSD file (so you can go back and edit the avatar) and then "Save for Web..." This will save your avatar in GIF format to be uploaded wherever you desire.

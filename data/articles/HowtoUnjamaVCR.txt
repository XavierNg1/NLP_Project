 If its still jammed, go to step 2;
,,,,, If so, take it out. If not, read on.
 If you find screws on the bottom, remove them. Take the bottom off. Check to see if any belts are missing. If not, turn the loading gear (you will see it) until it won't turn any more. Then turn it all the way back. If there is no way to take the bottom off, go to the next step.
 Looking at the transport, you should find screws that are holding it in place. Take those out, then GENTLY take the transport out. If you need to, unplug some wires. Just make a note of were they belong.
 Check for missing belts. Replace if needed. Then, turn the loading gear until it won't turn anymore. Then turn it all the way back.
 Screw it back in place. Make sure its secure and EVERYTHING is the way you found it. Leave the top on.
 It will make some noise, don't worry. Its just resetting itself.

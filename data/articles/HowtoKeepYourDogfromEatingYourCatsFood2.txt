 To effectively train your dog to not eat the cat food, you have to wait until he actually does it to discipline him. Otherwise, he won't understand what he did wrong and the training won't work. When you put down the cat food, wait a few minutes and see if the dog goes for it. If he does so, then take corrective action., If your dog does not respond, you may need to use other tactics to create a negative association between an unpleasant (but not harmful) experience and eating cat food.
 A spray bottle can startle your dog so he'll associate eating the cat's food with an unpleasant (but harmless) experience and will not want to do it anymore.

Fill a spray bottle with water and keep it near the cat's bowl so you can reach it easily.
Wait for your dog to go for the cat food. Then take the spray bottle and send 2 squirts toward the dog.
 In addition to using a spray bottle to discourage the dog, you could also get a similar effect from startling the dog with a loud noise.This is supposed to scare your dog so he will be discouraged from eating the cat food again.

A few things you could use are a coffee can filled with coins, a whistle, or a magazine smacked against the table.
Wait until your dog goes for the cat food and then make the loud, startling noise.
Try to make it so that the dog does not know you are the source of the sound. You want him to respond negatively to the sound, not to you.
 The other side of dog training is rewarding behavior that you want to continue. When the dog eats his own food from his own dish, pile on the praise. Tell him he is a “good boy” and pet him (if he will allow it while he is eating -- some dogs will not)., Yelling at your dog is ineffective, as he is unlikely to make the connection between you yelling and his eating. It could just make your dog decide that he’s scared of you, in which case he will wait until you are not there to eat the cat food.

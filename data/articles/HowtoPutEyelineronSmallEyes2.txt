You’ll look like you’re barely wearing any liner, which will make your eyes look bigger., Use a soft pencil to make smudging easier. Smudge it with your fingertip. This will extend the liner and make your eyes look wider., Join the liner at the outer corners of your eyes for a cohesive look. Start at the outer corners and draw a line along the bottom lid using short strokes. Make the line on your lower lids thinner than the line on your upper lids. Consider using a lighter colored liner on your lower lid so it doesn’t look as heavy.








Try lining your lower lid with a thin line of eye shadow, which will look lighter than the liner on your upper lid.

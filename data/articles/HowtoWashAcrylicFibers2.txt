 Some acrylic fibers are delicate so you need to use specialty detergent. Grab a gentle detergent that’s mild enough to not screw up the fabric.Gentle detergent is usually clearly marked as good for delicates.
 A kitchen sink is the perfect place for handwashing your stuff. Fill it up with cool water and dunk your acrylic item in it. Make sure that it gets good and wet.Don’t forget to clean the sink before you start washing your clothes.
If you don’t want to wash your clothes in the kitchen sink, you can always use your bathtub or a utility bucket.
 Don’t pour the detergent directly on your clothes. Add a little bit to the water and slosh it around to mix it in. Move the clothes up and down in the water in a pumping motion to get them totally clean.Don’t add more than a tablespoon (15 ml) of detergent to the sink.
If your clothing is really dirty, let it soak for a while. You can leave in the water and detergent for up to 60 minutes.
 The water in the sink’s going to get pretty dirty after you slosh your acrylic items around in it. Let the water out, and then fill it back up with cool, clean water to rinse your clothes. Swish the items around in the water to get the detergent out.If there’s a ring of dirt around the sink after you drain it, clean it out before you rinse your stuff.
Depending on how dirty your clothes are, you may need to rinse them more than once.
You can rinse the clothes under running water at the faucet for the second rinse.
 You’ll damage the acrylic fibers if you wring or twist the clothes to get the water out of them. Instead, just use your hands to gently press down on the fabric and then shake it out so it’s not dripping wet.

 Look for clear water where there are plenty of meandering fish. Poor water quality can result in illness. Popular spearfishing destinations are Wisconsin, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Nicaragua.Get an understanding of the type of fish that you want to find so that you know what you are looking for.
 You can locate a remote beach and rent a kayak to find healthy, great tasting fish.If you are deep dive spearfishing, try to find a location where there are no other people spearfishing to reduce the risk of your dive.
 Prior to your dive, establish with your dive partner the radius for the dive and the overall timeframe so that you are aware of each otherâ€™s location at all times. This will also serve as a precaution should one of you get lost or experience problems, particularly during a deep dive.

 For this cake, you'll need:

One round cake, any flavor or texture of choice
Four cupcakes, same flavor and texture as the main cake, for the legs
One cupcake for cutting into a tail shape
One cupcake (same flavor and texture), baked in a much larger container, such as a large muffin container, for the head

Buttercream frosting, in the color of the turtle––usually green is best but you can use the child's favorite color if preferred
Candies for decorating the turtle.;
, Allow them to cool down before adding the frosting.

Cut the tail shape out of one of the cupcakes. A simple triangle will do, or a curve. Cut the cupcake in half first and use the bottom half to create this tailpiece.
 This could be a large platter or a cake board. It is important to use the presentation base now, as you won't be able to move the cake again after you start frosting it.

Place the large round cake in the center.
Place the four cupcakes at suitable intervals for the turtle's legs.
Place the head at the front part of the cake.
Place the tail at the back of the cake.
 The frosting will cover the joins of the cake.

Using a butter knife or a frosting spatula, cover all of the cakes with frosting, including the legs, tail and head. When you reach the joins, be generous with the frosting and smooth it over to cover any dips.
 Add M&Ms or Skittles for eyes, a curved candy for a smile. Add a line of green licorice to the tail (optional).

You can use candies as toenails if you like.
 The turtle is now ready to be shared among the guests.

 There are three shapes common to her design: her head, torso, and waist. She has a fairly oval face, with prominent cheeks, a rounded forehead, and a dainty, yet pointed, chin.


The three shapes need to be in proportion to each other and all line up at the correct angles. When you're drawing Ariel, what is she doing? If she has fins, she's probably swimming!;
, Include lines on her face to line up her eyes and nose, placement for her seashell bra, her elbow and shoulder joints, and fins.
 The most important being her unique hairstyle, of course! Remember: She's in water, so her hair doesn't need to be along her back and her fins are floating, too.


Ariel has wide, Disney princess eyes (they're all relatively similar). They're usually open and curious-looking.
Her nose is dainty and small; her lips are generally in a bit of a smile.
Her hair miraculously has no part and is incredibly voluminous.
Her hands and arms are generally held strong but femininely, like a ballerina. She has definite poise (especially for such a youngster!).
 You want fine, definite lines that are determined and confident. If worst comes to worst, just resharpen your pencil.
 If you have anything to add or change, do it now! The outline is your last round of actual drawing. Did you remember the lines in her fins, top, and waist-frills?

, That's it for drawing! Are we feeling ambitious and gonna tackle Flounder and Sebastian, too, or just keep it to Ariel?

, To keep it traditional, her seashell top should be purple, her tail should be medium green, and her fins light green. But this is your drawing -- maybe she should be sporting zebra stripes?

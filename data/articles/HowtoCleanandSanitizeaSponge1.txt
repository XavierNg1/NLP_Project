 Never microwave a sponge that has any metal on it. Metal reflects microwaves, causing them to move around erratically, which can cause sparking, fire, and damage to your microwave. To be safe, don't use a metal scouring pad or anything else that contains metal in your microwave., There should be no food or dirt visible in it. You can use a little dish soap to help get it clean. Wring it out to remove excess water., Pour about a 1/2 cup of water into a bowl and add a teaspoon of lemon juice. Soak the sponge in the solution until it is drenched. The lemon juice will help your sponge to smell clean and fresh when removing it from the microwave, and the water is necessary so that the sponge doesn't burn., Place the sponge in the microwave for about two minutes on high. Make sure to monitor the sponge vigilantly to watch for any signs of burning. Be sure to only microwave wet sponges and to turn off the microwave immediately if you see any smoke. Microwaves kill over 99% of germs to make your sponge sanitized and clean.Because types of microwaves and types of sponges vary, some sponges may only need a minute in the microwave.
You can put the sponge directly in the microwave or on a small plate if you prefer.
 Your sponge will be freshly sanitized and will also be very hot. Let it sit in the microwave for a couple of minutes to cool off. Remove it carefully, using tongs or oven mitts. It is ready to go! Be sure to sanitize your sponges regularly, at least once a week, for best results.

 Cats are escape artists, and can easily slip through cracked windows or doors. Therefore, don’t leave windows and doors ajar. When you enter the house, close the door quickly and tightly behind you., If your cat tends to dart toward the door when you leave, get a friend or family member to hold the cat before you exit. Alternately, squirt your cat with water just before leaving. You might also choose to provide your cat with a puzzle feeder just before making an exit., Cats are fast and can easily end up far away when chasing other creatures they encounter outside. To prevent your cat from racing off, only take it out with a leash and collar., If your cat is comfortable indoors, it will have little motivation to go outside. Provide plenty of toys for your cat, and play with it regularly. Provide a cat house or perch for your cat to lounge in. Keep litterboxes clean. With a healthy, happy cat, you’ll discourage escape behavior., If your cat is neutered or spayed, it will have much lower urge to roam and find a mate. Plus, neutering and spaying makes cats less quarrelsome and can reduce their likelihood for certain diseases.Cats can be safely neutered or spayed at about six month of age.

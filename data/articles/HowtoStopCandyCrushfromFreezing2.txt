 Sometimes a fresh install will address any issues, including freezing.


To uninstall on iOS, tap and hold the Candy Crush app icon until it shakes, and then tap the “X” button that appears on it to uninstall it.
To uninstall on Android, open the Application Manager from the Settings. Find “Candy Crush” from the list of Downloaded apps. Tap on it, then tap the “Uninstall” button.
 Open your device’s app store (the App Store on iOS and the Play Store on Android), and search for Candy Crush. Once you find it, select it, and then tap the “Install” button.
 Once the installation is done, look for the Candy Crush app on your device and tap on it. On the welcome screen, tap the “Connect” button. You need to do this in order for your game to be connected to your Facebook account so your previous progress can be synced and updated.
 You can now select the level where you left off and start playing Candy Crush again.

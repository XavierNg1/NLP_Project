 Only iPads that support both Wi-Fi and Cellular signals will have SIM cards. The regular sized iPads use Micro SIM cards, while the iPad Mini uses a Nano SIM.
 The iPad 2/3/4 and Mini have the SIM port located on the left side towards the top. The port is slightly recessed and can be accessed by flipping the iPad around so the back is facing you.
 Insert the straight end into the hole next to the SIM port at a 45Â° angle. Remove your SIM card from the tray. Be sure to reinsert the tray if you are sending your iPad in for warranty service.

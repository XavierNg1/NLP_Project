 The size of your organizer may vary and depends on the number of your cosmetics you want to store. If you have plenty of cosmetics and toiletries and you wish to group them together, find a bigger one.
 Collect a number of small empty boxes to fit into the container as compartments for your organizer. Empty toilet paper rolls are also a good option.


You don't need to spend good money for the fancy boxes. Simply collect cardboard packing box from your new light bulb or your facial cream. You can even make compartments from the tin can of can food!
Bear in mind that any food containers must be cleaned thoroughly and ensure odorless. Any sharp edges may wrapped over with the wrapping paper when decorating.



Try using duct tape to wrap around the edges of the box or the whole box; this will give rigidity for the box to maintain in shape and avoid tearing.
, Voila!

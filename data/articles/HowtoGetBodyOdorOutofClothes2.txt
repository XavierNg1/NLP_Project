 If you’re not washing that many clothes you can also choose to use a bucket. The water doesn’t need to be scalding hot but it shouldn’t be cold either.


This method will work best with warm to hot water.
You can soak your clothes in the washing machine using the ‘soak’ setting if you would rather not use your bathtub.
 If you’re filling a whole bathtub with water and clothing you should add two cups of white vinegar. If you are only filling up a bucket with water, one cup of white vinegar will do the trick.White vinegar helps to lower the pH in the water, thereby reducing odors., You can let your clothes soak overnight if you need to, but the odor should start to decrease after a few hours.


If you weren’t happy with the results of the lemon mixture or the baking soda, soaking your clothes is a great option.
 Wringing out and air-drying outside is the best option for removing odors because the air circulation combined with the light will help to deodorize the clothing. If you’re in a rush it is perfectly acceptable to use your dryer.

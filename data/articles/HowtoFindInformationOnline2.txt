 If you are looking for peer-reviewed academic articles, the best place to start is an academic database. If you attend (or work for) a university, you can probably access exclusive databases through your libraryâ€™s online catalog. If this is not the case for you, try Jstor, ARTstor, Ebsco, or Google Scholar. Be aware, however, that not every article you find will be available for free., The internet contains specialized online libraries for many, many different subjects. Seeking these collections can help to speed up your search, as well as provide reliable places to return to for all sorts of information.For information on the Arts, check out the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Art Cyclopedia, or UBUWeb.
For information on history, try the Perseus Digital Library, Project Gutenberg, or Digital History.
For medical and scientific articles, visit BioMed Central.
 When individuals search for information online, they tend to think in terms of text, but many useful educational videos exist online as well! In fact, sometimes a video is the best way to learn what you seek. Many informative user-generated videos exists on Youtube.
For more reputable information provided by professionals, search for videos on TED (otherwise known as TED talks).
 If you are looking on the internet for something to buy, you can use review sites and/or price-comparison sites to locate the best version of what you need for a competitive price.Review sites like Amazon, Reevoo, and Trustpilot can help you decide if a particular product is worthwhile.
Price-comparison sites like Money Supermarket and Comparethemarket.com can help you find the best price.
 Many websites operate newsfeeds (otherwise known as RSS feeds). You can use an RSS reader to compile information from various RSS feeds. This allows you to see when new information appears on your favorite sites, without having to visit them one at a time.Some good RSS readers include Feedly, Newsblur, and Flipboard (tablet only).

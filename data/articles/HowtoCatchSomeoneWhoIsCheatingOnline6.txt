 One of the most straightforward ways to determine if someone is cheating is to ask them directly. Not everyone will come clean, however, and they may continue telling lies. Spying on them online may contribute to hostile feelings between the two of you and may further weaken any trust that still exists.
 Try to choose a time when you can both be available and able to devote time to the conversation. You may want to ambush your partner in the act, but this might not be the most productive route.
 Approaching the conversation in a serious yet calm manner may result in a more honest conversation than if you are aggressive, demanding where your partner has been or who they have been with.
 Get referrals from trusted friends or from the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy.Not every marriage counselor will be the most appropriate or the best fit for you and your partner, and it may take visiting with more than one counselor to find the right one. Be patient with your partner through this process, particularly if they have admitted cheating on you. If you are committed to making the relationship work, you will need to both be open to forgiveness and compromise.

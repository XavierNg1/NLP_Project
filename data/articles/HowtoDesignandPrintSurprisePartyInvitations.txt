,,, Distributing the invitation too early may lead to people forgetting to come or discussing the event with the honoree. Distributing it too late may lead to guests being unavailable. Aim for at least a week and a half (approx 10 days) in advance

, If you would like to use an online template, you might go to your favorite search engine (e.g, Google) and enter "surprise party invitation" on the search line. If you would like to save money enter "surprise party invitation free" on the search line. You will have many choices of companies eager to have you send invitations from their site or print them out.
 Once you find the right invitation select it and simply enter the information about your event from your list above. Enter the addresses If you are distributing your invitations electronically, they should be sent out right from the site. Be sure to send one to yourself, just to be sure the send worked. Also, be sure that you do NOT send the invites from an email or postal address which the honoree has access to. On occasion postal mail and email are returned. If the honoree sees the returned mail the surprise would be spoiled

, In this case might use PowerPoint or most any photo software package. Start with a background color, add in a photo or two, add in some graphics, enter your text with a nice font which is easy to read, and you will have a nice looking invitation.
, Congratulations!!!

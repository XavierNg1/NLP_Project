 Log into Facebook and open the Settings page. On the top-right corner of the interface, click the small inverted triangle and then click "Settings".
 On the left side of the screen, you will see a tab labeled "Blocking". Click it to open the blocking tools.
 If you don't ever want to see a notification about a specific game, no matter who sends it, you can block the game entirely in this section. Enter the name of the game and select it from the matching results.


Blocking apps will disable the app from contacting you or getting non-public information about you through Facebook.
You can enter as many apps as you'd like.
It is not possible to block all games at once. You will need to manually enter each game that you want blocked.

 Flip over your canvas to expose the back. The cork board squares will sit inside the canvas’ wooden frame. Coat the back of the canvas with a thin layer of glue and place the cork board squares. After placing each piece, run your hand over the cork board to remove air bubbles. Cut the cork board as needed. When you’re done, the entire area inside the wooden frame of the canvas will be covered in cork board., Before you make any cuts, run over the fabric with a warm iron. This will remove any wrinkles or creases that may alter the dimensions of your fabric. Measure and mark the burlap so each edge is 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) more than the dimensions of the canvas. You will wrap this extra fabric around the frame. Cut your fabric.


You may use any fabric you want., Lay your fabric on a flat work surface. Place the canvas facedown in the center of the fabric. Fold one edge of fabric over the frame and insert staples along the entire length of the wooden frame. Repeat on the rest of the edges., The upholstery tacks will form a decorative edge around your memory board. You must position them over the wooden frame. Use a measuring tape and pencil to mark the location of each upholstery tack—the distance between the tacks is up to you. Hammer each tack into place., Flip your canvas over. Position and attach one or more D-Ring hangers on the wooden frame. You will use the hardware to hang the memory board.


This step is optional., You can attach your mementos with pushpins or thumbtacks. Choose pins and tacks that match the aesthetic of the board.

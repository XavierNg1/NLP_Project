 This will remove some of the dirt and natural oils on your skin and hair. Starting with a clean face will help to remove more of the unwanted hairs during the process.
 Use a popsicle stick, spoon or a Q-tip to precisely apply the wax. Cover the hair thoroughly. Be extremely careful with this step, as it can be tricky. Avoid spreading the wax onto areas where you would not want your hairs removed.
 Running your finger over the cloth in the directions the hair goes. Leave the wax in place for 15 minutes.









You can make this easier by cutting the fabric into strips that can be placed over the wax. Having a small piece of fabric stuck to your face is much less of an impairment than a whole rag.

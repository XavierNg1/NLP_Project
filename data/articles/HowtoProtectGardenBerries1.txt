 Bird netting has Â¼ inch holes, making it near impossible for a bird or squirrel to get into the netting. Use commercial bird netting made of plastic or nylon. You can find bird netting online or at your local hardware store.Buy enough bird netting to cover the entire berry plant, or row of berry plants, in your garden.
You can also use chicken wire over the berries. Chicken wire can be hard to drape over the berries so use this material with caution.;
, Dig small, deep holes and place five to seven foot poles made of wood, bamboo, or metal into the holes. You may need to use a shovel or pick axe to make the holes, depending on how hard the ground is. Arrange the poles along the berry bushes, lashing them together to create a teepee shape at the end of each row. You can then make V-shapes with the poles along the center of the berry bushes.You can also use wooden stakes to install the netting over the berry bushes. Make sure the wooden stakes are tall enough to allow the netting to drape over the berries.
 Drape the bird netting over the poles. Make sure the netting covers the entire berry bush from top to bottom. Use staples or upside down flower pots to keep the netting in place.Make sure the netting is firmly attached to the poles and there are no holes or gaps between the poles and the netting.
 Once the netting has been installed over the garden berries, check it periodically for any birds or squirrels that get trapped in the netting. You will need to remove them to ensure they can get back to their nesting area.You should also confirm that the netting is secure and has not shifted or moved around. You do not want any birds or squirrels to find an open spot in the netting and get at the berries.

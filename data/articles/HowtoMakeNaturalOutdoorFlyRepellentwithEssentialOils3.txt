 These three oils are most effective against flies. To make an oil rub from these powerful oils, it's important to dilute them with a carrier oil. Make a 2% solution by adding 12 drops of your chosen essential oil per 1 fl. oz (30ml) of carrier oil, such as olive oil. Apply it to your wrists, neck and other pulse points to keep flies away.


Keep extra oil in a small vial so you can apply it again when necessary.
Applying undiluted essential oils directly onto skin (even lavender or tea tree oil) can result in sensitization, which means that you may become so sensitive to the oil that any contact will cause skin irritation., Mint is another natural fly repellent, and it has that classic, sweet mint fragrance. Peppermint, spearmint, catnip are fantastic at shooing away unwanted flies and keeping you smelling great. Make a 2% solution by adding 12 drops of peppermint essential oil per 1 fl. oz (30ml) of carrier oil, such as olive oil. Rub it directly on your skin.

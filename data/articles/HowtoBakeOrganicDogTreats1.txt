 Dogs love the taste of peanut butter. Get smooth (not crunchy) organic peanut butter, rolled oats, flour, and honey from your local grocery. You can use white or whole wheat flour., Get a large mixing bowl. Add in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of oats, 1/3 cup of peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon of honey. Mix them thoroughly with a spoon or whisk. Then add 1 and ½ cups of water to the mixture and mix it in until it becomes thick and doughy.
 Lightly sprinkle flour over the cooking surface and roll the dough flat on the cooking surface so that it becomes a ¼ inch thick sheet. Use a cookie cutter or knife to remove cookie-shaped pieces and place them on a baking sheet. Bake them for 40 minutes at 350 degrees.
 Consider adding half a tablespoon of fish oil in when mixing the recipe. Dogs sometimes dislike the strong taste on its own but the flavor will be overpowered by the peanut butter. Fish oil will improve the dog’s coat, joints, and circulatory system.

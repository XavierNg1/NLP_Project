 First, ensure that you understand why the relationship foundered, where you see yourself in the future, and whether you still truly love this person. Then, decide when and where you're going to do it. If you are able to do so, meet your love in person. If you are less confident, or if there is no way to be physically with this person, then you might call them, or email them, or write them a letter.
 Ask the person if they will meet you at a neutral location: a coffee shop, or a public park, or a favorite restaurant. If they will not meet you, then try a less direct means of communication like phone, email, or handwritten letter.


Avoid saying this over text or instant message. Try to say it as thoughtfully and intentionally as possible. If there is a medium that the two of you always used to communicate, then consider using that medium.
If the person doesn't want to see you, then you need to respect that. Do not show up at his/her home or workplace. Do not follow this person, or arrange for someone else to follow him/her.
 You can hope and pray that this person will return your love, but you need to be prepared for rejection. If you did something to seriously hurt or anger this person, then they may not be ready to take you back. If your love has found someone else, then he or she may simply want to focus on the new relationship instead of trying to sort out the past. It is good to be bold, and to speak what is on your mind â€“ but you must do so with abandon, with the conviction that you absolutely must say this thing, regardless of the outcome.


Be prepared to respect this person's decision. Whether or not they love you back or want you back, you need to allow them the right to say so. If you do not respect a person, then perhaps you do not love them.

 Walnuts make a great snack all by themselves. The high fat content can also help you to feel fuller longer. You can keep raw walnuts in a container on your counter for easy access or throw a handful in a plastic bag or container to take to work.
 If raw walnuts aren’t your style, try dressing them up a little. Walnuts are great candied or dipped in chocolate and make a nice addition to an hors d’oeuvres table, especially during the holidays.


Make maple candied walnuts by quickly adding 1 cup (8 oz) raw walnut halves, 2 tablespoons (1 oz) maple syrup and a pinch of salt to a hot skillet that’s been sitting over medium high heat. Stir constantly until the nuts are coated and the syrup has evaporated. Be careful not to let the syrup burn. Let them cool on wax paper, pulling them apart as they do so. Store in an airtight container.You can also simply melt some chocolate – dark or milk – and dip the walnuts in about halfway. Lay them on wax paper to dry completely and then store in an airtight container., Walnuts are a great addition to any snack mix you might want to whip up. Add them to your choice of dried fruit (cranberries, pineapple, and banana chips are great options) and a handful or two of coated chocolate candy for an easy snack mix.

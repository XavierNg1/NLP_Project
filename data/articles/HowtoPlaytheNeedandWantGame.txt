 Basically, you are to go shopping and only come home with what you need rather than with any impulse buys or things you thought you wanted but really don't need. To win this game, there must be no wants in the stuff brought home (subject to the exceptions to the rule below).;
, This will help to give your mind the advantage over your stomach and general feelings of fatigue. It's far harder to resist purchases when you lack energy (including as a result of lack of sleep) because you're more likely to feel like you need a "pick-me-up" and it's far harder to excuse yourself for unnecessary purchases.
 You're more likely to win this game if you already know what you need before you go shopping.
 Start playing:


Get out your list.
Every time you see something that is not on your list and find yourself wanting to put it in your basket or cart, you have to ask yourself: Do I need this? Or do I just want this?
Stick with what you need. Every time you answer "want", put the item back on the shelf. Walk on.
 Make your purchases. At home, tally up how well you've done. If you have no impulse buys, purchases that were not on the list, no "wants", then you win. For every slip-up, you've succumbed to wants over needs.
 Whether you are trying to save money, save resources, or stop cluttering up your life, you will discover over time that this not only gets easier but makes the few times when you do buy a treat so much more exciting and rewarding than giving in to wants all of the time.

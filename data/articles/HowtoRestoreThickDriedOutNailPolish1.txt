 Most beauty shops sell acetone. You may also be able to find it in a drug store that sells beauty supplies. Once you have your acetone, add a few drops to a container.Acetone is acidic, so you will need a container it will not eat through. Avoid plastic. Use a glass cup instead. A shot glass would work. Just make sure to wash it thoroughly before drinking out of it again.;
, Add equal parts orange oil to the mix. Swish the mixture around to blend.
 Place the brush in the acetone and swish it around. Any remaining clumps of nail polish should break off from the brush and begin to loosen. Keep swishing until the brush is clean.








If there are some clumps of nail polish that will not come off, use a paper towel to remove them.
 The brush is now fairly soaked in acetone. Place it back in the bottle. Screw the cap back in place and lightly shake the bottle. The acetone in the brush should loosen up the rest of the polish so you can use it like it's new.

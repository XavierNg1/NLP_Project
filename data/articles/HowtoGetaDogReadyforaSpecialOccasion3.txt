 Special occasions often include unfamiliar people and surroundings. This can be both exciting and stressful for your dog. Even the best-behaved dogs may be thrown off under these conditions. The best way to make sure your dog minds their manners during a special occasion is to train them well from day one and practice this training daily.


Don’t assume that just because your dog knows how to “stay” in your living room at home that they will follow this command in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony. As soon as you get to the location of the event, practice basic commands like “stay,” “sit,” and “be quiet” with your dog., If your dog has a few bad habits, like jumping up to greet people or begging for food, do everything you can to break bad habits before the day of the event. If you’re short on time, determine which bad habits might be the most problematic depending on the occasion and work on those first., Putting your dog through an obedience course is always a good idea, but especially so if you plan to have them participate in various special occasions, like holiday parties, weddings, or dog shows. Going to a professional dog trainer can help give your dog the skills they need to perform at their best and will give you the tools to help them do so.

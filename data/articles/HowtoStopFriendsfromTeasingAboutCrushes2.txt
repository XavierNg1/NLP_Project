 The goal is to divert their attention to anything else other than your crush. Get your friends talking about what they’re up to or the things that they’re interested in.


Make the conversation less about you and more about them. Ask questions about their day, any plans they may have for the weekend, or about the latest movie they watched. Be excited about what they are saying in order to encourage them to keep talking more about them and less about you and your crush.
Encourage your friends to open up. Ask them about the love interest in their life or if they have their eye on someone. Your interest can make them feel comfortable with expressing themselves about what's going on in their lives.
 If your friends insist on bringing up your crush, you don't have to talk about the person if you don't want to. When it seems like they're about to start teasing you, try one of these approaches:


Tell your friends, "I don't want to talk about that right now."
Shrug, then turn it around and bring up one of their boyfriends/girlfriends.
Act like you didn't hear what they said, and change the subject entirely.
 If unwanted teasing starts happening, transition into in a more welcoming conversation. If there's something you have in common that you could both talk about happily for hours, jump straight to that instead of lingering on the subject of your crush.


For example, if your friend is a huge sports fan, bring up their favorite player/team or recap last night’s sports highlights. Friendly banter about whose player/team is the best can help switch the conversation gears to more pleasant conversation.

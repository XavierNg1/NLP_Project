Push and turn down - push the lid downward and push it until it rotates and opens.
Squeeze the sides and turn - use the grooves around the lid to get a good grip on it, then squeeze and turn the lid at the same time until it opens.
Push down the tab and turn - use your palm to push down the tab and turn the lid until it opens.
Line up the arrows - rotate the lid until the arrow on the lid is in line with the arrow on the lip of the container. Then, lift the lid off the container.

 Draw a teardrop shape and another teardrop that's slightly larger. Then sketch a large triangle.


Since these will only be used for tracing, you do not need to use cardstock or cardboard. You may use any paper you like.;
, Choose a bright and colorful sock to use. Patterned socks also work. You may stuff it with stuffing, beads, dried rice, beans, or anything small and round, such as pebbles.
 Wait until it's completely dried. Be careful not to burn yourself.
 Once the glue has dried, cut the edges off. Try a more curvy approach so it resembles more of a narwhal's tail.


You may skip this step, but your smaller teardrop template will have to be large enough to cover half the sock at its widest point.
 Turn the sock upside down and shake it to make sure the stuffing will not come out. If your beads or stuffing falls out, it is either not sealed or has too much stuffing.
 Make two of each tear drop and a single large triangle. Try to make the teardrops match.


Use the white fabric on the triangle.
 Simply roll it up and pinch the bottom to keep it from unraveling. You may twist for a spiral effect, or wrap black thread around it.
 This prevents from unraveling. Make sure the hot glue does not drip on you or spread.


Trim your horn until it reaches your desired shape. Make sure the bottom is flat so it is easier to glue on later.
 Make sure the points are facing outwards. You can use larger fabrics if you like a larger tail, but be sure they are identical.
 Place hot glue on the tear drop, and then place some on your sock. This prevents it from making a mess. Be careful not to have them uneven!

, Make sure the bottom is flat before you glue it. Otherwise, it might come off. If it does come off, your horn may not be sturdy enough.
 You can use black fabric circles or googly eyes in its place. Add additional accessories such as spots if desired.

 Try to find some inspiration for your birthday card. There's a big chance you will find books about arts and craft in your local library. And, of course, the internet has thousands of ideas. Just search for birthday cards on Google and you'll find lots of original ideas and designs.
 Again, arts and craft books and the internet could give you some ideas on what you'll need to make your chosen design. Also, if things might get messy when making the card, you'll need something like an apron or an old shirt to protect your clothing.

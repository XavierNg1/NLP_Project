 So Total bits = Tb = 8.

Sub-net mask can be 0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254 and 255.



 


Below table gives you the "Number of bits used for subnetting"(n) to their corresponding subnet mask.






For subnet mask 255 is default, so it'll not consider for subnet masking.
For example:
Let, IP address = 210.1.1.100 and Sub-net mask = 255.255.255.224
Total bits = Tb = 8
Number of bits used for subnetting = n = 3
(as subnet mask = 224 and its corresponding "No. of bits used for Subnetting" is 3 from above table)




;
, Tb = m+n.


Number of bits left for host = m = Tb - n = 8 - 3 = 5







, Number of host per subnet = 2m - 2.


Number of subnets = 2n = 23 = 8
Value of last bit used for subnet masking = Î” = 2m = 25 = 32







,


The 8 subnets (as calculated in previous step) are shown above.
Each of them has 32 addresses.



Here the taken IP address is 210.1.1.100 . 210.1.1.100 comes in 210.1.1.96 - 210.1.1.127 subnet (see the previous step table). So 210.1.1.96 is network address and 210.1.1.127 is broadcast address for the taken IP address i.e. 210.1.1.100 .

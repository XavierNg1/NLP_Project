 Every state has a Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, or some similar office. Check the Internet to find out what the office is called in your state and to locate their web site. Reviewing that site will be invaluable to you for information about re-titling your vehicle. The unofficial site DMV.org contains helpful information for locating state offices., If you cannot locate a web site or do not have access to a computer, you should be able to contact a customer support telephone number to call. These lines generally have a wealth of information, either in the form of a live representative or a library of recorded information., Whichever method you use, you should be able to find out the specific details that you will need to know to obtain a title in your new state. Ask about any special requirements that the new state may need for you to obtain a title. Some things to ask about are:


Inspection
Emissions test
VIN Verification
Detailed registration requirements
Proof of sale price or valuation

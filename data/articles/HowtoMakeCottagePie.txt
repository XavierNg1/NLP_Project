 Place in a large pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Boil for about 20 minutes (or until the potatoes are tender when poked with a fork).;
, Once the vegetables are softened, add the meat to the pan. Once the meat starts to brown add the tomato puree and fry with the meat. Add any other vegetables of your choice when the meat is almost browned. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked and the vegetables are tender.
 Pour in the beef stock or gravy, add the Worcestershire sauce (optional) and any other seasoning you want. Once the stock/gravy is boiling, cover the pan and leave to simmer for 10-20 minutes if using gravy, or 20-30 minutes if using stock. Stir occasionally. Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't become too thick or dry.
 Once the potatoes are cooked, drain out the water and mash with half a cup of milk and a big spoonful of butter, (it helps if you microwave the butter for a few seconds to soften it up first), although it depends on your preference.
 Then, spread the mashed potato evenly over the top of the meat filling. It's easiest to add the potato bit by bit rather than trying to add it all in one go and then try to spread it out. Use a fork to run lines across the potato, this will go crispy once it's been baked.
 Remove the baking dish from the oven, leave for a few minutes before serving (it will be very hot) and then enjoy!

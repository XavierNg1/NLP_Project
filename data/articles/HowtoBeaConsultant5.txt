 Pick a field that you're not only an expert in, make sure that it's something you're passionate about. You can consult for just about any type of business, but here are some of the most popular fields (see a longer list here).


Accounting
Advertising
Communications
Marketing
Public Relations

, In most cases, a bachelor's degree in a related field is the bare minimum for becoming a consultant. An advanced degree, such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) will greatly improve your chances, especially when paired with courses in the following:


Strategic Management
Consulting Practices
Business Development

, Even though you may be working for yourself, you have become a business and may need to take the proper legal steps before operating. These steps may vary depending on the state your operating within and the type of business you'll be consulting.


For example, a financial consultant should have certificates for Financial Planning (FP) and the Member of the Society of Financial Advisors (MSFA).
Fund-raising consultants don't need special certification, although you can become certified through the National Society of Fund Raising Executives. And in some states, you may need to register as a professional fund-raising consultant before starting your business.

, If you've just graduated, this is a terrific way to learn the ropes of a business without being too bogged down by the corporate process. You'll see a lot and most likely have an opportunity to work on multiple projects, thus expanding your knowledge of the business.

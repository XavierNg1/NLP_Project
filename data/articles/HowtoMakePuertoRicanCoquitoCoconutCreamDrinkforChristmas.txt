 Make sure you've got everything ready: a can of evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coconut milk, white rum, cinnamon, vanilla extract, 2 cinnamon sticks, and 1 halved vanilla bean. The vanilla bean is optional but it really does add an extra delicious taste to the drink. You can also use ordinary rum instead of white rum. If you want a creamier taste, you can use cream of coconut instead of coconut milk.


If you want to make the drink virgin, then replace the rum with a cup of cold coconut or ice.;
, Start by putting the evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coconut milk in a blender. Blend them together for about a minute, and then add the rum, cinnamon, and vanilla. If your blender isn't large enough, you can also blend the ingredients together in batches.
 Pour the ingredients into an ordinary pitcher or even some glass bottles. Whatever you use, make sure that it has a lid and is fully covered. You can even stick with the blender you were using. Just like revenge, Coquito is best served cold! Some people even refrigerate it overnight, but giving it at least two hours should do the trick too.


Add the cinnamon sticks and halved vanilla bean to the mixture before you refrigerate it.
 This will help blend the ingredients a bit more.
 Pour this drink into small glasses and serve the tasty drink garnished with a bit of cinnamon and a cinnamon stick or just on the rocks. You can keep the leftovers in the fridge for about a week, but if you make Coquito right, there won't be any leftovers! This recipe will serve about five 8 oz. bottles.


If you like the drink but want to make it less potent, you can replace some of the rum with ice, coconut milk, or even whole milk.

 Pork sausage and bacon are both fairly common to country-style gravy, but they are not necessarily a standard ingredient.


Crumble roughly 1/8 lb (60 g) of sausage into the pan for every 2 cups (500 mL) country gravy you plan to prepare.Crumble 4 to 6 slices of bacon into the gravy for every 2 cups (500 mL) of country gravy.
Cook the sausage or bacon first and set aside. Use the fat from the meat to help form the roux for your gravy.
 Cook about 1/4 lb (115 g) ground beef for every 2 cups (500 mL) of gravy you plan to prepare.


Cook the hamburger first. Make sure that the beef is fully browned and fully cooked before removing it from the pan.
Add about 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of the rendered fat back into the pan to serve as the fat base for your roux. Add the flour, seasonings, and milk according to standard recipe instructions.
Stir the cooked, crumbled ground beef back into the country gravy just before serving.
 Different seasonings can give your country gravy a slightly different taste.


For a kick of heat, try adding 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) ground cayenne pepper, 1 tsp (5 mL) chili powder, or 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) ground white pepper per 2 cups (500 mL) of gravy.
For a warmer taste, add 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, ground cloves, or ground allspice to 2 cups (500 mL) of country gravy.
For a more savory taste, add 1 Tbsp (15 mL) fresh herbs like cilantro, oregano, or parsley.
 Stirring in grated or shredded cheese can turn country gravy into something that can satisfy any cheese-lover at your table.


Add about 1/2 cup (125 mL) grated or shredded cheese per 1 cup (250 mL) sauce.
Stir the cheese in at the end, just before serving. Stir until the cheese melts completely.
Try cheddar, mozzarella, or your favorite type of cheese.
 Onions and mushrooms can add a gourmet touch to a standard country gravy.


Saut√© 1 cup (250 mL) sliced mushrooms and 2 Tbsp (60 mL) chopped onion in butter or oil. Prepare 2 cups (500 mL) of country gravy in the same skillet or saucepan without removing the mushrooms and onions.

 If you started with Cyndaquil, it'll learn Smokescreen while Pidgey can learn Sand-Attack. Both should be evolved to their second forms by the time you reach Whitney.
 By lowering its accuracy, its attacks will miss more often, giving you a better chance of defeating it.
 Special attacks such as Thundershock or Ember will work better than physical attacks, given Miltank's lower special defense. You can buy Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Ice Punch in the Goldenrod Department Store if you have any Pok√©mon that can learn one or more of those attacks (Abra, in particular, can learn all three and has a high special attack).

 There are many different products labeled "tire installation tool." For this method, you'll need one that looks like a long metal bar with a "mounting guide" that slips over it. The mounting guide has a curved channel about the same width as your bike rim, so the tire can fit onto it.


Look for this from companies that sell foam tires or tubeless tires.
 After removing the old tire and tube, snap a section of the new tire into place and secure with a zip tie.
 Fit the end of the bar over the wheel axle or quick release pin. The bar should rotate freely around the wheel without coming detached.
 The mounting bar channel should face the same direction as the rim channel.
 Fit a section of loose tire onto the mounting guide. Slide the mounting guide up near the rim, so the tire stay taut and secure in the mounting guide.
 As you rotate the bar around the wheel, slip the tire off the mounting guide and onto the rim. Once some of the tire is seated, the tool should do most of the work for you.
 If there are any loose areas, squeeze them down or push them into place with a plastic pry bar or rubber mallet. Once finished, remove the zip tie and reattach the wheel to your bike.

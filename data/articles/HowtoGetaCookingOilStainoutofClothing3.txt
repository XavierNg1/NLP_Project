 Sometimes, you don't notice oil stains until after you have already washed and dried the garment. Unfortunately, the heat of the dryer would have set the stain into the fabric. Luckily, it is still possible to remove the stain. Here is a list of what you will need to do this:Cardboard (recommended)
WD-40
Baking soda
Dish soap
Old toothbrush
Small bowl and Q-tips (for small stains)
Washing machine

, Try to cut the cardboard several times larger than the stain, in case the stain spreads. The cardboard will prevent the stain from sinking into the back of your garment.
 If you have a small stain, spray the WD-40 into a small bowl, and apply it to the stain using a Q-tip. The WD-40 will help break the oil stain down and make it easier to get out., Pour some baking soda over the stain and WD-40. You want a nice, thick layer. Work it into the fabric using a toothbrush. As you scrub, you will notice the baking soda clumping up. This is because the baking soda is absorbing the oil.
 Dust off the old, clumpy baking soda, and sprinkle on some new baking soda. Keep scrubbing, dusting, and adding new baking soda until you get no more clumps.You will probably end up with lots of white powder everywhere. Don't worry. This is normal. The baking soda will wash off.
 Gently swirl the dish soap so get it into the fabric. Make sure that there is still a slick layer of dish soap. If it has completely soaked into the fabric, add a little bit more.
 Do not rinse the dish soap off; it will come off in the washer., If the stain is still there, let the garment air-dry, and try the method again. You can also take the item to a dry cleaner. Only when the stain is gone is it safe to put it into the dryer. This is because the heat of the dryer can set the stain.

 Leave room for the addition of the lilac flower petals and sugar.;
, Sprinkle the separated petals onto the sugar in the jar.
, Shake vigorously to move the petals through the sugar in the jar.
 Choose a dry, dark and cool spot to store it. Shake it every now and then over the next two to three days.

Add some of the violet food coloring at this stage if using. If you do so, leave the sugar on a parchment covered tray to dry out. This may take several days.
 Keep the lilac sugar in the pantry away from light and humidity. Use when making or baking foods that require a lilac flavour or add to your tea and coffee. It is also lovely sprinkled over cereal, fresh fruit and added to tisanes. Why not try making cinnamon toast using lilac sugar instead of plain sugar?

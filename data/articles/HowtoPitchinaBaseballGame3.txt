 This will reduce pain, swelling, and risk of injury. Keep the ice on until it gets too cold to bear.
 Everyone makes mistakes, and you have a chance to make up for it the next time you pitch. If you have pitched badly multiple games in a row, then try changing your mechanics until you pitch consistently.
 You helped your team, and pitching is not easy work! Great job!

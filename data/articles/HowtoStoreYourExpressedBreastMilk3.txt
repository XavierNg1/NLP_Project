 The morning you want to use a container of breast milk, move it from the freezer to the refrigerator to give it time to thaw. Don't place it on the countertop to thaw; it's better to have a slower transition from frozen to thawed., Fill a bowl with water that is warm, not hot, and place the jar or bag of breast milk in the bowl. Let it warm until it's a bit warmer than room temperature, then use it immediately.
 The milk could get too hot and scald the baby, and excess heat destroys the nutrients in the breast milk., Thaw only as much as you can use in one day. If you have some leftover after a feeding discard it, as it may have become contaminated.

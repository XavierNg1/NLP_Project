 This is the most important (and obvious) step to this process!;
, Try not to stick to your actual name.
 Hopefully, they'll comment back.
 People like others that are interesting and creative. If you do something that gets people interested, then they will comment you.
 This might grab their attention as most people just put "Come to my page." You'll seem more interesting.
 Actually type things about yourself, & make your page attractive!





, This is very important. Think about it this way: would you look at someone's page that left you a comment saying, "You better come to my page." No., EVERYONE goes on bebo bands and groups. But don't comment like "Please come to my page". That's useless, as everyone does that!

, Almost everyone should comment back, which will add to your page views and keep them coming back. They may even tell their friends about you - easy views!

, Click that and in one of the sections on the side, set it up like a profile view counter and type in the number you'd like.

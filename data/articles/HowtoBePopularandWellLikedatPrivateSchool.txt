 Go to a cool church, and get your friends to go too! Wear your pretty dresses and go to Starbucks afterwards. Small group is an awesome way to have fun. You get about 12 girls to come to your house, and for the first hour, you get to hang out at their house, and then a college student comes and teaches you a lesson about God. You can all go to dinner afterwards!;
, These hair accessories are popular at school.
 It's really important to them, especially at a private school!

, Popular private school kids love to play sports and watch sports. Have sleepovers where you play volleyball, play v-ball in the pool, swim, or jump on the trampoline. It's always tons of fun!

, You MUST HAVE designer brands and dress like you're set for the runway! If your school has uniforms, you still need this for the weekends, and spice up your uniform with ah-dorable accessories! :D Juicy Couture is super cute! Their tracksuits, dresses, shoes, purses, school supplies, and accessories are adorable and a definite must! Billabong, Hollister, PacSun, and Roxy are also cute. The surfer style is so cool right now! The preppy, girly style like Abercrombie, A&F, and Forever 21 are also SO fashionable, trendy, in, and cute! ;D

,, These popular girls don't get in big trouble, but sometimes just little trouble because they talk and laugh during class. They don't get detention, but it's enough for the teacher to tell them to stop.
 Cute binders are a must for middle and high school. Juicy Couture and Ed Hardy have good ones. You can put notes from your friends in the front, and it instantly makes you smile.
 Remember that you can damage your hair if you flatiron it all the time. Major curls aren't in anymore, but waves/slightly wavy/slightly curly hair are cute. In fact, most people with wavy/slightly curly hair get voted Best Hair if their hair is gorgeous.

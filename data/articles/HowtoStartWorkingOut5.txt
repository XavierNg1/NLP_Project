 That is to say, don't miss workouts. If most of us are being honest our workout history looks like this: workout for a couple of months. Get sick and stop. Spend a couple months getting back to where we were. Life gets hectic and stop. Spend a couple months getting back to where we were. See the pattern? Yep, no progress. So whatever you do, stick with it. Otherwise you'll get nowhere.


You'll be amazed at how much easier it is when you do (or how much harder when you don't). And when things are easier, you're more likely to do them. The second you start skipping, it's all downhill (or uphill, depending on your perspective) from there. So don't.
 Awesome -- you're out there and going. Now your biggest problem is plateauing and getting bored. You'll know when this is happening -- your motivation is waning even though your skills may not be. The same gusto just isn't there anymore. The answer? Do something different.


If you've been running that same 5k five days a week, take it outside. Find a new trail, start running at night, or start for a 7k. If that's not enough, pick up a new activity entirely. A yoga fan? Try pilates. Always wanted to try kickboxing? Go for it. You're ready.
 When you feel it's time, reassess your fitness level. What are you capable of now that you weren't before? What's your heart rate like during these activities? Odds are everything's betterâ€”time for a new challenge!


It's all about staying motivated. Have you gotten really close to your weight loss goal? Great! Now let's start thinking about muscle definition. Have you been hiking that one trail without fail and with ease since you started? Time for the harder one. This new you needs new goals. In time, a new goal will be a reward. After all, look how far you've come.

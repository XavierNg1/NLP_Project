 If you're a visual or creative person, making up symbols for your new language can be a great way to secretly communicate with your friends. These symbols can represent entire words instead of creating a whole new alphabet. This is an option if you're fine with only being able to write your made up language. However, if you want to speak your secret language, this isn't the best method to use.


Reference other languages that use symbols for their written language to get inspiration for your symbols. Some languages that use symbols for words are Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphics., Make sure that the alphabet and dictionary have been agreed to by everyone involved. It's ideal to make symbols that are easy to draw so that your friends with poor drawing skills can still use the language. Making symbols for words instead of letters will make for a much simpler language to learn, and a much easier diary to create. Make sure that all of your friends get a copy of this dictionary.
 This way, you can have it memorized close to the same degree you have of your native/first language. Keep practicing and using it often, as new languages are easy to forget.

 Answer the questions that you compiled for yourself as comprehensively as you can given what you’ve managed to learn from your studying process. Do not consult your notes until after you’re done testing yourself on the study material. Note the questions you got wrong or didn’t answer and focus extra attention on the content related to them., Mnemonic devices are memory techniques that allow your brain to encode and retain information. These study tricks are essentially shortcuts that allow you to recall things, in the form of acronyms, images, rhymes, songs, or other memorable devices. Create or use mnemonic devices for the content that you have more difficulty remembering when studying.For example, a popular mnemonic device for students learning history is, “in fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue”, used to remember the year of Christopher Columbus’ famous expedition.
 Based on the sections that you struggle with when testing yourself, review your study material. Reread your notes and, if necessary, re-write notes for the content that you have trouble remembering to reinforce your understanding of it. Continue testing yourself on the material until you feel confident that you've learned it.

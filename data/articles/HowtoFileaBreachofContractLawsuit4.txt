 Some contracts may include a special provision requiring any disputes be handled through “alternate dispute resolution,” which includes the selection of a mediator or arbitrator.


The contract may specify certain qualifications, such as board certifications or association memberships, that the mediator or arbitrator must have.
Generally, mediation is a more casual and collaborative experience, while arbitration involves more formal, court-like rules and procedures.
Arbitration replaces a trial and the resolution is legally binding. Mediation typically is not legally binding.
Unlike a lawsuit, which is a matter of public record, mediation or arbitration is confidential.Even if your contract doesn’t specifically require mediation or arbitration, you can still choose this method over a traditional, formal trial if you want. Alternative dispute resolution is particularly attractive if you want to maintain a friendly relationship with the other party.
 Keep in mind any specifics listed in the contract. If there was no detail in the contract to guide you, your local court or bar association may have a list of recommended mediators and arbitrators.


You can also search for an arbitrator or mediator using a national service such as the American Arbitration Association.
 Although mediators or arbitrators won’t necessarily have the same formal service procedures as the courts, the more collaborative, voluntary process requires both parties to be aware and present.

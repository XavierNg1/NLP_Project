 Choose jars with plastic lined, screw-top lids. If you plan to freeze any jelly, make sure the jars are freezer safe. Jelly is poured, so the mouth size of the jar doesn’t need to be extra-wide.

Jelly recipes are typically presented with the amount of half-pint jars they will make. For example, if a recipe makes four half-pint jars, you’ll want four eight-ounce (240 mL) jars.
Plastic-lined lids are compatible with acidic ingredients like vinegar and lemon juice, whereas other types of lids like waxed and cellophane are not.;
, If you have a dishwasher, wash the jars on the regular cycle. Then set the dishwasher to “heated dry” until the jelly is ready to fill the jars. Alternately, boil the jars in a pot of water for ten minutes. Leave them in the hot water until you’re ready to fill them with jelly.Cooking jelly with apples is an overnight process, so you won’t need to do this until the second day.
 Fill a small pot with hot tap water. Place the metal lids into the water over low heat for at least five minutes. This will clean them and soften the seal. Leave them there to soak until you’re ready to use them.

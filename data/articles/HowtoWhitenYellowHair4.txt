 Squeeze out some lemon juice and rub it against the yellow areas of your hair. You can also apply it along with your shampoo for a more mild effect.
 Heat and sunlight will help the lemon juice lighten your hair., Leaving lemon juice in your hair too long can cause damage from the acid. Conditioning your hair or using alkali products will help prevent this.

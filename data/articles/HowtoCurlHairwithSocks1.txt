 Cut the toe off and roll into a ring. To do this, you start at the top, and slowly roll down creating a donut shape. One ring is all you need to make gorgeous curls! This method can be used for long hair, layered or straight, and also hard to curl hair. If it’s layered, you will have to work a little bit more to tuck them in.

, Flip your head over. Gather your hair, and put it into a high ponytail, as high up as it will go. Secure it with a “scrunchy” (this kind of ponytail tie prevents kinks) hair tie. 







, Only spray until it’s lightly damp. You don’t want it too wet; otherwise it may not be completely dry by morning. After you’ve done it a few times, you’ll know the perfect amount of dampness for your own hair.








If your hair tends to be on the frizzy side, add a little anti-frizz serum to your spray bottle. You may also need to first blow dry it smooth.
 Pull the sock straight up to the end of the ponytail. Then slide it back down a little bit. For the hairs that are sticking out, spread them around the top of the sock. After doing that, they should go up and over. You want them to tuck neatly under the bottom of it.
 Keep your ponytail straight up while you’re rolling so the hair stays taut. Continue rolling until you’ve reached the base of your ponytail. When you’re finished, you will have a bun on top of your head. There’s no need to secure it. It should stay put! Now go to sleep, and dream about how amazing your hair’s going to look when you wake up!







, Tada! You have a head full of natural-looking, pretty curls. Arrange, style the way you want, and start your day!

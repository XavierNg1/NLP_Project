 Direct sunlight may “blind” the camera and filters and burn the CCD causing stripes in the image.
 Due to the large contrast, the camera will adjust in order to achieve a good level for the sky and the interesting landscape or objects may appear too dark. One way to avoid these problems is to mount the camera high above the ground. Used a proper pole with sturdy pole mount adapter or wall mounted bracket and always use proper mountings to avoid vibrations caused by wind.

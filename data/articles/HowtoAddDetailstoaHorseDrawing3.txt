 Feathering is the long white bunches of hair that usually grow long enough to cover drafts hoofs/hooves. Some types of drafts don't have feathering, just add some extra hair to the horses hocks/ankles.
 Horses have white marks on legs called markings, not all of them have them. Choose what type of styles of leg markings you want like stockings, socks, coronet or even plain. If you show the horses face remember to add a white marking if you like, since most horses have them their too. The style could be blaze, stripe, star or snip.

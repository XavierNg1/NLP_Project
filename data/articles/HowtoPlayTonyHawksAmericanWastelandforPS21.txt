Controls might be hard but here are some simple controls

x is a ollie
x+square and right on the directional arrow <-- is a kick-flip.
x+square and left on the directional arrow --> is a heel-flip.

Combinations of x and square can add up to cool flip tricks such as hard-flip, varial kick-flip, inward heel-flip, impossible, pop shuv-it, and much more.


When going up a ramp click x and O+a directional arrow for a grab.

 If you have an equation with one variable, you will need to rewrite that equation so that the value "0" is the only value remaining on the right side of the equal sign.Example A: Change the following equation to standard form: x5 = -9

Example B: Change the following equation to standard form: y4 = 24

, To move terms, you will need to either add or subtract them from both sides of the equation.


The correct mathematical function will depend on what you need to do to leave nothing but a "0" on the right side of the equation.

If a number on the right side of the equation is negative, add it to both sides of the equation.
If a number on the right side of the equation is positive, subtract it from both sides of the equation.



Example A: x5 + 9 = -9 + 9

Since the value on the right was negative (-9), you must add positive 9 to both sides of the equation.



Example B: y4 - 24 = 24 - 24

Since the number on the right was positive (24), you must subtract positive 24 from both sides of the equation.
 Solve both sides of the equation. Once the only value on the right side is "0," you have the standard form of the equation.



Example A: x5 + 9 = 0

Example B: y4 - 24 = 0

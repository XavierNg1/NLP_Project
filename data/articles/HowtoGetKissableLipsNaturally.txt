  Apply a good coat of honey on your lips, thick enough that you can see it in a mirror but not so thick it drips down your face, and leave it on overnight.  This remedy is yummy and hard not to lick off, so only do this if you have good self control.  When you wake up, you'll have smooth, puckery lips!;

  Rinse your toothbrush with water, and gently rub your lips with it.  If you want, apply a little bit of petroleum jelly on the toothbrush (only do this if the toothbrush is an old one that you are not using).  This gets rid of dead skin.

  Simply wet a cloth with warm water and press it to your lips for a few minutes, dipping it back in water as needed when it cools. Afterwards, gently rub it across your lips to remove dead skin.

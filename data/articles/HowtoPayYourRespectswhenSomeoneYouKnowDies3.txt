 In the days and weeks after the funeral or memorial service, you can pay your respects by visiting the graveyard or crypt where the deceased was laid to rest. It is generally acceptable to bring flowers or other mementos of the dead. This is a great way to privately honor the deceased., If you are close to the bereaved, it may be comforting to you and them to talk about the deceased. Do this on a case-by-case basis, as some people may want to talk about the person and others may not.


Talk about the great times you had with the person, and relay the qualities about them you will miss. If you want, you may try to keep it upbeat by telling funny stories about experiences you shared with the deceased.
 If you want to continue to pay respects to the deceased after their memorial service, you can implement a ritual that helps you keep the person’s memories alive. For instance, if a teacher who loved chocolate chip cookies died, you might bake them each month on the anniversary of their death.You might also ask other mourners to join you. For instance, you might go to lunch every other Friday at the person’s favorite restaurant.

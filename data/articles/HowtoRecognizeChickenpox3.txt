 The medications used to treat chickenpox are not given to everyone. In many cases, doctors won't prescribe harsh medicines to children, unless the infection looks like it could lead to pneumonia or another equally serious issue.For best results, antiviral medication must be given within the first 24 hours of the appearance of the rash.
If you have skin conditions such as eczema, lung conditions like asthma, were recently treated with steroids or have a compromised immune system, antiviral medication will be considered.
Some women who are pregnant may also qualify for administration of antiviral medication., Children especially should not take either and babies under six months old should not take ibuprofen at all. Aspirin has been associated with another serious condition called Reyes syndrome and Ibuprofen may lead to other secondary infections. Instead, take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to treat headaches or other pain or fevers resulting from chickenpox., Although the blisters and scabs are very itchy, it is important that you do not remove the scabs or scratch the rash. Removing a scab will cause that pox to scar and itching increases the risk of bacterial infections. Cut your child's finger nails if they cannot help scratching their blisters.
 Place cold compresses over the blisters. Take cooler bathes. The cooler temperature will help alleviate both the itching and fever that may accompany chickenpox.
 Take cool baths with baking soda or colloidal oatmeal or apply calamine lotion to help to ease the itching. If this doesn’t relieve the itching call your doctor for medication. The baths and calamine lotion will relieve itching (reduce the severity) but there isn’t anything that will completely take it away until the blisters have healed.


Calamine lotion can be purchased at any grocery store or pharmacy.

 When you become exposed to a virus, your body reacts by increasing your internal body temperatures, thus creating a fever. Fevers are meant to burn out the infection, thereby protecting you from the virus.


The Ebola virus also stimulates the production of cytokine and histamine in your body. The increased production of these two chemicals can also lead to a fever.;
, Viral infections often cause headaches, which means headaches can also be a sign of other illnesses, not just Ebola. Headaches occur when blood vessels in your head become narrow due to fever or infection.
 This symptom may not be present in some Ebola patients. When the virus begins to spread through the body, it creates symptoms much like the flu, so there is the potential for a sore throat to develop.


Your throat may begin to feel scratchy or dry. This can lead to irritation of the throat lining which leads to a sore throat.
 This happens when virions (virus particles) start invading the gastrointestinal tract. The virions will attack the intestinal cells thus causing stomach pain by altering normal gastrointestinal activity.

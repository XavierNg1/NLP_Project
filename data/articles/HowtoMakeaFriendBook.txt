 You could just add a few pictures or make a collage. You could also have your friends help you decorate. Remember to be creative, because you will look at this later in your life.;
, Include things they like, any hobbies they have, any pets they have, even their favorite food. Make each page unique, maybe color each background with the friend's favorite color. Remember to add their picture!

, If you both like the band Paramore, include a Paramore page. If you went to a concert, add a page for that concert. If you both like The Hunger Games, include a page for the The Hunger Games. Decorate each page and add a lot of pictures!

, Have them autograph their page, or maybe even make a page for yourself and have your friends write down what they think about you.
 Don't worry if your book gets filled, you can always make another one!

, There is no such thing as too much. If you and your friends discover a new awesome show, add it!

, Remember to add all of your friends and never lose or forget about it.

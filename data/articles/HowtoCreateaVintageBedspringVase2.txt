 Take a piece of sheet music and roll it into the shape of a cone. Position your cone of music so it fits inside your bedspring, lining it. Fill your sheet music vase with whatever your want: pinecones and dry flowers tend to work well.To allow your sheet music vase to hold real flowers, tuck a votive filled with water into the bottom of the cone.
Try lining your bedspring with a map and filling the insides with seashells for a more nautical feel.
 To complete this project, youâ€™ll need a bedspring, an old handkerchief, a tulip and the lid of a vintage Mason jar. Wrap your tulip in the handkerchief, then stand the flower up inside your bedspring. Fill your Mason jar lid with water and position it underneath the flower to keep the flower hydrated.Refill your Mason jar with water every three hours to keep your flower alive.
Create three or more bedspring tulip vases and line them up in the center of your dining room table to create a striking centerpiece.
 Stand your bedspring up and position a mini-potted plant in the narrowest portion of the bedspring cone. Plant your bedspring outside in your garden, or display it by a window with lots of natural light.Swap out the plant in your pot in favor of a candle and line the patio of your house with bedspring candles.
Plant succulents in your pot for a low maintenance plant that will thrive without care.

 Purchase a commercial cleaner, such as Goof Off Stain Remover, to finish the job. Look for specific caulk removers. Follow all instructions and warnings supplied by the manufacturer to ensure proper cleaning.Warning: Always pretest new cleaners on old clothing before applying it to important or favorite garments.
 Antibacterial sanitizing products can remove some stains from clothing, and they may be effective on caulk. First, squeeze the sanitizer onto the stained area. Rub the spot gently with a tissue or a damp rag. You may need to use several applications of sanitizer if the stain is especially bad.
 Wet the stain with water. Pour baking soda onto the fabric while it's still wet. Massage the baking soda into the fabric with a rag or towel until the caulk comes out.


If the stain does not come out completely, keep trying. Put the clothing in the wash afterward, and results will improve even more.

 If your dog is too heavy for you to pick up, you can still use a home scale with a little preparation. Place a large, stable container on the scale, or make your own platform from plywood, rigid foam, or plastic. Place this so the scale supports the entire platform, then cut out a window so you can read the display. Now you can still use a home scale to weigh your big dog. Follow these steps:Coax the dog onto the platform and have it sit down in a steady position. Record the weight displayed on the scale.
Move the dog off the platform. Record the weight of the platform alone.
Subtract the weight of the platform from the first measurement. This is the weight of your dog.
 If you don’t have a scale at home, or you can’t get your dog to use the platform method, try taking your dog to a bus station. Put on the leash and take your dog to a long-distance bus travel station – Greyhound is an appropriate choice. These stations have oversize scales to weigh luggage, though you may need to sweet talk the employee at the counter.Consider bringing a small coffee gift card or similar token of appreciation for the favor.
 Call up the receptionist or vet tech at your veterinarian and ask if you can use the scale at the office. If you find a nice employee, you might be able to pop in and use the scale without paying for an appointment.If your vet is a stickler for following the rules, you may need to just bite the bullet and schedule an appointment with your vet to find out your dog’s official weight.
 For best results, have a veterinarian examine your dog and recommend a goal weight. You can find weight recommendations for each breed online, but these are not always accurate for your dog, especially if he is a mixed breed.Talk to your vet about your dog’s weight and ask if they have any recommendations for diet and exercise.

 You may be able to prevent manic episodes from happening in the first place by practicing good sleep hygiene. This can be very effective at curing sleeplessness in individuals with bipolar disorder - even those in a manic episode. Consider developing a winding-down routine to get you in the right mind-frame for sleep.A nightly routine may consist of doing light stretching, tidying up your home, preparing your clothing for the following day, taking a hot bath, and reading a book. Try to do things that do not involve bright lights or technology since these things do not signal to your brain that it is sleep time. Do calming activities that indicate to both your brain and your body that sleep time is nearing.
 The bedroom should be associated primarily with sleeping. If you are a person that does work on your laptop in bed or watches TV while in bed, you may need to change those habits to get to sleep. Try moving distracting activities from the bedroom and do these in another area.
 Get a cozy mattress, bedding, and pillows to create an environment conducive to sleeping. In addition, cover your windows with black-out curtains to let minimal light in. Turn down your thermostat to a cool temperature.
 Depending on any medications you are taking, you may have already been instructed to limit these beverages completely. However, if you have been cleared to drink alcohol and caffeine, keep consumption to several hours before bed.You may be surprised at the advice about not drinking alcohol before bed. Most people will feel drowsy after one or two drinks. Even though alcohol may help you fall asleep, it does not promote good quality sleep and you may wake up hours later and be unable to fall asleep again.
Caffeine is a stimulant, so the last thing you want to do in the hours before bed is stimulate yourself even more than you already may be with manic symptoms. Cut caffeine intake in the afternoon to sleep better at night.

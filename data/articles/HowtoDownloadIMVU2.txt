 In the address bar of a new tab on your Safari browser, enter this address: http://www.imvu.com/newimvu/mac.php.


It should take you to a download page. Click the the “Download IMVU on MAC for Free” button to begin the download.
 As a default, the downloads from Safari will go to the desktop.


Look for the installation file there.
Double click on the installer, which should be named something along the lines of “IMVU_installer.dmg.”
The installation process should be straightforward, not requiring any special customized settings. Click “Next” on each page to proceed with the installation.
When it finishes, an IMVU icon should appear in your desktop, ready for launching.

 Visit a hardware store to purchase a boron chemical powder; boron-based treatments are one of the safer options for an amateur to use.Ask the salesperson there for tips on applying the solution, and purchase other items you might need for the treatment:


Garden sprayer
Face mask
Protective goggles
Safety gloves

, Chemical compounds can produce fumes that cause adverse reactions if touched or inhaled. If possible, bring the infected item outside for treatment; before working with the solution, take the time to put on a face mask along with a pair of safety goggles and gloves. This will minimize exposure to the skin and eyes and prevent inhalation of the gases released during the treatment phase. Make sure to cover the ground underneath the item as well.
 Boron powder is quite concentrated, so follow the instructions for mixing it with water very carefully. Respect the ratio of water to solution; the exact ratio will be indicated on the packaging and should be adhered to perfectly. When making a certain amount of the solution, factor in the size of the wooden item being treated and how many coats you will want to use.Pour the prepared treatment solution into a garden sprayer, making sure the unit is sealed tight to avoid accidentally spilling any of the solution.


Be sure to keep the chemicals away from children and pets.
 Apply an even coat of the treatment solution to the wood surface. Allow the coat to dry before attempting to move the wood; leave the item at least an hour before going back to check on it.This drying time will allow the solution to permeate the wood surface and help expedite the woodworm eradication.


The solution can also be applied with a large paintbrush to get at small or hard to reach areas.

 You don't want to write a review solely based on first impressions.
Read the album cover while you listen, for an overview about the band/singer. You can also read other reviews or ask others for their opinion, to ascertain common attitudes towards the band/singer's genre and previous work. This is just background work; you won't be slavishly recycling old opinion from others.;
, You may want to write out an outline if that helps you organize your thoughts.
 This information is especially important for a debut album, but less so if the musicians are superstars, or if you would expect most readers in your intended audience to be familiar with the band.

If the celebrity is a standalone singer, still give information such as where are they from.
 You want the reader to get as much of a sense of what the music sounds like as possible.
, This will stay with the readers and help them to decide whether or not to buy the album.

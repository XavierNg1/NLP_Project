 Imagine lengthening your body through each vertebrae in your spine. Point your tailbone towards the ground and the crown of your head towards to sky. As you point your tailbone down you will need to align your body by shifting your pelvis slightly forward.Practice the proper alignment of your body by standing against a wall. Your head, shoulders, hips, and heels should all touch the wall.;
, As you lengthen your body, donâ€™t forget to relax. It is not uncommon for your body to naturally tense up as you stand up straight. Relaxing your body will allow your diaphragm to expand and enable you to take a deeper breath.If you find that your body is too tense, try shaking out your body and then regaining your singing posture. If you are having a hard time relaxing, you can also try progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive Muscle Relaxation is a systematic relaxation technique that enables you to relax each part of your body.
 Your ears should be over your shoulders and the crown of your head should be pointed at the ceiling. This position will allow the maximum amount of air to flow in and out of your abdomen.Holding your chin too high can cause your vocal cords and tongue to be stretched too tight.

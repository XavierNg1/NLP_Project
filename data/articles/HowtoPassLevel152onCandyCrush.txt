 The pathway in the middle column is cleared and not blocked by icing, and the two pathways on either side are only blocked by two icing squares. Positioning ingredients in the middle three columns will improve your odds of bringing down the ingredients sooner, and will force the release of the remaining ingredients onto the playing board.;
, Vertical striped candies will clear all candies that reside in the same column, and will break single layers of icing and jellies.


Create vertical striped candies by matching four same-colored candies in a row, moving the fourth candy into the match in an upward or downward vertical direction.
 Combining striped candies with special candies such as wrapped candies and color bombs will produce effects that will help clear the layered icing and unblock the ingredientsâ€™ pathways.Create wrapped candies by matching five same-colored candies in an L shape, T shape, or + shape.
Create color bombs by matching five same-colored candies in a row.
 After ingredients land directly on icing, you may experience difficulty with breaking the icing and clearing the pathway underneath.Work on clearing any icing that lies directly below the ingredients. If ingredients fall onto the icing, try to move the ingredients sideways toward the open pathway. This can be achieved by swapping ingredients with nearby candies that can be matched and cleared.
 When detonated, wrapped candies will clear the surrounding eight candies.


Try to allow any wrapped candies you create to fall onto the icing before matching them with other candies. This will help clear multiple icing layers at the same time, and help clear the pathways for the ingredients.

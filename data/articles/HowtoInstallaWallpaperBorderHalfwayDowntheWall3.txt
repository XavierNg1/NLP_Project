 Keep the border rolled with the glue side facing up.
 Dunk the roll in a shallow tray of water. Allow it to stay submerged for about 10 seconds before removing it from the water.


Alternatively, you can unroll the paper without dunking it in water and apply a special paste-activating gel to the glue side of the border with a paintbrush., Fold the glue side inward without creasing it, and allow the border to relax and expand for about 5 minutes.

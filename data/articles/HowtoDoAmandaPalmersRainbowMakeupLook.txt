 Not only will this add some of Amanda's style, it will get your hair mostly out of your eyes!;
, If you haven't shaved them, skip this step.
 Use a primer (like Urban Decay's Primer Potion or a similar product, for example) if you like, because it helps the shadows last all day.
 Amanda uses all kinds of colors and she probably applies them with her fingertips - an artist's best tools! If you want to recreate her rainbow look, choose bright shades of red, green, blue, and yellow.
 Use your fingertips. Don't worry about making each eyelid match - this look is about being unique. Amanda will put yellow shadow on one eye, from lash-line to eyebrow, while the other eye sports red, green, AND yellow. So go crazy!

, It is recommended to put pencil liner in your lower waterline, and use liquid liner on the top lash-line. You can just apply a simple line with a little flick at the end, or you can go completely crazy with swoops and flourishes! Be creative.

 Then draw around it in eyeliner.;
, Somewhere in the circle, preferably quite near the edge, draw a small black dot for a pupil.
 At the top and the bottom of each circle draw long, exaggerated, cartoon-like eyelashes. When you close your eyes, it will look like you have massive eyes, in the style of the Tim Burton movies.
 Apply lighter foundation than you normally would so you look pale and ghostly. Also apply the foundation to your lips and eyebrows until they blend in with the rest of your face.


If wished, draw a red heart in the middle of your lips with bright red lipstick––think Helena Bonham-Carter as the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland.
, Then blend it in slightly so that it looks almost natural.
 Add cartoon freckles with eyeliner, or wear your hair in two French plaits like a doll. Wear kitten heels and a cute tutu-dress to complete the look.

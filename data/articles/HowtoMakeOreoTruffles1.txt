,, Place each ball onto a baking sheet covered in wax paper.



Stir the melted chocolate with a toothpick.
 Return them to the wax-paper covered baking sheet. To coat them in the melted chocolate, use a candy or truffle dipper, or use two forks to roll each Oreo ball until it is evenly coated.


Remove the dipper/forks from the balls and allow the excess chocolate from the balls to briefly drip back into the bowl before placing them onto the baking sheet.
 Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until the balls are firm.

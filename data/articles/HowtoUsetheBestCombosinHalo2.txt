, This is the best way to kill others swiftly and without being seen. Either the sniper rifle or the energy sword will do. If you're in a high place, try to snipe them if you can without them jumping. If they get away they're probably coming for you, so pull out that energy sword and chop their head off! If you like dual-wielding then go with the pistol and the smg (make sure to put the pistol in your good hand, since you will have to pull the trigger a lot).
 You might die, but you can still take them down with you.
,, - unless they are a long way off, then use something like a battle rifle, or even an SMG.
 Hold the trigger on the pistol, it will charge. When it is fully charged (your hand will shake), shoot an enemy. His shield will decrease to nothing, and a good grouping from SMG will kill him fast.

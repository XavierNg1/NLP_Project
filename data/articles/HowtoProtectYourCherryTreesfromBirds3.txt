 Fruit-eating birds love mulberry trees. Plant a female mulberry tree nearby, from a variety that fruits just before the cherry trees. The birds should flock to the mulberry tree much more than the cherries, as long as the tree still has fruit.


Avoid the mulberry variety Illinois Everbearing, which have slow-ripening fruit too large for many birds., Some orchard growers shoot larger cherry thieves such as jays and magpies, and/or trap starlings and other small birds. You may need government approval.In the US, contact the Department of Fish and Game or the local Agriculture Commissioner. In the UK, contact Wildlife Management.
Local university agriculture extensions can teach you how to choose and set traps. Traps are much more effective when matched to your bird population and set by an expert.

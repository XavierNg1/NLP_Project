Place a small, clean, soft bristled painting brush, small spoon, and tweezers nearby., Dip the brush into the egg whites and coat the tops of each flower. Make sure to coat the entire surface, as any uncovered portions may rot. Using the small spoon, sprinkle the petals with the sugar., Using the tweezers, flip each petal over gently. Repeat the process, brushing egg yolk over the back of each petal. Sprinkle with sugar., Leave the heartsease petals on the parchment paper to dry. Alternatively, place them on a baking rack to dry (gently, using the tweezers). Leave the petals for two to three hours to dry.Store crystallized petals in an airtight jar or container for up to a year.

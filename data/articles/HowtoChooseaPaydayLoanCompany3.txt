 The Attorney General of any state is that state’s chief law enforcement officer. In those states that regulate payday lending, the Attorney General’s office is charged with issuing licenses and investigating complaints. Before borrowing from any payday lender, check the website of your Attorney General to find whatever available information you can.If a lender has a history of complaints against it, you should be cautious about using them yourself.
 As payday loans have become increasingly popular, states have enacted protective legislation. Some legislation limits the fees or interest rates that lenders can charge, while other laws regulate the allowable length of repayment. You should understand the laws of your state so you can defend yourself against improper lending practices.


The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) has a website that contains a summary of all the state laws on payday lending. You can access this information at http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/payday-lending-state-statutes.aspx.
 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a government agency in the U.S. that is charged with protecting consumers’ rights. If you have questions about a particular lender or that lender’s loan practices, you can contact the FTC directly.


At the website, http://www.consumer.ftc.gov, you can find general advice about credit and loans.
The FTC will accept and investigate consumer complaints. If you believe you have entered into a loan agreement that is illegal, you can file a complaint online at www.consumer.ftc.gov. The FTC will investigate the complaint and report back to you. The FTC does not work to resolve your private matter, but they will be able to provide you with some advice about acts that you might take.

 When you receive an incoming call, a circle appears on the incoming call screen. Look closely at the options available surrounding that circle, and you’ll see that you need not be flustered.


Normally, to answer a call, you would slide the circle to the right side of the screen, and to reject the call, you would slide the circle to the left side of the screen.
The other option available is to decline the call with a text message.;
, When you can’t take a call, dragging the circle to the messaging icon and letting go will let you send a quick text message, which can either be pre-written or created on the spot.
 You can also choose the “Custom” option to create a text message (that is, when none of the pre-written messages will do).


Your selection of a pre-written text message will automatically decline the incoming call by sending the text message to the caller.
Creating custom messages and clicking on the Send button will also decline the call.
 The Phone app can be found in your App Drawer and is represented by a phone icon.
 It’s the button represented by three horizontal bars, and found at the bottom right or bottom left corner of the phone screen.
 You should be able to find it under Settings. In some Android devices, Call Settings can also be categorized under “Other Settings.”

, Here, you will find the list of pre-written short messages.
 Edit the selected text message according to your preferences. You can include a greeting at the start of the message if you wish, just to make the message sound a bit more friendly.
 Simply click on “OK” or “Done” to save the edited pre-written text message.

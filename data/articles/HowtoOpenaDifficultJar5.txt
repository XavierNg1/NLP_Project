 You can use a number of different kitchen utensils to break the seal. Try one of these:









A butter knife
A teaspoon
An old-fashioned triangle can opener
A bottle opener
Any other strong, thin-tipped object

, Stick it into the place where the bottom of the lid juts over the mouth of the jar. Push the utensil until it is firmly wedged between the lid and jar.
 Apply force to the utensil like a lever. Separate the lid from the jar a little to break the seal. Scoot the utensil over and do the same in another spot. You should hear a "pop" sound when the seal breaks.









Be careful! Thin glass jars could crack, plastic could puncture.
 Once you hear the seal pop, hold the jar upright in one hand. Use the other hand to turn the lid to the left. It should come off easily with a gentle twist.

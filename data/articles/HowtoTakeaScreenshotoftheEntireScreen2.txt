 An image of the entire desktop picture will be saved on your desktop named "Screen shot" with the date and time included in the file name.
 This will turn your cursor into a small cross. Once the cross pops up, you can click and drag over the image as you wish to save.
 You can double click on the image file on your desktop to open it. From there you can edit it, crop it, or rename it with your favorite program.


If you click on the name and let the mouse hover over it, you can rename the picture right on your desktop.

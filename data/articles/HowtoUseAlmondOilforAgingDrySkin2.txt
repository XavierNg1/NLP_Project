 You will need 1 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons almond oil. Mix the oils in a small, glass jar or bottle.If you don't have any castor oil, use hazelnut oil instead.
You can use other amounts, as long as you stick to these proportions: ⅓ castor oil and ⅔ almond oil.
 Pour a small amount of the oil onto your hand, then massage it onto your face, taking care to avoid your eyes. You do not need to wash or dampen your face first. This technique is known as "oil cleansing," and you can use it to remove dirt and makeup.You have made enough oil to last a few treatments. You do not need to use all of it.
You typically don't want to apply oil to a dirty face, but this is the once exception; you will be wiping this oil off later on.
 You don't have to do this, but it certainly would not hurt to do so. If you have very dry skin, or simply want to treat yourself, this would be an excellent idea., Soak a clean wash cloth in hot water. Wring out the excess moisture, then drape the cloth over your face. Leave it there for a few minutes or until it cools. This will help open up your pores and make the oil more effective., Use the damp washcloth that you draped over your face to do this. Do not scrub your skin, however. If your face still feels oily, you can repeat the damp washcloth treatment two to three more times.If you have very dry skin, consider leaving a thin film of oil on your face.
If your face still feels dry afterwards, you can apply some moisturizer to it.
 It is best to do this in the evening, just before you go to bed. This will give your skin time to soak up the beneficial oils. You can do this daily, but if you have normal or oily skin, it's best if you do it once a week.You likely won't see results overnight; give the oil cleansing method a few tries before deciding whether or not it is right for you.
If you have any oil left over, you can use it as a body massage oil. You can also discard it or pour it into a small, glass bottle for later.

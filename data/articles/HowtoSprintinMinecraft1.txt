 This is W by default. Press and hold after double-tapping to keep sprinting forward. You will move 30% faster than usual, and your field of view will become slightly wider., Tap left control while moving forward to start sprinting.

If this doesn't work, open the Esc menu and go to Options â†’ Controls to assign a key to sprint.
 Your character will continue to sprint until you release the forward key, collide with a block, or interact with a mob. If you tapped the sprint key, you will stop sprinting after thirty seconds, but can turn it on again right away.


You can turn left and right as usual while sprinting, though this slows you down slightly.While sprinting, you can jump four blocks horizontally instead of two. Your jump height does not increase., You can only sprint while you have at least six hunger (three food symbols in your hunger bar). Eat some food and try again if your stomach is empty.

Sprinting uses up your saturation and hunger 10 times faster than walking. Jumping while sprinting uses them up 80 times faster than walking., You can hit the sprint key while swimming as well, or while flying in Creative mode. This will only increase your speed a little bit, but your field of vision will widen. If you are on a vehicle or mount, your field of vision will widen but your speed will remain the same.

If you don't use the sprint key, instead start sprinting on the ground, then double tap space to start flying.

 Products like gel cleaners and other types of commercial drain cleaners can help you remove clogs from your drain. However, you do need to be careful with these products, as they are very strong, and they can damage your pipes or cause problems if you don't use them properly.Always read the bottle to make sure the product you have can be used on the types of pipes you have and the system you have. For instance, you may need a special product for a septic system. In addition, make sure you buy one appropriate for baths and showers.
Never mix more than one type of drain cleaner. For instance, if the clog doesn't move, you don't want to pour another kind on top. That can lead to toxic fumes, which can cause you health problems.
 Each drain cleaner will work a little bit differently, so it's important to read the instructions first. Make sure you are following the instructions to the letter because drain cleaners are powerful chemicals and they can be harmful., Generally, you start with about half a bottle to try to remove the clog, and then you wait a specified period, usually about 15 minutes. Use the whole bottle if it's not draining at all and half if it's draining a little bit. Usually, you can pour the cleaner through standing water but not always., After waiting the required time, you need to use hot water to clear the chemicals and the clog. Watch to see if it's draining properly. If it's not, you may need to try again with some more of the same drain cleaner. Make sure you don't try a different cleaner.

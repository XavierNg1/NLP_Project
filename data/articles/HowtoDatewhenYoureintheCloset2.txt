 A good way to make friends and meet others like you is to join your school or local city Gay Straight Alliance. This is a fairly safe space for meeting people because if anyone asks, you're a straight ally, not gay.
 Maybe romance will spark with one of your new friends. Even if it doesn't, you now have a bunch of people to talk to who understand your life experiences.

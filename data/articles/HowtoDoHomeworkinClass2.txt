 It might look strange if you go to the restroom carrying your papers and pencil. For this reason, it's a good idea to prepare them before you ask to visit the bathroom. Hiding all of your materials will let you slip out of class with everything you need.


Fold your homework or worksheet up neatly and slip it in your pocket.
Hide your pen or pencil in a pocket.
If you need another textbook, you might try quickly visiting your locker to pick it up.
 Once you've gotten your supplies hidden and ready to go, it's time to ask your teacher if you can visit the bathroom. Act normally as you get your teacher's permission to use the restroom. Stand up and leave as you usually do, heading down to the restroom for some alone time to work on your homework.
 Once you've reached the restroom, find a stall with a door that you can close. The stall will afford you some privacy as you work on your homework. It's up to you how you want to set your workspace up, but here are some ideas:


Use the stall walls as a solid writing surface, doing your homework while standing up.
Put the lid on the toilet down and sit down to get your homework done, using your lap as a writing surface.
Use the top-back section of the toilet tank as a makeshift desk.
 You won't want to spend too long working on your homework in the restroom. If you do, you may get in trouble for being out of class for too long. Once you've got some work done, wash your hands and head back to class.


Remember to hide your homework again in your pocket before returning to class.
It's probably a good idea to work no longer than five minutes before going back to class.

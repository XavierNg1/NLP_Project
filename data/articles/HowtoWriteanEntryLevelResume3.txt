 While listing out your job or volunteer experience, along with concrete facts about that experience like the dates you worked there, are important, you need to try to give examples of how you went the extra mile, or made yourself invaluable to the company. Some ideas include:


Discuss the challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Talk about the strategies you used to overcome the challenges.
Discuss how you benefited the company or organization.
 You want to stand out from the crowd; using a cliché opening will submerge you in it. Avoid opening lines that seem cliché, rehearsed, or common.


Consider discussing some unique skills you have or your area of specialization instead. Make sure whatever information you use relates to the job you are applying for.
 Do not try to cram a ton of information on your page, or try to fill a page with unnecessary details. Every time you add something to your resume, think about whether or not it pertains to the job you are applying for.
 Your resume is a professional document. As such, you should try to keep your use of personal pronouns to a minimum, even though the document is about yourself. Do not list each skill by saying something like “I am very organized”.


Instead, when listing your skills, keep them short and informative. List something like: 1. Exceptionally organized. 2. Competent in WordPress, Twitter, and Excel. etc.
 Your marital status, weight, or dog’s name have no place on your resume (unless, for the latter, you are applying for a position as a dog walker). Your potential employer wants to learn about your professional experience, not about your personal details.

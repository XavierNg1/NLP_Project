 Take your stick (it should be a long one) and prod (not too hard!) them from behind the spider you are trying to capture. It should move into the canister and you've got yourself a trapdoor spider. Trapdoor spiders will usually hold their doors closed with their fangs. If you can't gently pry the door open, the spider is just behind the door. A quick stab with a small trowel will usually result in a spider still holding its door (or half a spider).

 The web will eventually pull all of the way out with the spider contained in the small bulb formed at the end of its web.

For example, let's say you have a 12-page PDF file that you want to split, with the first 5 pages in one file and the last 7 in another. In the Pages section, you would enter "1 to 5" to create a PDF file with the first 5 pages.
 This allows you to quickly split a single document into two different ones without having to repeat the process.


For example, after entering "1 to 7" in the first row, you can enter "8 to 12" in the second row. When you confirm the split, two files will be created at the same time.
 This will allow you to enter custom filenames for each of the new split documents.
 button once you are satisfied. Your new split documents will be automatically downloaded as a ZIP file. The ZIP file will contain all of the documents that you created.


Double-click the downloaded ZIP file to see the documents.

 Now that you have completed the construction of your kite, it is now time to send it to flight. To start, find a location where there is lots of open space without trees, such as a park, lake, or beach. Although your paper kite may not reach significantly high heights, avoiding any hindrances is still a good practice.
 To launch your kite, begin to walk with the flying line in one hand and the kite in the other hand. Increase your walking pace to allow your kite to fly using simple aerodynamics. When launching your kite, your back should be to the wind and your kite should face you.


Aerodynamics is the movement of a solid object through the air.The right wind direction will keep your kite in flight.
 You can release more string when you feel your kite rising and reel in your kite when it begins to fall.

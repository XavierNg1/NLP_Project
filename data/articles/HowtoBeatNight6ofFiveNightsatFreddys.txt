, It is recommended alternating between Pirate's Cove and the Show Stage until you see either Bonnie or Chica leave.
 Don't chase down Bonnie or Chica on the cameras, it will only waste power. Checking the blind spots by your doors to see if they are there is a better way to keep track of where they are. If they are there, quickly close the door, then open when they are gone.

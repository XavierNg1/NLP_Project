 This is to check for any illnesses or ailments. Believe it or not, there are many diseases that harm tortoises, and it is your job to protect yours.;
, This is a good idea for young tortoises because they can't get lost. The floor of the vivarium should be covered in newspaper, and some fresh water should be kept in a flat dish. Add a small shelter for them to sleep in. This is like their home, so you should try your hardest to make it cozy.
 If your tortoise is old, you should keep it in a green house for easy access to a garden. This way, they don't need to move around too much to get food.
 Don't just feed them lettuce. They eat cabbage, dandelion, and occasionally tomato. Vary their diet, but always check first. Be careful to not overfeed your tortoise.
 Scrub their shell with Hi-Bi-Scrub. Be careful to not get any in their eyes.
 Make sure that dogs, cats, foxes, and hamsters stay away, or else your tortoise could get seriously hurt.

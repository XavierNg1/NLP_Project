 What if you're not able to spend a lot of one-on-one time with your dog? Consider exploring other options to give your dog some company. For example, if you know your dog is friendly with other dogs in your neighborhood, consider setting up doggie playdates. Here are some tips for doggie playdates:Choose a dog that’s the same sex and about the same size as your dog.
Have the playdate in a safe, enclosed area.
Watch how your dog plays with the other dog. If your dog growls or tries to get away, start searching for another playmate.
If the play becomes too rough, you and the other dog owner should separate the dogs.
Allow the dogs to take frequent breaks and rest in the shade.
 If your dog gets lonely during the day when you're not home, adopting another dog may help lessen that loneliness. Don't just adopt any dog, though—you will need to find one that is compatible with your dog and will provide good companionship. Before going to your local pet adoption center, ask yourself some questions:Can I afford to take care of another dog?
How does my dog like to play (wrestling vs chasing)?
What is my dog's personality (mellow vs high strung)?
Does my dog tend to guard its food or belongings?
What if the two dogs don't get along?

, If getting another dog isn't feasible, consider hiring a pet sitter to give your dog companionship during the day. The pet sitter can take your dog for walks and play with your dog so it doesn't feel so lonely. Visit http://www.petsitters.org/ to find quality pet sitters in your area. When you interview different pet sitters, ask the following questions:What type of services do you provide?
What type of animal training have you completed?
Will you take notes about my dog, such as routines, medical conditions, and what it likes to eat?
Do you work with a particular vet that you take dogs to if they get sick?
Can you provide me with references so I can speak with some of your other clients?

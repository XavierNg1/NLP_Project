 Place the ham hocks in a large 6-qt (6-L) pot and fill the pot 2/3 with water, making sure there is enough water to completely cover the meat. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
 Let the ham hocks sit in the still-boiling water until the meat begins to fall off the bones.


Add more water to the pot as it starts boiling down. The ham hocks should always be completely covered throughout the cooking process.
The ham hocks need to be completely cooked before you add the collard greens.
 Separate the leaves and rinse each one under cool, running water. Stack the leaves on top of each other and roll them together. Cut each roll into thin strips using a cutting board and large kitchen knife.


If using frozen greens instead of fresh greens, you may not need to separate the leaves, but the leaves should still be thawed and rinsed.
Rinse each leaf individually. Do not rinse them all at once.
Rolling the leaves and chopping them up in that form can save you time.
 Add as many collard greens to the boiling water as possible until the pot is full. Cook until they begin to wilt.
 Once your initial batch of collard greens wilts, you can add the remaining greens in batches. Continue adding the greens in batches, waiting for one batch to wilt before adding the next.


Note that you should not remove any of the greens after you add them and after they wilt down.
 Sprinkle salt into the water, stir, and continue cooking for another 30 minutes on medium heat.


Stir the contents of the pot occasionally so that the taste of the smoked ham hock spreads throughout the dish.
 Once done, drain the water and serve the collard greens and ham hocks alongside one another on the same serving dish.


For an added kick, add a dash of hot sauce to the dish before enjoying it.

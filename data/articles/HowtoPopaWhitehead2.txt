 Use a regular needle from a typical sewing kit. It'll be sharp enough to get the job done and minimize the risk of scarring. Soak the tip of the needle in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide for one minute., Insert the needle at an angle. If you poke the needle in a vertical downward motion, you could hit live skin under the pus. Remove the needle as soon as you see pus oozing from the whitehead.


If you see clear liquid or blood instead of pus, stop. Squeezing a whitehead that isn't ready to be popped can cause it to swell and stick around even longer., Place each of your index fingers at the base of the white area. Squeeze in a down-and-in motion. Be gentle to avoid damaging healthy skin. Gently wipe away the pus with the tissue on your finger. Replace the tissue with a clean one to avoid infecting your skin. Continue until all the pus has drained.

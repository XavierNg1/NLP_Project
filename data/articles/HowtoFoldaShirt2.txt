 Lay the shirt out horizontally in front of you, face-up. The neck of the shirt should be to your left.
 On the far side of the shirt, grasp the shirt with your left hand at the top of the shoulder, halfway between the sleeve and the neck.
 On that same side, grasp the shirt with your right hand halfway down the shirt (think of this as the point where the bottom fold would be on a store-bough shirt). Your right hand should be parallel with your left hand.


Make sure that you have pinched through both layers of fabric.
 Still pinching the shirt with both hands, cross your left hand over your right hand so that the shoulder of the shirt goes down to the hem. Pinch the hem and the shoulder together with your left hand.


Your arms should now be crossed.
 Lift the shirt up as you uncross your arms, keeping your grasp on the shirt with both arms. Pull the shirt taut with both hands and shake out and creases.
 Holding the shirt up, lay it so that the front portion of the unfolded sleeve is touching the ground, up to the equivalent position where it is folded on the other side.
 Lower the rest of the shirt so that the fold is complete and the front of the shirt is facing up.

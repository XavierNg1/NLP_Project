 You need Lapras and the fishing rod from Lana for this.;
,  From here, you should look directly south and get on Lapras.  You should see a fishing spot.
  If it is not, leave Brooklet Hill and return.  Keep in mind that going too fast near the fishing spot or traveling on top of the fishing spot will cause it not to ripple.
  When it is rippling, there is a 5% chance of finding a Feebas.  When it is not rippling, there is a 1% chance.  It is very easy to leave Brooklet Hill and come back from this spot.
  From here, you should weaken it with False Swipe or Hold Back, and then paralyze it or put it to sleep.


If it is night, you can use a dusk ball, but a dive ball will work well any time.  Feebas has a relatively high catch rate, so it should be easy to catch.

 The best way to prevent stillborn puppies or death in infancy is to spay your dog. This is particularly true if your dog has lost puppies in previous pregnancies. Unless you are a professional dog breeder, you should have your dog spayed before its first heat, which is usually around 5 to 6 months of age.Young dogs that become pregnant are more likely to miscarry and have stillborn puppies. They are also less likely to be able to properly care for their puppies and meet their nutritional needs.
 If you want to breed your dog, you should visit your veterinarian to make sure that your dog is healthy enough to deliver puppies successfully. Many dogs suffer from genetic problems that make healthy delivery of puppies difficult. If your dog is pregnant, you should set up regular veterinary checkups to make sure that the pregnancy is progressing normally. Although it will not eliminate it, working with a veterinarian will limit the likelihood of stillborn puppies.


You should also contact your veterinarian if any complications arise during your dogâ€™s labor.
 One of the leading causes of stillborn puppies is a herpes infection. If the mother is infected while pregnant, she will likely lose the entire litter. To avoid this, you should isolate the mother from any other dogs for at least the last three weeks of the pregnancy.You should also keep the mother and pups isolated for at least three weeks after the birth.
Transmission occurs by direct contact. This includes sexual contact as well as nosing, sniffing, and licking other dogs.

 Gohma guards the Dragon Roost Island peak in this version of the game. Initially, you’ll have to start at the bottom of the island and make your way up to its peak, where you’ll find the Boss Room where Gohma is.


Unlike in other versions where Gohma takes the form of a spider, in Wind Waker, it appears as a centipede Cyclops and requires a slightly different approach to defeat it.
 Once you get inside the Boss Room, Gohma will start attacking you using its two front limbs. To dodge this attack, simply run around the Boss Room allowing you to easily evade Gohma’s claws.
 After three or more consecutive claw or leg attacks, Gohma will then blow a pillar of fire at you. This fire breath will last around 3 seconds and will follow you wherever you go so just keep running around the room (like what you've been doing in step 2) until the fire breath stops.
 You have already received and used the Grappling Hook by the time you reach Dragon Roost Island. Take the Grappling Hook, aim it, and shoot at the dragon’s tail you see hanging from the ceiling of the Boss Room.


This will make the dragon sitting atop of the mountain move and drop the ceiling on Gohma.
Repeat this step up to three times until Gohma’s stone armor breaks.
 After breaking its armor, take your bow and arrow, aim it and shoot at Gohma’s eye. This will knock the monster face forward to the ground, placing its eye within your reach.

Approach Gohma’s eye and slash it as many times as you can using your sword. Keep doing this until the monster explodes.

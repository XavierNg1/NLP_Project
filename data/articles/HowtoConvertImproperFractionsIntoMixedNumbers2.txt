 This problem is easy — just solve exactly as above. See below for a step-by-step solution.


11/4 — to start, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.
11 ÷ 4 = 2 R 3 — now, we need to make a fraction from the remainder and our original denominator.
11/4 = 2 3/4


, We're dealing with a really big numerator here, but don't be intimidated — the process is exactly the same! See below:


99/5 — how many times does 5 go into 99? Since 5 goes into 100 exactly 20 times, it's safe to say that 5 goes into 99 19 times.
99 ÷ 5 = 19 R 4 — now, we just put the mixed number together like before.
99/5 = 19 4/5


, Up until now, we've only dealt with improper fractions where the numerator is bigger than the denominator. But what happens when they're the same number? See below to find out.


6/6 — six goes into six one time with no remainder, obviously.
6 ÷ 6 = 1 R0. Since a fraction with 0 in the numerator is always equal to zero, we don't need to put a fraction next to our whole number.
6/6 = 1


, If the numerator is a multiple of the denominator, you don't have to bother with the remainder — just do the division problem to get your answer. See below.


18/6 — since we know that 18 is just 6 × 3, we know we'll have a remainder of 0, so we don't need to worry about the fraction part of our mixed number.
18/6 = 3


, Negatives work exactly the same way as positive numbers do. See below:


-10/3
-10 ÷ 3 = -3 R1
-10/3 = -3 1/3

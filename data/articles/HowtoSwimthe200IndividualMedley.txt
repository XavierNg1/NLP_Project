 The key is to use all of your strength to rocket yourself off the block and into the water. Many people make the mistake of slightly rolling back for more power, but all that does is slows you down, because while the other swimmers are in the air, you're just going to be coming forward.;
, So once you come off your starting block, start with a rather aggressive but consistent dolphin kick, and break out just beyond the flags. Remember not to breathe on the first three strokes off the wall. Even if it's hard, it will get you ahead in the race. When you come to the wall at the other end, stay low on your turns, so only your collarbone comes out of the water. Then start the last 25 meters (82.0Â ft) of butterfly.
 Push off underwater with a dolphin kick and also break out just after the flags. NOW start the backstroke. Keep in mind to have good shoulder rotation and pull hard underwater with your hand. Now the backstroke flip turn is really important. Once you see the flags, count about 4-5 strokes, and while pulling with your hand, rotate onto your stomach and flip just like you would a freestyle flip turn. Then instead of rotating onto your stomach again once you come off the wall, keep going on your back towards the other end of the pool.
 Have a powerful kick and remember to glide. Another important factor is to keep your arms in front of you. If you bring them too far back, the officials will count that as a pull and you will get disqualified. And don't slow down. Keep going at a fast pace. At most times people decide to slow down, and that costs them the race. And remember to touch with 2 hands on both walls.
 This should be all out, and forget about how tired you are. Thinking about that will get you even more tired. On your turn, remember to have your arms pressed in against you and not out on either side of you.

 Coconut milk is high in fat, fiber, and nutrients like vitamin E that make it excellent for moisturizing hair. Combined with the super-moisturizing power of extra virgin olive oil and the acid of lemon juice, this mask will help relax hair.People with artificially colored hair should avoid using lemon juice on their hair, as it will cause color to fade more quickly.
 In a separate bowl, mix 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) cornstarch with 4 tablespoons of lemon juice until a smooth slurry forms.
 Over medium heat, whisk the mixture constantly until it thickens. Once it reaches the consistency of a bottled conditioner, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
 You can use a pastry brush or a paintbrush to make application easier, or just use your fingers to work the mask evenly throughout your hair. Make sure your hair is coated thoroughly with the mask for best results.
 If you don’t have a shower cap handy, you can also wrap your hair with plastic wrap. Wrapping your hair will help it retain heat, which will assist in relaxing curls.
 If you have a hairdryer, use it on the low setting until hair is warm. Alternately, you can warm a damp towel in the microwave and wrap the warm towel around your hair.
 Avoid shampoos that have heavy surfactants or sulfates, as they will roughen your hair’s cuticles and undo the moisturizing and smoothing action of the mask. Follow with a deep conditioner.
 Use progressively finer combs to completely detangle and gently stretch your hair.









Coconut milk is different from coconut water (which is thinner) and cream of coconut (which is sweetened and thickened). Make sure to purchase the right stuff!
This mask will relax and loosen curls, but if you have very curly hair it may not entirely straighten your hair. However, the extra moisture provided by the mask will also help protect your hair if you use heat appliances.

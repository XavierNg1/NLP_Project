 Select an outfit that you are comfortable in, but don't feel like a total nobody in. Dark denim stands out and never looks too casual. Skinny jeans always make you feel great. Try a long top to cover up if you're wearing something too loose/too tight below, but make sure it's a flattering cut: Voila! comfort, and style together. Try not to wear anything too short or revealing, you don't want to be tugging on your clothes all day (or look insecure).;
, You want two or three colors that flatter, and matching accessories always add a bit of class. For the "classy" look, try not to layer your clothes, and try stick to neutrals: beiges, browns, blues, blacks, whites.The baggy jumper look is a nice casual look for look nice. For a more preppy look, use brighter tones (ones that never clash!) and cuter cuts. Obviously, this is up to you and your personal style. Try throwing something out of the ordinary into the mix! Try something bright if you usually stick to neutrals, go for something simpler yet classier if you always go bold. It will be a refreshing change to your peers' eyes, and you might get some compliments thrown your way!

, It's always nice to see a fresh, bare face--and it feels more comfortable to have to go around school the entire day without too much caked on.
 No need wasting time changing your outfits again and again! You should look great, and feel great at the same time. Make sure, however, you feel comfortable in it: comfort is KEY!

, You should feel fabulous because of your personality, and your looks should only highlight your inner person. Don't try to look like someone you aren't; you'll just be seen as a fake. People should love you for who you are.
 If you see someone else wearing an outfit you could've worn, compliment them, but don't wish you were wearing that outfit. The outfit you have chosen to wear makes you look great, so keep that in mind and feel confident that it is true.

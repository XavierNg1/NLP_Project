 Unless your children are grown, you don’t want them to have to help your process your complicated feelings about the separation with your partner. Instead, share information that’s developmentally appropriate. It’s okay to be honest, but don’t make your kids feel like they’re responsible for your well-being.Never make a child feel that he has to “take sides” with you against the other parent.
Encourage your child to talk to you, or a counselor or professional, about his feelings regarding your separation.
 It might be difficult, but if you have children together you’ll need to develop a basic framework for your expectations regarding your new situation. The more clear you are, the more likely the framework will be to do what you need it to do.This might feel artificial at first, but it can help add clarity to your communication during this difficult time.
For example, setting regular times to talk together, with clear topics, and limited times will help establish parameters regarding your meetings so that they’re less likely to deteriorate into repeats of old conversations.
It’s a good idea to agree together not to talk negatively about one another in front of your children.
Consider asking a relationship counselor for help developing a framework for interaction if you need to.
 If you’ve set guidelines for communication, stick with them. For instance, if you’ve said you’ll meet your separated spouse for coffee, be there at exactly the time you said you would be. If you have children, this is especially important as your children will be worried and confused about the ways their lives are changing.If you’d like to work on saving your relationship, showing your spouse that he’s a priority in your life will be important.
If you make a mistake, or don’t follow the guidelines you’ve created together, acknowledge your error promptly. After all, we’re all only human, and mistakes can happen.

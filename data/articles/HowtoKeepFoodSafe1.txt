 Don't buy cans that are leaking, bulging, or dented. Jars of food should not be cracked or have loose lids. Avoid buying jars where the button on the lid has already been popped up.;
,, Frozen foods should be frozen completely solid. They should be free of ice crystals and frost, as these are signs that the food may have thawed and then been refrozen.
 Chicken is easily contaminated if not stored properly. Be extra careful when picking out chicken to bring home.


Choose your chicken towards the end of your shopping trip. The longer it sits in your shopping cart, the more likely it will be to go bad.
Choose wrapped packages without tears, holes, or leaks. The package should be cold and feel firm when lightly squeezed.
Smell the chicken. If it smells spoiled, don't buy it.
Check the sell-by date. Remember that this is different than the use-by date; it's okay if it's today's date. Just plan to use the chicken within two days of its sell-by date to be safe.
 Like chicken, turkey is easily contaminated. Be sure to choose the turkey near the end of your shopping trip to avoid contamination while it's in your cart.


Find a wrapped turkey without holes, tears, or leaks. Be sure that the turkey is cold and feels firm when lightly squeezed.
Choose a turkey from the bottom of the stack. Often, those that have been stacked near the top do not stay cold enough to guarantee safe eating.

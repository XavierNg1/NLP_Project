 To figure out if you are a hypochondriac, you should decide if you have been obsessed about being sick or finding symptoms for the last six months or so. Think about whether you have thought a lot about having a disease, if you’ve felt anxious because of symptoms or fear of being ill, or if you’ve been obsessed with diagnosing yourself.Ask yourself if these behaviors have interfered with your life, your work, or your relationships.
Think about whether you have failed to believe a doctor who told you that you were fine. You may also need reassurance from your family or doctor all the time.
 People who suffer from hypochondria generally have two different extreme ideas concerning medical care and their health. One the extremes may be obsessing and always going to the doctor or researching diseases while the other may be avoiding it completely.If you are obsessive, you may need information and assurance. You may research symptoms constantly, self-diagnose yourself, go to the doctor all the time, and demand unnecessary tests.
If you avoid medical care, you skip medical visits, avoid getting overly physical in case you hurt yourself or get injured, and even avoid watching television shows or movies dealing with medical issues.
 Some people may be at a greater risk for hypochondria than others. People with anxiety disorders or OCD may be more prone to developing it. You may be at risk for hypochondria if you have witnessed serious illness at sometime in your life.You may also be more prone to hypochondria if someone in your family has hypochondria.
You may be at risk of hypochondria if you experienced abuse as a child.

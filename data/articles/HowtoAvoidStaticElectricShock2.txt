 Static shocks are more likely to occur in dry environments. Keeping your home humid can reduce your risk.


Ideally, your home should be above 30% rh, or relative humidity. You can measure the humidity of your home by purchasing a humidity thermometer online or at a hardware or grocery store.Raising the air humidity to 40 or 50% rh can help reduce static shock. You should aim for this range.Humidifiers range in price. Large humidifiers, designed to work in a large space, can cost over $100. However, a humidifier for a single room might only be $10 or $20.
 Having carpeting at home instead of wood floors puts you at greater risk for static shock. Certain measures can be taken to make your carpet less conductive to static electricity.


Rubbing fabric softener sheets over the carpet can prevent the build up of static electricity but such methods do not have a permanent effect. Try repeating the process once a week.You can also place cotton rugs on areas of the carpet that you walk across frequently as cotton is less likely than certain fabrics to conduct electricity and cause static shock., If you're getting electric shocks in bed, adjusting your bedding might help.


Opt for materials like cotton over synthetic fabrics or wool.Try not to layer sheets, as fabrics rubbing together can cause static buildup. If your bedroom is warm enough, you may be able to ditch your top sheet or blanket.

 Do not use quotation marks. For example:


“Judge.”

, Use parentheses around the date. For example:


“Judge. (2014).”

, Write the title in italics. Follow the title with the retrieval date (the date that you accessed the information. For example:


“Judge. (2014). Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 1 October 2014,”

, You must do this for APA format, unlike MLA format. For example:


“Judge. (2014). Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 1 October 2014, from http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/judge.”

, To do this, use a shortened form of the title, as well as which definition and the number or letter you’re referring to. For example:


“A judge is someone who decides court cases (‘Judge,’ def. 2, a).”

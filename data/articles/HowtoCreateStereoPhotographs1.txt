 Landscapes and places of interest are excellent for this work.;
, It must be strong enough to support your camera. Mark and drill 6mm (1/4") holes, the first 2.5 cm (1") from one end and others at 1 cm (about 1/2") centres. You will now have a slat with a series of holes running down the middle of its length.
 Itâ€™s normally held in place by a circlip. Push this screw through the hole in the ends of the steel slat, opposite the first hole and keep it in place with the circlip. The end of the slat that has no holes in it must go over the platform of the tripod.
 Turn its nut finger tight. Do not turn it fully tight, as the slat must be able to move freely from left to right.
 You might have to insert washers to take up slack between the slat and the camera base. Your camera should now be connected to the tripod by the slat in a cantilever fashion.
 Swing your camera through 180 degrees around the centre pivot, focus on the same object and take another shot.
Always focus on a definite object when you take both photographs, as this is what your eyes do automatically.
This position works for objects that are from 20 metres away to infinity. For closer pictures, your camera must be nearer to the centre pivot. Just unscrew the nut of the roofing bolt and shorten the projecting arm of your slat. For a normal lens, the swing will move your camera through a short arc, so that the picture is not distorted.

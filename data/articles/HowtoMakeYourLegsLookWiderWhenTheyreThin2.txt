If it looks like you can't fill out your pants or they're two sizes too big, it just makes your legs appear smaller.This goes for accessories, too. A huge belt or belt buckle may overwhelm your lower half. Instead, try an eye-catching pattern on your shirt or tie to draw attention away from your legs., Pinstripes are a no-no since they'll only make your legs look longer and skinnier. Dark colors have a slimming effect, so choose jeans in a lighter wash and try light gray, beige, or khaki trousers instead of black., A long jacket can make your legs look extra long and skinny, and a shorter jacket won't look proportional and can even appear childish.

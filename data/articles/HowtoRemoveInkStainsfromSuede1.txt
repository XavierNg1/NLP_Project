 Sanding is generally considered the best way to remove stains from suede.An emery board, a common type of nail file, is convenient and will also work well for this method.An emery board is essentially a small strip of fine-grit sandpaper glued to a piece of cardboard. You can buy inexpensive emery boards from most grocery stores, pharmacies, and beauty shops.;
, While sandpaper is relatively safe for suede, it may not be right for all items. Some processing and dyeing methods may make suede more prone to damage from friction. To make sure sanding won't ruin the suede, do the following before tackling your stain:


Pick a small, inconspicuous spot on your item to test.This should be in an area that is hidden from view during normal use, such as the inside of a jacket. If you can find no such spot, pick one that is less visible, such as the inner side of a shoe rather than the outer side.
Gently rub the sandpaper on the spot. Go back and forth a few times.
Check for damage. It's normal to see some loose fibers after sanding suede. These can be shaved off with a razor. However, if there is any discoloration or major changes in texture, you should try a different cleaning method.
 Gently go over the stain with your sandpaper. Make small circular motions all over the stained area. Apply only the lightest amount of pressure possible. Be careful not to abrade the fabric. The stain should gradually wear away., It's possible that sanding alone will not remove the stain. If there is still a stain that won't get any lighter, stop buffing and try a solvent method:


Soak a soft bristle brush with either white vinegar or rubbing alcohol.
Gently scrub the stain, being careful not to abrade the suede.
If the brush dries out before you've completely lifted the stain, soak it again with your solvent of choice.
Once the stain is lifted, finish up by brushing the area with a clean toothbrush.

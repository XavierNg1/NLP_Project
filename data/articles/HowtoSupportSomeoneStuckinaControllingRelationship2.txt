 Find some reading materials about controlling relationships, locate counselors in your area, and track down the numbers of some helpful hotlines. Share these resources with your friend or family member.Do not give the person pamphlets or books to read unless they have a safe, private place to keep them. Likewise, don’t send them information online unless their partner does not have access to their computer and phone.
 Many people stay in their controlling relationships because leaving is too logistically difficult. If your friend or family member wants to leave but doesn’t know how, offer to keep their personal items at your house, give them rides to counseling appointments, or let them stay with you while they look for an apartment.Don’t promise more than you can realistically give. Once you make the offer, the other person will depend on you to follow through.
 Sometimes it takes a long time for a person who’s being abused to work up the courage to leave their partner. Remain available and supportive for your friend or family member, even if it’s painful to see them in a bad relationship.Your ongoing support and willingness to listen may mean more to the other person than you realize.
Avoid pressuring the person to leave their partner, or they may turn away from you. If they leave, it has to be their own choice.

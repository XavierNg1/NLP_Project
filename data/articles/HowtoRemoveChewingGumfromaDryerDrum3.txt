 Use very little water to make the paste. Start with a teaspoon. Then, mix it together with the detergent. Continue to apply water in 1/4 teaspoon increments until it forms a thick paste.


The exact amount of water to apply will vary depending on the type of the detergent.
This is a good method to use if the ice cube method does not completely remove the gum residue. However, you’ll need to let the gum warm back up to room temperature before trying this method though.
 Apply the mixture to a clean rag. Then, rub the paste on the gum area in the dryer. Continue scrubbing the gum with the paste until it is completely removed.
 Simply wet a clean rag and wipe down the inside of the dryer drum. Make sure to wipe down the entire drum so that all the paste is gone. You don’t want the detergent to dry up and clump inside of your dryer.
 Don’t do this with your clean clothes though. Dampen some old rags and put them in the dryer. Then, run a cycle. This will help to remove any remaining gum residue and make sure that none ends up on your clothes.

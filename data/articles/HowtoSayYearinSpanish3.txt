 In English, you use the same word to talk about a school year or a 12-month period of time. Spanish has a different word, although in practice the two are used interchangeably.Curso is a masculine noun. It is primarily used to refer to an academic year, but it also can be used as a translation of the English word "course."
For example, you might say "El curso acaba en junio," or "The school year ends in June."

, The Spanish word generación (hen-er-rahs-ee-OHN) is similar to the English word generation, but sometimes can be used in contexts where you would use the word year in English.Typically generación is used to mean year in an academic setting. It refers to a specific year of students, such as the class of 2017. This group is a "generation" in the sense that you're talking about everyone in that graduating class.
For example, you might say "El príncipe William y yo estuvimos en la misma generación en el Colegio Eton" if you wanted to tell someone "Prince William and I were in the same year at Eton College."

, If you're a wine enthusiast, you probably hear people talking in English about good years and bad years. In Spanish, rather than using año, you'll more frequently hear these words.Cosecha (coh-SAY-chuh) refers to a harvest generally, but can be used when talking about wine. Vendimia (vin-dim-EE-uh) refers more specifically to a harvest of grapes, so it's a more specific term.
For example, you might say "1994 fue una buena vendimia" or "1994 fue una buena cosecha" to mean "1994 was a good year ."

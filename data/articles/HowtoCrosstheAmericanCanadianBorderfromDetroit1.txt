Traffic can often get pretty backed up at the crossing of the Canadian-American border, so one thing you don’t want to happen is get all the way to the front only to realize you forgot some of your paperwork. This can lead to making you leave and come back or possibly getting subjected to a secondary screening. Again, as stated above, a secondary screening is a very long and thorough process and you wouldn’t want to put yourself through that, especially if it is not necessary.

 This collage is a good one after you've been hiking or walking in natural areas and you've collected things you found along the way. Suitable items include:


Seashells, broken and whole; carapaces of insects
Flowers (these can be pressed and then used)
Dried grasses
Leaves
Seeds and nuts,
coconut shell '
straw,
and others,etc.
 If not, they may rot or go mildewy on the collage.
 Paper, smooth bark, cardstock, recycled cardboard, etc. are all good choices for the background.
 Perhaps you'd like to make a nature scene, such as arranging dried flowers as they'd appear in nature, or a clump of dried grasses. Or, maybe make a landscape or seascape using the items.
 Use clear-drying craft glue. Double check that the items are actually sticking to the background.


If you want to preserve plant material used in a collage, make a "glaze". Dilute PVA glue with a little water. Brush this over the whole of the paper; this glazes the paper. Arrange the plant material on the glazed paper. Brush over all of the plant material with the same glaze. You must cover every possible bit of the plant material. Once fully dried, the glaze will protect the plant material for years and the effect will leave the collage shiny. Note that this can damage more delicate plant material, so be careful.
 Place the collage on display or take photos of it and share online.

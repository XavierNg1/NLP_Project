 You'll also need a craft punch with a holiday shape or a simple shape like a circle, some small round stickers (all one color or a variety of colors––both are fine) and some string. If you'd like, use various kinds of craft punch shapes that represent the holiday season.
 If you don't have a craft punch or want more variety, trace shapes over the cards using a pencil and cut them out. (Cookie cutters make an excellent tracing template.)

, The length is entirely up to your needs.
 This part is simple––use the the round stickers to attach the back of the card shape to the string. The stickers form part of the whole design, so be sure to stick neatly and center the card shape.
 You can continue to add to the garland year after year by attaching more string and adding new shapes.

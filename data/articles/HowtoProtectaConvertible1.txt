 It is recommended that you clean your convertible top at least once every 4 weeks to keep dirt from sinking into the fabric or vinyl.;
, Use a gentle car shampoo or one made specifically for convertible tops, which can be found in any automotive or home improvement store. Apply the cleaner with a sponge as you would to the rest of your vehicle.

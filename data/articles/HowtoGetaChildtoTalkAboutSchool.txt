 Start by asking simple questions such as "So, what did you do at school today?" or "How was school?" when your child comes home. When they shrug, don't respond or ignore you, try asking if they did anything interesting. There's a big difference between "Things" at school and "Interesting Things" at school. "What was your favorite thing that happened at school today?" is a good question to get some conversation going.;
, Whenever your youngster brings home homework or a reading book, help them out. This will not only teach them valuable skills, but it can also boost your relationship with one another. Whilst helping, ask your child simple questions such as "Have you been enjoying ?" Children may be struggling with the subject, so try to help them and ask them to pay attention in class.
 School is for learning and building skills, but it's also a place to make new friends, blossom your creativity and improve social skills. Teach your child what else school can be used for, that they should respect school rules (unless you have a problem with them), and to respect school property and keep it tidy.
 Find out what you can do to help your child at home. Let the teacher know when you have concerns. Let the teacher know you appreciate his or her efforts when appropriate.
 Open house, conferences, volunteer in the classroom, and attend all school functions if possible. This lets your child know that school is important.

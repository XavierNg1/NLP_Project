 If the boot tray needs cleaning, do so now and dry thoroughly before proceeding.;
, If making a pattern, you could do something like these suggestions:

Add different shades of pebbles in varying ways, such as stripes, wavy stripes, geometric shapes, etc.






Design a letter, number or symbol in the center or across the pebbles; use differently colored pebbles to make it obvious.


Work in small sections at a time, starting at a corner edge and working methodically across the tray. Paint a small area of the tray's corner with glue, then add a dab of glue to each pebble.






Press the pebble in place. Keep the pebble as flat as possible––the surface should not be too bumpy for the boots and shoes to sit on.






Repeat for each pebble in that section.






Move onto the next section. Move across and add pebbles according to your pattern or randomly.
 When you near the end, it is a good idea to test which pebbles will fit before adding the glue, as there may be some rearranging required before everything will fit neatly. Try not to leave large gaps!

, Also follow the manufacturer's instructions with respect to time.
 Paint or spray a suitable sealant across the top of the pebbles.
 Encourage all members of the household to place their muddy, wet or snow-covered boots and shoes on the tray to drain.
 Wipe down and wash it regularly. It may also need to be drained every few days if water has amassed in it from melting snow, etc.

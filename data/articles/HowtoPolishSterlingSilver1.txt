 You will only need enough water to fully cover the silver, so your bowl may not need to be filled very deeply.;
, Use a mild dish detergent to wash your silver. Pour a small squeeze of the detergent into the water and slosh it around with your hands a bit to mix it well.
 Place all your silver items into the bowl. Use a brand new sponge or soft toothbrush to gently scrub off dirt and tarnish on your items. Don’t allow them to soak for too long, to prevent water spots.
 Take each piece of silver out of the soapy bowl of water individually. Run it under warm or cool water to rinse all the soap off.
 Use a dry microfiber towel or cloth to dry off all the water. Be sure to catch water hidden in cracks and crevices in jewelry or silverware., Use a silver polishing cloth or small microfiber cloth to rub off any tarnished areas that are still visible. Don’t use any fabric or material with heavy or stiff fibers, as these will scratch and dull your silver.

 One of the most common ways that LSD is distributed is through small square pieces of paper.The sheets of paper often have colorful markings or cartoon characters on them. These papers are also known as blotters.


If you notice some small squares of colorful paper in the person’s room, then he or she may be using LSD.
 LSD drops are often stored in small dropper bottles, such as empty fresh breath drop bottles.The bottles are only about two inches tall. The liquid LSD may also be dyed to make it less obvious that the liquid inside is LSD.
 People who use LSD often apply drops of the drug to sugar cubes for consumption.If you notice any plastic bags containing sugar cubes in the person’s room, then this could be a sign that he or she is using LSD.
 Having a drug habit is expensive, so someone who uses LSD regularly may often be low on cash. Consider how often the person asks for money and how quickly he or she spends it.


For example, if the person asks to borrow money a few days after he or she has been paid, then this may indicate that he or she is spending money on drugs.

, Press Enter repeatedly to skip through the pre-game cinematics till you arrive at the Main Menu. Click “Start Game” and then “New Game” to start GTA: V from the beginning, or click “Load Game” to load a previously saved file and continue from there. This will enter you into the game world.
 This is one of the legit ways you can earn money quickly in the game. To trigger a mission in GTA: V, check your map (located to the bottom left corner of your screen) for icons that represent missions. These icons could be pink- or green-colored blips or sometimes letter icons that represent the gang boss giving you the mission.


Drive to the location, and when you arrive at the location, get out the car and approach the blue marker. Stand in the marker to immediately activate the mission. A pre-mission cinematic will play that will give you the mission instructions.
Upon successfully completing the mission, a “Mission Completed” message will appear on the screen and will also indicate the money earned. Some of the missions include:
Chop: finding and intimidating a gang member
Daddy's Little Girl: bicycle race, swimming
Casing the Jewel Store: plan to rob a jewelry store

, These are other missions in GTA: V apart from the ones in the main story, and they can help one to quickly rack up some cash. There are three side missions in the game, and they all have Michael De Santa as the main character.


To do a side mission, get into the respective vehicle and press the CAPS LOCK key.
You will earn an amount of money for each level of the side mission, and a higher amount for each additional level you complete.
A side mission ends when you fail to complete a level, or if you press CAPS LOCK again to turn it off.

 Moccasins are the best option, but a simple flat, brown slip-on shoe would coordinate with the look. Basic brown suede boots would also work as long as they have a flat sole. Fur-lined or fringed boots can add some flair to your costume.If you do not expect to walk through mud puddles, you can also wear moccasin-style slippers.
Simple brown sandals could also work as long as they are not embellished with other decorations.
 Start with a brown cloth headband that wraps around the head rather than over it. Use a hot glue gun to attach one to three feathers to the inside of the headband. Position them so they are at the side of the head and behind the ear.If you cannot find a brown wrap-around headband, cut a strip of stretchy brown fabric that is long enough to fit around the wearer's head and add an extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) to the length. Loop the strip of fabric around to create a band, using fabric glue or hot glue to secure the extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) of fabric over the other end of the band.
If you want to give your headband extra flair, decorate it with wooden beads, colorful seed beads, or craft paint.
 If you want to add a little extra shape to your tunic, tie a braided leather sash around the wearer's waist. If you canâ€™t find a sash or belt without a buckle, cut a strip of brown leather, canvas, or brown rope that is long enough to wrap around the waist. Make sure to cut enough extra material so you can tie the belt into a loose bow at the front of the costume.


A fringed leather belt can add an attractive touch to your costume too.

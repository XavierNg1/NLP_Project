 The possibilities are nearly endless: tapioca can thicken everything from pie fillings to soups and stews. And as for desserts, it can keep them fluffy without adding too much extra sugar and carbs. Just make sure to allow the tapioca time to soak in the flavor of whatever dish you're adding it to.


Quick-cooking tapioca is ideal for an addition to these dishes. Old-fashioned tapioca has a starker flavor that might end up contrasting with the flavor you're intending for.
 If you'd like to add an interesting twist to your jam or jelly, tapioca is where it's at. It can absorb the fruity sweetness and add interesting texture and volume. Add in the tapioca near the end of your cooking cycle so the tapioca doesn't overcook but yet still retains flavor.
 Because who doesn't love bubble tea? It's like eating and drinking your meal all at once, which is totally killing two birds with one stone. It's cheaper and healthier when you make it yourself, too!

, Turns out quick-cooking tapioca can serve as a substitute for cornmeal or flour. The ratio for cornstarch is 1:1, but the ratio for flour is 2:1; that is, 2 parts tapioca to 1 part flour. For diet restrictions and taste preferences, this can be quite the lifesaver!

 Wrap the 14 gauge wire around a pencil as many times as the number of jump rings you need.


If you have jump rings already, see How to open a jump ring.
Whenever you're cutting wire, use eye protection.
 Cut across the top of the loops with the wire cutter. Leave the ends of each jump ring open; this will let you slip on the charms.
 If you're using seed beads, see How to work with seed beads.
 Put two or three beads on one head pin. Twist the end of the pin around the narrow part of the needle nose pliers. Use flat nosed pliers to grasp the wire end, and wrap it around the base of the loop three times. Trim close to the loop.
 Join the jump ring to the beading ring band. Firmly close each jump ring. Done.

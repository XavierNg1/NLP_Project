 At the top, you'll see the SafeSearch filter. Put a check on the "Filter explicit results" to switch to SafeSearch.


Properly setting this will block pornographic images from your searches; even provocative searches, such as for the word "sex," will return images that may be suggestive, but no more so than you might find on network television.;
, A filter is good, but as any 12-year-old will (probably not) tell you, getting around a simple setting is far too easy. To provide a greater level of protection, you can lock your SafeSearch setting, so that it requires your login to change. From your Settings page, click on SafeSearch Lock, as shown:


You'll need to log in with your account and password, and SafeSearch will remain active until you turn it off. Furthermore, you can tell at a glance if it's active: large colored balls will appear in the top right of the screen as long as SafeSearch Lock is enabled.
 When you are done adjusting your SafeSearch settings, be sure to click the blue Save button at the bottom of the screen, or your prefs won't be saved.

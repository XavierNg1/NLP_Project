 If you play sports or have hobbies that require you to depend solely on one eye, consider whether you are using your dominant eye. But remember that your eye dominance might vary based on distance. So be sure to consider your results on the most relevant eye dominance test. Then use that eye, rather than your nondominant eye. Your dominant eye may not be on the same side as your dominant hand or foot. Activities that require you to rely heavily on one eye include:Sighting a gun
Archery
Focusing a camera that does not have a large display screen
Looking through a telescope or microscope

, Knowing your dominant eye is particularly important for people who wear monovision contact lenses. If your doctor prescribes monovision contacts for you, he or she will probably also test your eye dominance. There are two types of monovision lenses:Monovision contacts. People with monovision contacts have a lens with a prescription for good distance vision in their dominant eye and a lens for reading in their nondominant eye.
Modified monovision. This involves wearing a bifocal or multifocal lens in the nondominant eye and a lens for distance vision in the dominant eye.
 If you feel that one of your eyes is too weak, you may be able to strengthen your eyes by doing exercises. But always consult your doctor before starting an exercise regime to avoid eye strain. Your doctor may recommend:Convergence exercises. In these exercises you bring a ruler or pen slowly towards your nose. When you start to see double, stop and refocus until you see one image. If you need to, move the pen away slightly and try again.
Practice focusing your nondominant eye close-up at reading distance, then far away. Ask your doctor how long you should maintain the focus at different locations. Then close your eyes to relax them for a minute.

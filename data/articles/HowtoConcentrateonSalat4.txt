 Keep in mind that your life in general has an effect on prayer (and vice versa).
 Eating non-halal food, earning unlawful income, and committing sins take away the joy and concentration in prayer.
 Let your employers or boss know that you need a few minutes break for prayers and a longer break on Friday noon (for Muslim brothers). Avoid night shift duty, if possible.

...surely by Allah's remembrance are the hearts set at rest. (Quran 18: 28)
Avoid activities that divert your attention (e.g. too much gossip, TV, music etc), as mentioned in Surah Al-Muâ€™minun.

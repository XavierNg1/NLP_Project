 Yams aren't grown from seeds like most other vegetables - they grow from slips, which are derived from the sprouts of adult yams. To grow sprouts, cut a yam in half and submerge one portion in a glass of cool water. Insert toothpicks at three points around the middle of the yam and suspend it over the container, half-submerged in the water., The growth process requires warmth, so place the glass near a heat source. If possible, position the glass near a window so that the sprouting yam gets sunlight as well. Otherwise, place it near a heater to absorb warmth that way., Refill the water in jars or glasses if necessary to keep the submersion level of the yam consistent. Wait for sprouts to form on the yam; this will take a few weeks. Once sprouts are leafy, take each one and gently twist it off of the yam.Each yam can produce up to 50 sprouts.
 Lay each sprout in a shallow container, with the bottom half of the stem submerged in water. Allow the leaves to hang out over the rim of the container. Over the course of a few days, you should see roots emerging from the bottom of each sprout. When the roots are about an inch long, they are then slips that are ready to be planted.Slips can also be purchased online.

 When purchasing a rope to pull a vehicle, the most important thing to look for is the strength of the rope. Most ropes in retail stores will indicate on the packaging what the maximum amount of weight the rope is rated to pull without failing is. Use your vehicle’s owner’s manual to determine the weight of your vehicle and choose a tow rope rated for that weight.Most tow ropes that can be purchased at auto parts stores are sufficient to pull normal sized cars or trucks.
Do not use a rope if you aren’t able to determine its maximum strength rating.
 If the vehicle you are pulling will start, but cannot drive, it is best to start it and allow it to run as you pull it. This will allow you to utilize the power steering and brakes. If the vehicle will not start, insert the key and turn it so the accessories come on and the steering wheel unlocks.Some vehicle’s brakes will not function properly without the vacuum created by the engine running.
The vehicle will not have power steering without the engine running.
 If you need to pull a vehicle just a few feet, there are fewer concerns you will need to address before getting moving. If you need to pull the vehicle to your house or a repair facility you will need to assess the vehicle’s ability to cover that distance safely.If the vehicle will not start, it is not safe to tow it a long distance. Without power steering or brakes the towed vehicle may crash into the tow vehicle.
If you need to pull a vehicle out of mud, snow or a ditch, you will only need to pull it until it can move under its own power.
 If you intend to pull a vehicle with a tow rope on public streets, you will need to determine if it is legal to do so. Check into the laws in the region you will be towing the vehicle through in order to determine if it is legal to do so.Laws in the United States vary from state to state regarding towing a vehicle with a rope.
In some places it is illegal to tow a vehicle with a rope at all.

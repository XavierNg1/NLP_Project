 Go up to him at the end of class or on a lunch break. If you don't work or go to school together, shoot him a text message. Don't be afraid to make the initial move because you have nothing to lose at this point.


In the early stages of trying to win him back, try to keep the interactions short and sweet. Don't put yourself in a position where you will feel tempted to bring up negative feelings.
 If you call or text a guy repeatedly, he will often view this as harassment or stalking and be turned off by it. Limiting your contact will also leave him wanting more, and make him more likely to come to you.
 Once you have spent some time together again, this is an appropriate step to do. Use your eyes to flirt or wear a bold red lipstick. Remember, there's a difference between playfully flirting and appearing desperate. Guys love to feel like there "all that and more" laugh at his jokes unless they upset you. Make him feel like he has control but not to much control.
 If he ever complimented you on a shirt you wore, or you had a particularly good day with him while wearing a certain outfit, don't be afraid to bring those items out again.
 When you're ready to make the first bold move in winning him back, remind me of the good times you both enjoyed together. Bring up a funny anecdote or a particularly fun or sexy date.

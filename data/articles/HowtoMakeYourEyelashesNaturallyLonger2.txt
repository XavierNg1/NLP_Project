 You want to make sure that your hands are clean and dry before you massage your eyelids, otherwise you could risk irritating your eyes or causing pimples (styes) to form.
 You can also use a clean washcloth soaked in very warm water. Just be sure that the water isn’t so hot that it burns your skin. This will help unclog pores and deep clean your eyelids and lash line., Sweep your fingers along the length of your eyelids towards your eye — downward on your upper eyelid, and upward on your lower eyelid.Massaging these areas will keep pores clean, increase blood flow, and stimulate hair growth.









Be sure that you apply a gentle pressure to your eyelids while massaging them. The pressure shouldn’t be so hard that it hurts your eyelids or eyeballs in any way.You can do this with or without oil. If you do use oil, be careful that it doesn’t get into your eyes, and that you properly wash your face afterward so that the oil doesn’t clog your pores. Coconut oil may be a good choice as it has antibacterial properties.
 If you experience any discomfort, consider applying less pressure, or take a break.
 Some people even massage their eyelids once a day.

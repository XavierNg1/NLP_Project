 For the cat repellent, you’ll need a 2-ounce (59 ml) glass spray bottle. Add 1 teaspoon (2 g) of black pepper, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cinnamon to the bottle.You can substitute cayenne pepper for the black if you prefer.
 After you’ve added the spices to the spray bottle, toss in a crushed garlic clove. Next, squeeze in 3 to 4 drops of lemon essential oil, and swish the contents gently to combine them.You can substitute ⅛ teaspoon (½ g) of garlic powder for the clove.
Lime, wild orange, or grapefruit essential oil will work in place of the lemon.
 Once all of the spices and oil are in the bottle, add enough water to fill the container. Shake the bottle vigorously to completely blend all of the ingredients.Tap water will work well for the repellent.
 When the spray is fully mixed, spray it over any outdoor locations that you wish to keep cats away from. In particular, it works well for garden beds, bushes, and other plants.You can also use the repellent to keep cats away from indoor plants.

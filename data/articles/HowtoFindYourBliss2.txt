 Gratitude is an act of honoring the wonderful things in your life. It’s like thanking the universe for what you appreciate and sending the message “Yes, more, please!” Instead of dwelling on what you don’t like, when you turn your attention to what you appreciate, you invite more of this into your life.Find your bliss by expressing gratitude for the good in your life. Each day, write down at least three things, people, or events that you are thankful for.
 As you slowly build awareness of yourself, you may start to notice the things, activities, people or events that make you feel especially euphoric. Let your pile of good things grow by doing more and more of these things.Make a list of the things that bring you incredible joy. Do them as often as you can. For instance, you might find joy in singing. If so, find a way to sing nearly every day.
 You will spend a lot of your life working, so it’s a great idea to do something that brings you joy. This may not even be your occupation, but a side job or passion project. When you do work that you feel is purposeful and enjoyable, you are more engaged and less stressed.If you’re not already doing work that speaks to your passion, figure out what that might be. See a career counselor, job-shadow someone, or read a book about an industry that piques your interest.
 Volunteering and charity work can bring about a deep sense of purpose for you. It also helps you feel connected to your community. Acts of selflessness like this are great for others, but they benefit you, too. Giving back has been shown to increase the lifespan, lower depression, boost self-esteem, and lead to more happiness.Find a cause you feel inspired by and get behind it. Dedicate a few hours each week or month to community service. Write a check to a charity you believe in. Or, volunteer to help out a neighbor or a friend.

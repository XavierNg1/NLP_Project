 If a new employee is left on his or her own, the new place and strange situation will may cause them anxiety. This will impede the employee’s ability to learn their job and do it well.


With proper orientation and communication, the employee receives guidelines regarding the job's expectations and it no longer seems guesswork.;
, If adequate attention is not given to the new employee on their very first day, they may start feeling as if they are not valued by the organization. This is a major cause of employee turnover.


Therefore, orientation is a key engagement tool that helps employees work at their best from the very outset.
 The better the initial orientation, the more likely it is that the employee will learn what they need to learn. This tends to save time for both coworkers and supervisors as they don’t have to educate employee on how to basic tasks on a daily basis.


Through a comprehensive orientation program, the new employee receives answers to questions that he or she otherwise would have to ask at a later date, which could slow their productivity and waste time.
 When a new employee knows what is expected from him or her early on, it becomes easier for them to avoid damaging mistakes and unnecessary blunders. Their attitude and communication methods are steered in the right direction from the very beginning.

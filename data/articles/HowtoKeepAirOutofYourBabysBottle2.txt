 Hold your baby so that she is in a half lying position, with her head slightly elevated. This position will help your baby to swallow and breathe, while gravity will help to bring the milk or formula down into your babyâ€™s tummy., Hold the bottle so that it is in a horizontal position, parallel to the floor. Tilt the bottle when you feed your baby, so that the milk fills the entire nipple, and there is no room left for air.Generally, you want to aim for a 45 degree angle, but this will change depending on how much milk is in the bottle.
 If the milk flows continuously, your baby will be less likely to swallow air. To check to see how the milk is flowing:


Fill the bottle up with milk or water. Turn the bottle upside down. The flow should be approximately one drop of liquid every second.
You should get a new bottle if the liquid stops and starts flowing constantly. This will cause your baby to struggle to suck out the liquid.
If the liquid flows without stop out of the bottle, there is a chance that your baby will not be able to catch her breath. This is also a problem.
 The ring will allow air circulation into the bottle, to make it easier for your child to suck out the milk or formula. If your child is having a hard time getting milk, but the nipple appears to be working well, check to see that the ring is tightened on to the bottle properly.The ring may need to be loosened a little bit in order to allow your baby to suck out the milk.
The ring is tight enough when you can see a large bubble forming every time your baby takes a drink. If it is not on properly, you will see a bunch of bubbles form as soon as your baby stops trying to suck the milk out of the bottle.

 You may need to make a little more of the seasoning than the recipe instructs if you have a very large turkey. To determine how much seasoning you need, place your turkey in the container you're going to cook it in.Slowly fill the container with water. Keep filling the container until the turkey is completely submerged.
Remove the turkey and measure out the water. This is how much seasoning you will need.
 Solid seasoning will not make a poor quality turkey taste good. Before you season a turkey, make sure to pick a quality turkey at the store. Go for a turkey between 12 and 20 pounds without artificial flavors or added preservatives., If you purchase a turkey that requires thawing, read the package instructions. Make sure you thaw the turkey for as long as necessary. Your turkey will not cook correctly if it's improperly thawed, so give yourself enough time to adequately thaw the turkey.,

About 5 days is required for thicker pieces and for longer-term storage.Expose the fish to light smoke at the beginning (keep the vent open for the first third of the smoking period), then increase the amount of smoke but keep the temperature below 90ºF/32.2ºC., Smoke at 100ºF/37.7ºC for the first 2-4 hours, then gradually increase the oven temperature to 140ºF/60ºC until the salmon flesh becomes flaky., This will kill bacteria present in or on the fish.


The smokehouse will need to be set to 200 to 225ºF/93.3 to 107.2ºC for at least 30 minutes to achieve this.
Use a standard meat thermometer to test the fish's internal temperature.
 At all times after the 30 minute internal heating up, keep the fish above 140ºF/60ºC, even when continuing to smoke it.
 If it doesn't work for you or you're just not keen on fiddling with smokehouse or smoker apparatus, you don't have to miss out. You can still take your fresh catch straight to a commercial smokery to have them do it perfectly for you.

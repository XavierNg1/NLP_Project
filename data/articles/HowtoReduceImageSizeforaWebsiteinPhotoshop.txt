, Typical websites are roughly 800 pixels wide, but different display settings and sizes can have a large impact on your images' appearances. For instance, if you are using a 1024x768 pixels setting, an 800-pixel wide image will stretch across roughly 80% of the computer screen. If your monitor is set to 1280x1024 pixels, the same image will stretch across roughly 60% of the screen. Remember that browsers such as Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer have their own status bars, toolbars, borders, and settings.
 The Image Size dialogue box will pop open.
 Leave the pull-down menu set to "Bicubic."

, For Websites, use pixel dimensions. Leave the pull-down menus set to "pixels" and fill in either the "width" box or the "height" box - the other box will be filled in automatically because you have "constrain proportions" checked.
 Your altered image will now appear. Under the View menu, select "Zoom In" or "Zoom Out" until the image size reaches 100%. (The bottom left of the window will tell you the percentage size.) That's it!

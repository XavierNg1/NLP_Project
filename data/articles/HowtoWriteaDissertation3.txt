 Your adviser will be your guide along this perilous journey, the Virgil to your Dante. Be sure that you get along with and understand your adviser, preferably before starting work. Being unable to communicate complex ideas with this person will make it very difficult to proceed. You should both have a thorough understanding of what youâ€™re trying to do and what your advisor expects from you.
 Understand the people who will be on your committee. Know what their areas of expertise are, as well as areas where their knowledge is lacking. This will influence how you write your content. You will also want to know what types of research and evidence they value vs. which they hate. If there are particular methods that they do not approve of but that you intend to use, you will need to be prepared to defend yourself and your choices.
 Since this work is intended as your first foray into the academic world, you will need to think of your future colleagues as you write it. Is the topic you have chosen something which is largely disapproved of in your discipline? This will make it hard to integrate into the community once you graduate and you will need your peers to think well of you if you want to get a job.
 Dissertations, since they are legitimate research, will hopefully be used by future scholars in their own research and learning process. With this in mind, try to write your dissertation in a way that will be as accessible and understandable as possible.

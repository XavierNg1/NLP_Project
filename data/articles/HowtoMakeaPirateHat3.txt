 To make this pirate hat you will need the following:


Black poster board
Scissors
Glue
A pirate hat template
Spare sheets of white paper
Pens, pencils, markers, or crayons

, You can find a pirate hat template online, or you can draw one yourself directly on the poster board. If you need to make multiple pirate hats, consider drawing a stencil on a separate piece of poster board.If you're drawing your own template, you have some freedom when it comes to the shape of your pirate hat.
 If you printed your template out online, place it on the poster board and trace the shape of the hat. Make two copies of the pirate hat shape.
 Make your cuts as clean as possible. When you've finished cutting out your hat shapes, line them up with each other. Make sure they're both about the same shape.
 Cut out the design and glue it to your hat.


Draw features on the skull and crossbones using the markers. If you're working with kids, have them try their hand at drawing the skulls.
If you don't have any spare paper, you can draw the skull and crossbones directly on the hat.
 Glue the top edges of the hat together. Do not glue the bottom edges of the hat together, or you won't be able to wear it.









Allow plenty of time for the glue to dry before trying the hat on.

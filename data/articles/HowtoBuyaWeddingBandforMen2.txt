 A high-quality wedding band will have two marks. One is the manufacturer's trademark, which means that the manufacturer ensures good workmanship on your ring. The other is a quality mark (like "24K" or "PLAT"), which will vary depending on what metal your ring is made of.If your ring is made of two metals, it will have two quality marks.
 If your partner works with his hands a lot or is very active, a durable metal will stay in better condition. Platinum is a popular choice for men's rings because of its durability. Palladium, titanium, and tungsten are also heavy-duty metals.Silver is a soft metal and vulnerable to scratching. Avoid sterling silver if you want a durable wedding band., Talk with your jeweler about the wedding band's warranty, and ask them questions about their specific policy. Does your jeweler offer free ring cleanings? What about resizing, and how long do they offer this after the ring is purchased? What if a gemstone falls out of the band, or you lose your ring? To what extent will the jeweler replace your ring?Check their jewelry return policies in case you need to use them.
Some jewelers offer ring insurance in case your wedding band gets lost or stolen.
 When it comes to a finish, you have many choices: brushed, polished, satin, hammered, or sandblasted. Brushed wedding bands are textured. Polished rings are shiny and reflective in sunlight. Satin rings are similar to brushed but with a matte finish. Hammered rings have an artisan, handmade look. Sandblasted rings are rough and subtly bumpy.

Satin finishes are most popular for contemporary jewelry.

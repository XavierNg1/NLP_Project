 This could be from your own body or from another source. You could visualize the energy entering and filling every part of your body from the Earth through your feet, or from the sky and the sun through your crown chakra. Some people imagine energy coming into the body on the in-breath and out through the hands on the out-breath.
 When you feel like you have enough energy hold out your hands. You can either hold them like you hold a basketball, you can cup them like you are holding a baseball, or you can even hold out one hand. Do whatever feels natural to you.
 Picture a trapdoor cover opening and letting the energy flow out. Imagine a hose in each of your palms slowly emitting psi. It doesn't have to be very fast, or have very much pressure, it just has to naturally flow. Don't let it out of your hands; the next step will help with this.


At this point you should be able to sense the psi. It could feel like heat, pressure or tingling. When you feel this, move your hands closer together a bit - if there is resistance (even a little) you will know you're sensing it.
 Using visualization, compact the psi into a ball in your hand. You can also make it into a cube, or a triangle, or pretty much anything!

, This comes easier to some people than others. Have a very clear intention in your mind. Sometimes it may help to say it in words in your head. The point is make sure your message is very clear.


Psi balls can be programmed for pretty much anything. A common use is to get someone's attention - program the ball to "poke" someone, to let someone know you want to speak to them. The ball can travel long distances to give the message.
 If you programmed it, then it should carry out its programming as soon as you let go. If you made one just for practice, then it should naturally dissipate.

 This is the first challenge; as a first-time app designer, you need to make a decision whether it is better to offer it free to gain a following, or whether after spending money to get the app into iTunes, you want to start trying to recover some of the costs and have good reason to believe that people will purchase it.



 


How good is your app in terms of quality, uniqueness, and interest?
What is motivating your decision to charge? Is that reason stronger than giving away a freebie that might attract more people to your website, blog, product, etc., that is behind the app?
Keep in mind that clever marketing can be more successful than offering an app for free; if your strength lies in marketing or social network connecting, charging might be a good way to go.;
, For this, you'll need to consider the unique qualities of your app and its similarities to existing apps. If your app has a lot of competitors, you probably won't want to charge a lot for it or the customers will simply choose other apps over yours. On the other hand, if your app is very specialized and rather unique, it's likely that you'll be able to put a higher price on it.






Test the waters and see what your customers are prepared to pay. You can adjust the price if needed.
Don't forget to account for the fact that Apple takes a cut.
 Other ways can more profitable than charging for the initial app. For example:






Charge for in-app or add-on purchases. This can be an excellent way to interest customers in your app, and then have them motivated to purchase the in-app or add-on items. In-app purchases can be items such as weapons, new skins, or additional content.
Get a cut for the advertisements accompanying downloaded apps.
Keep updating the app and providing sequels to encourage people to continue using your app.

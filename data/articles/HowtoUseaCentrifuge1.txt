 Cracked tubes can fracture at high speeds or at the very least, leak sample into the rotor.


Discard broken or cracked tubes to prevent them from accidentally being used in the future.;
, Tubes that have been specified for use with a centrifuge have a proper cap or lid that seals the tube. Using a different lid or covering such as saran wrap or foil can easily lead to spills within the centrifuge.Making an aerosol of your sample can be hazardous to your health and the environment. In addition, it can lead to loss of precious samples.
 You may know how you placed your tubes into the centrifuge before they started spinning, but at the end of the spin you will not be able to tell them apart. Make sure you put some sort of label on each tube so you know which sample is which.If you have a balance, be sure you label it as such.


It is best to label the tube directly instead of using a sticker. A sticker can fall off during the spin making identification difficult.
 Wiping the tube is particularly important if you are working with a biohazardous material.You want to limit any possible spills or aerosol formation of your sample. The best prevention is to wipe down the sample with a proper disinfectant before the spin begins.
 At high speeds, a centrifuge can easily become unbalanced if there arenâ€™t equal masses opposite each other in the rotor. Remember to balance the masses of the tubes, not the volumes. Weigh the tube with your sample and record the mass. Add water to a separate empty tube until the mass is the same as your sample.Unbalanced tubes can lead to permanent damage of the centrifuge and can be hazards if the rotor breaks free from the rest of the centrifuge.
Balancing is extremely important at higher centrifugation speeds.
Many centrifuges will automatically turn off if it senses an unbalanced load, but older ones may not have this feature. If the centrifuge begins to shake or wobble, it is off balance and you should stop it immediately.

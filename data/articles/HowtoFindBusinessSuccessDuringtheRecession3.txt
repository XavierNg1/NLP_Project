 Some businesses focus on stopping the bleeding. For this kind or response to a recession, you would implement policies that reduce operating costs. Shrink discretionary expenditures. Lower your payroll expenses by reducing head count. Postpone making investments in research and development activities. Hold off on capital purchases. These practices may help your company from going under during an economic downturn., Some companies see a recession as an opportunity to explore how innovation or restructuring can help them adjust their business model to be more profitable. For example, you can take advantage of the downturn to acquire employees, assets or even other businesses that may make yours stronger. These organizations thrive on a culture of optimism. However, they also need to temper that optimism with a dose of common sense so they know when itâ€™s time to make budget cuts.For example, when it comes to managing payroll expenses, companies that focus on creating operational efficiency instead of merely reducing the workforce tend to hold on to their profitability. This is not only because of the improved morale of the staff at these businesses, but also because staffing levels have been optimized to efficiently produce the goods or services.
 Progressive companies survive a recession by balancing cost-cutting measures with acquiring new investments. They take advantage of the depressed prices to acquire property, plants and equipment. Because they acquired their assets for a lower price, their profitability is higher. Also, the assets continue to help them when the recession ends as they respond to increased demand. Also, instead of cutting them all together, these companies make modest reductions to research and development activities. The payoff for this investment comes after the recession ends, when the R&D activities add to sales and profitability.

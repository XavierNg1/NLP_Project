 The top number, called the numerator, represents the number of parts you're working with. The bottom number, called the denominator, represents how many parts there are in total.;
, If you are working with fractions that are on the same line, it's helpful to rewrite them so the numerator is on top of the denominator.


For example, if you have 1 piece of a pizza that was cut into 4 pieces, you have 1/4 of a pizza. If you have 7/3 pizzas, you have two whole pizzas plus 1 piece of a pizza that was cut into three pieces.

,, Stir with a spoon until the mixture forms a ball with some dry flour on the sides of the bowl. At this point, use your hands to gently mix the dough. You want a smooth dough that is not too wet or sticky and not so dry that it cracks and crumbles when you tear off a piece.
, Form the dough into one-inch balls. For each one-inch ball, make a 1/4-inch ball -- that's your stamen for the flower shape.
 With your index finger and thumb, pinch and shape each wedge to form clean, crisp edges. Arrange four wedges on the prepared cookie sheet, conjoining and slightly overlapping the tips of the "petal." With the tip of your pinkie or the wide end of a chopstick, lightly press the overlapped petal tips to "glue" them together and form a well into which the "stamen" will go. Lightly press a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm)-ball into the well., You should have about 15 flowers. Be sure to leave about one inch space between them on the cookie sheet.
 The cookies are done even though they're not golden browned.

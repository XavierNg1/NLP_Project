 This will form the resting place for the dipped almonds. If making a lot of covered almonds, you'll need more than one plate or baking sheet; use your judgment.,, Pick them out with a fork. As you bring up each almond, tap gently against the side of the pan and wipe off any excess fondant., Leave for 5 minutes, then turn over to dry and harden on the other side., These can now be used as wedding favors or for treats.

To present at a wedding, use either favor boxes or gauze bags tied with ribbon.

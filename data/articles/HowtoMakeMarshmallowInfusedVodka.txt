 To get the most out of the marshmallows.


Cut them into pieces. This will enhance the flavor of the finished result, as the actual marshmallow inside the "shell" is exposed during the infusing process.

Be sure not to cram everything at once; if it doesn't all fit, use multiple jars and equal amounts of each ingredient. Tightly secure the lid on.
 Allow the marshmallows to soak in the vodka for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator. Try shaking the jar about every 6 hours so that the flavors can mix together instead of having the sugars always settled on the bottom.
 Any "seen" remains can easily be scooped up with a spoon to make the straining process easier. Place a metal fine-meshed sieve above a bowl and pour the infused mixture through it. Repeat straining the vodka a few times to get all the marshmallow sugar out.
 You can either store it in the refrigerator for a few weeks or the freezer for two months.

 Keep your feet about a foot away from the wall and shoulder width apart.;
, Be sure to keep the small of your back pressed firmly against the wall with no arching. Pay careful attention to your knees to make sure they are aligned properly over your toes.
 Hold this position for a goal of one minute or until you can no longer maintain proper form.
 Allow yourself adequate rest periods between tests to avoid over-straining the legs and to allow them to recover.



If you held a squat with proper form for under 20 seconds, your legs are considered relatively weak.
Remaining in the squat position for 20 to 35 seconds means your leg strength is average.
If you held for 35 seconds or longer, your leg strength is strong.

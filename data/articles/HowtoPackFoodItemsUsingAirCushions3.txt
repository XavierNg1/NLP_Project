 Take the product and place it into the box. Make sure that item is placed in the center of the box. Corner protection involves using air cushions to protect the corners of your product from damage. This is useful when packing large items like humidors.
 Use two air cushions and place them in the two corners of the box. The cushions have two chambers that allow them to be bent in certain places.
 Once the product is completely secure and cannot move, close and pack the box.

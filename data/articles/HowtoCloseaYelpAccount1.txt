Closing your account will remove all of the reviews you have posted as a Yelp consumer, as well as any pictures you have uploaded and comments you have made in the Yelp forums.;
, When you close your Yelp account, Yelp will eventually remove your content, but this could take a while. If there are reviews or images you want removed immediately, delete them yourself before closing your account.

You can find your reviews in the About Me section of the Yelp website. Click the "Remove" link for each review you want to get rid of.
You can delete photos by opening the business page that you uploaded the photo for. Select the photo you want to remove, then select "Edit caption". This will display the "Remove" button for the photo.

You cannot delete your account from your account settings or by using the mobile app.
 Yelp asks for a reason that you're closing your account. You don't have to enter anything specific, but you must type something into the box before you can proceed.
 Your account will not be deleted immediately. You'll need to wait for a confirmation email, which may take a little while to appear in your inbox.
 It will be sent to the email address associated with your Yelp account.
 Click the "Close Account" button to make it official. You won't be able to recover the account after doing this.
 Once you confirm that you want to close your account, your data will begin to be deleted. This process does not happen all at once, but over the next week or so all of your photos and reviews will be deleted from Yelp.

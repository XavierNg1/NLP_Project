 You don't have to eat sprouts on their own — in fact, they're often best when paired with other ingredients with complementing flavors! In this recipe, we'll use sprouts as the "greens" for a basic salad. To start, gently toss your sprouts with chopped red onion and tomatoes in a mixing bowl.


With their relatively mild flavor, red onions are frequently used for salads. However, if you find them too strong, try soaking them in water before adding them or using a sweet onion as an alternative.In terms of tomatoes, there's no wrong answer here — anything from a large, hearty beefsteak tomato to a handful of flavorful cherry tomatoes will work well.
 Next, add chili powder, salt, and chaat masala to a small mixing bowl. Stir to combine.


Chaat masala is an Indian spice blend that's often available at ethnic grocers or in the "spice" aisle of well-stocked grocery stores. If you can't find any, you can approximate the flavor with cumin, salt, and crushed red pepper, though the final taste will be somewhat different.
 Spritz your veggies with the juice of half of a small lemon, then toss it gently to get an even coating. Sprinkle your dry seasonings over the dish and toss again to combine. The powdery seasoning should cling to the lemon juice, creating a sort of makeshift "dressing".
 At this point, you may want to add a few coriander leaves to your salad if you have them available. Coriander leaves have a spicy, aromatic taste that complements the mild flavor of sprouts excellently.


You may also add your preferred salad dressing, but use caution — not all dressings pair well with the tart, spicy taste of your lemon-and-spice seasoning. You may want to try testing dressings on individual sprouts until you find a taste you like.
 Congratulations! Your salad is ready to eat. Serve the salad on its own as a light, refreshing treat or as a side-dish for heartier main courses (especially Asian dishes.)

 While it may feel impolite, turning your body away, leaving headphones on, and avoiding eye-contact will signal that you are not in the mood to talk. This may save you from directly telling someone to shut up later on.


Keep working on whatever activity you were doing when they interrupted.
Get up and move around, be active, and find little chores to do instead of listening.;
, Saying things like, "I'd like to add something," or "If I could interrupt you for just a moment," will often let someone know that they are talking too much. While people often talk quickly, capitalizing on a breath or a brief moment of silence can break the one-sided flow of discussion.


Signal that you would like to speak by holding up your hands, opening your mouth, or clapping. Anything to break their train of thought and get a chance to talk works.
If they ask to finish their thought, don't let them continue to steamroll the conversation; interrupt them once they finish their sentence.
 This is especially helpful when dealing with someone you talk to frequently. Let the person know that you listened to them and steer the discussion in another direction.
 Phrases like "I would love to chat, but I'm swamped with work right now," "Today's not a great day to talk, I have a lot of errands," and "I unfortunately can't devote my full attention to you right now," will allow you to easily wiggle out of the conversation later on.


If you don't want to talk, use a generic excuse like "Let's catch up another time," or "Sorry, I'm in a hurry now. I'll see you later!"
If you are constantly being talked over, recognize that you must be more direct.

 Place your longhair dachshund on a comfortable spot on the floor or on a portable grooming table. You can also use a countertop or kitchen table. If you choose to be on the floor, lay out a soft, large towel to catch any hair. Remove any accessories they may be wearing, such as a harness or collar.If your dog will not stay still during grooming, enlist another person to help hold them while you groom the dog.;
, You want to be able to focus on one section of the coat at a time. This will help you brush each section thoroughly and to detect any tangles or mats., Before you begin brushing, go through each section and gently comb the hair. This will dislodge loose hair and untangle smaller knots. Use a fine-toothed comb so you can untangle knots more easily.


While you are combing, keep an eye out for any skin irritation. Dachshunds aren’t any more predisposed to have skin problems than other longhaired dogs but they do occur. Grooming regularly will help you to notice any skin irritation or problems early on. Look for any redness, flaking, or scabbing on the skin., Using a soft bristle brush, begin to brush each section of the coat. You should start at the head and make your way down their body. Always brush in the direction that the hair grows; never go against the growth pattern., As you finish the first few sections, brush down towards your dachshund’s legs. Continue brushing in the direction that the hair grows all the way down their legs.


Be extra careful when brushing their tails. This hair tends to be very fine and longer than the other sections of the coat, and can become easily tangled. Check for any debris, like chips of wood or dust, before you brush it.
 Daily brushing helps to remove any loose hair that can get trapped in the dog’s fur. Dachshunds have double coats and longhaired dachshunds are more likely to become tangled and matted when they are not thoroughly brushed daily.


Twice a week, use a wire-pinned brush to detangle their coats.

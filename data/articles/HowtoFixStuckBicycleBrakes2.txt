 If your levers are fine and the pad isn't stuck to the wheel somehow, then your cables form the next likely problem area. You should be able to fix your cables by hand without consulting a mechanic.If you do have trouble, however, don't hesitate to take your bicycle in to a shop.
 The cable length adjustment is perhaps the most basic brake repair task that you'll encounter. On a typical safety bike, you can make fine adjustments without any specialized tools. Simply turn an adjusting barrel to make the best fit at the end of a length of cable housing. The adjusting barrel for a V brake is normally located on the hand-lever, where the housing exits.
 Get lubricant in an aerosol can with a tube. Then, spray oil into the cable housing at the ferrule: the cap where the cable enters the housing underneath the brake levers.Use a light machine oil with a small nozzle similar to "3 in 1" Oil, or purchase a special brake cable oil at a bike shop. Spray gently, and don't over-saturate the cables.









WD-40 and other industrial-grade degreasing products may "wash" the factory lubricant off the cable. When the WD-40 evaporates, there will be very little lubricant residue on the cable.
 If the cable is still stiff, try taking it out of its plastic tubing. First, remove the clamp at either the caliper or brake lever. Then, pull the cable out the opposite end. If you remove the cable, use an aerosol solvent (or even WD-40) to flush any dirt or debris from the cable tube while the cable is out. Apply a light coat of lithium grease or machine oil to the cable. Finally, reinstall the cable if it is not damaged.









Put the cables back into the casing. Thread the loose end of the cable through the clamp at the end where you removed it.
Then, check the "free travel": the distance the brake lever can be squeezed before the brake contacts the wheel. Tighten the clamp when the brake pads are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel with the lever released.

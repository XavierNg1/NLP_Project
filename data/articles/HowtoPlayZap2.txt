, Do you want them to hug a guy they like? Say hello to that cute older boy? You can write almost anything. Also, think of a time in the future (two or three hours gives the victim to most suspense to find out who they have to talk to.) Just make sure the time isn't too far in the future. Everyone has a limit as to how long they can wait.
 Most people will appreciate you asking them if you can zap them, but you don't have to if you don't want to.
 Write what time it has to be before they can look at the zap (or find out who's on it) without having to do what it says. For example: 2:00

, For example: Hug

, For example: Bob in Social Studies (you could also write the last name, instead of what class they share with the victim.)

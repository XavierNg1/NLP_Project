 Look along branches that are actively growing on the outside of the original plant’s canopy. Search for fully matured buds where the leaf stems meet the branches. Cut the branch from the original plant (called a "scion"). Then cut the leaves from the very top of their stems. What you have left is a "budstick."Snipping the leaf's blades away and leaving the stem creates a handle to hold your eventual “patch.”
Matured buds of one species of plant may look considerably different from another. Search online for images and descriptions for the particular plant that you are budding.
 First, make a horizontal slice along the budstick, about a half-inch above the bud and leaf stem. Then make a second, parallel slice of equal length about a half-inch below the bud. Perform a third, vertical slice from the end of one horizontal cut to the corresponding end of the other. Then make a second vertical slice to connect the other two ends of the horizontal lines. Now carefully peel the rectangle of bark from the branch.Next, find a smooth stretch along the stem of the "root stock" (the plant that will receive the scion patch). Use the same cutting technique to remove a rectangular patch of equal size.
 Place the scion patch into the root stock’s open patch. Line the sides of each one up so they are flush.Wind grafting tape around the patch to seal it, leaving the bud and leaf stem exposed, or use budding rubber to secure the patches. Let the plant heal for two to three weeks. If you used grafting tape, remove it, since it doesn’t break down naturally like budding rubbers do. Trim the root stock above the patch to motivate growth from the scion bud.If it is too late in the season to expect growth immediately, wait until winter to trim the top of the root stock.

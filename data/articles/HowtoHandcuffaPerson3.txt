 This technique, sometimes called the LAPD technique, has the suspect interlace their fingers behind their heads before handcuffing. This can occur in a standing or kneeling position.
 Grasp the suspect’s left wrist in your hand and press the “bow” of the handcuff against their wrist. Cuff the wrist, making sure that the cuff isn’t too tight.
 Grasp the cuffed wrist and move it in a circular motion away from the body and behind the suspect’s back. The chain of the handcuff should be coming out of the cuff away from the body. The suspect’s other hand should still be resting on the back of their head.
 Holding the cuffed wrist in one hand, grasp the suspect’s right wrist and move it in a circular motion behind the suspects back next to their cuffed hand. Press the suspect’s hands together, palms facing outward, and extend your left hand to restrain both of their wrists.


Some people find it helpful to hold the suspect’s thumbs together to help restrain them.
 Try to complete this step swiftly as the subject can still resist with one hand free. If the suspect begins to struggle, subdue them before continuing to handcuff them. If the handcuffs have a double locking mechanism, this is the time to lock it.


Always double check the tightness of the handcuffs. You should be able to slide your smallest finger between the cuffs and the person’s wrist. Leaving the cuffs too tight can result in nerve damage to the suspect.

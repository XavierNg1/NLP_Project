 Locate the app on your home screen or app drawer, and tap it to open.


If you don’t have the OneDrive app yet, you can download it for free from Google Play for Android, and from the App Store for iOS.
 Enter the email address registered with your Microsoft account, and tap the arrow button next to the field. You will then be asked to enter your password. When you’re done, tap “Sign in” to continue.


Once you’ve logged in, you can now exit OneDrive.
 Open your app drawer and tap your gallery, music, or file management app. Scroll through the different pictures, music, or other files until you find the one you want to back up.


When you find the file or folder, press and hold it and select “Share” from the list that appears.
Please note that not all file management apps are created equal, and some may not offer every sharing feature.
 Since you have OneDrive on your device, it should appear in the sharing list. Select it and OneDrive should open. Navigate to and open the folder where you want to save the file/folder you’re sharing. Once you are in the folder, tap the “Upload” button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.


The OneDrive screen will disappear, but there will be a cloud icon on your notification panel signifying that an upload is in progress. Slide down the notification panel and you will see that it says “Uploading,” and under are the number of files being uploaded and how many are left.
You’ve now backed up your files/folder on your mobile device.

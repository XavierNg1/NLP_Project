 You begin the ocho cortado in the basic tango start position. Keep your feet together and slide your right foot back so that it is about in the middle of the left foot. Make sure that your back is straight and that your weight is on the balls of your feet. Your right hand should be across your partner’s back. Your left elbow is bent at about 89 degrees and your left hand is gently holding your partner’s., The ocho cortado starts with the basic tango step. Step backward on your left foot, followed by your right, and ending with your feet parallel. Then take one step to your left, followed by two steps forward. Finish with your feet parallel and your partner in a cross position. Keep your knees flexed and move your feet in a quick staccato motion., Uncross your partner by pivoting them to your right, taking a step backward with your left foot as they step forward. Spiral your body to the right and step forward with your right foot, placing it between your partner’s feet. Finally, turn left and return your partner to cross position.This movement is the same as a regular ocho. However, by stepping between your partner’s feet, you abort or cut (cortado) the full movement.
 Step forward with your left foot and then take a side step to the right. Your feet should be facing forward and parallel beneath you. From this position you can make another move.

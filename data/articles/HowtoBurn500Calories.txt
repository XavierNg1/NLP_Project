 If you run at a pace of 6 miles (9.7 km) per hour—or 10 minutes per mile (1.6 km)—you can burn 500 calories in 44 minutes. To shorten this time down to 30 minutes, you'll need to run at a pace of 8 miles (12.9 km) per hour.


Running at interval sprints can shorten your time even further. For someone weighing 120 lbs (54.5 kg), you can burn 500 calories in 24 minutes this way. Someone weighing twice as much can accomplish the same feat in half the time.;
, If you don't have the energy for a full run, you can try jogging at slow, steady pace. Since jogging isn't quite as intense, though, you'll need to do it for about 60 minutes at a speed of 5 miles (8.0 km) per hour to see results.If you increase your pace to 6.5 miles (10.5 km) per hour, you can lose the same amount in about 53 minutes if you weigh around 120 lbs (54.5 kg). Decrease this time interval if you weigh more.
 If jogging doesn't appeal to you, take things even one step slower by going for a 2-hour nature hike.


You'll need to walk at a moderate pace while hiking to really make a difference. Also note that adding diverse terrain, like hills and rocky paths, can further shorten your exercise time.

 The amount of time you'll need to spend will vary based on the type of exercise you choose to perform. In general, sports that require more vigorous activity will require a shorter time than leisurely sports, though.


Play a singles match of tennis for 60 minutes. If you choose to play doubles, increase the amount of time to about 90 minutes.

On the other hand, doing a dance workout like Zumba will burn 500 calories at a much faster pace. Someone weighing 120 lbs (54.5 kg) would need to practice about 67 minutes, but someone weighing 240 lbs (109 kg) would only need 33 minutes of practice.
 Mowing grass for approximately 2 hours in one day will give you the calorie loss you desire, but you'll need to use a push mower and not a riding mower.

Consider combining this exercise with something else. For instance, if you mow the lawn for 1 hour, you've burned about 250 calories. Jogging for 30 minutes or performing another similar exercise can help you burn the remaining 250 calories.

, Fold the lower half of the stripe section over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely. Make a gutter when folding, by folding it just below the grommet. This offset is to ensure the thickness of the flag and to ensure that there is no red showing.
 Keep the crease tight and make sure the corners are aligned with the first fold's offset.
 Bring the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the offset edge of the flag. It's important to start with the folded edge, to make sure the folds align correctly in the end., Fold the triangle you've just created, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.
 The entire sequence of folds should involve 13 folds, which represent the thirteen original colonies.
 When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible. Tuck the end into the fold to secure the flag in place. Make a 45 degree fold and then tuck the fabrics in. The finished flag must have no red showing, has four stars pointing upward, and square corners so that it can be easily inserted by the relatives of the deceased into a case for viewing.

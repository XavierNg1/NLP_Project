 Especially in the case of international adoption, the process can sometimes take a long time, even when adopting an infant. The Lifebook can include that part of your child’s story—how you were waiting and longing to bring her home.;
, You may want to use stickers, stamps or other scrapbooking tools, or just keep it simple with words and photos.
 Include information about where your child lived prior to living with you. Difficult issues such as neglect and abuse should not be included, but can be shared with children when they are developmentally ready to hear them and, preferably, with the help of a trusted therapist or counselor.
 Grant’s daughter was born in Guatemala, the story in her Lifebook begins: “My name is Mia. I was born in the Central American country of Guatemala. Guatemala is the country just south of Mexico. Guatemala is a beautiful country.” It includes some history of her home country, along with photos and postcards.


The Lifebook story should emphasize the idea that your adopted child was planned for and wanted, and loved by both her birth mother and her adoptive parents. Part of what Grant wrote for her daughter included this: “At the same time that I was being born in Guatemala, God was figuring out a way to let my mommy and daddy in America know that I would be coming along soon. When they found out that I was going to be a part of the family, they were so happy.”

,, Grant adopted her daughter as a toddler, and she read the book to her at least once a week until she could read it herself.
 Often, this is the way an adopted child can share a bit of his or her story with people they trust.

 You have all the options in the world, but you might want to find a quiet table where no one else is sitting. Sit down there. Put your stuff down and spread out. Get your lunch out.


Donâ€™t feel self conscious about sitting by yourself. Everybody at lunch is paying attention to their own social situations, rather than yours. Even if people do see you sitting alone, they will see it as a sign of confidence rather than isolation., Do another activity simultaneously, if desired. You could read, play a game on your phone, or do a crossword puzzle. If not, just enjoy your lunch. Eat as slowly or quickly as you want to., Someone might be looking desperately for a lunch companion, and, if you would like to, you could wave that person over to sit with you.

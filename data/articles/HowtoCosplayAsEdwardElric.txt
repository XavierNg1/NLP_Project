 It should also be able to be braided. You can also cut your hair yourself and dye it a rich golden blonde.;
, Ed more or less always has his hair in a braid. Leave two sections of hair out in the front as his bangs, and hair spray them up. You could try teasing them up and shaping the bangs. Also, don't forget the antenna! You can use hairspray or gel to let a small part of the hair stick up.
, Ed usually wears relatively tight, shiny black pants. Try leather, or satin. Both work, but satin is easier to move around in. He also wears a black tank top and a shiny jacket, as well as a large belt around the belly button area. It's suggested you make his one of a kind red coat yourself since online shops can make them look cheesy. Look up pictures of the coat and start drawing patterns to help you with the designing. Also, if you feel like being particularly accurate, get white dress gloves. You can usually find such gloves at costume stores, dress clothing stores etc. And, when you're done, you can re-purpose them into normal wear gloves, or even (with a bit of sewing, or even a red marker) into gloves for cosplaying as Mustang.
 If you are wearing the long red jacket, you might not need to have automail. However, if you do want the automail, there are some tutorials online, as well as some people who can do custom cosplay pieces. Just be prepared to pay at least $100 for the arm itself, as cosplay takes a lot of time and work for a quality piece. if you don't want to, just say you're from the "promised day" chapter.
 Whenever somebody refers to you as short, small and/or minuscule, overreact and over-exaggerate what they called you. Care for those close to you. Don't give up.
, It's more fun cosplaying in groups.

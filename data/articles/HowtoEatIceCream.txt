 If you're too young to go out and buy ice cream yourself, ask your mom or dad to buy you some. In the freezer section, you can buy gallons or pints of ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, and pre-made cones, in addition to other treats. You can also go to an ice cream shop and have them serve you the ice cream and toppings.;
, This includes pre-made cones, ice cream sandwiches, and any frozen treats that come in packaging. Be careful not to drop your ice cream when you open the container it is in. Throw away your wrapper in a trash can.
 You will have to do this for gallons or pints of ice cream. Using a sturdy spoon or ice cream scooper, remove scoops of ice cream one at a time, and place the scoops in your cone or bowl. If you are using a cone, ask someone to hold it while you scoop the ice cream into it.


Run the spoon or scooper under warm water for a few seconds before scooping. This will make it scoop better.
Careful—pushing down hard with the spoon may cause it to bend.
Gently push the top of the ice cream into the cone so it makes room for more.
 Bits of brownie, sliced strawberries, sliced bananas, crushed nuts, cookie pieces, and even gummy bears are all excellent toppings for your ice cream.
 Putting the ice cream in the freezer before it begins to melt will keep it fresh longer.
 You can use a spoon for a cone, too, but cones are made to be eaten by hand.
 If you’re eating an ice cream come, you need a napkin because melted ice cream tends to drip out of the bottom. Wrapping a napkin or small piece of foil around the base will prevent the ice cream from melting quickly and dripping on you.
 Make sure it's a safe place where you and your ice cream won't be prone to accidents. Walking around with ice cream might make you spill it or bump into someone.
 You don't to waste any ice cream! If the bottom of your cone is leaking, you can regularly suck out the drips from the bottom.


Make sure to lick the edges of your ice cream sandwich, if you are eating one.
If you don’t like the melted ice cream, wipe it away with a napkin instead of your tongue.
 Moving from the top of the ice cream down to the beginning of the cone, lick away the ice cream resting on top of the cone. Then, start nibbling at the cone. With your tongue, gently push down the top of the ice cream so it fills the cone and doesn’t fall out.Move the napkin away from the area you’re eating.


Never start eating from the base of the cone.
As you nibble the cone away, more ice cream will appear, so alternate between nibbling the cone and licking the ice cream.
When just the tip of the cone is left, you can eat it whole.
Some people like to bite their ice cream, but this could cause your teeth to ache.
 Some people like to spoon the ice cream into their mouth upside down so the ice cream lands directly on their tongue, and others prefer a plastic spoon to a metal once since plastic doesn’t get as cold.Try a few different spoon methods, and see what you like best!

, For example, ice cream sandwiches will need to be bitten, not just licked. Cones can also be bitten instead of nibbled. Just try to keep the bites small so you don’t get a brain freeze.
 If you’re really sticky, wash your hands and face in the sink.

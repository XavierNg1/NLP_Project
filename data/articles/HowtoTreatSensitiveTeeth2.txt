 The bacteria that causes cavities to form feeds on carbohydrates - sugar and starch. If your diet is high in sugar and starch, cutting back can help reduce your cavities and go a long way toward treating your sensitivity.


Bread, pasta, snack foods, and beans are starchy foods that could lead to cavities.
Ice cream, candy, baked goods, and other sugary foods should also be avoided.
When you do eat sugar and starch, make sure to drink water and brush your teeth afterward so that the substances don't remain on your teeth. Also, don't rinse your mouth right away if you are using a fluoride toothpaste. Leave it on for two minutes before rinsing.
 Acidic foods can contribute to wearing away the enamel on your teeth. Cutting back on acidic foods and drinks will help keep your enamel intact. Consider limiting or eliminating the following:


Wine
Citrus
Tea
Coffee
Tomatoes
Carbonated drinks

, When you do drink liquids that are highly acidic, like tomato juice, orange juice or tea, use a straw so that the beverage deposits at the back of your mouth instead of swishing around your teeth. That way, you'll be able to enjoy your favorite beverages without worrying that they're wearing away your enamel.
 After indulging in an acidic food or beverage, rinse out your mouth with water and drink a bit of milk. The water rinses away the acid and the milk, which is basic, changes the chemistry in your mouth to prevent your enamel from eroding.


You can also swish for one minute with an alkaline solution made out of a spoon of baking soda dissolved into a glass of water.

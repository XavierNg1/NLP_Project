 Look for a scratching post that has a variety of textures at your local pet store or online. A scratching post with shelves or resting spots that are high up are an even better option for a senior cat.You may have a designated area for your cat to play, scratch, and lounge in your home. If you have more than one cat in your household, try to have one scratching post for each cat.
 Older cats do well with high climbing spots where they can rest, lounge, and nap, as this helps with stress and anxiety. Being up high can help older cats be less anxious or stressed, especially if they live in a busy household. You may set up a shelving unit with nothing on the top shelves so the cat can climb and rest up there. You can also get a shelving unit made for cats that has several different resting spots at different heights.The top of cupboards and bureaus as well as the tops of couches are also good climbing spots for cats.
 To ensure your senior cat stays relaxed and calm, make sure you spend time playing with it on a regular basis. Show the cat some love and attention by having 10 minute play sessions once a day. Use the cat’s favorite toy to play with the cat. Have the cat run and chase the toy.You can also play fetch with the cat as well as hide and go seek with the cat.
 Senior cats can have sleep issues where they are overly active at night and do not sleep as well as they used to. You can combat this behavior issue by maintaining a sleep area for the cat that is clean and calm. Wash the cat’s bedding regularly so it stays clean and attractive to the cat. Place the cat’s bed in a quiet, cool area in your home so the cat can rest in peace.


You can also have a short play session with the cat right before bed to help it go to sleep. Feeding the cat before bedtime is another good way to get the cat to sleep when you do.

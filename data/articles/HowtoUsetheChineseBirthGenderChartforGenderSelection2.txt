 While many families use the Chinese birth chart after a child has been conceived, some couples look to the birth calendar before conception to select a boy or girl specifically. Whatever gender your child is, you're sure to love them; but what if you could figure it all out beforehand?

Birth charts that don't use the lunar calendar as a guide aren't accurate. Beware of readings that use the Gregorian Calendar.
Be sure to select dates based on the date of conception, especially when considering age. Select how old you were at the time of conception, not how old you currently are.
 Science has been unable to verify the accuracy of the Chinese birth chart, so be careful using the chart solely to determine or predict the gender of your child. There are several ways to scientifically predict the gender of your unborn baby — ultrasound, amniocentesis— but the Chinese birth chart is not one of them.

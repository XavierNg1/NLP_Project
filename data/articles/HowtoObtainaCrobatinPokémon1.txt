 Pokémon that also evolve with max friendship (under certain conditions) are Meowth (in its Alola Form in 7th generation Pokémon games), Chansey, Eevee, Pichu, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Azurill, Budew, Buneary, Chingling, Munchlax, Riolu, Woobat, Swadloon, and Type: Null, into Persian (in its Alola Form), Blissey, Espeon/Umbreon, Clefairy, Togetic, Marill, Roselia, Lopunny, Chimecho, Snorlax, Lucario, Swoobat, Leavanny, and Silvally, respectively.;
, Golbat evolves from Zubat, which can be caught at many caves throughout your adventure.
 Feed it a lot of vitamins such as Protein or Iron to increase both friendship and stats, and use it in battles as often as possible. Try not to let it faint a lot.
 Massages/haircuts can quickly raise happiness in 4th generation Pokémon games, and in 5th generation games, you can feed it Sweet Hearts.
 This increases the happiness more quickly.
 It can often be difficult to tell, but there are people in every Pokémon game that can measure your Pokémon's happiness. If that particular person says that Golbat is extremely happy with you, it's time to level it up.

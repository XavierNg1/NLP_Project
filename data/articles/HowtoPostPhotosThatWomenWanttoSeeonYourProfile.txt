 Bonus points if your eyes and smirk says, “I’m trouble. Come get me.”;
, The truth is, like most men, women want to date men who are fit. However, this isn’t always the rule. Really, women just want to see the product before they go and purchase it. If you have a nice body, then a shot of you playing tennis or running on the beach are always good shots.
 So if you have a cute tush and can accentuate it by wearing tight pants, go for it. But just remember, no shots of your privates. Yes, there’s a difference between private shots and butt shots. Most men post private shots and it’s old. But women find “cute butts” – well – cute. But ONLY if they really are cute.
 So go ahead and post some goofy photos of you being a clown (but not too goofy).
, Studies have shown that the first thing women look at on a man is his eyes. And for god sake whatever you do…don’t wear your sunglasses at night!!!

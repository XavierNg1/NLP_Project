); on AB describe the equilateral triangle ABD -- (please see the article, How to Determine a Line = to Square Root of 3 Geometrically, on how to construct an equilateral triangle correctly if you don't know how).

 III.).
 II).
 III.). Produce DA to meet this circle in AF.
, XXXII.).
 XXI.). Hence we have DF = DE, and DA = DB; and taking the latter from the former, the remainder AF is equal to the remainder BE (Axiom III.). Again, because B is the center of the circle ECH, BC  is equal to BE; and proved that AF is equal to BE; and things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another (Axiom I.)

, Therefore from the given point A the line AF has been drawn equal to line BC.
 Were such the case, this Proposition would have been unnecessary. The fact is, Euclid's object was to teach Theoretical and not Practical Geometry, and the only things he postulates are the drawing of right lines and the describing of circles. If he allowed the mechanical use of the rule and compass he could give methods of solving many problems that go beyond the limits of "geometry of the point, line and circle."

 Most likely, there will be a link to the person's Myspace page.;

Celebrities are usually very busy, and therefore, do not have time to be chatting with anyone online. If the person seems to be having conversations with another person (especially if the other person is a celebrity), he/she is a fake.
Celebrities are very personal people, and don't usually announce to the world who they're dating (especially not on Myspace). If the person has "I love ", it's likely a poser.
For the most part, celebrities try to be as professional on Myspace as possible. They should be promoting their latest projects and inform their fans of any news they have.
Posers are usually very insecure when it comes to whether or not other people will believe them. Real Myspace profiles most likely will not have "This is the real me. If you don't believe then don't add".

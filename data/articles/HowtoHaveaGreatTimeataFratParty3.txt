 Showing up to a party too early shows that you have nothing else to do, and could make people think you’re desperate. Arriving too late may mean that you miss everything and the party is already over. A good rule of thumb is to arrive at the party when it’s in full swing, typically around 11:30 p.m.


Once the party is dwindling down make sure that you leave. It’s embarrassing to be kicked out of the party once it’s over. When groups of people start to leave, that's your cue.
 Not all frats are created equal, and many of them have different cultures and house rules.Make sure that when you are going to a frat house, you like the culture of the frat so you can meet people with similar interests and maximize your fun.
 Showing up to a party alone can increase your stress.If you bring friends to the party, you’ll have someone to talk to before you can start warming up to strangers.


Make sure to bring people of both genders. Sometimes frat parties won’t allow a group of guys to go in unless they have females with them.
Don’t forget to open up and be social with other people. Limit conversation with your friends so you can meet new people.

, They should be arranged in a semi circle around you so that they are easy to reach. Make sure the timpani are almost (but not) touching and that you don't need to pull your elbow out or in to reach any of the drums.
 There are different ones for the different sound you want to get out of the timpani. Some people use a French grip which is like matched grip for snare, except the wrists are turned so that the thumbs are pointed upward. You can also grip the mallets like you would with matched grip. Either is correct.
 Before you begin tuning, move the pedal as far down as it will go so the timpani plays the lowest possible note. Gradually increase the pitch by pushing the pedal forwards. If you go past the desired pitch, start back at the lowest note again. Make sure that, when checking the music to see what notes you will be playing, the higher note will go on the smaller drum and the lower note will go on the bigger drum. The drums should also be arranged largest to smallest because this makes the music much more easier to read.

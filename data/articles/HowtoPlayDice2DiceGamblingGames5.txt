 There are only three bets taken:


An even money bet that the total will be under 7.
An even money bet that the total will be over 7.
An odds bet that the total will be 7. Typical odds are 4 to 1, although some casinos pay only 3 to 1.(Although 7 is the most likely number to be rolled on two dice, the actual odds are 5 to 1 against its being rolled.)

, Most commonly, the dice (made of wood) are rolled down a chute by a dealer.,


Instead of rolling the dice down a chute, they may be rolled in a cup and concealed as in Cho-Han Bakuchi.

 You can find a recipe for just about anything you’d like to cook on the internet. Making an effort to cook can really be a big help for you parents. You may need to enlist your parents help to get everything you need, but they will likely be happy to help you with acquiring what you need.


Start by writing down all the ingredients and supplies you will need.
If you can’t get to the grocery store to pick up ingredients on your own, ask your parent to drive you.
If you need extra help with your recipe, try searching YouTube for videos related to what you would like to cook.
 On the night you cook, or on another night, offer to clean up the mess. Rinse and place all the dishes in the dishwasher (or wash them by hand if you don’t have one), and put any left over food away.

Be sure to wipe down the counters with a damp cloth.
Sweep up any crumbs that might have fallen on the floor.


There are many ways you can get involved in cleaning the house. You might offer to scrub the tub, vacuum the floor, or dust the furniture. As long as you offer, and do a good job, your parents are very likely to be impressed by your effort., Maybe the grass needs mowed, or the dog needs to go for a walk. Ask your parents if there is anything you can do to help them outside.

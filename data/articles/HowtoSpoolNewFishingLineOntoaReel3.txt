 Before you can spool the line,you'll need to tie it onto the reel.
 Depending on brand, some rotate clockwise, some, counterclockwise. Now, look at the new spool, and note the direction the new line unwraps from the spool.


For each reel, make sure your bale rotation and the spool unwinding match. In other words, if your bale rotates clockwise, make sure the line coming off the spool is coming off in a clockwise direction. This procedure will help minimize line twists.
If the spool unwind does not match the bale rotation, simply flip the spool over.
 Then, attach the new line onto the reel. Lift the bail arm, and run the end of the new line up through the rod guides to the reel. Tie the line as follows:


Wrap the line around the reel.
With the free end, tie a basic overhand knot around the main line.
Tie a second overhand knot near the tip of the free end to prevent it from unraveling.
Tighten the knot around the reel, and closely trim the excess line from the end.
Note: if you're using very low diameter line and don't want the bulk of a knot, use electrical tape to secure the line to the reel.
,, Confirm that the coil of line is being coiled onto the reel in the same way. If the line is okay, go ahead and finish. If not, go back and repeat the steps to make sure the coil of line coming off the spool of line is coiling onto the reel spool in the same direction.


A good way to spool the line is to take a soft cotton cloth and hold the line in the cloth at about the first eye. Apply a good amount of tension, so the line does not spool loose, and you can real as fast as you like.

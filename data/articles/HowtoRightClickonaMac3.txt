 Under the Apple menu, click System Preferences, then click Trackpad.
 In that window, enable the Secondary click checkbox, and from the menu, select Click in bottom right corner. (Note: you may alternately choose the bottom left corner if you prefer). You will see a short video example of the proper way to click.
 Go to the Finder, and as shown in the video, press one finger on the bottom right of the trackpad. A contextual menu should appear.

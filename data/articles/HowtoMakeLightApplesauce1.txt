 Wash 3 pounds (1.36 kg) of apples. Use an apple corer to remove the core and seeds of each apple. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut each apple into five or six pieces. Place the apples in a slow cooker.Try using a combination of apples for a rich flavor. For example, you could use Fuji, McIntosh, and Jonathan.
You don't need to peel the apples since the peels will cook down and you'll be blending the sauce.;
, Add Â½ cup (120 ml) of water to the apples in the slow cooker and put the lid on the cooker. Turn the slow cooker on to LOW and cook the light applesauce for six hours. The apples should become soft and start to combine if you stir the sauce.If you're worried about the applesauce sticking, you can stir the applesauce occasionally.
 Turn off the slow cooker and carefully transfer the hot sauce to a blender. Place the lid on the blender, but leave the vent on the lid open so the steam can escape. You may want to lay a dishtowel over the vent so no applesauce flies out. Blend the applesauce until it's smooth.You could also use an immersion blender. Place the immersion blender directly into the cooked apples in the slow cooker. Ensure that the blender is fully submerged or the sauce could spray.
 Pour the applesauce out of the blender and into a serving bowl or storage container. You can serve the applesauce warm or at room temperature along with a sprinkle of cinnamon or a dollop of whipped cream. You could also chill it before serving it. Just refrigerate the applesauce for up to a week.You can freeze the applesauce for up to 6 months in an airtight container.

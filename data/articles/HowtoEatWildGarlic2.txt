 Set the oven to 350 F (180 C). This only has to be done if you wish to toast your nuts. The nuts can also be used raw or left out entirely.
 Place about 4/10 cup (50 g) of pine nuts in an oven dish or on a baking tray. Let the nuts sit inside the oven for about five minutes. Remember to check, since the nuts can quickly burn. Take them out when finished.


Walnuts or other nuts can be used instead., Combine about 3.5 oz (100 g) of chopped garlic leaves, 4/10 cup (50 g) of parmesan cheese, a tablespoon or two of olive oil, and the nuts inside a blender. Use the pulse or blitz setting to make the pesto as smooth as you’d like.Walnut oil or canola oil can also be substituted for the olive oil., Pouring more oil into the mixture will change the pesto’s consistency. Thinner pesto can be made by adding more oil and blending the mixture further. Slowly add the oil and mix the ingredients until you get the consistency you desire., Add a squeeze of lemon juice to the pesto. Include some lemon zest if you have any on hand. Also try adding half a teaspoon of salt and black pepper to give the sauce more flavor.Use the pesto on pasta or other food as a sauce.
The pesto will last up to a week in the refrigerator and up to four months in the freezer.

 If your expression is not already set up like a fraction, rewrite it this way. This makes it easier to follow all the necessary steps when dividing by a square root. Remember that a fraction bar is also a division bar.For example, if you are calculating 144÷36{\displaystyle {\sqrt {144}}\div {\sqrt {36}}}, rewrite the problem like this: 14436{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {144}}{\sqrt {36}}}}.
;
, If your problem has a square root in the numerator and denominator, you can place both radicands under one radical sign.(A radicand is a number under a radical, or square root, sign.) This will simplify the simplifying process.

For example, 14436{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {144}}{\sqrt {36}}}} can be rewritten as 14436{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {144}{36}}}}.
 Divide the numbers as you would any whole number. Make sure to place their quotient under a new radical sign.

For example, 14436=4{\displaystyle {\frac {144}{36}}=4}, so 14436=4{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {144}{36}}}={\sqrt {4}}}.
 If the radicand is a perfect square, or if one of its factors is a perfect square, you need to simplify the expression. A perfect square is the product of a whole number multiplied by itself.For example, 25 is a perfect square, since 5×5=25{\displaystyle 5\times 5=25}.

For example, 4 is a perfect square, since 2×2=4{\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}. Thus:4{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4}}}=2×2{\displaystyle ={\sqrt {2\times 2}}}=2{\displaystyle =2}So, 14436=4=2{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {144}}{\sqrt {36}}}={\sqrt {4}}=2}.

 For your characters to be believable, they need to live within a well-crafted universe. To start building your world, figure out what you want the physical environment to look like. Do you want your story to take place in a medieval time period with castles, or do you want to create a whole other planet with a yellow sky and red water? Take notes on physical descriptors that will make your world stand out.


Think about flora and fauna, what creatures live in the world, if there are seas or forests, color of sky, the type of air, natural landscape, and cityscape when creating the details of your world., Not every character in your story can have a star role. To make your world believable, you need a cast of filler characters who can take up the jobs and residential roles that make a society function. You can’t have a world full of only dragon slayers and knights in shining armor. You also need cobblers, tailors, merchants, cooks, and children.Part of what makes a series like the Lord of the Rings so interesting is the enormous cast of characters. There are elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and more. Try adding many different kinds of characters into your world to keep your reader engaged.
 Consider how the society in your story functions. Is there are a specific system of government? Is money the standard currency, or are transactions made with chocolate or pine cones? What kind of law enforcement exists, if any? Your society can have any rules that you’d like, as long as they have consistency. This way, your characters will have a functional home that will strengthen their personality traits.

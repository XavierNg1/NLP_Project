 To do so, click â–¼ in the top-right corner of the Facebook website and then click Log out.


You can also launch a private browser (or open an Incognito tab in your browser) and search from there.
 It's the text field at the top of your browser's window; doing so will select any text in the URL bar.
 For "name", type in the first and last name of the person who has the blocked account.


For example: "Johnny Appleseed facebook."
If you have the blocked user's custom Facebook URL link, you can enter that instead.
 Doing so will bring up a list of Facebook profiles that match your search query.


If your search doesn't return the results you want, try adding specific details that you know appear on the Facebook user's account (e.g., their current city or former workplace).
 This will open their profile summary. While you likely won't be able to view their entire profile (unless their whole profile is public), you'll be able to see any information they've chosen to make public, such as their profile picture, occupation, and contact details.


This method isn't ideal for gathering information about a blocked account but it does allow you to verify that a Facebook account from someone whom you suspect has blocked you does still exist.

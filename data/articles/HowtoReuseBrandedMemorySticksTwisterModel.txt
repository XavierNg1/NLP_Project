 To avoid fingerprint marks on the Branded USB Memory Twister, it is advised that you wear gloves before handling the goods. To remove the old clip, put the forefinger of your left-hand into space inside the metal clip to pry it apart and open it up to get the plastic housing out. This should avoid any scratches to the housing.;
, Before attaching the new metal clip you need to pinch it together to ensure a snug fit.
 In order to avoid defacing the housing, wrap a small plastic bag around it before attaching the clip. Pry open the clip just enough to squeeze it around the housing with the plastic bag sandwiched in between as a protective barrier.

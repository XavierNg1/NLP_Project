 Smiling projects your confidence and makes you seem approachable as well. You don’t need to sport a huge grin, just a subtle smile will do. Try not to force your smile. Instead, showcase your natural smile as you walk. , A hunched appearance projects a lack of confidence. Instead, walk straight and tall to seem confident. As you walk, keep your shoulders back and lift up your chin slightly. You can test your posture by holding a pencil in each hand and making a fist. Let your arms fall loosely at your sides. If the pencils face inward (towards you), then you are hunching your shoulders. Shift your shoulders back until the pencils face forward to see how your ideal posture should be while you walk. , A brisk walk projects confidence, while walking slowly makes you seem preoccupied with your own thoughts. To seem more confident when you walk, adopt a brisk pace. Try practicing walking to the beat of a favorite quick paced song to help you develop your brisk walk. , Walking silently makes you seem meek or afraid, so don’t tiptoe or walk silently. A bit of noise is good when you want to walk confidently. It demonstrates that you want to be seen because you are confident in your appearance. , Crossing your arms while you walk makes you seem vulnerable, so don’t cross your arms. Allow your arms to fall loosely at your sides and move them back and forth slightly as you walk. , Walking right behind someone that you came with can send the message that you are weaker than that person and that you require protection. If you will be walking with someone, make sure that you are in front of the person or at least side-by side.

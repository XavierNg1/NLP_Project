 This will automatically start the download of LiveSlides, a free add-in program that makes it possible to embed YouTube videos in a Keynote slide.Keynote does not offer this functionality on its own.


You must be using Keynote 5.2 or later on OS X Yosemite (10.10) or later to use LiveSlides.
If you embed the video using this method, you’ll need to make sure your computer is connected to the Internet when it’s time to present your video to your audience.;
,,,,, A popup window will appear with a blank text box.
 A new slide will be appended to the end of your slide deck, containing a square placeholder box that says “LiveSlides web content”.
 This will embed the video on the correct slide.
 The video can be played in any Keynotes slide view, including during your presentation. You’ll just need to be connected to the Internet for it to work.
 Remember, the actual video isn’t saved inside of your presentation—just an embedded link. This means you’ll need to be connected to the Internet in order to view the video.

 Factory settings are the settings for the TV when it has been purchased new.


These settings are not the ones you want permanently as they are designed for the in-store setting with lots of bright, ambient light. However, you should reset to the factory settings so that you can use it as a foundation when calibrating the display for your own environment.;
, Some televisions are equipped with an ambient sensor which is used to automatically adjust the television color based on the environment. Unfortunately, dynamic modes tend to result in bright and garish pictures, so it's usually best to avoid using them.
 The brightness setting isn't actually a control for brightness, but rather the level of blackness. Raising brightness is really just reducing the blackness. Adjust the brightness levels until your eyes feel comfortable watching the screen.
 The contrast setting isn't actually a control for contrast, but rather the brightness of the white. Adjust the contrast levels until you can distinguish between dark blacks, light blacks, dark whites, and light whites.
 The sharpness setting adds information to the picture so that it looks more crisp. If your television is high definition, then you most likely do not need sharpness and can reduce it. If your television is not high definition, sharpness can help to improve picture quality.
 Most televisions have their tint setting calibrated correctly straight out of the factory, so the factory setting for tint is likely the most optimal already.

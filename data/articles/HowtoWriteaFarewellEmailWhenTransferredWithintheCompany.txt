 Categorize them into multiple mailing lists, if required. For example, one may have been part of a core functional team, a cross-functional team, a task force, etc. This categorization may be important, because you may want to write (a) one email to all people/ mailing lists; (b) one (same) email, but separately to the mailing lists; and (c) separate emails to separate lists.
 The email is likely to about the past associations, and be nostalgic in tone. Hence, do not hurry the script. Dig into your past emails, blogs, handwritten notes, and photo gallery (your machine as well as on social network)., As with any script, there needs to be a beginning, a middle, and and end. Depending on your style, you may want to begin with a quote such as "The woods are lovely, dark, and deep; but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep". Alternatively, you may begin with a simple "Thanks" (or you may wish to keep the thanks for the end). Or, you can also start with how you began your journey with that group/ project and mention some of the key highlights., You may choose to elaborate on the achievements, and note specific assignments along with the names of some people who have/ had made significant contributions towards your success. Writing specific names, though, is always tricky, since you'll always feel you've missed out on someone. But don't worry too much, because if you're feelings are genuine, the "left out" person will know it was not deliberate., Thank everyone (once again, if you've started like that as well) and close the note. Mention your contact details in your signature.

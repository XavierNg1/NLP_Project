In order to avoid eating unhealthy fats, Cook meats that have a low-fat content or trim off excess fat.Avoid processed foods like bacon, sausage or ground beef.
Choose lean meats like white chicken meat, pork with the fat trimmed off, and lean beef.

 Hydrogenated oils are liquid vegetable oils that have had hydrogen added to them through an industrial process. The result is a more solid fat that is inexpensive to use, easy to make, and will last a long time.

Trans-fats are also common in most fast food.


Check the nutritional label on any food product to see if they contain trans-fats.
If you are at a restaurant, ask about what kinds of oils are used to prepare the food.

 Before getting a tattoo, make sure that the tattoo parlor has the proper licenses and seems clean and safe. You can also consider running an internet search to read reviews of the shop and the tattoo artists.Never hesitate to check if the store follows appropriate sterilization processes. Ensure that the needles used by the tattoo artist are sterile and new. Make sure the artist wears new gloves.
Since certain tattoo inks could be harmful to your skin, you need to ask the tattoo artist to use inks manufactured particularly for tattoos.
 Just as you ensure that the tattoo artist does everything right, you need to strictly follow the tips suggested by the artist to prevent infection.Try to change the bandage on your tattoo every five hours or so to let your skin breathe and heal.
Wash your hands with warm water and soap before touching your tattoo. Once your hands are clean, wash the tattooed area and wipe it dry gently with a cloth towel or paper towel.
Apply the antibacterial ointment recommended by your tattoo artist.
 Your tattoo might become itchy in the days following your tattoo session. Try not to scratch the tattoo, no matter how itchy it is, because scratching may do damage to your tattoo and could cause infection.
 Exposing your tattoo to water (especially pool water) increases the chance of infection, while exposing the tattoo to sunlight risks damaging your skin and the appearance of the tattoo.

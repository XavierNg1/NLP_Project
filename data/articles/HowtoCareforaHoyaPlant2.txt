 Do this every three to four weeks during the spring and summer. Fertilizer with a ratio of 5-10-5, 8-8-8 or 10-10-10 is fine.A common dilution rate is 1 teaspoon per gallon of water, but this varies.
The dilution rate and application frequency may need to be adjusted based on an individual Hoya plantâ€™s needs.
 If the leaves and stems become pale, the Hoya needs to be given fertilizer every two weeks. If new leaves are smaller and darker than usual with shorter stems between the leaves, give the Hoya fertilizer every six weeks.
 Mix the solution up and pour it evenly over the soil immediately following a regular watering. Do not give Hoyas fertilizer solution when the potting soil is dry as it could burn their roots. They should not get any fertilizer during the fall and winter.
 It will produce flowers on those stems again the next time it blooms. Also, do not move the Hoya after it begins to develop new flower buds. Moving the Hoya could disturb it and cause it to drop the buds before they open.
 The container will be packed with roots when it is ready to be repotted. Being pot-bound encourages Hoyas to bloom. Repot the Hoya into a container with drain holes that is only one size larger than the current container., Read the ingredients on the potting soil bag. It should be primarily sphagnum peat moss. Pour an inch or two of potting soil into the new container.
 If it seems to be stuck, run a butter knife around the inside of the container to loosen the roots.
 Finish filling the container with potting soil. Water the Hoya generously to help settle the soil around the roots.

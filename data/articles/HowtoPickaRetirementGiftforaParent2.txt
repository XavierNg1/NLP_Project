 Perhaps your parent enjoys wine tours. Buying them a tour pass for a high-end winery might be something they really enjoy. If they love live music, buy them tickets to their favorite band.
 Sometimes a parent might have a lifelong dream, such as a trip to Rome, a cruise, or visiting the Grand Canyon. Oftentimes either career or children get in the way of these dreams. If you know of something they've always wanted to do, now is the perfect time to make it happen.
, If you run out of other idea and your parent has a social or civic cause they are devoted to, you could organize a charitable event or volunteer day in their name. If all else fails and the scheduling for an actual experience doesn't work out, you could also consider sending a donation in their name.

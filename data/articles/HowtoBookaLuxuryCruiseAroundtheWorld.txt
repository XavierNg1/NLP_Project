 Even world cruises won't take you to every possible destination, so you'll have to compare several to choose the ports of call you most want to visit. You should also consider the departure location.;
, You will not be able to get discounts by waiting until the last minute, when the cruise line drops the price in order to fill empty cabins. However, you may see some discount for booking well in advance.
 You may not get most of what you paid returned to you, so you'll want to buy trip insurance. You should also check into your medical insurance coverage and buy additional insurance to cover you while you're on your cruise.



Although you may leave Florida in warm, sunny weather, the ports of call you may visit could be experiencing cold or wet weather. Be sure to pack warm clothing, jackets and rain gear. This is especially important if you are traveling to the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are reversed.
The customs in some countries may dictate what clothes you can wear. Some may frown on wearing shorts in public, while others have laws prohibiting certain items of dress, especially for women. Don't discover too late that you have to stay on board because you don't have acceptable clothing.
Most cruise ships have formal dinners that require evening gowns and tuxedos. There may be other events at which specific dress is required.

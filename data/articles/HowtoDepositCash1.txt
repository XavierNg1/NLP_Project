 Lots of information on the slip is already printed. Your name, address, bank name and address, and your account number should all be on the deposit slip already. Before depositing cash, check to ensure this information is present and correct.If the information is not present or incorrect, talk to a representative of the issuing bank.
If you did not receive deposit slips when opening your account, contact the bank where you have the account. Many banks offer unnumbered deposit slips in their lobbies (in which case you will have to fill in your account number manually).;
, There should be a space to the left of the deposit slip for you to write the date of your deposit. This will help the transaction proceed smoothly and prevent confusion., Locate the line on which you are expected to total your cash. Typically, the cash deposit line is the first line on the right side of the deposit slip. It has a small black triangle next to it, along with the word “CASH.” Total the amount of cash you’re depositing and write it on this line.If you’re depositing checks along with cash, you can write the totals of your checks on the subsequent lines.
 When you’re done filling the slip out, add up your cash and check deposit amounts. Write the grand total at the bottom of the deposit slip. For instance, if you deposited two checks worth $50 and $100 in cash, you’d write $200 at the bottom of the deposit slip.

 If you're making a necklace or bracelet, you're gonna need to have some sort of staying-put device. The simplest way is to make a button clasp. There are two things you need to consider: the beginning and the end.









For the beginning, don't start your knots flush up against the larkshead knot. Leave a space to slide your button/bead/clasp through.
For the end, simply add an object through all of your cords, tie in a knot, and secure with a dab of glue. Cut off the remaining excess and slide it through the space you left at the top!

, While macram√© is beautiful on its own, if you're making jewelry, you may want a few more ways to jazz it up. Beads do just that!









With a square knot, all you need is four cords to add on your bead(s). Slide your bead onto the two center, anchor cords and do a square knot around it. Easy as pie.
Use a bead as your anchor. Then, start knotting in two different directions. With your two sets of string, knot as much length as you need and tie them together when you're finished!

, Making a bracelet that you can take on and off easily seems like a task for the bracelet pros, but it's easy! Just take your length of knotted cord and overlap it into a circle. Take an extra length of cord (about 4" or 10 cm) and start square-knotting over both ends.









After about half an inch of square knots, thread the ends through the backside of the closure. This is easiest done with a small knitting needle. That's it! The length of square knots keeps your ends together and it slides up and down the cords. Huzzah.

, Using a cooking mallet, lightly hammer each steak until it begins to tenderize and grows by roughly half.
 Make space for one cutting board to season the meat, one bowl with flour, one bowl with the beaten egg mixture, and a resting surface, like a bowl or plate.









To make the egg mixture, mix together all the dry ingredients first in a medium bowl â€” the baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt. To the dry ingredients, add the buttermilk, egg, and hot sauce to create a kind of slurry.
 To dredge, put a steak through flour, then soak in the egg mixture, then the flour again and put on resting surface. Do this for all the steaks. Let them rest for 10-15 minutes.









When covering the steaks with flour for the second time, make sure they are evenly patted down and completely coated. For a fully-developed crust, make sure to pat down the steaks several times in the flour.

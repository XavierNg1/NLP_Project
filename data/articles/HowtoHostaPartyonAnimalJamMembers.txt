 For example, a prom or a dance party. The type of party will help you decide on the location, items, clothes, etc. Other cool party ideas include:


Underwater party
Trading party
Spirit party.
 For it to be epic, do some of the following:


Add bright colors.
Buy a bigger den if needed. A castle or a volcano is ideal.;
, Examples are red sports car, crystal alpha statues, orbs, lava lamps, beta items, phantoms, etc. (Make a dance floor by putting multiple dance floors together.)


Use mostly member items, not too many non-member things.
, Rooms such as, a restaurant, cull room, party room, bathroom, etc.
 Don't be a bunny, koala, panda, or monkey host. Maybe something like a wolf, fox, arctic wolf, cheetah, snow leopard, eagle, etc.



For girls, you might want the secret colors (if you know them), maybe some pink and purple to look really girly.
For boys, be some boy-like but epic colors, such as blue (make it dark!), red, or black. If you choose black, choose lightning or fire pattern with white. if red, choose lightning pattern which should be dark blue (yellow if you don't like blue). And if you choose blue, do the lightning pattern with dark red color. Choose the demon eyes and choose whatever boy-like color you want.

 You should see a sign that says Host your own party.,,,,,

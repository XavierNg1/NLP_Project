 In order for a doctor to treat your PAD medically, they will need to assess the severity of your condition. In order to diagnose PAD, the doctor will need to do an ankle-brachial index test that compares the blood pressure in your foot and your arm. They will then do a imaging test to get a look at the actual blood flow in your limbs.Imaging tests used by doctors to diagnose PAD include CT scans, ultrasounds, MRI scans, and angiography.
 If you are diagnosed with PAD it is likely that your doctor will put you on medication that will lower your cholesterol and your blood pressure. Additionally, your doctor may prescribe medication to prevent blood clots, as clots can occur more easily in arteries that are abnormally restricted.Even if you plan on working to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure through diet and exercise, you will still need to take medication in the mean time.
To prevent blood clots your doctor may tell you to take aspirin or may prescribe clopidogrel (Plavix). In order to treat symptoms they may also prescribe cilostazol (Pletal), which increases blood flow by thinning the blood and widening the blood vessels., For cases of PAD that are very serious, you may need to consider getting a minimally-invasive procedure done to correct the problem. This is not done for mild cases of PAD, but if blood flow to the limbs is severely compromised, your doctor may suggest it.There are several types of procedures done for treating PAD. They include: going into the artery and cleaning the plaque out of it, putting stents in the arteries to keep them open, or having a bypass graft surgically implanted to go around the blockage in the arteries.

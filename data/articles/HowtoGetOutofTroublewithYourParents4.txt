 Your parents have rules that sometimes might not make sense to you. Mostly, these rules are meant to keep you safe and to teach you good values. Respect these rules and follow them., Helping around the house is a great way to get on your parents’ good side. Housework is an added stress for anyone, and it typically falls on parents’ shoulders to keep the household together. As you get older, take on more responsibility around the house by offering to walk the dog, fold laundry, clean windows or vacuum the car.
 If you get into trouble because of bad grades, try to make changes in how you are doing in school. Schedule the same time every day to do homework. Set up a study group a couple of days before a test. Hopefully, this will improve your grades, but at the very least, your parents will be able to see how hard you’re trying to improve.


Get a tutor who can help you learn school material. Sometimes tutors charge a fee, but you may also be able to get a tutor through your school for free. Talk with your guidance counselor about this option.
 When you anticipate that you might get in trouble over something, schedule a time to talk with your parents again. Give them a heads up that you’re getting a bad grade in one of your classes, for example. The key here, though, is to also tell them what you’re doing to try to stay out of trouble. Tell them, for example, that you’re taking the initiative to ask the teacher for extra help.

 To build their cooking levels, they can either read a cooking book, watch the cooking channel on TV, or gain knowledge by cooking. In the Sims 3, your Sim could actually take a cooking class at the restaurant to gain a cooking skill. Most Sims can make basic foods and instant meals with zero cooking skills.
 There will be different options of meals to prepare. Depending on the time of day, categories includes breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, and dessert., Single meals are prepared and consumed by that specific Sim. If a Sim prepares a group meal, the finished meal will be left on the counter until it is completely gone or if someone "cleans up". Group meals are four times more expensive than single meals and will use ingredients to make.,

 The vertex is the point where the two line segments or rays of the angle meet.If you are looking at an angle in a math book or worksheet, this point is likely already labeled. If you are drawing your own angle, you can label this point using any letter.

For example, you might have an angle with a vertex at point C.
;
, Usually these points are plotted near the end of the line or ray. Again, these will likely be labeled for you, but if you are creating the angle, you can label them however you like.

For example, on the top ray of the angle, you might have point A. On the bottom ray of the angle, you might have point B.
 This is simply a small representation of an angle (∠{\displaystyle \angle }). Using this symbol will help differentiate an angle from a triangle the angle might be a part of.
 The convention is that the vertex point is the middle letter in the angle label. So, if you are reading the name of an angle, you generally read it from the point on the top ray, to the vertex, to the point on the bottom ray. For example, an angle with a vertex C, and a point A on the top ray, and the point B on the bottom ray, would be labeled ∠ACB{\displaystyle \angle ACB}.

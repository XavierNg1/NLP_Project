 Not all insects are harmful to plants, and some are actually beneficial. Determine what type of pest is harming your plants before selecting a pest control solution.


Move the pest. Often times, you can determine where the pest is coming from and then relocate the pest's home base.
Determine what will repel the specific pest. Organic baits, traps and nontoxic repellents can be used to safely remove pests. Some examples of nontoxic repellents include mineral oil, liquid soap, clove oil herbicide and hot pepper sprays.
Purchase organic pest control products at your local garden center. Seek advice from local garden experts before using any pest control products. When choosing an organic pest control product, make sure it is labeled as Certified Organic.
Build barriers to keep pests away from plants. Use row cover, which is a woven fabric, to keep pests away. The row cover allows air, light and water to reach plants without letting pests access the plants.

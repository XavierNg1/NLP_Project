 Pellet dewormers are mixed with your horse's grain. Ask your veterinarian to recommend a particular pellet dewormer brand and dosage. The package you choose should also say how often to feed your horse, based on weight.


Write down a deworming treatment schedule as recommended by your vet. You'll need to feed your horse the right dose of pellet dewormer for as long as suggested.
 Use the scoop that's included in the package to measure out the correct dose of pellet dewormer. Mix this into your horse's grain feed. Only mix enough for a single feeding, not the entire day.Avoid mixing the pellets into treats rather than grain.


Grain ensures that the whole dosage is consumed, while your horse could pick around the pellets or refuse them altogether if you include them with treats.
 Offer your horse the grain feed mixed with dewormer pellets. Make sure he finishes the food, so you can be sure that all the medication was eaten. If your horse won't eat all of the pellets and grain, add a little liquid molasses to encourage him to finish it.If you plan on feeding your horse hay, be sure to wait until after he's eaten all of his grain feed with the pellets mixed in.

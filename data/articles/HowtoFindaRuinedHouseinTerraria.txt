 Good armor includes Necro/Crimson, Gold, and Silver. Arm yourself with your strongest weapons.

Having an Obsidian Skull or any item that grants immunity to fire or lava is recommended. If you have the Lava Waders, these are extremely useful. Also bring several potions of healing, as you most likely will be harmed by Fire Imps. If you don't want to fall and sink into the lava, get some wings.
A shadow key is essential; it can be used infinitely, and is the only way to unlock Shadow Chests. It is found within Gold Chests in the Dungeon. Also remember to bring a potion of Recall or a Magic Mirror so you can make a quick getaway if things turn sour!;
, If this is your first time to the Underworld, then at least have a Deathbringer Pickaxe, as you may be digging for quite a while before reaching the Underworld if you rely on a Bronze Pickaxe.

If you've been to the Underworld before and mined Hellstone ore, use a Molten Pickaxe.
This may seem like a boring step, but is imperative to your survival and will maximize your loot.
 Be sure to look out for caverns, as they will provide a quicker way down. If you do this correctly, after a couple of minutes of tireless digging, you will notice the background changes to a wall of rock with many glowing lava veins. This means that you have arrived in the Underworld., You'll likely find one (made up of Hellstone or Obsidian Bricks and probably partially filled with lava) after traversing across the terrain for a little bit. Be sure to check it for loot.

Be careful of those Fire Imps and Hellbats!

, You have successfully found and looted a Ruined House!

Now go find some more and keep gathering loot before teleporting home with your Potion of Recall or Magic Mirror.

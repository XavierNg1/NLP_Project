 Curl your fingers over the treat. Then, call your dog over and sit on the floor in front of it. Hold your fist under your dogs nose. Your fist should be a few inches away from its face.Make sure you hold your fist in a vertical position in front of your dog’s face. This will ensure that part of your palm, as well as the treat, is visible.;
, If your dog just smells the treat, don’t do or say anything. The goal is to get it to paw your palm. Once your dog paws your palm, reward it by giving it the treat in your palm.Also reward your dog with pets and praise, for example, “Good girl (or boy).”
Repeat steps one and two for about three 15 to 20 repetitions, or until your dog consistently paws your palm for the treat. Do this over the course of a day.
 Instead, place the treat in your pocket, or keep it in the treat bag. Hold your palm in the same position. Once your dog paws your palm, reward it with praise and treats from your pocket or the treat bag., Once your dog can consistently paw your closed palm without a treat, add a verbal cue like, “high-five.” Say “high-five” as your dog lifts its paw to touch your palm. Reward your dog with praise and a treat for the correct behavior.Repeat this step until your dog consistently paws your palm while saying “high-five.”

, Keeping your hand in a vertical position, say “high-five.” The moment your dog touches your open palm, i.e., a high-five hand, with its paw, reward it with praise and treats.Once your dog gets this maneuver down consistently, up the ante by moving your hand a little higher so your dog has to stretch for it.

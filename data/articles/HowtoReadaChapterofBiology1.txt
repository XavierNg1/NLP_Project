 To successfully read from your biology book, you should look for a quiet place. Try to leave any distractions, such as TV or cell phones, turned off. This will help you focus on the biology concepts that you are reading about.Going to the library or an open classroom is always a good option when seeking a reading space.;
, Jumping straight into the first paragraph might be overwhelming for some. Instead, read through the section titles for that chapter to gain a rough idea of what concepts you will be reading about. This will mentally prepare you to read the material and understand how the concepts fit together.For example, a chapter on mitosis might have sections for interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis.
 Many biology books will have a chapter summary or a page listing key terms at the end of the chapter. These pages summarize biological concepts discussed in the chapter. Read over this material to have an idea of what the main points of the chapter will be.
 Once you have read your section titles and settled into your quiet space, itâ€™s time to get to work. Start reading the first section of the chapter. Read at your own pace and make sure that you are understanding each section before moving forward.Sometimes, it is a good idea to commit to reading one section at a time instead of reading the whole chapter at once.
Re-read sections as needed.
 Much of biology is better explained with visuals. Instead of skipping over charts and images, take the time to look at them. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and in biology, this is often true.


One of the most popular images in biology is the diagram of a cell. This shows the major structures and functions of the cell.
You might also encounter a chart depicting the Krebs Cycle.

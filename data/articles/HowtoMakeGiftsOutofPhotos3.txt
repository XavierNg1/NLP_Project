 The size will depend on how big you want your puzzle to be. You may choose a medium size, 8 by 10 inch (20.3 by 25.4 cm) puzzle, or a large 20 by 30 inch (50.8 by 76.2 cm) puzzle.
 Press your photograph onto the cardboard.
 Use a straight edge to ensure you do not cut into the photograph.
 Allow it to dry between coats. This will protect your puzzle through many uses.
 Try to create pieces of approximately the same size, but different shape.


If you want the puzzle to look like a traditional puzzle, trace the pieces from an already completed puzzle of the same size onto the back of your cardboard. Cut out the pieces carefully with an X-acto knife. This method will take longer than cutting the pieces freehand.
 You can use a gift box or reuse an old puzzle box. Place the pieces inside the box and wrap your gift.

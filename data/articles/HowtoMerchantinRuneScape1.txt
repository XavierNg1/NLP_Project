 Rare items such as party hats, Halloween masks and Santa hats have appeal because they are only available in a finite quantity. These items disappear every day as more players lose them and retire from playing.;
, New items are good for short-term trades because finding a true price on the Grand Exchange (GE) takes a while. Also, merchants can easily sell new items at a premium to players who want to have the latest thing.
 If merchants are working together to drive up the price of an item, don't buy in unless the items has skilling value or value as a weapon or armor. Only trade speculative items for the short term, because many people will jump in and drive up profits, but the price fall when everyone sells will be precipitous.

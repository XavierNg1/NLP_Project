 A shoe box might be a little too big, but those cardboard boxes that snacks and granola bars would be perfect. You can also use a small, wooden box instead., You can choose any types of books you want, but it might be a good idea to use books that you might find on your shelf. For example, if you have a lot of new books, a set of dusty, leather-bound books might look out of place.


You can also stack some of your own books together, then photocopy their spines.
 Measure your box first and write that number down. Open up your picture in an image-editing program. Change the canvas size until the width matches up with the number you wrote down.
 Try to get good-quality print out. You can use plain, old printer paper for this.
 Find a sheet of thin cardboardâ€”an old cereal box would work great for this. Next, cover the cardboard with a thin layer of glue. It might be a good idea to paint the glue on with a paintbrush. If you use too much glue, your paper will get soggy.


If you are using a cereal box, cut out the front or back first, then put the glue on the cardboard side. The image size will be on the back from now on.
 Use your fingers or the edge of a ruler to smooth it out. Wait for the glue to dry before you move on., The picture you printed out will probably have a white background, or the background of a bookshelf. For this project, you want just the spines and no background. Use a pair of scissors to cut your image out of the cardboard. Follow the top edges of the spines as best as your can.If you are very careful, you can also use a craft knife. Be sure to work on top of a cutting mat, and to cut away from yourself.
 Cover the side of your box with a thin layer of glue first. Next, place the cardboard cutout on top of the glue. Make sure that bottom and side edges of your cardboard cutout match up with the bottom and side edges of your box., This cubby not only acts as a storage for your secret candy stash, but it also doubles-up as a nifty bookend!

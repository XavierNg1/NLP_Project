 Children model what they see and hear from others, so take a look at your own language. Clean up your language when your toddler is around, and encourage family members and friends to do the same. Save your adult TV shows and movies for a time when your child isn’t around—if they hear a character swear they are likely to repeat it because they know it will get your attention.Some family members or friends might think it’s cute that your toddler swears and may egg him on. Doing so just reinforces the bad behavior and teaches the child that he can get a big reaction with a bad word.
 If your child has friends who swear and he picks up the language from them on a regular basis, consider talking to the other child’s parents to see if they can encourage their child to use nice words around your toddler.
 If your toddler attends daycare, let his teacher know of your family rules about swearing and how you hope to handle the situation. Create an open relationship with the daycare instructor so she can tell you if your child swears.


If it happens repeatedly while you aren’t around, reiterate the swearing rules and remind your child of nice words he can say instead. You can also give the daycare instructor permission to take away privileges for swearing.

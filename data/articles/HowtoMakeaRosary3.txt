 Form a circle of beads by tying the two ends together after the first and last knot. You now have a circle of five decades with two string tails hanging loose.


If your beads are large enough to slip over both tails, you may keep both strings intact.
If your beads are too small to slip over both tails, trim the shorter tail with a pair of scissors. Use a dab of clear nail polish or glue to keep the last knot secure as you continue.
 Tie a knot directly after it.
 Tie another knot to keep these beads in place.
 Secure it tightly by adding a double knot after you've strung it on the rosary. Use more clear nail polish or adhesive to make sure the knot stays in place. Clip the loose thread hanging off the knot.
 It is customary to have a priest bless the rosary before you use it to pray. Take the rosary to your parish and ask the priest to say a blessing, then use the rosary or give it away.

 By brushing your cat’s teeth on a regular basis, such as once per week, you can avoid expensive medical bills down the road. You will need a cat toothbrush and toothpaste, which you can find at your local pet store. Ask your veterinarian about the best brands and an appropriate routine., Clumping kitty litter is more expensive than regular kitty litter. It is more expensive because it lasts longer and helps control odor. If you scoop out the dirty litter on a regular basis rather than changing all of the litter at once, the clumping kitty litter will save you money.If you prefer to change all of the kitty litter at once, you will end up spending much more on the clumping variety. In this case, you should purchase the non-clumping variety., Instead of going to the boutique pet store, try shopping for cat toys at your local dollar store. Your cat won’t know the difference.
 Instead of buying expensive toys, sew some catnip mice and make little cat houses. However, always check to make sure there are no sharp objects or joking hazards on the homemade toys.


If you are not a confident craftsperson, you should avoid making homemade toys. They could be a hazard to your cat.
Use some old fabric, needle, thread and some catnip to make your own catnip mouse.Let your cat play with leftover book boxes, paper bags and other stuff in the house. Often, they will prefer to play with random boxes than the toys you buy for them.

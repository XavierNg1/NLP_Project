 If your chin is tilted down slightly, your upturned nose will be much less obvious, and people will not be able to see inside your nostrils.Tilting your chin down can also be an effective way of turning the focus onto your eyes and can help make your face look more slender as well.


Practice your head tilt in the mirror. You want to make this head tilt look natural, and not forced. If you practice while looking in the mirror, you can find an angle at which to hold your head that minimizes the appearance of your nose and still looks comfortable.
 Smiling widely will make your nose appear wider, and your nostrils appear wider as well. Controlling your smile can be an especially useful trick for when you wish to draw attention away from your upturned nose in photos.


Maintain white teeth. If your teeth are healthy and pearly white, they will receive more attention than your upturned nose. This will also enhance your smile, drawing more focus to your mouth.
 Because people with upturned noses have visible nostrils, they are more noticeable when they flare. Try to prevent flaring your nostrils to reduce the appearance of your upturned nose.

 Keep a journal where you write down how much time you spend on every activity in your daily life. If you keep track of your time for a full week, you can pinpoint activities that dominate your daily routine., Once you’ve determined what types of activities you typically spend time on, sort them into larger categories.


For example, you can have categories for academic, recreational, work, or social activities.
 Once you’ve sorted your activities into groups you need to determine what categories need to take priority in your life. Managing time is all about balance, so dedicate more time in your life for activities that are most important for achieving your goals.If you need to work to pay your rent and want to maintain a high GPA, you should prioritize spending more time on these sorts of activities.

 For example, replace sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) by sqrt(12).


The above identity, sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab) is valid for non negative radicands. Don't apply it if a and b are negative as then you would falsely assert that sqrt(-1)*sqrt(-1) = sqrt(1). The left-hand side -1 by definition (or undefined if you refuse to acknowledge complex numbers) while the right side is +1. If a and/or b is negative, first "fix" its sign by sqrt(-5) = i*sqrt(5). If the radicand is a variable expression whose sign is not known from context and could be either positive or negative, then just leave it alone for now. You could use the more general identity, sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(sgn(a))*sqrt(sgn(b))*sqrt(|ab|) which is valid for all real numbers a and b, but it's usually not worth the added complexity of introducing the sign function.
This identity only applies if the radicals have the same index. You can multiply more general radicals like sqrt(5)*cbrt(7) by first expressing them with a common index. To do this, temporarily convert the roots to fractional exponents: sqrt(5)*cbrt(7) = 5^(1/2) * 7^(1/3) = 5^(3/6) * 7^(2/6) = 125^(1/6) * 49^(1/6). Then apply the product rule to equate this product to the sixth root of 6125.

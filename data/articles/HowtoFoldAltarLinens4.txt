 Spread the cloth out so that lies right-side up in front of you.


Use your hands to smooth out as many wrinkles as possible. If you allow any of the wrinkles or folds to remain, you could end up creating a large crease where one should not be.
Large linens are rolled, not folded. You will roll the linen up so that it faces inside-out when viewed on the roll.
 Place an appropriately sized cardboard roller on one end of the linen. Roll the linen around the cardboard, and continue on until all of the material is on the roll.


You will need to hold the cloth with a bit of tension as you roll it up. Otherwise, wrinkles are more likely to form.
Keep the hems straight and square with each other so that the linen rolls up evenly.
 Protect the linen by wrapping the roll with tissue paper.


It is also recommended that you label the tissue paper with "Fair Linen," "Credence," or another appropriate name. Doing so will make it easier to identify the linen later.
After completing this step, you can place the linen in storage.

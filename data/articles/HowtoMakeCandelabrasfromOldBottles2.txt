 Make sure after evaluating the space, design and display you are armed with enough bottles. Create a mock candelabra with the bottles by simply arranging them to see if what you have is the desired look.
 Check your workspace for a glass cutter, hammer, electric drill and possibly an electric saw (unless you can purchase pre-cut wood). You will also need sandpaper.
 If possible, pre-measure for size and bring the measurements to the hardware store so they can cut them for you.
, You can decorate the bottom of the bottles with beads or jewels for an added, original touch.

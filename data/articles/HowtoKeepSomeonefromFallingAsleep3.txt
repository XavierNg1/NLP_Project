 Is her goal to stay up for 24 hours? For 48 hours? Studies show that writing down goals improves achievement of the goal., Research shows that when people break their goals down into smaller chunks, they complete the goals more quickly and accurately.Help your friend look at this challenge as an hourly goal or break it down even further, to minutes. Goals might be: Stay awake for one more hour, until 2am. When that goal has been reached, the next goal might be the same: Stay awake for one more hour, until 3am. Staying awake for one more hour (or 15 or 30 minutes) seems more manageable and easier to accomplish than staying awake for 24 or 12 hours.
 Often times, repeating a mantra can help focus the mind on something other than the difficult experience at hand. Good mantras are short, encouraging, and rhythmic.


Make up a mantra.
Use someone else’s mantra and repeat it. Try out, “Feeling strong, feeling good," or, “Looking good, feeling good, oughta be in Hollywood.”

: “Walk/Work your talk!” with integrity -- and in doing that, earn the right to have responsibility for others' success. True authority is born from respect for the purpose, good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads them to opportunity for success.;
, People will respond more openly to a person of passion and dedication -- but by not complaining against the student and never demeaning the work... Leaders need to be able to be a "source of inspiration", and be a motivator getting the work into gear towards the required action or cause. It is impossible to make a student do anything -- but inspire and coach the techniques: "Do it this way!" -- and "Right. That's it!"

, Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader and follower are different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team working towards the goal. This kind of leader will not be afraid to work.
 People look to the leader during times of uncertainty and unfamiliarity to find reassurance and security.
 Storms, emotions, and crises come and go and a good leader takes these as part of the journey and keeps a cool head. In turn, students learn to follow suit.
 So then, the goal is in view – a good leader views the situation as a whole, and also in part:


Always be breaking the course down into manageable steps and making progress towards each part and the finish line. The course changes each day. It is not one race, but many sprints.
 A good leader is committed to excellence. Second best does not lead to the best success. The good leader not only maintains high standards, but is proactive to advance the goal forward in order to achieve excellence in all areas.

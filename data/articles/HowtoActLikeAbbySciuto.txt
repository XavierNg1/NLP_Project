 Abby is a goth. If you do not want to be a goth that is fine, Abby is all about being who you are. If, however, you choose to wear a few goth items, try black nail polish, neck chokers, black or dark clothes, platforms or those bracket chokers that she is always wearing.;
, Abby is a very bubbly, true to herself person. DiNozzo described Abby as being the 'happiest goth you'll ever meet'. Don't let people put you down because you're different. Be yourself. Nobody can tell you you're doing that wrong!!

, Abby is a very smart person. Listen in class, be good with computers and forensic science.
 Although Abby is a goth, she still goes to church and bowls with nuns! Whatever your religion is, then worship at your church/temple/cathedral.
 Happy is mentioned a lot because Abby is very happy.
 She decorates her lab for Christmas and has a Santa tracker on her computer

,, This may make you hyper but Abby is extremely hyper anyway so this may help.
 Abby listens to music composed by Dominic Kelly, who has a good album out called 'Gothtronica'. She also listens to a few tracks by the band who performed NCIS' main theme tune, Numeriklab.

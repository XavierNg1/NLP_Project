 Use the circle to trace a second one, and cut it out as well. Plan on making the circles about 2 inches (5 centimeters) across. They do not have to be perfect, but they need to match up.The color of the felt does not matter, but it would be best if it matches your ric rac. This way, if you get any gaps, they won't be as obvious.
 Make sure that the outer loops stick out over the edge of the circle, and the inner loops are inside the circle.Set the other circle aside for now., Use a needle and thread to secure the bottom loops to the felt circle.If you don't know how to sew, or if you don't have any needles or thread on hand, you can use tiny drops of hot glue instead.

If you want to make a dahlia-type flower, gather the ric rac as you sew it., Let the outer loops overlap the inner loops of the first row. Again, stitch the bottom loops in place. Don't stitch the outer loops. This will allow them to flare out and look like petals., Make sure that each row overlaps the previous one slightly. As you get towards the center, the ric rac may start to buckle, which is fine. Many flowers get fuller and bushier towards the center!, When you get to the center, cut off the excess ric rac with a pair of fabric scissors. Stitch it down using 2 to 3 stitches, then tie the knot on the back., You can use a button for a rustic look, or a pretty rhinestone for something fancier. Make sure that it is big enough to cover any visible felt.

If you are using a button, consider sewing on instead. This will give you a nice, rustic-chic look., This will cover up the stitching and give your flower extra support. If you wish to use these flowers as hair clips, cut a slit in the second felt circle. Open and slide a hair clip through it. Hot glue the circle and the top of the clip to the back of the flower.

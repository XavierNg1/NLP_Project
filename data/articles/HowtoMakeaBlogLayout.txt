 68% of internet users have a screen resolution of either 1024x768, 1280x800, or 1280x1024, so obviously people are using larger monitors. You can take advantage of larger screen resolutions by using a center layout. Just design an adjustable layout so your blog is viewable on smaller screen resolutions. Visitors hate to scroll horizontally.;
, Pick either a two column or three column layout. Make sure your content column isn't too wide. Thinner content columns make for easier reading.
 Tests show the best column for the blog post content is in the center. Visitors look for menu items and other action items in the left and right columns.
 Examples: Social bookmarks, forms, blogrolls, categories, etc.

 Create a website for your personal or professional brand using a domain name. This way you will have control of what is attached to your name.Research competitor’s websites (such as other businesses in your field or other personal websites in your profession) for inspiration., Be active on social media by commenting on other people’s posts and responding to comments on your own posts. This will help you build connections and get your account well known. Replying to people personally and showing interest in what others have to say appeals to follower’s emotions and shows people that you are human outside of the screen., Make sure your photos are high quality images and that your posts are interesting, engaging, and worthy of being posted. Post your own content. Never steal content from others. Make sure most of your social media content is your own and not entirely reposts from other accounts.Post when people are awake and spread your posts throughout the day.
 Using hashtags can make your posts easily searchable and help you grow your audience. Use hashtags on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr to help more people find your accounts. Be careful to not use too many hashtags. Adding a dozen hashtags to the end of all your posts is going to look unprofessional, desperate, and annoy your followers.For example: “I had a great day today at the #Portland5K with the team. We really enjoyed a break from the rain. #runnerslife #adrenalinerush”

, To increase activity and followers, give something away on your social media. Make the giveaway to your followers only so people will follow you. This giveaway does not have to be huge. It can be as simple as a discount code, free trial, book, shirt, or following an account back.For example: “Giving away a signed copy of my book to one of my followers later this afternoon! Retweet to enter to win.”

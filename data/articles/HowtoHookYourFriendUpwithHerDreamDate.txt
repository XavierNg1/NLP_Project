 Even if it's just for a few split seconds. It'll put a guy in a little pickle if he's asked if he likes a girl he doesn't even know. Try this: when your friend isn't looking, knock one of her books off of her desk. Right in front of the guy, then step away quickly. If he isn't a jerk, he'll pick it up. Now he'll know who you're talking about when you ask if he likes your friend.;
, If you stalk him, showering him with questions, he'll probably be a little freaked out. This is a turn-off. At lunch go sit at his table if you're friends with one of his. Then ask him, if he doesn't reply, give him time. And ask the next week.
 He might be a little embarrassed if he's asked in front of his friends, they might laugh at him or something. But when you ask to see him in private, make sure you sound casual. Otherwise he'll think that YOU like him.
 Most guys will say, "I don't know." "Maybe." "I gotta think about it." Don't press him to much just try to get a definite answer.
 If he says yes, then don't tell everyone at school. That's is a humongous turn-off.
 That is if she knows you're trying to set the two of them up. If she doesn't, don't say anything.
 Even if she doesn't know you were setting them up. Make sure she goes and talks to him, and they arrange the date. Humbly take the million thank-yous she gives you.

 A nestling is a baby bird with no feathers and they won’t survive for long out of the nest. You should put the nestling back in its nest as soon as possible. A fledgling is a baby bird with feathers and it’s very common for them to be found hopping on the ground as they’re just learning to fly and forage for food.;
, Although it’s normal to feel worried for a fledgling hopping about on the ground, the fledgling might not actually need any help at all. If there are some cats or dogs about, all you have to do is place the fledgling back in a tree and remember to keep your dogs and cats inside your house if the fledgling is in your back garden.


If the fledgling is injured, you should immediately take action and call a wildlife rehabilitator.
 Dangerous birds are normally meat eaters and usually have sharp beaks and claws such as hawks or owls. Instead call a wildlife rehabilitator; they are trained to handle birds of prey.
 You will need a bucket with holes in the bottom, a stick that can fit in the bucket, some string, some dirt or leaf litter and a cardboard box with air holes in it.
 Once you’ve set up the bucket, you should also bring along your box.
 Whilst holding the bird with the towel put it in the box making sure it doesn’t escape.
 The bucket should be secured at least 2m of the ground and near the site of where the fledgling was found.


Use a ladder if you need to, never climb the tree.
 Make sure that there is no thick cover over the bucket, this is to allow the bird to get out and the parents to help it.
 If the parents do not return call a wildlife rehabilitator.
 The last thing you want to do is litter. It’s also handy to record the date, incident, treatment and description of the bird for reference.

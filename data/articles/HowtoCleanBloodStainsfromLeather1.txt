 The faster you react to a blood stain on leather, the more likely it is that the stain will be removed. As soon as the stain happens, dab the blood with a clean, dry cloth. This will help to remove some of the blood and will prevent it from seeping further into the pores of the leather.;
, Before cleaning a blood stain from leather, you should test the cleaning agent on the leather fabric. Choose a section of the material that is not visible and place a few drops of the cleaning agent onto the fabric. For example, test the bottom of a handbag, the heel of a shoe, or the back of a sofa., You should wait approximately five minutes to see if the cleaning agent stained the fabric. If you notice any discolouration, or if the leather begins to crack, you should not proceed with cleaning the larger stain.

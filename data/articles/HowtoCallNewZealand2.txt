 Some VoIP services, or voice over internet protocol, allow you to make international calls without including your country's exit code. Try entering the number as described above but without dialing the exit code.
 Your phone plan may block international calls. If no international phone calls are going through, you may need to call your company and alter your plan details.


Keep in mind that international calls are usually more expensive than local or in-country calls. If you plan to make international calls frequently, you may wish to choose a plan that has a reduced international price rate.
 Toll free numbers in New Zealand begin with 508 or 800 (0508 or 0800 if dialing within New Zealand). Because these calls are not actually free for international customers, many companies block international calls on their toll free numbers.Try contacting the company by email, or see if you can find a regular number for them that does not begin with a toll-free code.

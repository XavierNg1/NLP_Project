 While primers aren’t necessary for everyone, if you are battling acne, they will go a long way in smoothing your skin. So if your skin is bumpy and broken out, or even dry from acne cleansers, this will help your overall appearance as you apply makeup. , A good concealer will blend your acne spots with the rest of your face so it is much less noticeable. This will prepare your face for the rest of the makeup regimen. . Use a concealer brush rather than your fingers.
Twist the brush over the pimple to get the concealer into all the nooks and crannies!
Apply the concealer slightly past the pimple to blend it with the rest of your skin.
 Choose something that is not oil based, and is as light as possible while still being affective. This will help protect your skin from future breakouts. Heavy foundations also cake onto your skin and can actually make acne more noticeable. Again, don’t apply with your fingers; use a sponge instead. , Use a fine face powder to lightly dust your face. This allows all the work you just did to stay in place for the whole day! Apply with a large powder brush.

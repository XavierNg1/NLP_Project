 If anyone had a basic knowledge of hacking, they can access your WiFi network and harm any connected devices. Your devices can have important data wiped, passwords and personal information stolen, and more., WEP can be easily hacked into, so ensure it is a WPA or WPA2 encryption. Do not use a weak password, such as your pet's name. Ensure it is a secure password., Even with a password, hackers with advanced skills can still hack your network if they have the name of your network, so it is therefore a good idea to keep it private., If you are worried that guests may still be able to access your WiFi, you can set up a separate network for any visitors so they cannot access your main network.

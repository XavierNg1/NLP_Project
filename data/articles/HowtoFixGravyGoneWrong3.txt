 If the flavor of your gravy is a little underwhelming, add a little salt. Take some table salt and sprinkle it onto the gravy. Repeat until the gravy is to your taste. Be sure to taste the gravy as you add the salt so that you do not make it too salty.Too much salt can easily overwhelm the other flavors on your plate.
 You can also add a small amount of sherry, port, or Madeira to bring out the flavors of the gravy. Give small splashes of wine, tasting it after each addition, to avoid adding too much alcohol. Combine a small amount of fortified wine with some salt for the best results., You can also add more stock or bouillon if available. This will enhance the meaty flavor of the gravy. Make sure that you use the correct bouillon or stock. Your beef gravy will taste different with chicken stock added to it.


If you are less discerning about pairing meat and gravy, you can get away with using chicken stock for turkey gravy and vice versa.
 Depending on the type of gravy, you might also add some more seasonings. Black pepper can add an extra bit of flavor to any type of gravy. If you are making a beef gravy, add marjoram, bay leaf, sage, and thyme. For chicken and turkey gravy, add a little oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, and pepper. For pork, use garlic and onions with small amounts of oregano and sage.

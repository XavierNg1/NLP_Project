 Go through the traditional steps, but cut out the ball bounce: Scoop up jacks and grab the ball before it bounces.
 Allow the ball to bounce twice before you grab it.
 Before each pick up of the jacks, clap your hands. 







, Use the other hand than the one you would normally throw with.
 You must go from "onesies" to "tensies" without making a mistake. If you do, you have to start over at "onesies" at your next turn.
 After you throw the ball, make a circle in the air around it with your hand before it bounces.
 Try using a wooden ball, like earlier forms of the game did, or a set of small, similar-sized stones instead of metal jacks.

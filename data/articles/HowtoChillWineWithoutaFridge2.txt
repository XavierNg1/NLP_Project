 A large metallic mixing bowl or a metallic bucket are good choices.
 It can be cold tap water at a pinch but less likely to chill


If out at a picnic or camping, use river or stream water to cool the bottle–– see cooling beers without a fridge for the river/stream method.
 Then let it sit for 5. After a while, check if the bottle is cold. If not, let it sit there for 5 minutes more.


Note that this method may not work for your wine. It does require quite cold water and a good wait for the bottle to cool down. However, provided you keep checking that the water is very cold, and you use metal to conduct the cold, good results can be had.

 The most straightforward and often most effective way to insulate a keg is by buying a specialized "keg cozy." These insulated jackets are usually made from neoprene and are similar to smaller can cozies designed to insulate aluminum cans from the warmth of your hand.


Keg cozies can be purchased from some home brewing supply stores and from specialty manufacturers. Searching the Internet for suppliers is the best way to locate and purchase a keg cozy.
Make sure that you buy the right size for your keg. Keg sizes are not standardized, but common sizes include the "half barrel" with a volume of 15.5 gallons (59 L) and the "quarter barrel" (pony keg) with a 7.75 gallon (29 L) capacity.;
, After thoroughly chilling the keg using either a refrigerator or an ice bath, you can position the insulating keg cozy around it. Usually this is done by wrapping the cozy around the sides of the keg and zipping it up to keep it in place.
 Keg cozies will only keep the beer chilled to the appropriate serving temperature for about 4 - 6 hours. For this reason, you should plan to serve the beer from your keg as soon after insulating it and removing it from a chilled setting as possible.

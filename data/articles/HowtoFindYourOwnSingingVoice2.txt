 Your vocal cords are muscles that need time to warm up so they don't get overstrained. Start by singing scales slowly for about 10 or 15 minutes. When your vocal cords feel warmed up and ready to go, you can launch into singing your practice songs.
 Choose songs that easily falls into your range, so you'll give yourself the best chance of singing well and finding the great singing voice that's been hiding within you for all this time.


Sing along with the recordings of the songs you pick until you feel comfortable with the songs.
Practice singing the songs without the recording. You can play the instrumental part, but don't play the vocals.
Try songs in a range of genres. You might love hip hop best, but you could discover that you're better at singing jazz or country songs. Give all types of music a chance.
 Use a tape recorder or another recording device to record yourself singing after you've warmed up and practiced. Take note of things you might need to work on as well as what sounded good.
 Sometimes it's difficult to tell where we need improvement without feedback from others. Sing for your family members or friends, and ask them for honest reactions to your voice.


Remember to warm up before performing.
Sing in a big, open room with high ceilings; your voice will sound better than it would in a low-ceilinged room with carpet.
After you've gotten some feedback, take it to heart next time you practice singing.
Karaoke clubs are a great place to practice singing in front of other people.

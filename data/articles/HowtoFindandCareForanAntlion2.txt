 Antlions don’t like people, so avoid well-trodden areas. Instead, try to find relatively secluded areas to find antlions.Find secluded sandy areas. Antlions will not be found in the middle of a busy beach or playground.
Look for cone-shaped pits. They should look like hollow cone with a hole in the middle like a funnel. This is a clear sign of nearby antlions.
Antlions can live in many other kinds of substrates. Check out other areas with a lot of dirt if you don't have any sandy areas nearby.
 You may have to try multiple times to make sure you find a living antlion larva.


Use the scoop near the antlion pit. They may not be in the pit at the time, so you may need to try around the pit as well.
Carefully sift out the sand. Make sure you don't hurt the antlion by being too rough with the sifter.
Continue using the sifter in the area until you find the antlion. Stay attentive, since the antlion is the same color as its sandy environment.
 Make sure it’s secure and safe, so you can get it home.


Bring a small cup or other container. Fill it with sand from the area where you found the antlion. Keep your antlion habitat along with your antlion inside a dark area. These habitats may be the best designed for your antlion.
Don’t worry if the antlion is on its back and playing dead. In a few moments, it will get up and try to bury itself again. Once you get the antlion back to your home, put it in its environment. Let the insect get used to its new home for at least 24 hours.
Be careful when opening the package when it arrives. You don't want to injure the antlion.
Once the antlion is out of the box, make sure to have its habitat prepared and ready. The antlion will need time to adjust after being shipped.

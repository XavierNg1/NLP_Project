 There are the more popular ones (rock, country, rap, etc) and then you have the genres such as metal and "screamo" that tend to send most people in the other direction. Make a list of each genre.;
, Sure, you have "punk", but there's also pop-punk, crust punk, ska punk, etc.
 Even if you don't like it right away, give it some time and try multiple bands from each genre. If poppy country isn't your thing, try older country such as Dough Stone or George Jones. Don't like a bunch of deep growls you can't seem to understand? Try a band like Bring Me The Horizon. Their songs Don't Go, Drown, and Deathbeds are softer and easier to understand but are still within the genre.
 Start in the opposite of what you mostly listen to. You may like songs about partying, but some christian rock songs could find a way into your iPod. Don't turn something down without trying it first.
 Your friends are a good example. They may have a better idea of what you like, and probably know more knew bands than your grandparents.
 Even if the older members don't like the new bands, they probably know some really good oldies you may like. Keep an open mind.
 If you find something you are even vaguely interested in, type some of the lyrics into a search engine to find the song.
 Don't be afraid to ask them about the band and their music taste.
 Venues don't usually limit the bands that play there. Look into any band you don't know.
 There will usually be "related artist" section somewhere. You can also use Wikipedia.
 They will have common elements in their music and/or writing.
 Start out listening to your favourite songs, and look in the related videos for ones you don't know. You could also search for song themes you're interested in ("songs about ___").

 If they are the same number, then you're dealing with fractions that have the same denominator. If not, skip to the section down below.;
, By the last step, you should understand how they were added together.

Ex. 1: 1/4 + 2/4







Ex. 2: 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8







, The numerator is the number on top of the fraction. However many fractions you have, if they have the same bottom numbers, add up all the top numbers.


Ex. 1: 1/4 + 2/4 is our equation. "1" and "2" are the numerators. That means 1 + 2 = 3.







Ex. 2: 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8 is our equation. "3" and "2" and "4" are the numerators. That means 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.
 Take the sum of the numerators you got in Step 2; that sum will be your new numerator. Take the denominator that was the same for each fraction. Don't do anything to it. This is your new denominator; it will always be the same as the old denominator when you add fractions with the same denominators.


Ex. 1: 3 is our new numerator, and 4 is our new denominator. This gives us an answer of 3/4. 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.







Ex. 2: 9 is our new numerator, and 8 is our new denominator. This gives us an answer of 9/8. 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8 = 9/8.
 Simplify the new fraction to make sure it's written as simply as possible.

If the numerator is bigger than the denominator, like it is in Ex. 2, that means we can take out at least one whole number. Divide the top number by the bottom number. When we divide 9 by 8, we get 1 whole number and a remainder of 1. Put the whole number out in front of the fraction and the remainder in the numerator of the new fraction, leaving the denominator the same.
9/8 = 1 1/8.
 If the denominators are different numbers, then you're dealing with unlike denominators. You're going to have to find a way to make the unlike denominators be the same. This guide will help you do that.
 By the last step, you should understand how they were added together.

Ex. 3: 1/3 + 3/5







Ex. 4: 2/7 + 2/14







, Do this by finding a "multiple" of the two denominators. An easy way to find one is to simply multiply the two denominators together. If one of the numbers multiplies into the other numbers, you may only need to multiply one of the fractions.


Ex. 3: 3 x 5 = 15. Both of our fractions will have a denominator of 15.







Ex. 4: 14 is a multiple of 7. So all we have to do is multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Both of our fractions will have a denominator of 14.
 We're not changing the value of the fraction; we're just changing how the fraction looks. It's still the same fraction.


Ex. 3: 1/3 x 5/5 = 5/15.







Ex. 4: For this fraction, we only have to multiply the first fraction by 2, because that's what gives us our common denominator.





2/7 x 2/2 = 4/14.
 Again, we're not changing the value of the fraction; we're just changing how the fraction looks. It's still the same fraction.


Ex. 3: 3/5 x 3/3 = 9/15.







Ex. 4: We don't need to multiply the second fraction because both fractions already have their common denominators.
 We haven't added them yet, but that will come soon! What we've done is multiple each fraction by the number 1. Our goal here was to get the denominators to look exactly the same.


Ex. 3: instead of 1/3 + 3/5, we have 5/15 + 9/15







Ex. 4: instead of 2/7 + 2/14, we have 4/14 + 2/14







, The numerator is the top number of the fraction.


Ex. 3: 5 + 9 = 14. 14 will be our new numerator.







Ex. 4: 4 + 2 = 6. 6 will be our new numerator.
 Or, just keep the denominator that's on the changed fractions already — it's the same number.


Ex. 3: 15 will be our new denominator.







Ex. 4: 14 will be our new denominator.



Ex. 3: 14/15 is our answer to 1/3 + 3/5 = ?







Ex. 4: 6/14 is our answer to 2/7 + 2/14 = ?







, Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator in the fraction by each number's greatest common factor.


Ex. 3: 14/15 cannot be simplified.







Ex. 4: 6/14 can be reduced to 3/7 by dividing both the top and the bottom numbers by 2, the greatest common factor.

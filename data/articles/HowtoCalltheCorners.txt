 Why are you calling corners? Focus on your intent and allow yourself to enter the proper mindset for magical workings.;
, You can change tools to what you have on hand, remove them, add them, or use none at all. You should have one symbolic tool or item for each corner/direction/element, some candles and a compass for knowing which direction you should be facing. Here are some suggestions for corner correspondences:


East/Air- feathers, incense, dried lavender, citrine, white quartz, athame
South/Fire- a red candle, volcanic rock, heated stones, ruby, gold, brass
West/Water- a jar of seawater, shells, mirrors, silver, chalice, pearls
North/Earth- soil, fresh herbs, oats, salt, clay figures, wooden tools

, There should be no negative energies, you should be in a comfortable mood and physical condition and it should be clean. Make sure you have enough space to walk around in a circle and that anything flammable is kept well away.
 Place each object you have chosen for each corner in that area of the circle.
 Take a few deep breaths.
 You can focus your attention on the object you chose, or hold it in your hands. Repeat this step for all four corners. Your own blessing/call can be different, such as calling upon specific deities or changing the words. You should say this in a confident voice.
 You can now continue with your chosen ritual or spell.

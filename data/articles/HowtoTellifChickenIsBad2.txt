 If there is a thick layer of ice around your chicken then it is no longer good. The ice crust will be thick like the ice on a freezer hasn’t been thawed in a while. A flash-frozen chicken will not have a thick crust if done properly. If the ice is white it could be a issue with freezer burn., Freezer burn looks like a white rash or mark on the chicken that isn’t fat. It is rougher than the skin around it and raised slightly.

While it won’t hurt you it will make your chicken less enjoyable.
 A frozen chicken is harder to check for color. It will be off color, similar to the raw or cooked chicken, a slight grey or yellowing of fat. If it is darker than grey, that chicken belongs in the trash bin.

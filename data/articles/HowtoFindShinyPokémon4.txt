 There is a very small chance that the Pokémon you pick will be Shiny. Save right before picking or starting the battle., If the Pokémon is not Shiny, restart your game.

This will not work on Legendaries in Pokémon X or Y.
 This is a long and very time consuming process. Some people have reported it taking over 1000 tries. If you keep trying, however, you may be able to get a Shiny starter or Legendary.

If the Legendary fight is one where the Pokémon will automatically run, it will still be Shiny when you meet it later.

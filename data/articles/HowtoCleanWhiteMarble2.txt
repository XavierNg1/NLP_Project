 Rip up a couple sheets of paper towels and place them in a bowl. Note that the amount of paper towel you use depends on the size of the stain you’re trying to remove. Pour a few drops of ammonia in the bowl, and enough hydrogen peroxide to completely soak the paper towel chunks.


When handling ammonia, you should wear gloves to avoid skin irritation and burns.
If the stain you’re trying to remove is quite large, you may want to fold up a paper towel instead.
Attempt this method if you’re dealing with old or tenacious stains that can’t be removed with more conventional means., Pick the saturated chunks out of the bowl and place them over the stain. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, or the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia might leak out over your marble. If you’re dealing with a vertical surface, the paper towel chunks should be wet enough to just stick on., Stretch a length of plastic wrap over the poultice and stain. Apply pressure to its sides, so that it completely seals the poultice, then use clear adhesive tape to secure the plastic wrap.


Use a toothpick to poke a couple of holes in the plastic wrap to allow airflow.Let the poultice sit for two to three days.
 You should be able to lift the plastic wrap easily with just your fingers. Pick the paper towel poultice off of your surface and throw the chunks away. Then, dampen a cloth with warm water and wipe the area clean.


After washing the marble, use a dry cloth or paper towel to dry the area.

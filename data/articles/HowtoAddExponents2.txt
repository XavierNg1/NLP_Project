 This key will likely look like yx{\displaystyle y^{x}} or EXP{\displaystyle EXP}, or it may look like an x{\displaystyle x} with a blank box as the exponent. If you do not have a scientific calculator, you cannot use this method.
 To do this, hit the base number (large number) first, then hit the exponent.

For example, if your problem is 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}}, you would hit the following sequence of keys to solve the first expression:3{\displaystyle 3}yx{\displaystyle y^{x}}4{\displaystyle 4}


, This will show you the value of the first exponential expression. You do not need to hit the equal key (={\displaystyle =}) after typing in the first exponential expression.

For example, after typing in the expression 34{\displaystyle 3^{4}}, you should hit the +{\displaystyle +} symbol to see a value of 81{\displaystyle 81}.
 To do this, hit the base number (large number) first, then hit the exponent.

For example, if your problem is 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}}, you would hit the following sequence of keys to solve the second expression:2{\displaystyle 2}yx{\displaystyle y^{x}}5{\displaystyle 5}


, This will show you the final sum of the two exponential expressions.

For example, after hitting the appropriate sequence of keys, 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}} adds up to 113{\displaystyle 113}.

 Washing off oil with oil may sound weird, but using oil as a cleanser is the best way to remove the oil that's already there. To make your own oil cleanser, mix these ingredients and store them in a jar:


2 parts castor oil
1 part extra virgin olive oil
A few drops of your favorite essential oil, like lavender or lemon

, Saturate a cotton ball or pour some of the oil mixture directly onto your hand. Rub the oil gently into your skin in a circular motion, concentrating on the areas that are the oiliest., Wet a washcloth with hot water. Gently apply it to your face, letting it steam your skin for about a minute. Use it to wipe away the oil, and with it the dirt, makeup and dead skin cells that were clogging your pores.
 Olive oil has the same pH as your skin's oil, so it's the perfect cleanser. However, all skin is unique, and some skin types respond well to different types of oil. Try the following options:


Coconut oil. Many people use this as both a moisturizer and a cleanser.
Tea tree oil. It's good to add a few drops of this if your skin is prone to acne, since it's a natural antibiotic.Flaxseed oil. This light oil is great for all skin types.

 You can help to prevent drain blockages by regularly flushing your drain. Sprinkle 2-4 Tbs. of baking soda down your drain. Follow this with hot water from your faucet, letting the hot water run for 2-3 minutes.Consider doing a baking soda flush once a month, or any time your drain seems slow.
 Another option for your monthly drain-flush is to use white vinegar. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar down the drain, and wait 30 minutes. Follow with hot water from your faucet, letting the water run for 2-3 minutes. White vinegar contains acetic acid, which is excellent at dissolving built up grime in your pipes.
 If you have experienced clogs in the past, or if it has been a long time since you've done a flush, you may want to do a deeper cleaning. For this you can combine 1/2 cup of salt with 1/2 cup of baking soda and pour this down the drain. Follow this with 1/2 cup of white vinegar, and wait several minutes for the mixture to foam. Then pour 2 quarts of water down the drain to rinse.

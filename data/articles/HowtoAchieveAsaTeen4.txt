 Learning is the only way to gain wisdom beyond your teenage years and achieve your goals at a young age. It’s not all about grades, though a good grade will show your peers, family, and teachers that you're hardworking. Instead, actually understanding each subject you study and how it fits into the real world should be your top priority. Try to find real world experiences for the things you learn in school.


If you find yourself interested in a subject you’re studying at school, don’t stop with preparing for a quiz or test on the topic. Keep reading, ask your teacher for an extra credit assignment, or do some online research.
The subject in class you find interesting today may lead to a great career choice in the future, so talk to your guidance counselor about job possibilities. For instance, if you really enjoy studying history, you may want to consider careers in archeology, law, or conservation. All of these fields use history every day., If you can easily get all of your work done, it may be time to find classes that can offer you more mental stimulation. Being challenged to push beyond your current ability is how you’ll become successful. Make sure to find a balance and make time for relaxation.


Don’t take too many classes. This can be overwhelming. Challenge yourself, but don’t sabotage your ability to learn well.
If you can’t take more advanced courses, ask your teacher for additional assignments or set your own goals to keep learning outside of the classroom., It’s easier than ever to do this with a world of news and information at your fingertips on your computer, tablet, or smart phone. You can also read the local newspaper, watch the news each morning or evening, or consider volunteering with a local political campaign. Gaining a better understanding of what’s happening around you will allow you to not only develop your own opinions, but it will also give you the ability to know how to make a difference.

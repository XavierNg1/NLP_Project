 Wear good clothing, especially in cold climates or places with thorny bushes. Bring water and check the weather before you go so that you'll be prepared for any bad weather. Bring a net to catch the mantis with, and bring a container to keep it in. This doesn't have to be the container it will live in permanently - anything small, portable, and with a lid will work.;
, Look around your house, making sure to check humid places and plants or other greenery. Look in places with lots of insects and bugs. Look carefully, as they are very good at camouflaging and can be colored green, yellow, brown, and even pink, depending on where you live.


Make sure not to step on or squish any praying mantises or other bugs you come across.
 Be sneaky and quick when attempting this, as they are quite fast. Use the net to catch the mantis, or put the container in front of it and try to edge it in, and firmly close the container as soon as the mantis is inside.
 Put one hand in front of the mantis and slowly coax it onto your hand. Move slowly and carefully so as not to scare the mantis, and keep it in your hand rather than letting it run up your arm. Once you're holding the mantis, put it gently into the container and close it.


Consider wearing gloves when handling a larger praying mantis, as their feet can hurt your hands and arms.
 If you can't find a praying mantis but still want one for a pet, you can simply buy one. Look online or at pet or garden supply stores near you.

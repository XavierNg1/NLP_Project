 It may be strange to see a cat on a leash, but it is great option for transporting your cat if you do not have a crate. Be sure to select the right size and type of harness and leash for your cat. With practice, time, and patience, even a nervous cat will learn to be comfortable in a harness and a leash., Begin by placing your cat in the harness indoors for ten-minute sessions each day, rewarding the cat with a treat for good behavior. Once the cat is accustomed to the harness, attach the leash.
 Eventually, with consistency and praise, the cat with get used to moving about on his or her own while wearing both the harness and the leash. At this time, begin picking up the leash and walking around the house with your cat for small intervals. Reward your cat with treats when he or she remains calm.
 Once your cat is confident walking around the house with you, it is time to head out to the great outdoors! Little by little, your cat will become more familiar with this routine and it will be a great method for transporting your cat.

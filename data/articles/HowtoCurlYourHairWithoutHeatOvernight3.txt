 It's usually easiest to start at the back of your head, but you can start anywhere you find comfortable.


If you have afro-textured hair, twist the hair for more exaggerated curls.
The cocoon method can be more difficult than the methods above. Give yourself plenty of time to learn it.
 Place your index and middle finger against the lock of hair, about an inch from your scalp.


Try to keep your nails facing away from your hair.
If you're right-handed, use your left hand. If you're left-handed, use your right hand.
 Wind until the ends of your hair are pointing straight upwards, then stop. You should now see a 'U' shape in your hair, almost like a loop without a top.
 Twist the strand of hair above the U-shaped loop, curling it around the hair that you left between your U and your scalp. Do this until you have about an inch (2.5 cm) of hair left.
 Using the two fingers secured in the loop, grab the end of the hair. Pull it through the loop, withdrawing your fingers. Keep hold of the hair, and do not pull it out all the way.









The main loop is now filled with hair. On one end, there's a dangling end of hair. On the other, there is a smaller hair loop. These are the ends of your hair, which will end up mostly straight.
 Keep holding the end of your hair, near the main loop. Use your other hand to push the hair on the other side toward the loop to tighten the knot. Don't let the end of the hair slip out too far, or the knot will come undone.
 Repeat until as much hair as you like is tied up into knots.
 In the morning, just tug the the little tail left sticking out of each knot.

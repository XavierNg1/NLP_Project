 Many times a cat owner first notices a skin problem because their cat is itching or licking areas of its body incessantly. If your cat is doing this, you should have a closer look at the area your cat is focusing on.Your cat may also be chewing on areas still covered in fur. Even though there is still fur present, this does not rule out a problem underneath with the cat's skin.
 Skin inflammation can usually be spotted when petting your cat or giving it a home health exam. Take the time to inspect your cat's whole body, in order to locate areas of concern. Inflamed areas of skin may have:Redness
Swelling of the skin
Loss of fur
Scabby, scaly, or flaky skin
Bumps on the skin

, If you have identified that your cat has an area of inflamed skin, you should then assess its severity and whether or not it gets worse. Watch for healing in the area over the course of several days to determine if the inflammation is simply a random and temporary irritation or not.


In order for any kind of irritation to heal, your cat needs to leave it alone. Consider putting a cone on your cat for a few days to see if the inflamed area clears up once it is no longer licked or gnawed at. If you don't, the cat can cause further problems by creating wounds or abrasions in the area of irritation.

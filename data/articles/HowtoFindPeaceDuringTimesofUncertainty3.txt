 Uncertain times can make you feel isolated and alone; however, you can choose to seek out the comfort or support of others to help you through. Friends, family, or trusted co-workers can serve as a listening ear or shoulder to cry on when life seems crazy.Ask for support when you need it. Say, "Mom, everything in my life seems to be going wrong. I could really use your problem-solving skills right now. Do you mind helping me out?"

, Ask God, Buddha, the universe, or whomever you believe in to take your anxious feelings away from you. Give your worries over to your higher power so that you are able to live in peace. Letting go of your need to be in control and putting trust in something else to take care of you may be just what you need to get through your time of uncertainty and feel that everything will work out., When you’re feeling lost, talking it out often helps. Seeking the help of a therapist allows you to understand the cause of your uncertainty, which may help you to stop the fear once and for all. The therapist may also suggest ways for you to cope when you’re feeling worried.


Be honest with your therapist. Tell your therapist that you are afraid of the uncertainty in your life and are fearful of what is to come. Holding back will hinder your recovery., When you’re struggling, sometimes the best medicine is to be around those who are going through the same experience. Figure out what is bothering you the most — whether it is anxiety, depression, or something else — then find a group that can help. You may find that joining a religious group is beneficial, as you can talk to others about what you are enduring, and find help through your religion or beliefs.

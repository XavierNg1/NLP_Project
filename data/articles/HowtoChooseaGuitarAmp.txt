It all depends what you prefer, many metal musicians prefer the harsh growling tones of a transistor amp, whereas a blues player may prefer the warmth and crispness of tube amplification. Tube amplifiers also cost a lot more than their "solid-state" counterparts, premium sound = premium price. One thing to bear in mind when making this decision is that tube amplifiers are fragile and they need a lot more upkeep than a transistor amp. Tube amps also can be very loud. Concerts at stadiums can be played with 30-watt combos, as 100-watts or more are needed for solid-state. Transistor amps are designed for the road and they can take one hell of a beating. Also the cost of replacement tubes when the old ones die is something to be considered too.
 A fully kitted out pedal board can cost a fortune, therefore many people turn to modelling amplifiers with built in effects to save on $$$. And if you're not aware what's your tone, then go with modelling amp as they provide many presets of different amps and you'll really enjoy playing and exploring tone that you like. Its kind of middle one between tube and transistor. Sounds like tube, and price and weight like transistor one!,, Or watch videos and reviews on YouTube. Once you find the one you want, be sure it's the right one. Smaller stores may offer an exchange if you take it home and you don't like it. Bigger retail chains might not be so kind.
 And don't harm the neighbours.

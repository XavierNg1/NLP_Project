 Telling someone to "shut up," even politely, is difficult for people who are generally nice and friendly. But if someone is being offensive, aggressive, or even taking too much of your time, you need to take a stand for yourself.


Ending a conversation does not mean ending a friendship, so don't be afraid.
Incessantly talking can mean that someone does not respect you or your time, and letting them talk over you can reinforce that behavior.
 Be direct and to the point, and avoiding asking questions or inviting interpretation with mushy language. Don't say, "Would you mind if I kept working?" Say "I'm getting back to work now."


Make eye contact and speak clearly. Raise your voice if you need to be heard, but try to keep your tone level and steady.
Use declarative (ie. "I am") sentences instead of questions or conditional ( ie."If you...") phrases
Example: avoid saying, "Well, I'm kinda busy right now." Instead, say, "I've got a lot to do, and I unfortunately do not have time to talk."

, When someone is being crude or hurtful, tell them that you would rather not talk about it and that they can have a nice day. Engaging aggressive talkers will only make them louder and angrier, so take the high road and leave.


Example: "That's enough. I am not going to tolerate that sort of language."
Ignore any further comments.
Know the line between conversation and harassment, and ask for help if you feel threatened.
 If someone continues talking, let them know you need to leave and walk away. Be polite but confident, and don't linger if they "have one last point." You have done everything you could to end the conversation peacefully, so don't feel badly if they still don't respect your time.


Example: "It's been great talking to you, but I am going to go now."

 Since you want to finish the world, you should select one that you believe is easiest for you to go through.
 Play the level as you would—get coins, power-ups (if any). It would be best to avoid the enemies though rather than kill each one. Do this until you get to the goal stairs.
 At the top of the stairs, don’t jump just yet. Back up a little until you’re at the left edge of the very last step at the top so you’ll get a good start for your jump towards the goal pole.
 This is your goal, the highest point of the pole. If you jump at the very top of the pole and slide down, you’ll earn 1up for your efforts.


If you found going through the level is easy for you, repeat it. If not, find another level that’s easier for you to finish and reach the goal.

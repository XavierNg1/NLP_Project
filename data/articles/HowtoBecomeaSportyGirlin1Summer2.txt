  Exercise everyday for at least 30 minutes.  This can be biking, swimming, dancing in your room, soccer, yoga, push ups, sit ups, etc.  Do any exercise everyday.  You can also do 2 or 3 a day.  Switch exercises every week or so.  Eat healthy.  Eat lots of protein, such as chicken, fish, tofu, and nuts.  Also eat fruits and vegetables.  Drink lots of water and drink milk or eat yogurt every morning.  Also drink some apple juice or orange juice or any kind of juice.  Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, because it will help your body restore its strength and makes you healthy and energetic.
  Soccer, badminton, dance, hockey, volleyball, dodgeball, tennis, etc.  Do any sports you like.  Play at least 2 sports.  Practice them everyday to get better at them.  Also if your sport uses a ball, don't be afraid of the ball.  Just play your best and practice to get better. To get better at sports, you need some strength and flexibility.  Try doing swimming or yoga.
  Run everyday and don't look back.  Run as fast as you can.  Do it everyday.  It will be a pain, but it helps you become the fastest girl/person in your class!  If you have long legs, lucky!  You're probably already quite fast, you just don't know it.  So yeah, run everyday using a good pair of runners.  Make sure to drink tons of water after this.
  Make tons of friends.  Be a super kind person, and talk to all different kinds of people.  Try to make friends with lots of boys and sporty girls.  Talk about sporty stuff and try to be funny and easygoing.  Don't be a brat or selfish.  Sporty girls are always popular.
  Sporty girls like to put themselves out there.  Smile whenever it's appropriate.  Laugh whenever someone tells you a funny joke.  Tell other people funny jokes. Just smile a lot and laugh.  This attracts people in an addicting way.  Practice these steps over the summer, and you'll go back to school popular.  Everyone will pass you the ball.

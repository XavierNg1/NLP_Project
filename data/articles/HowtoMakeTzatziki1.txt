 Peel the cucumbers, cut them into three or four parts, and then use an apple corer to remove the seed section in the middle.;
, With the flat side on the cucumber chunk on a large grater, roughly grate the cucumber. The chunks do not need to be too small.
 Place the shredded cucumber in a sieve and drain the liquid into a cup. Press the cucumber in the sieve to encourage more of the moisture out. Set aside both the drippings and the cucumbers.
 Very finely dice garlic or run the garlic through a high quality garlic press. Then, mix the garlic together with a little olive oil and a half tablespoon of salt, preferably with a mortar and pestle but a bowl and fork/small potato masher can work okay.
 Line a sieve with coffee filters and then pour in your yogurt. Drain for about 15 minutes, stir carefully (do not disturb the filters) and allow to drain for another 15 minutes.
 Mix the container of yogurt, the drained cucumbers, and the garlic mixture together in a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl.
 Now, there are different schools of thought here. Different areas of Greece tend to use different spices, and tzatziki is prepared with non-traditional spices elsewhere in the world. You can choose which best suits you, or combine 2: lemon juice, wine vinegar, 1 tbsp fresh oregano, 1 tbsp fresh dill, or 1 tsp mint. Ground black pepper to taste is pretty standard, however.
 Cover with plastic wrap and set in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Twelve hours will produce a better tasting final product. The cucumber juice can be used to get a more sauce-like texture for use on salads or as a dressing on meat, or just a small amount can be added to get a stronger cucumber flavor.
 Enjoy your authentic Greek tzatziki! Traditionally it is served in a bowl with dipping bread, and topped with a light drizzle of olive oil, a few whole kalamata olives, and a sprig of oregano or other fresh herbs.

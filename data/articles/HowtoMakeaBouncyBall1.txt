 You'll need:


A bowl of warm-hot (not boiling) water
Some Borax (also called sodium borate, this can be found easily in the laundry section of your grocery store)
3 or 4 drops of any food coloring (optional).
Cornstarch
Regular school Glue;
, Pour half a teaspoon of Borax into a small bowl and then 2 tablespoons of warm water.
 Add a couple of drops of whatever color you want the ball to be.
 Stir until dissolved.
 Take one tablespoon of glue and add it into a separate bowl.
 Add half a teaspoon of the Borax solution into the bowl with the glue.
 Add one tablespoon of cornstarch.
 Stir the mixture until it is completely combined.
 Take the mixture in your hands and roll it into a sphere.
 Set the ball aside to dry. After 10-15 minutes, it's ready to play with. Just store it in a plastic bag when you're not using it.

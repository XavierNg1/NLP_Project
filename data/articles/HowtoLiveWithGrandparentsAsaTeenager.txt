 Whenever your grandparents tells you to do something (e.g. clean the floor, wash the dishes, do your homework): say, "Yes, grandpa!" or, "Yes, grandma!" with a smile on your face and do it immediately, without delay. Be happy while you are doing it, and make it so apparent that everyone else in the house can tell you are happy. Exceed their expectations by doing the best job you can possibly do. When you are done, ask them if they have anything else for you to do. Repeat the process.;
, Even though you may disagree with them at times, understand that they have had much more real life experiences than you do, and you should show respect for that. Reciprocity works in a way that if you respect their opinions, they will appreciate it and learn to respect yours too! But if you do not respect their opinions, then they will be upset and will likewise not respect yours as well. A vicious cycle will then begin, arguments will beget more argument, until you can no longer live with your grandparents (or anyone else for that matter).
 E.g. "Grandma, you made such a delightful breakfast! Thank you very much! I wish one day I could make something similar." Give them a hug or a kiss.
 People like to hear themselves talk. Act very interested in what they have to say. Perhaps you can learn something from their experiences (most likely, you will).
 Surprise them with a gift.
 If your grandparents need to go see the doctors, take them there if you can. If they need to go shopping, go with them if you can. If they need help with work around the house, offer to help them in any way if you can. Living with your grandparents puts you at a position to understand their daily needs; as a teenager, you may have the strength and resources to help them with these needs. Living in harmony with others is all about showing outgoing concerns and taking good care of one other.

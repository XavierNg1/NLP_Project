 If you have some funds available, you might want to consider a secured credit card. With a secured credit card, you pre-pay the amount of your credit line as a security deposit for your credit line. If you fail to make your payments, this deposit will be used to cover them. This type of credit card is a good option if you are trying to rebuild your credit or if you cannot obtain a credit card any other way., If you are a member of a credit union, you might want to check with them first because credit unions sometimes offer better interest rates than other lenders. If you are not a member of a credit union or would like to consider some other options, you look at a list of secured credit card offers.Pay attention to the interest rates and annual fees as you consider secured credit cards.
Keep in mind that interest rates are often higher on secured credit cards because people who apply for these types of credit cards are trying to rebuild their credit.
 Once you have found a credit card that seems like a good fit for you, complete the application. You will also need to pay the minimum security deposit that is required to obtain the credit card, so make sure that you have the funds available to make this payment when you apply.

 Take the mouse by the scruff of its neck, and turn the mouse on its back in your hand. However, nipples may be obscured by fur on the mouse's stomach. Try to part the fur or feel the belly to see if you can spot the nipples. They may look like bald spots if the mouse is young.


It can be difficult to spot nipples on pinkies but with good lighting and an observant eye, you can spot nipples as early as three days after birth.
 Male mice do not have nipples. While female mice have 10 nipples and should look like little indentations. The most prominent nipples are the two by the genitalia.


Pregnancy is usually an easy visual determination of sex, as the doe's nipples will swell and drop, forming "saddlebags" around the hip area. However, not all mice will be as obvious, and for some, obese males may look just like pregnant females. Try gently palpating the "saddlebags". You might be able to feel distinct nodes, which are likely the pups.

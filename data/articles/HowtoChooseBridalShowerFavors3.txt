 A big trend in bridal shower favors is going for gifts that have been personalized. This means the names of the bride and groom and/or the name of the guest appear on the favors. You can order personalized wine glasses or cocktail glasses online. Or you can make the personalized glasses yourself using markers and stencils.You can also order personalized chocolate and candies as favors, which will feature the name of the bride and groom on them.
 You can also make the favors more personal by spending time making personalized t-shirts for each shower guest. You may write the personâ€™s name on the t-shirts and include a photo of the bride. Or you may have a funny saying on the shirts that reflect the theme of the shower.This may be a good option if you want to save money but still want to give your guests a favor that feels personal and just for them.
 Another personal bridal shower favor could be a collection of photographs of the bride and their guests. You may put the collages together beforehand to showcase all the fun times the bride has had with the guests at the shower. Or you may take pictures at the bridal shower and send each guest a photo collage as a favor in the mail or online.


It may also be fun to have a Polaroid camera set up at the bridal shower, where guests can take pictures with the bride and other guests. They can then take the Polaroid photos home as favors from the shower.

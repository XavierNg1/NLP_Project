 You can easily tell the difference between adult female and adult mate crickets. Female crickets have an ovipositor (egg laying appendage) that extends from their rear and smooth wings. Male crickets have ridges on their wings and use these ridges to make a chirping sound when they are trying to mate.It is difficult to tell the difference between males and females when the crickets are young.
Breeding is not difficult with adult crickets.
 One container should be exclusively for breeding. Place substrate (e.g. moist sand, soil, coconut husk; damp cotton wool or paper towels) in a plastic tub. The substrate gives the female crickets a place to burrow before they deposit their eggs. Remove the container once eggs have been laid.You can also place one pint (500 ml) of nesting material on top of an egg carton for burrowing as well.
The nesting container should be 2-3 inches deep so the eggs will not be disturbed.
Check the nesting material every 2 or 3 days to make sure that it has not become dry. You should see eggs in 4-7 days.
 Eggs are a whitish yellow color. Once they have been laid, move them to a different container that is between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If the substrate stays moist, the eggs should hatch in about 10 days.Once the eggs hatch, move them to a rearing container.


If the substrate dries out, your eggs will not hatch.
 The rearing container should have small holes in the lid that are 1 inch apart. Place a water dish in the container and spray it with water every two days. Watch this container more carefully than you watch the breeding container. Keep the crickets in this container until they are ½ inch long. Once they are ½ inch long, you can feed them to your reptile.


For breeding purposes, move some of the crickets to the breeding container when they are ¼ inch long. Adult crickets only live for a few weeks, and you will miss out on the breeding period if you do not set them aside.

 If there is any debris caught in the ignition cylinder, it may cause the key to fail to engage the pins properly to turn. Purchase canned air from a local retail or office supply store and insert the straw from the nozzle directly into the key hole. Spray the canned air into the key hole in short spurts. It should only take a few short sprays to clean out any debris.Do not spray the entire can into the key hole. The extreme cold could result in damage to the ignition cylinder.
Wear eye protection when using canned air to clean the key hole to ensure no debris gets into your eyes.
 If the ignition cylinder has seized, spraying a small amount of electrical cleaner into the key hole may lubricate it enough to turn. Be careful not to spray too much into the key hole. A few short squirts should suffice. Once done, insert the key and turn it back and forth gently to work the lubricant in.If this works, you may need to replace the ignition cylinder soon as it gets progressively worse.
 If all else fails, you will need to have your ignition cylinder replaced. Have your vehicle towed to a nearby repair facility that specializes in your make and model of vehicle. Explain the issue and discuss your options.Just like having a new key cut, you will need to demonstrate sufficient ownership of the vehicle in order to have a new ignition cylinder installed.
A new ignition cylinder will likely require replacing your key, even if it wasnâ€™t the issue.

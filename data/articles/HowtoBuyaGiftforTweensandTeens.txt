 Baking some treats such as cupcakes, brownies or flapjacks, show you have put time and effort into it and they can share them with their friends. This is a nice gift if you feel a bit unsure of whether or not to buy them something as it shows you've thought of them but is informal enough that, if the family haven't reciprocated, you won't look overbearing or be out of pocket.

 When choosing the photos, be sure to pick the best pictures, so that you'll be motivated to look at your photo album time and again.;
, Copy these pictures in a separate folder. Keep the originals separate so that you have untouched ones still available.
 Use your favorite photo editing software to enhance the photos to appear their best. Use the advanced options to fix red eye, colors, shades, sharpness, etc.
 Look online and compare what each service offers, including whether you can drop into a real store or can only use their services online and what their prices are.
 Sometimes you can choose between standard and photo paper. The extra charge usually required for photo paper in your photo-book is worth the money because it is of higher quality, looks better and will last longer.
 Try to be consistent, and ensure that there is a nice composition for your photos. Always remember: Less is more!

, Use a nice picture of soft color as a background for your page. Add text if needed.
 If you're using an online provider, there should boxes to check, or you may need to email for confirmation if there is any uncertainty.
 Some photo services will have coupon deals available, depending where you live. Using a coupon will bring down the price of your book––that's always nice.
 Ask the service provider for an estimated time to produce it. When it arrives, enjoy your photo-book and show it around. Then it's time to get started on the next one, now that you're a pro!

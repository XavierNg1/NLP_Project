Hulu is a company which offers digital-quality cable television shows on your computer, free of charge.
Visit Hulu.com to view your favorite shows. Be aware that currently, Hulu does not allow you to watch digital cable television shows at their time of broadcast. Instead, you must wait at least one day after broadcast to see the shows in which you are interested.



Like Hulu.com, the TVU network allows you to watch digital-quality cable television programs on your computer. Unlike Hulu, however, which allows you to simply visit a website and select your favorite shows, TVU requires a download. Visit the TVU Network homepage to begin the downloading process.
Once at the homepage of the TVU Network, you can find a green button in the upper right-hand corner which says "download."
Click this button, and follow all downloading instructions which follow. Depending on your individual computer, instructions may vary quite a bit.
Understand that the TVU Network operates much like traditional versions of digital cable television. This means that you can only watch digital television which is currently being broadcast. Unlike Hulu, you cannot watch programs which may have aired several days beforehand.

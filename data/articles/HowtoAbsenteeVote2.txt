 This is true in all states.


Eligible spouses and children of military members can also vote as long as they are US citizens who are at least 18 years old. If a child is a US citizen but has never resided in the country, many states will allow that child to claim a parent's state or residence as his or her own.
 Typically, your legal voting residence is the state in which you lived prior to enlisting.


You may no longer have a formal connection to your past residence, but if you have not claimed a new place of residence since, that location will be the one you must use.
You can claim a new legal voting residence as long as you are physically present at that location and can show intent to return there as your primary place of living outside of the military.
You can change your legal residence every time you change your permanent duty station, or you can keep the same legal residence without changing it.
 Regardless of your legal voting residence, the easiest, most streamlined way to request an absentee ballot is by contacting the Federal Voting Assistance Program and requesting a Federal Postcard Application.An online version of the FPCA is also available.

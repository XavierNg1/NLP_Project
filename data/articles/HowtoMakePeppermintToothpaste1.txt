 Baking soda has been a popular alternative to commercial toothpaste for its abrasiveness (which helps scrape off food and other accumulated particles in the mouth) as well as for its powerful cleansing properties.For this recipeyou will need the following:


1/4 cup baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine-grained sea salt
20 drops peppermint essential oil (make sure you are using pure peppermint essential oil and not peppermint extract which is used for baking)
20 drops of liquid stevia extract (or to taste)
1-2 teaspoons of water (add to desired consistency);
, The process of making your own toothpaste is quite simple and you don’t need any special supplies to mix the ingredients together. Obtain a small bowl, fork, and a clean, dry jar with a tight-fitting lid to store the toothpaste in.
 Add the baking soda and sea salt into the bowl and then use the fork to mix the two ingredients together. Since they are both dry materials, don’t worry too much about the consistency, just be sure to mix the two thoroughly.
 Start by adding in the peppermint essential oil, mashing it into the dry mixture with the fork. Then mix in the stevia and then finally water until you get your desired consistency.


If you prefer a strong minty flavor, use all 20 drops of the peppermint oil. If you would like a more mild version, start with 10 drops and add more after tasting if desired.
Add in the liquid stevia to taste as well. Mix thoroughly after adding 10 drops and if you prefer a sweeter version, add in the rest of the stevia.
Finally, drizzle in the water a little at a time. Don’t expect the final product to have the exact same consistency as store bought toothpaste. Instead, aim for a damp paste that sticks together.
 When using your toothpaste, you can use a small spoon to scoop out a pea-sized amount onto your toothbrush or you can just directly dip your toothbrush into the jar.

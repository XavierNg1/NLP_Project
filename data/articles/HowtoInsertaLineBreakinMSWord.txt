 Using your computer’s file browser, find a document with the extension .doc or .docx.;
, Once you’ve found it, double-click the file and it will open in Microsoft Word.
 Scroll through the document until you locate where you want to insert a line break, and click the area. This will place the cursor in that area.
 Hit the key combination Shift + Enter to create a line break. You will now be able to add content in the line right after the break.


Notice that the cursor will not situate itself in the blank space where the break is when you click on the space. This is the line break.

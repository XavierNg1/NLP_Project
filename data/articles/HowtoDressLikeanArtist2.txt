 You don't have to be a fashion designer to make your own clothing. Working from a pattern makes sewing your own wardrobe relatively simple. Check out your local fabric store for some wild, off-beat patterns you wouldn't find on store-bought clothes. As your skill-level increases, you may even decide to design pieces from scratch without an existing sewing pattern.
 Are you tired of seeing the same old T-shirt designs? Make custom shirts that nobody else in the world can wear.


If you have a business or studio, design T-shirts with its name and logo. If the shirts are eye-catching, wearing them can get complete strangers interested in your art.
 Find original buttons or add faux jewels to your clothes. Try your hand at basic jewelry crafts to make accessories that are both different and fit perfectly into your personal style. Upcycle any odd knickknack that can be incorporated into your clothes and accessories.

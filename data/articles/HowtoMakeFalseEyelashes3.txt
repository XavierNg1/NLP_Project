 You'll be able to make your false eyelashes more quickly and without interruption if you have the materials you need on hand.
 You can use a length of string to measure the width of your lashes. Simply run your thread from one corner of your eye to the other, looking in a mirror as you do so to ensure you are properly following your lash line.


Trim excess string so that it is the exact width of your eyelash line.
 The width of your fabric will be the same as that of your measuring string, but the length of your fabric rectangle will determine the length of your false lashes. The longer you make your strip of fabric, the longer your lashes will be.


You can always trim down the length of your false lashes when you are finished, so it is better to cut your fabric longer and trim it down later.
 Using your scissors, cut your fabric in very thin strips from one end to the other. You will need to leave about 1-2 millimeters of fabric uncut at the base of your false lashes.This is where you will apply your adhesive to attach your eyelashes to your eyelid.
 You can attempt to curl your lashes by holding the 1-2 millimeter strip you left uncut and applying your hot plate to the "hair" part of your false eyelashes. If you have trouble getting the desired curl, you may need to lay your false lashes to a round, heat-resistant surface and then apply your hot plate. This will cause your false lashes to curl along the rounded edge of whatever object you are using.You may need to apply product to your false lashes to help maintain this curl.
 Cloth eyelashes are great for a feathery, delicate look, so why not add a small, delicate feather in the corner of your false eyelashes?Glitter and sequins are also good options to give your lashes a unique touch.

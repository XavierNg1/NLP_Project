 Diarrhea can cause severe dehydration for kids, so it is important to encourage your child to drink plenty of water while he is dealing with diarrhea.Try filling up a water bottle and encouraging your child to carry it around and drink from it throughout the day. Refill the water bottle for your child (or ask your child’s teacher to refill it) if it becomes empty.


Do not give your child electrolyte solutions unless your child’s pediatrician advises you to. These are often only necessary if your child is becoming dehydrated.
Do not give your child sports drinks, sodas or juice. The high sugar content in these beverages can make diarrhea worse., You can also offer your child a frozen ice pop or two throughout the day to provide more fluids.Try choosing popsicles that are low sugar or make some of your own using popsicle molds. You can fill them with water and add slices of fresh fruit to make them more appealing to your child.
 Offering a bowl of cereal with milk is another good way to provide your child with some extra fluid to replenish lost fluids and help prevent dehydration.Ask your child to choose her favorite cereal and top it with a half cup of milk. Encourage your child to drink the milk as well.
However, if your child seems to have more diarrhea after consuming dairy products, then you may want to hold off on milk for a few days.
 Another way to give your child more fluid is to offer some broth or soup as a snack or as a meal. You can offer your child some chicken broth or even a clear broth-based soup, such as chicken noodle or vegetable soup. The salt in the soup may also help your child's body to hold on to more of the fluids.

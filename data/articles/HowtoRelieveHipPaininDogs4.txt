 The application of heat helps dilate blood vessels and stimulates circulation to the hip. In turn, this helps remove noxious toxins that irritate pain receptor nerves. Just be careful you don't burn your dog – always test it on your skin first to make sure it's a safe temperature.A simple method is to use a wheat bag – the sort you heat up in a microwave. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to heat the bag, and with the dog lying down so that the sore hip is accessible, rest the warmed wheat bag over the hip. Leave it there for 10-15 minutes, and then follow with some passive movement exercises.
 This treatment involves the application of a small electrical current to the skin in order to numb sensory nerves and block pain transmission. It does this by stimulating delta fibers that release enkephalin in the spinal cord, which in turn reduces sensitivity to pain.Veterinarians often administer this type of treatment after surgery to help with the pain, but the effects only last for about an hour.
 Veterinarians who are trained in traditional Chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM) can provide laser acupuncture treatments to your dog to help relieve hip pain. The laser stimulates the release of your dog’s body’s own pain relieving chemicals. Ask your veterinarian for a referral if you are interested in this treatment option.

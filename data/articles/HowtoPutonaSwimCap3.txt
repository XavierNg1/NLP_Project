 If you have longer hair, use a hair tie to tie back your hair in either a ponytail or a bun.Make sure that your hair is secured tightly, because it may shift when putting on the swim cap.
 Have a friend turn the swim cap inside out and fill it up with water. You can scoop up water from the pool, or fill it up from any other kind of water source.Your friend should be holding the cap on the sides, with the water inside the cap.
 Sit down on the ground and have your friend stand over you, holding the swim cap directly above your head.Your friend can hold the swim cap near her face or even higher, to give the drop added height. Have your friend let go of the swim cap evenly, so it falls squarely on your head.


The velocity from the drop will cause the cap to fall on your head (because of the weight of the water) and the cap consequently will fold over onto your head.
Be aware that this method doesnâ€™t always work on the first try, and the results can be rather inconsistent. More often than not, adjustments are necessary.
 Make any needed adjustments to the swim cap. Reposition the cap on your head, tuck in any stray hairs, and position the cap around your ears.

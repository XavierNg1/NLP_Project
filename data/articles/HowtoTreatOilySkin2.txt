 This works as a great all-natural facial toner. It will close up your pores and dry up excess oil when applied to your face after washing. Pour a bit of witch hazel onto a cotton ball, and dab it onto your face after washing.


There is also a rose water witch hazel combination toner on the market that is great for oily skin.
 All natural tea tree oil is great for oily skin and acne/blemish-prone skin. Mix equal parts of tea tree oil with water, and mist it onto your face or apply it with a cotton ball. You can also add a few drops of tea tree oil to any of your other favorite toners.
 Although it may sound frightening because of the scent, apple cider vinegar is a good option for oily skin. Apply it directly to your face after washing, or mix equal parts vinegar with water. There will be a scent when you apply it, but after a short while (when the vinegar has evaporated) the smell will disappear.
 Full of antioxidants and skin-purifying nutrients, green tea is a great option for oily skin. Make your own green tea toner by brewing an extra-strong cup of pure green tea, and allow it to cool. It can be applied to your face twice daily after washing with a spray bottle or a cotton pad.
 Another natural oil, sea buckthorn has been used to treat skin ailments for many years. Combine a small vial of the oil with equal parts of water and dab it onto your face. You can also choose to add a few drops of the oil to your other favorite toners as an alternative to using it alone.
 There are dozens of oil-prone skin toners available on the market, each with varying results. Try out a toner that is advertised for oily skin, and see how it works. Make sure it doesnâ€™t have any added fragrance as this can irritate your skin.

 To open the Firefox browser on your computer, click on that fox icon on your desktop, Start menu, or taskbar.;
, Look for the icon with three short horizontal lines arranged on top of the other found at the top-right corner of the browser. Click on the icon to display a drop-down menu.
 To get there, click on “Options” from the drop-down menu. A window will pop up where you will see among the tabs one marked “Applications.” Click on it to display the options under it.
 A white box will appear in the Applications options menu with all of the different applications running on your browser. (At this point, it will be slightly different for each user.)


To look for a certain application, click on the search bar at the top of the screen, type in the name of the app, and hit Enter. If Firefox finds it, the application will appear in the box.
 To the right of each application is a drop-down menu that you can click on to get information about what you are allowed to do with a particular application. Just tweak the settings according to your preferences.


For instance, with the application Adobe Acrobat Forms Document, clicking on the drop-down menu beside it will display its own particular settings. One of the things you can do is to set “Always ask” on so that Firefox will ask you every single time how you want Adobe Acrobat forms to be opened.
You can also just customize what opens the application without having to be asked by Firefox each time. If you look further down, you will see that the options on the drop-down list are “Use Firefox” and “Use Adobe.” Simply click on the one that you want to be your default.
 Once you’ve changed your application settings to make your browser experience smoother, click on “OK” at the bottom of the box to save your changes.

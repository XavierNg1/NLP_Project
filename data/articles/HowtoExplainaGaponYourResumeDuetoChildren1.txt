 Employers are more likely to hire somebody who can offer an explanation for the gap on their resume than someone who does not address it at all.State the reason for your employment gap upfront, in your cover letter.
 There’s no need for anything elaborate. Put one or two sentences into your cover letter, clearly explaining the reason for your work hiatus.For example, you might say something like, “I took three years off to care for my child, and now I am eager to return to work.”

, Once you have stated the reasons for your employment gap, move on to what you have to offer your potential place of employment. Focus on your skills, experience, and enthusiasm for the work.If you gained any work-related experience during your hiatus (e.g., volunteer work, freelance work, or certification courses), mentioning this could give you an edge.

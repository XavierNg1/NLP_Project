 When you are starting out for the first time, start your page by posting interesting pictures related to your company. For example: if you are a travel company, you can share the photos of beautiful destinations that falls under your holiday packages, post a picture with a beautiful travel quote. Research shows that audience likes interesting photos.;
, Write blogs and articles exclusively on those products which your company offers. If you are offering refurbished mobile phones or computers, you can share a blog post like ‘How to purchase refurbished mobile phones’, ‘Benefits of recycled computers’. Make sure that these blogs contain the answers and are properly interlinked to your company’s website.
 This is to be done at a later stage, when you have already got some good number of likes on your page. Asking a question increases the engagement rate of the audience.
 If you want to increase the number of likes in your Facebook page overnight, then you have to shell out some money. Take help of the boost post option and invest accordingly on the basis of your company’s budget. Remember, once the number of likes increases,you will certainly have more inorganic likes to the page.
 Take the help of ‘Facebook Insights’ and get to know about the specific time periods when the audience engagement is high and post accordingly, Research says that Wednesday and Friday are the days when most of the users increase their Facebook activity. However, this may differ.
 Start a contest and ask people for submissions. This might be submission of a photo or a poem. Make sure that you offer them something in return for the best entry. You will subsequently see an increase in the number of submissions and user engagement too.

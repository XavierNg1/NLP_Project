 Single click the Internet button from the bottom right corner of your Windows taskbar and click Networking and Sharing Center.


The Network and Sharing Center is also able to be accessed through the Control Panel. Open Control Panel, type Network in the search box at the top of that dialog box and click "Network and Sharing Center".;
, It should be the third option from the top below the "Tasks" heading.


If using the substep from Step 1 above (open control panel, type network in the search box), without clicking "Network and sharing Center" you can directly click "Manage wireless networks" right from the pair of options you would normally have seen in the left corner column of the Network and Sharing Center dialog box and bypass the Network and Sharing Center dialog box altogether.
,, Click the "OK" button on the dialog box that displays.
 It should only take a few seconds to disappear.

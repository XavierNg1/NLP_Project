 In order to reply to tweets using your Twitter app, you will need to be signed in with the account you want to reply with. If you don't have the Twitter app, it can be downloaded for free from the Google Play or Apple App store.
 On your Twitter feed, you will see a list of all your recently-received tweets. Scroll until you find the tweet you want to respond to.
 It looks like a small arrow pointing to the left. Tapping the reply button will open the text box where you can type the reply.


By default, the tweet will be directed towards the user you are replying to, indicated by "@username". You can add other recipients by typing an "@" symbol followed by the username.
 Your tweet must be 140 characters or less, including the recipient's username. You can see your remaining characters at the bottom of the reply box.


Tap the "Image" button in the bottom-right corner to browse your phone for an image to attach.
 When you are ready to send the tweet, tap the "Tweet" button.

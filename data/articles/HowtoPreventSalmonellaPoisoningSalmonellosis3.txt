 Cross-contamination is when you contaminate cooked food or ready-to-eat foods with uncooked food. You should be careful to always use separate cutting boards, knives, and cooking utensils for raw food like meat and eggs. You should also make sure uncooked meat is in a separate area, far from produce and cooked food.If you must use the same cooking utensils for cooked food and raw food, make sure you wash all utensils thoroughly with warm water and soap before using them again. This will prevent Salmonella from getting into your food.
 You should make a conscious effort to keep raw food and cooked food on separate plates in your kitchen. If you use a plate for raw food, do not use it for cooked food until it has been washed thoroughly with warm water and soap.If possible, try to keep two sets of dishes out while you cook, one set for raw food and one set for cooked food. This will prevent cross-contamination from occurring.
 You should always wash your hands well once you have finished handling raw meat or raw eggs. Wash your hands after you drop a raw steak on the grill or a piece of raw chicken breast on a saucepan. Make sure you wash your hands after you crack an egg in a pan or when you are baking. This will prevent the spread of Salmonella and ensure your food does not become contaminated.

 Make sure that you are allowed to change your school uniform. If not, don't try to go over the top or anything too obvious. Just try out minor changes to your school uniform if you aren't allowed.;
, Does your school uniform consist of blue and brown? Black and red? Green and yellow?What are your school colours? Then, base the rest of the changes on these colours.



If you are allowed to, layer a black cardigan on top of your school shirt.
Wear hair bands and head bands with little novelties of ghosts and pumpkins to make your hair cute (if you're a girl).
If you're a boy, change the shoe laces to skulls or pumpkins, ghosts or just something "scary".
If you're allowed to, change the buttons on your uniform to orange, yellow, red, black, dark purple, dark blue or dark green. If you aren't allowed to, add cool, Halloween-y badges to your school jumper or blazer.
Add Ghosty and Halloween-y badges and key rings/key chains to your school backpack.
Wear some of those cheap plastic ghost and spider rings that you can easily buy from the two dollar shop.
Wear Halloween-themed earrings!

Collect a guam herb. Invest in clean guam for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy guams are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect 1 redberry. There are redberry bushes southeast of Varrock, or they can be purchased from Beefy Bill, just north of the Lumbridge windmill.
 This will create a "Guam Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose ranging potion.

You can use a few large candy boxes or you can use a lot of small candy. Glue the candy on the top box or top Styrofoam circle so it goes slightly past the top. This will create a “bowl” on the top of your cake. You can pour candy onto the top and the sides of the candy glued around it will keep it from falling out.

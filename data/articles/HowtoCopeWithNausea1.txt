When you feel nauseous, sip non-alcoholic drinks such as water, sports drinks, flat soda, and tea. Too much fluid can lead to vomiting, so take sips. Try taking one to two sips every five to 10 minutes. This can help settle your stomach and if you have been vomiting, it can help replace the fluids or electrolytes you've lost in the process.Drinks such as ginger ale and lemon lime soda are very helpful for nausea. These don't have to be flat when you drink them.

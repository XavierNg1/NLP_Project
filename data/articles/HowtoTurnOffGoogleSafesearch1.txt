 Unfortunately, Google sites in many countries no longer allow you to turn off SafeSearch completely.However, it is still possible to get explicit results. Start by entering any term into Google image search, then clicking SafeSearch → uncheck Filter Explicit Results. This will not fully remove SafeSearch, but it will make finding explicit results possible with the step below.


Check out the next step if you can't find the option or if the option is greyed out.;
, If you can't change your SafeSearch settings, they are probably locked by the owner of the Google account. Bypass this using any one of the following methods, then turn SafeSearch to the lowest setting as described above:



Turn on your browser's private mode. This might not turn off SafeSearch in all browsers, but it usually works. This will allow you to bypass SafeSearch if it has been locked by someone's Google account, but will not work if SafeSearch is enabled on the router.Open a new browser, or download a new, trustworthy, free browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

Create a new google account, or sign out and log into your own existing account.
 Explicit results will show up only if you make your search extremely clear. For example, if you are trying to find nude images, add the word "nude," "sex," or "porn" to the end of your search. The results you see should change dramatically.
 If you enter a search term that you think is clearly explicit, but you only get "safe" results, you can report the experience to Google. If they receive enough similar feedback on that search term, it may be changed to an "explicit" one that will automatically return explicit results without the need for additional terms.


You can use the same form to report the reverse: non-explicit searches that returned explicit results.
 Google SafeSearch isn’t tied to any web browser as it’s linked to your Google account.
 Visit Google’s search page and make a search. On the results page, if you see a picture of colored balloons on the top right corner, SafeSearch is enabled.
 You will be brought to the Search Settings page.
 Look for the “SafeSearch filters” section. The option for “Filter explicit results” should be checked and grayed out, meaning not editable. Click the “Unlock SafeSearch” link beside it, and you will be asked to sign into your Google account. If you’re already in, you will be asked to re-enter your password. This is for added security for SafeSearch so anyone can’t just turn it off.
 You will be brought to another page to confirm unlocking SafeSearch. Click the “Unlock SafeSearch” button, and Google will release the SafeSearch lock across all Google domains for your account.
 Go to Google’s search page, and the picture of colored balloons should be gone. You can now use Google Search and all its other domains freely.

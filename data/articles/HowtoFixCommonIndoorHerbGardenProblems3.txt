 Many problems with indoor herbs stem from a lack of pruning. You need to be vigilant about pruning your plants to prevent problems from developing.Once herbs are 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10Â cm) above the ground and have three grown sets of leaves, you can safely prune them for the first time.
Make sure to only trim above a growing set of leaves.
 Herbs should never flower. Once flowering occurs, this signals to the plant that the growing stage has ended. Herbs will die shortly after flowering. Trim any flowers from the plant as soon as you see them developing. This will encourage your herbs to grow into edible plants rather than flowers., Many people neglect to realize that bugs are a hazard indoors as well as outdoors. You can use a commercial bug spray or pesticide if it's safe to use in your home. You can also try more natural methods.For natural solutions, you can wipe off pests as you see them. You can also use the natural pesticide neem oil to keep bugs away.Spider mites are a particular problem with rosemary, so be on the lookout for small spiders around the size of a grain of pepper. They can be red, white, brown, or black and should be removed from the plant right away.

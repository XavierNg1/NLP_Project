 You are going to need a bucket that can hold a lot of water. However, you must also keep in mind the weight of the bucket when full. For example, a gallon of water weighs a bit over 8 pounds, which means a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket full of water would weigh in at 40+ pounds, if completely full., Pet stores selling aquarium supplies often sell inexpensive vacuum kits. These consist of about a 2 inch (5.1 cm) (or larger) diameter by 6 to 18 inch (15.2 to 45.7 cm) rigid plastic tube. This tube will be open at one end, with a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) diameter opening at the other end. Included in this kit will also be a fairly long length of 1/2" clear, flexible tubing. The 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) flexible tubing should be of sufficient length to reach from the furthest point inside the tank, over the tank top and downward into the bucket., Connect the wide rigid tube to the 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) flexible tube (if not already connected). The object of weekly maintenance is to remove solid waste and change about 25% of the water in the tank. This siphon procedure will do both at the same time., Before placing your hands in the tank, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water, and rinse well. Marine life and plants can react negatively to dirt, bacteria, and even soap.

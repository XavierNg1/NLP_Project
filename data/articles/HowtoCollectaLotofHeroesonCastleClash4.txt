 Merits are the only thing you can use to buy hero cards. Earn and save your merits. Once you have enough merits, tap your Warehouse, then tap Trade Merits. If there are any hero cards in stock, tap it and buy it.


Sell things to get merits. Few things give merits when you sell them, but it may be worth it. Be sure to sell thing that you don't need or you want to sell.
Do expeditions. Tap your arena and tap Expeditions. Choose your heroes and take them into battle. Expeditions are slightly harder than regular raids. The enemy heroes are higher levels, so be sure you have better skill talents and higher levels. Aim for getting three torches so you can get more merits.
Use merit packs. You can buy them or claim them in daily rewards. Use them to get more merits.

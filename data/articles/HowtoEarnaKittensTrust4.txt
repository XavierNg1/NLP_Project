 When you give your kitten food and water, it will come to know you as a caretaker or surrogate mother. This can help you earn a kitten’s trust.Place the food and water in pet dishes. Don’t use regular plates and bowls or your kitten will come to believe that when you are eating, you’re taking its food.
The best pet dishes for kittens are made of ceramic or glass. Unlike flimsy tin or plastic dishes, they are unlikely to spill. Plastic dishes, moreover, can leach chemicals your kitten’s water.
 If your kitten does not have a place to do its business, it will be difficult for it to bond with you. To earn a cat’s trust, place a litterbox in a quiet, low-traffic area of the house.Don’t place the litter box near the furnace or washing machine. These loud areas will scare the kitten.
Don’t place the litterbox in the corner of a room or in a closet. These spaces will make the cat feel trapped and disinclined to use the litter box.
 If you regularly bring gifts to your cat, it will soon come to trust you as someone who is kind and good-hearted. Each cat has different playtime preferences, so provide many different balls, string toys, and other toys. When you’ve identified a toy that your kitten particularly likes, spend most of your playtime with that toy.

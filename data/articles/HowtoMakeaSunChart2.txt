 To make this type of a sun chart, you will need a piece of paper, a pen/pencil, and a free day to spend observing the sun in your proposed garden space. You’ll get the most accurate representation of the sun if you take hourly observations, but if you’re not able to do that, make as many observations throughout the day as your schedule allows., To make the most accurate sun chart, you’ll need a nice sunny day. Remember, there are varying amounts of sun depending on the time of year; summer has the most sun, while winter has the least. Try to make your sun chart on a sunny, summer day so you can get a good idea of the maximum amount of sun your garden will get.


You can make multiple sun charts for each season to know what plants to grow.
 For this type of sun chart, you’ll want to divide your garden into separate regions and observe the sunlight in each one. You can split it up however you want. You don’t want the regions to be too large because half of it may be in sunlight and half in shade.


Give your regions distinct names so you remember each one when taking sun observations: Back left corner, front right corner, middle left, etc.
 Label each column with one hour of the day starting with sun-up and ending with sun-down. During the height of summer this will likely be from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM depending on your location. Label each row with the regions you divided the garden into., Each hour, look at where the sun falls in each region of your garden and record it using “sun”, “partial”, “shade”, and “dappled”. “Sun” is when the region is in full sun; “partial” is some shade, some sun; “shade” is no sun; and “dappled” is sunlight through a tree, fence, or shrub.It’s okay if you aren’t able to make observations every hour, but try to take them as close to that as possible for the most accurate sun chart.
Track the sun until it sets.
Use this chart to inform you decisions on the type of seeds to plant and where to plant them.

 After you land, don't move. Make sure your peers know that you believe you are fine, but that you're in pain. You'll have an urge to move around but don't - wait for EMTs to check you out thoroughly and release you. It would be supremely stupid to survive a fall on your head or neck without having serious spine injury only to start moving around and turn a tiny hairline fracture into a lifetime in a wheelchair. Be sure a doctor signs off on you before you decide to take your life in your hands.
 Lay down and put ice on whatever hurts or is turning into a bruise. Heat later - ice first.

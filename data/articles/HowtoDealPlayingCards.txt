Read the game rules, to see if each player gets an even amount of cards or a different amount.
Check to see if the game requires a separate pile on the side. This extra pile is known as a "kitty" or "discard pile". It can be used as extra cards to play in the game, a discard pile for unwanted cards, or leftover ones that aren't going to be used in the game.;
, The smaller amount of people that play, the more cards a person gets, as well as the higher amount of people, the less cards a person gets. Assuming that the entire deck without Jokers are dealt, this is a general guide:


2 people = 26 cards each with 0 leftovers
3 people = 17 cards each with 1 leftover
4 people = 13 cards each with 0 leftovers
5 people = 10 cards each with 2 leftovers
6 people = 8 cards each with 4 leftovers
7 people = 7 cards each with 3 leftovers
8 people = 6 cards each with 4 leftovers

, Make sure that the cards are facing down to ensure that no one can see what other people are getting.
 Move clock-wise in a circle and give yourself a card last. Repeat the process until the amount of cards specified in the rules are distributed.
, Once the discard pile is made, do a card count. Everyone should have the same amount of cards, except if the card rules says differently.
 The previous dealer then gets the 2nd to the last card of the "round".

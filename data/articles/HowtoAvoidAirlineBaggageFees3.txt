 Airlines often charge a fee for a first checked bag, and a higher fee for additional bags (such as $25 for the first bag, and $35 for each additional one). If you are traveling with multiple people, make sure that each pays for their own bag, rather than one person paying for them all--the overall fees will be lower.


For instance, for a group of four people traveling with four bags, it might cost $130 if one person checks and pays for all of the luggage, but only $100 if each person checks and pays for their own.
 Many airlines will offer passengers the option to upgrade to first class or another tier at the last minute for an additional fee. This is usually only offered shortly before departure. While there is a fee for this upgrade, you may decide the comfort and convenience of not having to pay separate baggage fees is worth it. In certain instances, it may even be more affordable than paying baggage fees.For instance, if you are offered an upgrade to first class on Delta for $90, you will be allowed to check up to three bags without an additional fee.
If you were traveling with a group of three, each person checking a bag, your baggage fees might total $95. If one of your group springs for the first-class upgrade and checks all of your bags, you will save a little money.
 Sometimes, the decisions about baggage fees are up to agents at the check-in. This means that if you are extra polite, you might be able to avoid fees.


For instance, if you have a bag that is slightly over the weight limit, you would ordinarily be subject to an overweight baggage fee.
However, if you tell the agent that your bag is only over the weight limit because you had to put a gift for your adorable 3-year old niece in it, you just might get out of paying the fee.

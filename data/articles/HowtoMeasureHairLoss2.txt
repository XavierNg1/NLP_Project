 The Ludwig Scale is a scale for measuring the progression of hair loss in females. While it can be a useful tool for assessing and explaining your level of hair loss, it has some limitations.


The Ludwig Scale was made to address female baldness as the patterns of balding in females are often different than in males. Baldness is more a progressive thinning of hair in females. However, sometimes women's hair thins and recedes similar to men's hair, so the Ludwig Scale might not work., There are three types of baldness outlined by the Ludwig Scale.


Type I is marked by hair receding and thinning on the top of the head. It may be hard to notice at this stage, but you may notice a bigger white patch than usual when you part your hair. The frontal hairline usually does not recede at this stage.Type II is marked by thinning, shedding, and a general decrease in volume of the hair overall. Your center part will also continue to widen. Treatment may be necessary at this stage of hair loss.Type III is the most extreme type of female hair loss. Hair is so thin it may not cover the scalp and will be noticeable to most people. Hair will also continue to thin and lose moisture., Female hair loss is not confined to the Ludwig Scale. It can also be frontal and advanced.


Advanced baldness is rarely seen in patients, but it's marked by almost no hair being present on the crown or the top of the head.Some women experience a gradual receding of the hairline, much the same way as baldness occurs in male patients. If this is the case for you, ask a physician if you should use the Norwood/Hamilton Scale instead to measure your hair loss.

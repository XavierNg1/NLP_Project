 Look at you. Playing a video game while others are making millions off of hit records, building skyscrapers, skydiving, and running countries. Not pressing buttons. Think: Is this who I really want to be?;
, If you play, say 30 songs a day, then the next day play 25, or maybe 27. Do this slowly, though, because dramatic song will just make you want to play more.
 If you play GH as much as I assume you do, then you must know how to hold the guitar. Not surprisingly, this is a basic element for playing. You know fast sequence picking, fret-to-fret finger speed, and pick-fret sync. If you can play expert GH, you can take up guitar. You will have a REAL skill, and get REAL appreciation.
 Write down all the stuff you buy, and all of the money you spend. See how much you could've gotten if you hadn't spent hundreds of dollars on GH.
 Put a sleep timer on you're TV if you can't stop playing yourself.
 Better yet, try to get addicted (I wouldn't say addicted) but engaged in another game even more.
 See what it's like out of the La La Land you call Guitar Hero. Videotape yourself and see how much time you really put into one game.
 And, no joke, you'll be a natural.

 You are about to embark on a journey into the darker side of humanity. You're preparing for a scenario where you may be choked, stabbed, held up with guns, ambushed by multiple attackers, put in compromising situations and forced to fight blind. This is street/battlefield fighting, not a sport with rules. Don't stop! Don't ever stop. You must be ready to keep going, no matter the obstacles you face.
 This is your best weapon. Unless someone wants to hurt you specifically, an offender will choose to attack a weak person, an easy target. How you walk, if you look at the ground or in front of you, signal whether you're a victim or not. And if someone is bothering you, use your voice as a weapon. Be ready to answer with confidence. , You may receive cuts and bruises. You may bleed. More severe injuries are possible, but unlikely as pains are taken to make the training as safe as possible. Remember, you must be able to perform the defenses when you are at your worst. That is when it matters most. The warm-up is designed to gas you out so that you begin learning when you're already at your quitting point. If a bad guy tries to do something with you when you are fresh, and you're used to doing these defenses when you're weak and tired - you will be that much more difficult to take advantage of., A real life situation is quite different than training in a safe and comfortable environment that is your Krav Maga school. Without proper training, you might freeze or lose control. Practice exercises and drills to train your mind and body to deal with a high level of stress. It is usually done by simulating real life like situations with a high intensity, great violence and pressure. , The physical conditioning is tough, and it takes most people a couple months of regular training to get caught up so that they don't get as sore for as long. You need to focus on what it is you are trying to accomplish - this is not something where a referee is going to step and save you because you're too tired to continue. This is something where you must finish the fight no matter how many times you've been stabbed. Most street fights last 6 to 10 seconds, so we train to fight for two minutes., This is the easy part. Cross-fitters and general athletes generally have the easiest time. Long distance runners and power lifters tend to have a hard time, because the training will take you from zero percent effort to 100 percent effort and back very rapidly. If you're just getting off the couch for the first time, it will be hardest of all - but don't stop. Whatever your fitness level or type, your body will adjust after a few months., You will deaden nerves in certain areas. This takes much longer. Your shins, wrists and quads will become deadened to pain and will become harder. Bruising will eventually become something that doesn't happen much in these areas, but you can count on having lots of colorful bruises on a more or less constant basis for at least the first year., If you can learn how to breathe out when you strike, or are struck early on, that will help with your conditioning quite a bit. The natural thing to do is to hold your breath while these things are happening, and if you do that, you will tire out extremely fast.

 Psoriasis usually presents as red patches with silver or whitish scales on top. Look for patches across your scalp, as that's the first sign that you may have psoriasis. It may cover your whole scalp or only be a few small patches.You may also (temporarily) lose some hair.;
, Another symptom of psoriasis is itchiness, so if you find yourself scratching red patches on your head, it could be psoriasis. However, don't rule psoriasis out if you're not itching. Not everyone with psoriasis finds it itchy., Psoriasis will often make your scalp sore or painful. Your scalp may also feel like it's burning. It can be painful at any time, though it may become worse when you press on your scalp or run your hands through your hair., Because psoriasis results in crustiness and scales, you may notice bits of it flaking off into your hair. In addition, you may notice bleeding where you have patches, particularly if you scratch the areas, as you may take off scales that aren't ready to fall off.Bleeding can also result from dryness of the scalp.
 If you have psoriasis on your head, you're likely to have it elsewhere, though not always. Look for similar patches on other parts of your body, and check to see if your patches extend past your hairline, as that could indicate it's psoriasis., Stress, cold, and dry air can all trigger flareups in different people. Keep a journal of common triggers and note when you have flareups to see which ones bother you. That way, you can take steps to avoid them when possible, or at least have treatments ready on hand.

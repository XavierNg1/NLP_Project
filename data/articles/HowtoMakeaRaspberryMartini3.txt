 Fill a chilled cocktail shaker with crushed ice. Next, pour 2 ounces (60 ml) of raspberry vodka, 1 ounce (30 ml) of Chambord or another raspberry liqueur, 1 ounce (30 ml) of Triple Sec or another orange liqueur, and ⅔ ounce (20 ml) of cranberry juice into the shaker, and shake to fully combine in the ingredients, which should take approximately 30 to 40 seconds.If you don’t have raspberry flavored vodka, you can make your own by muddling three or four fresh raspberries in a glass and pouring 2 ounces (60 ml) of plain vodka over the fruit. Allow it to sit for 5 minutes or so for the flavors to meld.
 Once the martini is fully combined, place a cocktail strainer over the top of the shaker and strain the martini into a chilled glass. Make sure not to allow any of the ice cubes into the glass.Chill your martini glass in the freezer for a half hour to keep your martini cold.
 Take three or four fresh strawberries and place them on a cocktail skewer or toothpick. Set the skewer on the rim of the glass, and serve.

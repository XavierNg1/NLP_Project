Choose an appropriate reason of reporting this photo from the dialog box that appears. You can report a photo as “Spam/Scam,” “Nudity,” “Hate/Violence,” “Illegal,” “Unrelated,” and “Blurry / Low Quality.”
Click on the radio button next to the selected issue and click on the “Submit Flag” button at the bottom of the dialog box.
 They will check your issue, and if they find your report to be right, they will delete the photo from their database.


It is a lengthy task and may take up to 3 months to delete a reported photo. Foursquare will not inform you its decision; if they find that the photo should be deleted, they will delete the photo automatically.

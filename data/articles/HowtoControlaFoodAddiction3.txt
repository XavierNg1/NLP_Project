 Diets can have negative and temporary connotations. Think of your changes as healthy lifestyle changes that make you a more rounded, healthier person, not just a healthier eater.
 Carefully plotting when you will eat can help insure that you are only eating during designated times and makes you conscious of when and how much you eat. A general guideline is to eat your lunch four hours after breakfast, and dinner five hours after lunch with a small snack before bed. , High sugars and fats can trigger the same chemical response that make addiction such a powerful force. Avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners like Sucralose or any food high in sugar. You will also want to avoid flour and wheats as much as possible. By getting rid of the main components of binge foods, you help alleviate your cravings over time. If you feel yourself craving something, try to eat something plain like a cracker. If you do not want the cracker, this can be your body's way of telling you that you were not actually hungry but only craving.
 Each healthy meal you have should contain certain foods and proportions. For example, most starchy vegetables should be at a 1/2 cup proportion for lunch and dinner. You should include a grain with each meal such as grits, oatmeal, quinoa or rye. One cup of any of these are great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
For a beverage, water is best. If you want something like coffee, make it decaf because caffeine is a stimulant that can help trigger cravings.
Focus on getting enough protein in your diet. Protein is a complex nutrient that takes work to break down and can leave you feeling full longer. Men should add two ounces of poultry or fish, or one ounce of red meat, to each meal.

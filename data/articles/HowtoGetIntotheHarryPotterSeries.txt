 This way, it'll open your mind a little more to the facts (as said by Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna's father) and make new friends. Some good ones are: http://www.pottermore.com, http://www.harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page and http://www.mugglenet.com


You should be getting interested in Harry Potter by now. Did you know that there are also songs to do with the series? They're really fun. Go to YouTube and type in: Harry Potter in 99 Seconds. It gives you a rough overview of the series.

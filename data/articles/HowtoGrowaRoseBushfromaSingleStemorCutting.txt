 Place the tip of the large knitting needle in your selected spot and hammer it all the way into the ground. Pull the knitting needle out of the ground. This makes a nice, neat hole for your rose cutting or stem to be placed.;
, Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands from thorns and to protect your cutting from germs. Make several small cuts along the stem of your cutting. Keep the gloves on while you cover all the fresh cuts with the growth hormone powder.
 Immediately place the cutting into the hole you prepared with the knitting needle.


If you are propagating from a rose stem, push the stem all the way into the hole until the bottom of the flower head touches the ground.
If you are propagating a cutting with leaves, push the stem down far enough that at least five of the leaves are not in the ground. It will look like a tiny plant.
 Place the jar over the cutting and water. In approximately nine months, the cutting will have taken root and will be a new baby rose bush for your garden.
 If you are propagating during the summer, itâ€™s important to water the cutting regularly, as you would a normal rose bush. However, if you are propagating in the fall, simply leave it alone until spring and remove the jar when you see new growth and there is no more threat of frost.

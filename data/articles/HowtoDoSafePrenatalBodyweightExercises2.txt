 One upper body exercise you can do while you are pregnant is a lateral raise. Stand with your legs wider than hip width. Keeping your arms straight, raise them out to the side until they are about to shoulder height. Hold for a second, then lower down.A variation of this is to raise your arms straight out in front of you to shoulder height. You can also rotate, raising your arms to the side for one rep, then raising them in front of you for the next rep.
These can also be done with light weights.
 Push ups are a way to strengthen your upper body and lower back while pregnant. You should start on your hands and knees. Your wrists should be wider than shoulder width with your fingers pointing ahead. Keep your abs tight. Lower yourself to the floor by bending your elbows. Make sure to keep your hips lifted. Then, push yourself up.Think about touching your forehead to the floor each time you lower yourself down.
You can also try doing push ups against the wall or using an exercise bench., Dips are a great upper body workout that isolates your triceps. Sit in a chair and walk your legs out and move off the chair so you are holding yourself up with your arms behind you. Make sure your butt is close to the chair. Lower down until your arms are at 90 degree angles. Push yourself back up until your arms are straight.You can walk your legs in and out to increase the difficulty.
If doing the dips on the chair is too difficult, you can sit on the floor with your arms behind you and do the same exercise.

 Combine one dry red chili, one teaspoon of coriander seeds, two cloves, half an inch of cinnamon stick, half a teaspoon of cumin, and four teaspoons of black pepper. Add the mixture to a small pan and roast it for two minutes over medium heat. Grind the results into a fine powder.


If you don't want to spend time making the masala yourself, you can find already prepared mixtures at Indian food stores.
 You'll be mashing it, so boil it until it is soft enough to easily smash it with a potato masher. You'll need to make about a cup mashed. Put it in a bowl and add to it half a teaspoon of salt, one tablespoon of the masala mixture, one tablespoon of tamarind paste, and three teaspoons of sugar. Set it aside.
 Add in half a teaspoon of cumin seeds and wait for them to crack open. After this, add in the potato mixture and blend it together. Leave it on low heat to keep it warm.
 Dump in the potato mixture from the last step. Let it simmer over low heat for two minutes, or until it reaches the consistency of a thick paste.
 Slice some thick sandwich buns into halves. Hoagie rolls work very well for this type of sandwich. Butter both sides of each slice and toast them in a frying pan over medium heat.
 On one half of the buns, add a quarter cup of the filling. Top it with three tablespoons of coriander chutney, one quarter cup of pomegranate seeds, one quarter cup of fine sev, and one quarter cup of crushed, roasted peanuts. Add the other halves of the buns to complete the sandwiches.


Fine sev is available at Indian food stores.
If you or anyone you plan to serve this to is allergic to peanuts, feel free to omit them.

 It is important to avoid creating an issue over a tiny thing that would have easily been sorted.;
, The best thing to do before considering a second chance; sit back, reflect and meditate on the reasons for misunderstandings.
 Don't go ahead and expect more than what is achievable as far as the issue is concerned.
 If you and either or both of your parents have fallen apart for some reasons known best between the two of you, then that is upon you, if not your parent to fix that. Both sides may have a problem putting their pride aside, but someone has to step in at the end of the day.
 Parents sometimes may think that we, being their children, deserve no apologies from them, but it's upon us to let them know that they were wrong but that you still wish to give them a chance to make things right and vice versa.
 If you were in a relationship with someone that you treasured or loved and then things fell apart, rethink your options and allow your partner a second chance to make things right. As it is said, it's better the devil you know, than the angel you don't.
 If things with your partner seem to be hitting the wall other than growing positively, try to give each other some "space apart", then give each other a second chance later on.
 If the person you have issues with seems to think that you are the one on the wrong and you know it's true, the best you can do is "own up" to the blame.
 If the issues you have with either party seems to want to head for a fight, you should take the initiative of backing up and give them time to cool off first before picking up the discussion again.

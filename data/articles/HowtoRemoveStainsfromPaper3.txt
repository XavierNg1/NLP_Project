 As with water-based stains, do this as quickly as possible. Oil stains generally don't set in the same way that water-based stains do, but they can still spread quickly. Wash your hands before moving to the next step to make sure they are free of oil.
 Place the towel on a clean, hard surface. Make sure to pick a surface that won't be damaged by the oil just in case it soaks through the paper. The best places for this are the kitchen counter, a glass table, or a metal workbench. Avoid wood furniture.
 Make sure that the stain is over the paper towel. It is best to center the stain so that there is roughly an inch of paper towel also covering the clean part of the page on all sides. The extra space is there in case the stain spreads a little over time.
 As with the first paper towel, make sure it is at least two sheets thick. Again, make sure the paper towel is around one inch wider than the stain on all sides. This is especially important to avoid getting oil on the object in the next step.
 The best books to use are hardcover textbooks and dictionaries. Any flat, heavy object may be used instead of a book. If the stain was inside of a book, close the book with the paper towels inside and place a second book on top.
 The stain may be completely removed at this point. If the stain is still visible, try replacing the paper towels and put the book back on the paper for another night. If any oil still remains, proceed to the next step.
 The baking soda should be in a relatively tall pile. If you can still see the paper through the baking soda, add more! Other non-staining absorbent powders will also work for this step.
 Repeat Steps 7-8 with fresh baking soda until the stain is completely gone.If after a few tries the stain is still visible, you may need to take your paper to a professional restorer. However, keep in mind their services will most likely be expensive.

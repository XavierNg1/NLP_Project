 When you greet someone in Balinese, you might like to be able to introduce yourself. You can do this by saying "wastan tiang" followed by your name. This translates simply as "my name is..." You can follow this up by asking the person you are greeting what he or she is called, by asking "sira pesengen ragane.", If you have stopped and asked someone for help or directions, you will want to thank them warmly for the assistance before you say goodbye. You can thank someone in Balinese by saying "suksma," which translates as "thanks."For a more polite version, you could say "terima kasih" for "thank you," or "matur suksma" for "thank you very much.", After greeting the person respectfully, you will want to end the conversation in the same way. People will appreciate you saying goodbye in a more polite way than just saying "bye", or "dah" in Indonesian slang. The most polite way to say goodbye is to say “Titiang lungsur mapamit dumun," which translates to "I’m taking leave now." This is generally used for people who are highly respected or of a high caste.Alternative farewells include “Pamit dumun,” “Pamit,” “Ngiring dumun,” and “Ngiring.”
A more informal goodbye to someone you know well could be “Kalihin malu.”

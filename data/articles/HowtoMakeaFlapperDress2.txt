 Buy a length of sequin. It should be a matching color to your tunic or fringe. Measure it around your head -- because it stretches a little, it's best to make it a bit smaller rather than a bit bigger.


Cut off the desired length and adhere together with E6000 glue.
Pick the desired place on the headband for your embellishment. This could be a flower, feathers, jewels, or whatever suits your fancy. Place some craft glue on your adornment and press firmly into place. You may want to pin it together with clothespins and leave to dry.
 High heeled Mary Janes (with thick heels) are ideal. If you don't have those, anything that wraps around the ankle (so your shoe doesn't come flying off when doing the Charleston) is good.


Stilettos weren't super common back in the day -- they're also not great for dancing in. Only go for stilettos as a last resort and if you're confident you won't trip!

, Though it's certainly not mandatory, a long string of pearls or feather boa is a fun addition to your already playful outfit. Gloves and a long cigarette holder can help put you in the flapper zone, too!


Don't forget your makeup! Depending on the color of your dress, you may be able to pull off bright red lipstick -- don't be shy! You'll be turning heads already, might as well milk it for all it's worth!

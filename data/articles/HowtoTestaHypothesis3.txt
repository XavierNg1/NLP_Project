 The null hypothesis is an assumption you make about what is true. However, you're only proposing this statement to decide how untrue it is. While that is confusing, compare it to the courtroom. If someone is a defendant, they are assumed innocent. It's the prosecutor's job to prove they are guilty.For instance, maybe your null hypothesis is "Most dogs sleep 18 hours a day."

, The alternative hypothesis is based on your null hypothesis. It basically establishes what you think is not right about the null hypothesis, so you can test the null hypothesis.For example, maybe you've decided that dogs actually sleep fewer hours in a day. Your alternative hypothesis would be, "Most dogs sleep fewer than 18 hours a day."
In other words, it's your responsibility to prove the null hypothesis is untrue by proving the alternative hypothesis to be true.
 A significance level refers to the likelihood that your results could have happened by chance. The most common significance level is 0.05, so you can choose that if you don't know what to choose. At this level, only a five percent chance exists that your results could come from coincidence.This idea is similar to proving guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt."
In other words, the significance level states that if the null hypothesis is true, then when gathering data, finding certain means or averages would be too unlikely because they are under the significance level. In that case, the null hypothesis is considered disproven.

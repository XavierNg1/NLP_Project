 It should be about 2/3 of the height of your paper. It doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it about twice as tall as it is wide, like the image below:;
, Draw two circles near the top of the oval, about 1/5 of the height from the top. Draw a smaller circle in each, and color them black, for the owl's pupils. Have fun with the eyes, if you want—you can make a serious owl, with in the middle straight ahead; an owl looking at something, by drawing the pupils pointed left or right; or a goofy, cross-eyed owl.
 Make a very wide "V" shape, extending beyond the edge of the oval on both sides, with the point of the "V" between the owl's eyes at about their centers, vertically. The point in the middle will give your owl lots of character. The less pointy the middle is, the "nicer" the owl will look. The deeper the point, the angrier the owl will appear. (In the image below, the red lines show the general shape—the black lines show the finished horns.)

, Draw curves from the top left and right, inward to about 1/4 the oval at the center, then back outward toward the bottom.
 Make elongated ovals at the bottom of your owl, three on each side, and then two horizontal lines for a perch. The perch doesn't have to be perfectly straight—it can look "branchy." Likewise, the talons don't have to be ovals—they can be pointed and sharp, which is especially good if you're making a mean owl.
 Make little "U" shapes around the area between the "wings" to look like little feathers.
 Place a narrow "V" slightly lower than the eyes for the owl's beak.
 If you want, color the "wings" brown, and the head and breast light tan.
 Add other details as you see fit. You can follow the suggestions below for adding light and shadow, or make up your own. Now that you know how to make an owl, you can create an entire flock of Halloween hooters!

 Class will be much more stressful if you don’t bring everything you’re supposed to. Make sure to bring your textbooks, pencils, homework, paper, and anything else you will need to be prepared. It’s easier to have fun in class when there is no unnecessary stress. Being prepared for class will also show your teacher your seriousness about the subject, which can improve relations, and in turn, make class more enjoyable for both parties.Bring a few extra pens and paper to lend out to other students who may have forgotten their supplies.;
, Personalizing your supplies and locker can make class more enjoyable. Cover your folders with stickers or drawings. Bring cute erasers for the tops of your pencils. Put pictures of your friends and family into binders. Add any decoration that you enjoy looking at, as long as it’s allowed in the classroom.You can also ask your teacher if it’s possible to help decorate the classroom for holidays like Halloween and Valentine’s Day.
 It’s not likely that this is something you can do regularly, but occasionally bringing things to pass out to class can liven the mood. First, ask the permission of your teacher. If it’s okay with them, you can bake cookies to pass out to your classmates, or bring another snack that can be enjoyed by everyone. Coordinate with your friends to take turns bringing treats to class.Ask your classmates if anyone has any food allergies before choosing a treat to bring.
Bring healthy snacks like banana bread and popcorn cups.

 Time passes fast when we are asleep. So, the days will seem shorter!;
, Like to draw? Well do it! Love to read? Well curl up with a good book! Keeping yourself occupied will surely help to pass the time!

, Do some tasks! If you can, clean your room! Practice and instrument! Get on top of your schoolwork! Completing things will surely make the time pass.
 Go to a movie! Have a sleepover! When you're with someone else, they help pass the time.
 You'll be looking forward to those events, and the other event will slip your mind! Plus, the new events will keep you occupied, making the time pass.


When you plan other sooner events it makes time go by fast and makes that event that your waiting for come faster.

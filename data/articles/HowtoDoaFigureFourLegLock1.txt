Face them as you start the leg lock., Grab it by the sides, heel, or ankle. Lift it into the air until their leg is roughly at a 45 degree angle., Use your right hand to continue holding their left foot up in the air. Place your right foot between their legs. Now place your left foot on the outside of their right leg. Their right leg should now be between your feet.

 Topical ointments like Oragel, Cepacol, and other products that contain benzocaine are great for numbing pain for a short amount of time. Press a dry cloth onto the affected area, then apply a numbing topical anesthetic. The dry cloth will help ensure the ointment gets absorbed efficiently without getting washed away by saliva. While it’s only a temporary fix, it’ll provide fast comfort for acute pain.Keep in mind that topical anesthetics will not last for more than an hour or so because the saliva washes the substance away.
 Mix one cup of warm water with one teaspoon of salt until the salt as dissolved. Gently swish the rinse around your mouth, then spit. While it’s not too helpful for deeper jaw pain associated with impacted teeth, it’ll alleviate surface swelling and damaged oral tissue that results when wisdom teeth erupt, or break through the gum surface., Cloves are a home remedy that might be able to help tooth pain. Use a cotton swab or ball to apply clove oil to the affected area, and you should experience a gentle, warm, numbing sensation. Try placing a whole clove onto the affected area if you have them handy and as long as the clove’s shape doesn’t cause any discomfort., If the tooth is not sensitive to cold, then you can also try placing a gauze wrapped ice cube on the area of your wisdom tooth that hurts. Leave it on for about 5 to 10 minutes to numb the area and then remove it for a while. Repeat as needed.
 It’s important to visit a dentist to see if the tooth is infected, is coming in on a bad angle, doesn’t have enough room to grow in, is pushing other teeth out of the way, or is causing any damage to your jaw or other parts of your mouth. If any of these apply, it’s possible that you’ll need to have your tooth or teeth extracted.It is also possible that a simple removal of the covering gum will make the pain go away as soon as the next day.

 Wrap your lehenga dupatta around your waist once and then tuck the upper corner into your waistband. You should tuck it in at the center of your waistband, just below your belly button.
 Create narrow pleats on the other end of your dupatta and wrap it across the front of your body. Then, lay the pleated fabric over your left shoulder. Position the fabric so that it is snug against the front of your body and pin the fabric in place.








Make sure that the pins are not visible. Position the pins under the shoulder of your top.
 Take the end of the fabric that is hanging down in back. Pleat the corner and then tuck it into the center of your waistband, right over where you tucked the other end of your dupatta.

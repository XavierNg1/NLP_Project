 To successfully sun dry fruit, you'll need at least 2 days of hot, dry weather and a clear sky (at least 90º F/32ºC with low humidity). Ideally you should allow for a full 7 days of drying, especially if the temperature is below 100ºF/38ºC.
 All you need is a rectangular wooden frame with a food-safe mesh stretched across it.


Stainless steel or plastic are the best options for meshes. Do NOT use aluminum, hardware cloth, or fiberglass meshes (unless the fiberglass mesh is clearly labeled food-grade).
 Since you're using a much lower temperature than other methods, you may wish to slice them extra thin.


Peel the bananas and slice them into 1/8 inch rounds (0.3 cm), or at least no larger than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).
If you want to prevent browning, dip the pieces in lemon juice.
 Powdered cinnamon adds a strong flavor for sweet snacking.
 Keep them in a single layer with no overlaps. It's fine if their edges touch; they should shrink a little as they dry.
 This will help keep dust off your food as well.
 Elevate it at least a few inches off the ground (for instance by placing it atop stacked cinder blocks).


Your roof is a great high-sun option that keeps it removed from most environmental pollution.
A concrete driveway will reflect the heat from the ground, drying the bananas faster.
 Even if the nights are still relatively warm, dew will add additional moisture to the bananas. Put it outside again during the day.
 The timing doesn't need to be precise; anytime on the second day of drying is fine.
 Check daily to see if they're ready to eat.


If you're not sure, just cut one open or bite into it to check for moisture.
 If completely dried, they should stay good for months.

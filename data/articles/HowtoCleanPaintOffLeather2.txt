 After dabbing at the worst of the mess with a washcloth or paper towel, pour the oil directly onto the leftover stain. For most paint stains, you’ll only need to use about a nickel-sized amount.If the paint stain is located on a slanted or irregular surface of the leather, such as the back of a couch, you can apply the oil using a washcloth.
Olive oil is a surprisingly efficient remedy for treating oil-based paint stains—you’re essentially fighting oil with oil.
 Massage the pads of your fingers into the stain using a circular motion. The added friction will serve to further loosen the paint. You should be able to observe the paint residue dissolving more or less immediately.For heavy residue or paints of contrasting colors, it may help to work the oil in with a brush to allow it to penetrate deeper.
Scratch at drying flakes lightly with your fingernail to scrape them off before they harden.
 As it sets in, it will begin to emulsify the paint, breaking it down so that it can be lifted away with ease. The longer the oil sits, the more thoroughly it will work.


Olive oil is perfectly safe for occasional use on leather. There’s no risk of staining, fading, discoloration or any other destructive side effects.
 Go over the leather a few times with a clean, dry cloth to remove the remaining paint and excess oil. When you’re done, the leather should be blemish-free and shine like new. Follow up by treating the surface with a trusted leather conditioner, if desired.Make sure there’s no oily mess left on any part of the leather. If loose paint runs, it may streak.
As an added bonus, the olive oil will soften, polish and add a coat of natural waterproofing to the leather.

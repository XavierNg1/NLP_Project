 Click the Tools tab. In the Tools menu, select Out of Office Assistant. Check the box labeled “Send Out of Office auto-replies.” You can adjust the time that the assistant is active by checking the box and setting the time and date range.
 For emails sent from within your exchange server, use the Inside My Organization tab. For responses to emails received from anyone else, use the Outside My Organization tab. Once you are satisfied with your replies, click OK.
 If you set a date range for your automatic replies, the assistant will end automatically when the date range is over. If you didn’t set a range, it will continue until you open the Automatic Replies menu and select “Do not send Out of Office auto-replies.”

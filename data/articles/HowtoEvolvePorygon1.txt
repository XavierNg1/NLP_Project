, Open your Pokémon menu and give Porygon the Up-Grade item. Since you can usually only get one Up-Grade per game, make sure you equip it to the Porygon that you want to evolve the most.
 Find a friend or trade Porygon to yourself if you have two games. When the trade occurs, Porygon will evolve into Porygon2. You can then trade Porygon2 back to your game to use it.

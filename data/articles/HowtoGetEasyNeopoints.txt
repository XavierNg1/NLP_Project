, The games i find most rewarding are the sponsor(ad) games. They are simple and easy but can give 1000 or more NP in under 3 mins. A few are my favourite games are fashion fever(just click randomise character, end game and send score to get 300 neopoints - 900 a day!), Ice cream machine ( type in strawberry vanilla chocolate to get a free life!) and turmac roll (slow down your turmac by clicking the left arrow so that you can have more time to react!).
 Your dailies are in the games room under luck and chance (they are mostly wheels for you to spin). They are cheap to play and can send you off with great rewards. There are also such things as the tombola, Coltzan's shine (available every 2 hours of the day in the lost desert), the fruit machine, the Snowager, Free jelly and free omelet( at tyrannian plateau).

Adjust the length of the rod by aligning the canopy with the crossbar and allowing a little screw thread to extend through the canopy.
Lock the length in place with a lock nut.

If you're using a center-mounted ceiling light, slide the canopy onto the rod so the nipple shows through the center hole. Screw on, and tighten the mounting nut.
If needed, adjust the rod so that the canopy sits flush against the ceiling.

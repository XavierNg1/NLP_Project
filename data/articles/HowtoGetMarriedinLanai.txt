You can legally marry at the age of 18 years old in Hawaii. If you are 16 to 17 years old, you must have parental consent. If you are 15 years old and wanting to get married, you must have a court order that allows you to.
If you are over the age of 18 years old, the only identification that you have to show is a valid i.d. such as a passport or driver's license. If you are 18 years old or younger, you will need to be able to show a certified copy of your birth certificate.
If you have been previously divorced or had a spouse pass away, you will need to show proof of death or divorce if either of those things happened within 30 days of applying for your marriage license.
You must both appear in person to obtain your marriage license on any of the Hawaiian islands. It will cost you approximately $60, and your license will be good to use for 30 days.

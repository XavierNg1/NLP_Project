 Gently handle the strawberries under running water, rinsing off any dirt attached to them. Pat dry with paper towels.;
, Create a double boiler or melt the chips in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring occasionally until melted thoroughly.
 Hold the strawberries by the hull or top to avoid messes.

Carefully dip about 1/2 to 3/4 of them into the melted chocolate.






Dip about half of the chocolate dipped strawberry into the edible glitter or sugar.
 Arrange them on a wax paper lined baking sheet. Allow the chocolate to harden; usually 15 minutes. You could also harden and store these in the refrigerator.

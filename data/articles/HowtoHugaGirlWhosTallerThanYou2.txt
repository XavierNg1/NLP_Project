 As the shorter person, it won’t work to put your arms over her shoulders as you would with someone shorter. Wrap your arms around her ribcage, keeping your forearms close to each other.You can vary your hand placement in this position. You can place your hands up on her shoulder blades while keeping your elbows by her sides. If its a more romantic hug, you can also keep your hands low on her back reaching one toward each of her sides.
 When you give a face-to-face hug to a taller girl, one main goal is to make sure you don’t awkwardly stick your face into her chest. The easiest way to avoid this is to turn your head to the side. If your head has to touch her chest, it’s better to lay your ear against her chest rather than putting your face into her chest.


If you are only a few inches shorter, this really won’t be a big issue. It’s most important when you are short enough that your face is at her chest level.
 If you are short enough that your face is closer to her chest level, you can avoid that awkward closeness by giving her a side hug instead. Do this by angling one side of your body toward her and one side away. Slip one arm around her back and pull her toward you.


Your shoulder will be slightly under her shoulder and your bodies will be touching from the chest down to the hips.
For added intimacy to compensate for less body contact, you can tilt your head toward her as an invitation for her to lean down and touch your head with hers.

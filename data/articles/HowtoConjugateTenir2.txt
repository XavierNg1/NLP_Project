 The basic past tense in French is called passé simple and is probably the first past tense conjugation you'll learn. Just as in present tense, the verb form is the same for first and second person."I held" would be "je tins" and "you held" would be "tu tins." Remember that French has two pronouns for you – tu is considered both singular and informal.
 If you want to talk or write about another person or thing holding something in the past, you would use "il tint" to mean "he held" and "elle tint" to mean "she held." Don't forget about the gender of nouns!, For first person plural, you conjugate tenir as "tînmes." So for example, if you wanted to say "we held hands" you would say "nous tînmes les mains.", The pronoun vous is used in French if you are talking to a group of people, or as a more polite or formal version of the pronoun tu. The conjugation for tenir in past tense is "vous tîntes" for "you all held.", When you are talking about some group of people or things, say "ils tinrent" or "elles tinrent" to mean "they held," depending on the gender of the people or things in the group. Use ils if you are referring to a mixed-gender group.

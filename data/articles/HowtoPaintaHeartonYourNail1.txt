 To create this nail art, you’ll need the following items: a base coat, a top coat, black nail polish, pink or red nail polish, silver nail polish, scotch tape and a toothpick.Mix it up and use both pink and red nail polish.
Try changing up the heart color for different finger nails.
Silver nail polish is optional.;
, Apply your base coat and allow your fingers to dry. Then paint two coats of black nail polish on your fingers, making sure to allow the nails to dry in between each coat.








After applying the second coat of paint, give your nails an additional hour to dry.
Run your fingers under cold water to accelerate the drying process.
 Remove one to three pieces of tape from the dispenser (pieces should be roughly half the size of your middle finger). Attach the corner of one piece of tape to the bottom of your nail, then angle the other two pieces of tape so they make a point at the tip of your nail. Alternatively, you can cut a heart shape out of a single piece of tape. 








If you look at your nail, the space not covered by tape should form an upside down heart.
If the tape doesn’t line up on your first attempt, un-stick it and try again.
 Use the pink or red nail polish you selected to fill in the blank space on your nail. Rip the tape off each nail as soon as you’re done painting the heart – otherwise, the polish will become sticky and hard to remove.








Apply the tape and paint the heart nail on each of your fingers.
Then give the hearts time to dry.
You can either leave the hearts alone, or choose to outline them in the silver polish.
To do this, dip your toothpick into the silver polish, then use the toothpick to carefully outline the heart on each nail.
After each nail has dried, paint top coat on each nail, then give the nails an additional hour to dry completely.

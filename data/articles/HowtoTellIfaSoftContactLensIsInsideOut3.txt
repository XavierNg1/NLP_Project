 Some lens manufacturers laser etch small numbers into their lenses that make this process even easier. Set the lens on your forefinger, rounded side down. Simply look for the numbers when viewing the lens from the side. If they are right-side up, the lens is oriented correctly., If you have a tinted lens, there will be a specific look to it if it’s inverted. Hold the lens on your fingertip and lower your hand. From there, look downward. If the edge is tinted in a blue or green color, which is dependent on the type of tint in the lens, then it’s in the right position. If the edges look like another color, they are inverted., If none of the other tests make it clear, you might have to insert the contact lens as it is. Unless you’re brand new to contact lenses, there will be a definite change in feel when a contact lens is inserted inside out. It will feel irritable, itchy, and uncomfortable.There may be a bit of confusion, however, because similar irritability can occur with a dirty lens that is inserted properly.

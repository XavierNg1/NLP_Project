, Try to find a plastic pouch with a document for service technicians.,,  The screws are on the inside top portion of the door.  You will need a special screwdriver, maybe the star type.

The control panel should allow you to pull it out enough to angle the front of the panel toward the floor revealing the inside.  Wires will prevent it from falling.
  It has two latches on the right, one on the left and one on the top – you should be able to do this by hand.

You can see the control board, wire connections, etc.
  Be prepared to support the control panel with your knees at this point.,  You will leave this detached for the test.,

At this point there should be no parts not reassembled.  The only difference from where you found the dishwasher should be that the ribbon from the control panel is not attached to the control board.
The unit should be ready for the test identified in the document.
 

The test indicates that if the dishwasher does nothing, the problem is the control board.  If the result is that the drain pump ran for two minutes, the problem is the control panel.

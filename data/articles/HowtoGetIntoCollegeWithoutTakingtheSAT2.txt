 In some states, students who graduate in the top of their class are automatically accepted into public universities in that state. In Texas, for example, all students who graduate in the top 10% of their class are automatically accepted to public schools.You may still have to take the SAT to be admitted to a public university in Texas, depending on the school you choose, but your scores will not factor into the admissions decision, so it doesn't matter if you did poorly.
 Some universities offer a wide variety of options for submitting standardized test scores, which could be very beneficial to students who perform very strongly in certain academic areas.


New York University, for example, will accept the scores from three SAT subject tests, AP tests, or IB higher-level tests in lieu of traditional SAT or ACT scores. This allows students to submit scores that are reflective of their high achievements in specific subjects., A growing number of US universities are now "test optional," which means that students can decide whether or not to submit standardized test scores as a part of their application. In fact, more than 800 universities now admit at least some students without SAT or ACT scores.If you choose not to submit SAT or other standardized test scores with your application, you should make sure that the rest of your application is very strong. You should spend extra time on your personal essay, making sure that it tells your unique story of personal achievement.You might be required to submit samples of academic work that you did for your high school classes in lieu of test scores. The requirements are different for each school, so read the application instructions carefully., Hampshire College has a "test blind" policy, in which it states that it will not consider SAT or ACT scores for admissions at all, whether the scores are good or bad. Instead, admissions are based on transcripts, personal essays, interviews, and extracurricular involvement.Hampshire College's policy is very unique, but it is possible that other colleges will adopt similar policies in the years to come.

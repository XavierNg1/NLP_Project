 Steaming helps to relax and open the pores in your skin, which can help to clean them, but it also opens them up to more inflammation and can lock in any dirt already on your face. Before you steam your face, you need to wash it with room temperature water thoroughly, getting any dirt, grime, make-up, and oils off of your skin before you start. Never steam your face before cleaning your face.;
, You can steam your skin in any clean bowl, sink, or other water basin. It's usually done by draping a towel over your face and the sink creating a tent to trap the steam and heat inside, softening your skin and opening your pores.


Make sure you clean the surface of the water basin thoroughly with soap, and rinse it out before you attempt to steam your face. In the past it was thought that antibacterial soap would be helpful, but newer studies have shown that antibacterial soaps can cause superbugs, that is why ordinary detergent or soap is recommended. This will remove germs stuck to the bottom of your sink and you can be reassured that you will not vaporize germs.
 Relax and breathe deeply, enjoying the effect of the steam. This is a common feature of spa treatments, helping also to relieve sinus problems and other respiratory issues.


It's important that you do this for no more than 5-10 minutes at a time, and no more than once or twice a week. Over-steaming your face can eventually dry it out, which can eventually result in your skin over-producing oil to try to make up for the lack of moisture in your skin.
 To close your skin back up, rinse your face with cold water and moisturize, using a natural moisturizer. It's important to use cold water to close your pores gently and naturally, not products made from glycerine and alcohol, which can be extremely irritating to sensitive skin.

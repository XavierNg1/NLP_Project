 Teenage Sims can get jobs too, but keep in mind that they will be stressed after school and will also need to find the time to do their homework.
 This will make your Sims become stressed quickly unless they have the 'Workaholic' trait, so once they get the 'Stressed' or 'Overworked' moodlet, have them either talk to their co-workers or slack off for awhile. Slacking off will, however, lower their job performance and can possibly get them fired., Make sure that your Sims are in a good mood before they leave for work, and make sure to work on the skills required for the job as well. (For example, if your Sim has a career in science, have your Sim work on the 'gardening' skill.) Try to get a promotion in 2 work days., Start off in a starter home with 1 or 2 Sims, female or male. Then, once you get enough money from your job to add a kids' room, make it a nursery at first, unless you are adopting a child.

 Cut back dead or dying shoots to the healthy wood. All other shoots must be treated as follows.;
, On rose bushes, these are shoots that you would target for removal. For climbing miniature roses, however, these shoots remain important for continued climbing growth. Remove only the tips of these growing shoots.

 Cut back and shorten flowering shoots that have grown along the length of the previous year's branches. When doing this, leave one or two buds of the thinnest shoots. The rest can be removed.
 These can, in the main, be kept. Tie these shoots back into the framework regularly to encourage growth in the pattern that you consider desirable.

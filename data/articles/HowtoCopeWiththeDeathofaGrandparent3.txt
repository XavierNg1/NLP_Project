 If you are younger in age and struggling with the death of a grandparent, you may want to reach out to a counselor at your school. Talk about any emotions or feelings you may be having and how you struggling to process these feelings. Often, your grief can lead to other issues, such as doing poorly in school or feeling socially isolated from others. Sharing your feelings with a counselor may help to alleviate some of your sadness and grief, allowing you to start to feel better.The counselor may suggest coping with your grief by taking up extracurricular activities you enjoy doing. She may also help you recognize any triggers in your external environment that could cause you to feel sad, upset, or depressed.The counselor can also teach you positive coping strategies, where you channel your negative feelings into positive actions, such as doing relaxation exercises, socializing with family and friends, getting enough sleep, and maintaining a healthy diet., You can also seek professional help from a grief counselor or a therapist that specializes in grief. Talk to your parents if you are of a younger age and experiencing intense feelings of loss that will not go away or that are conflicting with your day to day life.The therapist may suggest writing down your feelings and emotions in a journal, run through role playing exercises with you, and help you to process any feelings of "unfinished business" with your deceased grandparent so you can gain a sense of closure., There are many grief support groups that you can join, whether in your area, or online. Look for a support group that focuses on the loss of a grandparent or an elder. Often, it can be very comforting to talk to others who are experiencing very similar emotions as you in a safe, welcoming environment.

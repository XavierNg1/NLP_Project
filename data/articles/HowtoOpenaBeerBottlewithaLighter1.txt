 Curl your index finger just under the cap, leaving only a little bit of space. The closer you can get your finger under the cap and still fit the lighter edge underneath the easier this will be.









Your finger will be the fulcrum that holds the lighter under the cap. As you push down on the lighter, your finger will keep it pinned under the cap until it pops off. Thus, the closer your finger is to the bottom of the cap, the better.;
, Don't use the rounded corner. Instead, use the long plastic edge of the lighter bottom and place it under the cap. One side will be resting on your left pointer finger, curled around the top of the bottle (if you're right-handed).









The lighter should be perpendicular to the beer bottle., You want to be able to push down on it with smooth, even force.
 Your finger acts as the fulcrum that pops the cap off, so it needs to be firm.
 You should feel the lighter digging slightly into your finger, but quick downward pressure should pop the top quickly. It is exactly the same pressure and firm movement that you would use with a traditional bottle opener.









It may help to angle the beer slightly towards the lighter. If so, push down parallel to the bottle to get the most force on the lighter.

 Keeping the lights on in the baby’s room may keep him/her awake. When it’s dark, the brain begins releasing melatonin, which triggers sleep. Keep the lights off at night, which will help the baby recognize when it’s time to sleep. Dim the lights around the house when bedtime approaches. This will help the baby get ready to sleep by recognizing that the light is starting to fade.
If you need a nightlight in the room, use one that gives off bluish light, instead of yellow or white light. The bluish light will be less stimulating for the brain.
 The baby’s room should be around 70 degrees. This will be the most comfortable for the baby. Cover the baby with a light blanket and he/she should be warm enough.
 If the baby shares a room with an older sibling, it might be too stimulating to sleep. If the baby sleeps in the parent’s room, and someone goes in and out of the room a lot, this can disrupt the baby’s sleep. Move the baby to a different, quieter room.
 Calming lullaby music can soothe the baby and lull him/her to sleep. Nature sounds, such as rain or ocean sounds, are also calming. Play the music at a low volume.


Singing lullabies to the baby will also work.White noise can also help calm the baby. White noise machines can be purchased at major retailers. You can also use a fan or air filter for white noise. Just be sure to point the fan away from the baby.
 While some babies respond to music, others need silence to sleep. Turn off music and eliminate other noises. Close the door to the baby’s room. This will help control sound traveling into the baby’s room.

, The fun grows when you create your own name! This rule also applies to your cat's personality and appearance. Avoid building your cat off one of the original Warrior Cats and from other people's characters. Be creative and original!

, A Mary Sue is a character that is completely perfect. They are super strong, nice, smart, skilled, and beautiful. They never lose or get angry, and they usually have bad pasts. To avoid Mary Sues, think about your cat. If it is small, they can be fast and smart, but they will most likely be weak. Make your characters a little dumb, or maybe a little mean. But remember that every cat has to have some flaws.

 The first thing you must know is where Mushroom no. 3 is located. It can be be found at the bridge in Beast's Castle, the same place where you battled with Xaldin.;
, You'll need to equip 2 in order for Sora to draw in orbs that are far from him.
 Equip as much as you can, if possible.
 This keyblade also has Draw ability.
 Beast often gets in the way of Sora's glide and quick run because he's large, so it's better to remove him.
, Locking on to it will be troublesome when you miss some orbs since the camera will follow it.
 It will start dropping some orbs, but with a lot of draws equipped, you won't have to move much yet.
 Do this when the mushroom moves faster and drops a large number of orbs.


Luckily, the mushroom's movements are linear, so you'll be able to collect all the orbs by using quick run.
 Eventually, the mushroom will move faster and you'll have to glide after it.
 Mushroom no. 3 is one of the hardest mushrooms to beat, so you might have to repeat this a lot before you get it right.

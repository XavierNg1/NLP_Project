 If you want to use toothpaste to clean more of your face than just a few isolated spots, it's possible to construct a face wash which features toothpaste. Given the potential for toothpaste to irritate your skin, this is generally not recommended. Be sure to test the toothpaste on your skin before considering this.


There is no fixed formula, but you can just mix a small squeeze of toothpaste in a cup of water.
You probably shouldn't use more than a teaspoon, but you will have to judge how much of it an irritant it is to your skin.
 Once you have mixed the solution you can gently apply it to a clean face. Lightly brush the liquid onto your skin, ensuring that it does not sting or cause any irritation. Use plenty of water and don't scrub at your skin with your hands.


If your skin feels sore or irritated wash it off immediately.
Don't mistake dryness, redness or tightness for an indication that the solution is effectively drying out your pimples., Gently wash it off as you would with any other face wash, and pat your face dry with a soft towel. Given the potential for toothpaste to dry and irritate your skin, it's a good idea to apply a moisturiser to your face after using toothpaste. Ensure your hands are clean before you do this. If our skin is red, sore, or irritated, considered alternative ways to clean your face.

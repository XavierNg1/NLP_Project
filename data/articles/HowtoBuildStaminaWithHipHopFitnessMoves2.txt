 Many hip hop moves require coordinated feet, leg, arm and head movements. Repeat each move 50 to 100 times, until you feel you have the coordination to speed up.


If you need more time than the instructor is giving you, pause your DVD or computer, or ask the instructor to take a little extra time to work with you. If you are uncomfortable, you can stand in the back until you have picked up the coordination and stamina you need to work through a routine.
 Do the same move quickly 20 to 50 times before moving onto the next move.
 The more times you repeat the dance, the better your moves will be and the more endurance you will gain. Try to dance for at least 30 minutes at 1 time, and then work your way to 45 minutes to an hour.
 Hip hop fitness training should be mixed in with other workouts or with resting days. However, it is essential to train 2 to 3 times per week to increase your stamina in a noticeable way.


It is important to remember that even if you cannot devote 2 to 3 times per week to hip hop fitness, any cardiovascular exercise is helpful to your body. It increases your lung capacity and lowers your risk of heart disease and diabetes.
 Once you feel confident that you have enough stamina and coordination to dance for at least 30 minutes in succession, you will be qualified and enjoy an intermediate class.
 This means you have developed considerable stamina. You have improved your fitness, and you are likely to be able to do other cardiovascular exercise for longer periods of time as well.

Alternatively, you can submit two forms of ID from a list that includes a Social Security card, vehicle registration, student ID, traffic ticket, pay stub, auto insurance card, and hunting license, among others. One of the two valid forms must be signed.
A notarized (stamped/sealed) signature on the Certificate Request Form will also suffice, as will a court order.
Lastly, you could have an immediate family member with a valid photo ID request the copy for you.

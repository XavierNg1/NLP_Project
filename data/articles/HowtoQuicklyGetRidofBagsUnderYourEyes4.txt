 Before applying any makeup, dab some eye cream over the bags. Give it a few minutes to dry before continuing.Choose an eye cream the moisturizes. For an added boost, consider one containing retinols or caffeine.
Regardless of the type you choose, the eye cream will help moisturize the skin and fill in any fine lines that could otherwise trap cosmetics., Lightly apply concealer that matches your skin tone over the bags beneath your eyes. Use the applicator or a brush to pat it on, but avoid rubbing it into the skin since doing so could cause further irritationFor best results, choose a lightweight concealer with a creamy texture. Heavier concealers can sink into the fine lines beneath your eyes and highlight skin damage.Avoid using your fingers when applying concealer since doing so increases the risk of applying too much. A small, flat brush is your best option., While only optional, adding a bronzer to your cheeks can help minimize the appearance of swollen bags beneath your eyes. Apply the bronzer to your cheeks and blend it upward to the area just beneath your eyes using a standard powder brush.The contrast created by the bronzer can help minimize the appearance of bags without covering them directly. Avoid bronzers with shimmer, however, since these can actually highlight bags.
 Use a brush with splayed bristles to lightly dust loose, translucent powder beneath your eyes and over your cheeks.The powder should help set your makeup and prevent it from gathering in the creases and fine lines of the skin around your eyes.

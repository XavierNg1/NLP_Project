 Conditioning leather keeps it from cracking and getting dried out. Once you’ve cleaned your leather boots, pour some liquid leather conditioner onto a dry, soft cloth. Rub the conditioner into the leather using small circular motions. Let the conditioner dry and soak in.








Conditioners also come in wax and gels. Use whichever type you prefer.
Your boots must be completely clean each time you condition.
 Smooth-finished shoes will look a little shiny. These shoes can be polished to give them a mirror-like appearance. Use a soft cloth you don’t mind throwing away to rub the polish onto the surface of the leather in small circular motions.








Shoe polishes come in a variety of colors, and you should use the color that matches your boots. Go online if you need to find a uniquely colored shoe polish.
For a non-commercial polish, pour a small circle of olive oil onto a dry, soft cloth and rub that onto the surface of the boots., Just as they can’t be cleaned with normal leather cleaners, suede shoes also can’t handle normal conditioners and polishes. Instead, purchase a suede protector spray. This should be evenly sprayed on the surface of the boots after you’ve brushed them down.Let the spray air dry on the shoes.

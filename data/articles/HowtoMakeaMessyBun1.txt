 The following is a quick list of things you may already have around your home. Even if you don't have these things, don't worry, the messy bun can be easily created with just your fingers and a rubber-band. It is also easy enough to find all of the following items at your local 24-hour drug store. If you are thinking of creating a messy bun for a more important event like a wedding or prom you can plan ahead and find a store that specializes in carrying hair care products and accessories.


For the quick and simple messy bun up-do, you will need about 5 minutes, your fingers, and a rubber-band.
If you have more time, gather a soft brush, wide-tooth comb and an elastic ponytail holder. Preferably an elastic holder without a metal clasp to reduce the chance of hair damage.
Hair works best for a messy bun if it is two days after initial washing.;
, Select a light-weight mousse that will allow your hair to be easily pliable yet still appear soft and natural. For extra body, select a mousse that says it includes a volumizing agent. This will be displayed on the mousse bottle. If you have very soft and fine hair or want your messy bun up-do to last for a long time, pick out a hairspray that you like to ensure your messy bun stays intact.


For the most natural look, choose a hair spray with a micro-fine mist for minimal build up that you can apply and reapply without washing your hair.
For a more extreme edgy look, choose a hair spray that offers massive volume without stiffness.
If you have extremely soft or freshly washed hair, you can also experiment with dry shampoo or hair salt spray to add texture. (optional)

, Purchase some plain bobby pins, decorative flowers, bling gem-studded hair pins, small decorative hair clips, or similar hair items. When searching for such items remember to keep them delicate and classy. (optional)

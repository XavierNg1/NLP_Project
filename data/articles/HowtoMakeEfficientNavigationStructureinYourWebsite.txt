 This is done to ensure that visitors donâ€™t get lost when they go too deep in the site, and return to the home page easily with just one click and look for different information. Use a graphic banner or a logo for your homepage link. Keep it somewhere obvious, usually on the top of the site's pages.;
, This enables the visitor who has entered your site from a search engine to backtrack at any point and return to the parent page. It also tells them their location within the site. Use the hard-coded bread crumbs or JavaScript bread crumbs to make the breadcrumb trail.
 For long pages, in-page navigation is necessary. This is where page jumps helps. With just one click and your visitor reaches the part of the content he/she is searching for.Remember, too much scrolling makes the visitor give up after some time and leave the site. A page jump helps you avoid that.
 This link takes the visitor to the top of the page. Place "back to top" links at the end of every section.
 A site-map is an important part of a website. It clearly shows all the contents of the site in one page, structured and hyper-linked for the convenience of visitors. Apart from making the navigation structure user-friendly, it also aids the search engine spiders/crawlers

, In other words, keep your pages medium in length. Long pages, although they make navigation simpler and shorter, are boring to visitors. On the other hand, very short pages makes creating a navigation structure a hard process and the visitor is bored from going from page to page too many times to find what he/she wants.

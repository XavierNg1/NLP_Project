 Your data should have column headers, row headers and data in the middle to make the most out of your graph.


In Excel, "columns" refer to vertical depth. If you look at the above pictures, the columns are labeled with letters, and go from top to bottom: "A," "B," "C," etc.
"Rows," on the other hand, refer to horizontal distance. They are labeled with numbers, and go from left to right: "1," "2," "3," etc.
 If you want the column labels and the row labels to show up in the graph, ensure that those are selected also.
 In some versions of Excel, you can also try navigating to the Charts tab in the Ribbon tab and selecting the specific kind of graph you'd like to use. This will create your a graph on a “chart sheet.” A chart sheet is basically a spreadsheet page within a workbook that is totally dedicated to displaying your graph.


For Windows users, you can create a graph with a shortcut by hitting the F11 button on your keyboard.
 Select the perfect kind of graph depending on what information you have and how you want to present it — don't just settle for any old one. Different versions of Excel allow you to change the chart type in various different ways:


Change your chart on the Chart toolbar, which appears after your chart is created. Click on the arrow next to the Chart Type button and click on the whatever type of chart you'd like.
Manipulate the chart types in the Chart Layout tab in the Ribbon tab. Some versions of Excel won't have a "Chart Toolbar," but instead will keep the same basic information in a whole tab devoted to charts.

 Arrange the asparagus spears in a microwavable dish with the tips pointing in the center, if possible.


The tips are a more tender part of the asparagus spear, so they tend to cook faster than the woody stalk. As a result, these tips are also more likely to become mushy if overcooked.
Since the center of the microwave receives less heat than the outside, placing the tips toward the center will help prevent them from cooking too fast.
Note, however, that if you are using a rectangular dish can cannot arrange the asparagus spears in this manner; you can just line the spears up evenly. They should still cook without any problems.
 Only add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of liquid. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.


If you want the flavor of the asparagus to shine on its own, or if you plan to season the asparagus or toss it in a dressing after you cook it, use water.
If you want to add a quick boost of flavor to the asparagus as you cook it, however, try either orange juiceor white wine., Cover the dish and microwave on full power until the spears become tender.


If the dish has a microwave-safe lid, use the lid, but open any built-in vents before putting it on or put the lid on slightly askew to prevent too much steam and pressure from building up inside.
If you are microwaving cuts and tips instead of whole spears, only cook the asparagus for 3 to 5 minutes at full power.
Stir the asparagus halfway through to promote even cooking.
 Let the dish stand for 5 minutes before serving, then transfer the cooked asparagus to individual serving dishes.


Be careful when removing the cover from your container. A great deal of steam can build up during the cooking process, and you can burn your hands or face if you get your skin too close.
Add a dollop of butter or garlic butter to the asparagus before serving, if desired. Toss the asparagus spears gently to coat them.

, Recently Deleted is a system folder. Every iOS system will have it - it cannot be deleted.
 You will see all your recently deleted photos and videos from your iPhone or iPad here.


Photos and videos under the Recently Deleted album are the ones you’ve recently deleted over the last 40 days. They are kept here until such time, before they’re permanently deleted.
 Each of the photos and videos under the Recently Deleted album has a timer showing the remaining days before its permanent deletion. These timers are found on the bottom part of the thumbnails. After the photos are deleted from their original albums, they stay in the Recently Deleted album for about 40 days.
 You can recover individual photos or videos or recover them in a batch.

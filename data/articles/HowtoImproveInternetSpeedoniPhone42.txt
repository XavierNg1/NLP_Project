 This app is grey with gears on it. You'll likely find it on the Home Screen., It's near the top of the screen., You'll see a blue checkmark next to your phone's current Wi-Fi network. If this network is different than your home (or otherwise ideal) network, tap your home network's name to disconnect from your current network and connect to that one instead.

This can happen when your neighbors' Wi-Fi is unprotected or you're in a public place (e.g., a coffee shop).

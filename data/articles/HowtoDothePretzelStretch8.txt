 If you are quite flexible, then you should be able to get into a pretzel stretch using a t-kick. Start by kicking your left leg out to the side and up into the air a few times to get warmed up.
 When you feel ready, grasp your left foot with your left hand. Hold onto your left foot for a moment. Regain your balance if you need to.
 As soon as you have your balance, wrap your left arm in front of your left thigh and bring it around your body towards your back. Press your left arm into your left thigh to keep it in place.
 Next, reach your right arm around your right side towards your left hand. Connect your hands and point your toe upwards. Hold the stretch for as long as you want.

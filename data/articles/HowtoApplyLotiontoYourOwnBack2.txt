 You can use a plastic or rubber spatula, and a wooden one will work too, but avoid a metal spatula. If you have multiple options, opt for whichever one has the longest handle.You may not want to use a spatula that you frequently use to cook. If possible, buy one that you can designate for the purpose of applying lotion.
It’s possible to get splinters from a wooden spatula, so be careful when using one.
 Keep the spatula as flat as you can when you squirt the lotion onto it so that you don’t drop any onto the ground. You may do better to use a little less lotion and make more than one application.
 Do your best to keep the spatula flat with the lotion side up, bend your arm around to your back and place the lotion against your lower back.
 Move the head of the spatula around in a circle covering your lower back first and moving up to your mid-back. You can then reach over your shoulder from the top and apply lotion to your upper back as well.


Add more lotion if you need to and repeat the process until you have covered all areas of your back.

 Whenever you feel a junk food craving coming on, try to distract yourself with another activity, such as going for a walk, doing a hobby you like, or talking to a friend. Focus on another activity and fill your time with something positive, rather than reach for the junk food.For example, maybe you avoid buying a bag of chips at the store by calling up a friend and chatting with them instead. Or perhaps you avoid the candy aisle by going for a walk around the block instead.
 It can be hard to resist the temptation to have junk food when you know it is close by. Remove this temptation by not keeping junk food in your home. This way, you will not be tempted to eat it., One of the major reasons why you eat junk food is because you are feeling emotions like stress, boredom, or anxiety. Whenever you feel these emotions coming on, try to focus on healthy things you can do instead of having junk food. Pour your anxiety or stress into exercise. Pick a healthy food option rather than junk food.For example, if you are cramming for an exam and you are feeling stressed, go get a healthy snack like fresh fruit or a veggie wrap. Skip the junk food and go to an exercise class at the gym instead so you feel less stressed out.
 Positive affirmations are short phrases or sentences that you can say aloud to help you focus and remain optimistic. You can say positive affirmations in front a mirror first thing in the morning or right before bed to place yourself in a positive mindset. Use positive affirmations whenever you feel a junk food craving coming on to remind you to stay away.For example, you may use positive affirmations like “I will not eat junk food today,” or “I deserve better food than junk food.”

 WCDs (or wearable cardioverter defibrillators) are medical devices worn on the body, that help prevent sudden cardiac arrest. WCDs, such as the Life vest, resemble tight-fitting fishing vests and are worn under the clothes. These vests monitor cardiovascular activity, and can deliver life-saving electric shocks to correct the heart rhythm if a problem is detected.Understand that the research is limited. These devices are relatively new and still being researched.;
, There are numerous reasons why an individual may not be able to have a defibrillator implant right away, for instance, if a patient has an infection of the heart stream or has recently given birth. Furthermore, sometimes there will simply be a wait period until individuals can undergo implant surgery. WCDs should be used to protect the patient during these wait periods.The device is commonly used for a period of 30 – 90 days. Other situations in which you might need a WCD include:To prevent SCA while the underlying heart condition is established (such as following a recent heart attack)
If your ICD has been temporarily removed due to infection
If you are in end-stage heart failure or have a life expectancy of less than year, but would otherwise be a candidate for ICD

, If you feel that a wearable cardioverter defibrillator may be a good option for you, speak to your doctor about this possibility. A WCD is only available under the direction of a physician. Many insurance companies cover the cost of the device.You might ask, “Am I at risk for sudden cardiac arrest?”
You might say, “Am I eligible to use a wearable cardioverter defibrillator?”
You might say, “I think wearing a vest like this would help me feel safe.”

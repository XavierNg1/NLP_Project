 You can use concentrated Miracle Gro plant fertilizer to oxidize your copper quickly. Mix approximately one part Miracle Gro with three parts water for a bluer patina, or with red wine vinegar for a greener one.Apply with a spray bottle or rag, doing so unevenly if you want to create a more natural, aged appearance. It should develop a patina within 30 minutes, and reach a more permanent state within 24 hours.
 White vinegar can produce a green or blue patina on copper, but requires another material to hold the moisture close to the metal. Let the copper soak in a mixture of white vinegar and salt, or bury it in sawdust or even crushed potato chips, then soak the mixture with vinegar.Place in a sealed container for 2â€“8 hours, checking on the color regularly, then remove and air dry. Use a soft brush to gently remove solid materials.
 Fill a container 1/2 inch (1.25cm) deep with pure non-detergent ammonia, outdoors or in a well ventilated area. Spray the copper with saltwater, and place it above the level of the ammonia, on top of a wooden block. Cover the container and check back every hour or two until the copper is dark brown with blue hints.Remove from the bucket and air dry until a bright, blue color develops.



Warning: always wear gloves and safety glasses when handling ammonia. Do not use the container that held ammonia to hold food or water.
The more salt you use, the more noticeable the color will be.

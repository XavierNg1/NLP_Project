 There are many sprays available in supermarkets and hardware stores designed to kill all manner of flying insects. Simply spray the insecticide onto the gnats themselves, or in the usual areas they inhabit. This will immediately kill any and all gnats and other insects.


Make sure to check the label to find out if the insect spray is harmful to pets. Depending on the strength of the spray, you, your family and your pets may need to stay out of the sprayed area for several hours until the chemicals dissipate.

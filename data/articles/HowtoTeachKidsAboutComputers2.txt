 Examples of computer etiquette include understanding that food and drink must be kept away from computers at all times, and that keyboards, mouses, and other accessories should be handled gently without pounding or other physical abuse.


Monitor kids' computer use at all times to verify that they are handling and treating the computers safely and respectfully. This can help prevent kids from causing any accidents that can permanently damage computers; such as dropping laptops on the floor, or spilling food and drinks on computers and keyboards.
 Since most computers are driven by commands from a mouse as opposed to keyboard commands, teaching kids how to use a mouse is a major first step in learning about computers.


Modify the mouse settings on your computer to achieve a slower mouse speed, if needed. A slower mouse speed can help kids become familiar with the process for using a mouse, especially if you are teaching young toddlers or children who are still developing their motor skills.
 Kids should be taught to position their hands appropriately over a keyboard to type, as opposed to adapting a "hunt and peck" typing method.


Use typing software that teaches kids about proper hand and finger placement on a keyboard, and that contains a series of lessons that progress as kids develop their typing skills.
 The Internet can be a resourceful tool in completing homework assignments, and can be an ideal way for kids to strengthen their computer skills.


Show kids how to enter specific keywords and queries into search engines such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo. For example, if a kid's homework assignment is about alligators, show them how to enter specific keyword phrases into a search engine, such as "types of alligator species," or "breeds of alligators."
Teach kids about ways to find legitimate information sources. For example, show kids how to choose websites that can provide reliable information on a topic, such as websites that end in either ".edu," or ".org."

 This keeps them from flailing out when it's tied around your head.


They can slightly overlap; wrapping the scarf around your head will obscure any angles anyway.
 There are two ways you can do this:


Start at one end and fold until you reach the other.
Fold each side up a bit at a time until they meet in the center.
 Start with the scarf at the base of your neck.


If you like a bit of an asymmetrical look, start with your head a bit off the center of the scarf.
 They should meet near the top of your forehead. This keeps it sturdier and less likely to fall off. Twist it tight!


It should create a sort of entwined "x" shape.
Adjust your hair as the shape of the scarf forms.
 The scarf should lie on or just behind your hairline.


Tuck the loose ends in the first layer of the scarf.

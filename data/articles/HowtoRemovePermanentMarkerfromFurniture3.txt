 Hardware stores should have a stock of commercial carpet cleaners. You can ask one of the employees for a recommendation, but most cleaners will list what they work best for on the bottle. Lift Off #3is an example but you can get any number of products.
 Commercial products often contain chemicals that can cause damage if used on the wrong surface. Check the labels to make sure it is appropriate for the specific surface you need to clean.
 You can get these at places like Target or Walgreens. They work great, even on bamboo items!


Use furniture oil if the sheen gets rubbed off.
Other products such as Goo Gone or Bon Ami can remove permanent marker stains and are available at most hardware stores.

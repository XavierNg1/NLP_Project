 Crack open two eggs into a small mixing bowl. Add the vanilla extract and the salt. For extra flavor, add in ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Stir everything together with a whisk until the yolks break and the color is even., Measure out the almond flour and add it to the bowl. Pour the milk in next. Stir everything together with a whisk until everything is combined.

Add another 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of almond milk of the batter is too thick for you.
 Set a skillet on the stove and turn the heat up to medium. Heat the pan enough to sizzle a drop of water.Next, grease it with oil, butter, or cooking spray. To keep the pancakes from getting splotchy, wipe off most of the butter/oil with a paper towel., Depending on the size of the skillet, you may be able to fit more than one pancake—just be sure to leave some space between each one.

A soup ladle is great for measuring out the water and pouring it.
 Wait for bubbles to form on the pancake. Once the bubbles start to pop, slide a spatula under the pancake and flip it over onto the other side., The pancake is ready when it is golden-brown on both sides. Use a spatula to transfer the pancake from the skillet to a plate., Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) for each one. Re-grease the skillet after every couple of pancakes, and remember to wipe the excess grease off with a paper towel., You can pour some maple syrup on top if you want a traditional meal. For something a little different, try whipped cream or sliced fruit.

 Unless you plan to cover the carpet with one consistent color, get out your tape measure and map out the design you’d like to create. Use a washable marker to create your map––consider using a light color that won’t be visible underneath the paint.


Tape out areas that you don’t want to paint. Especially if you're using multiple colors, you’ll want to tape out the area you plan to paint using a specific color. Paint, allow it to dry, remove the tape and then re-tape the area in preparation of the next color.

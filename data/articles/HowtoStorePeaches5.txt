 Thoroughly mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of ascorbic acid with 1 cup (250 ml) of white granulated sugar.Both the sugar and ascorbic acid act as preservatives, but the ascorbic acid also prevents the peaches from turning brown after you slice them.
This amount should be enough to coat several peaches. If you need more, mix another batch using the same proportions.
 Rinse the peaches under cold running water, then cut them into halves, quarters, or slices.


Work with only one or two peaches at a time. The cut peaches can brown quickly, so it's best to handle the peaches in small batches.
Cold water is ideal since it helps the fruit remain firm.
Remove the pit from the center of the peach before continuing.
You can leave the peel on the peaches or remove it. To remove it, blanch each peach in boiling water for 30 seconds, then immediately transfer it to a bowl of ice water. You should be able to slide the peel off with your fingers or a small knife afterward.
 Sprinkle the ascorbic acid sugar over the peaches. Coat the entire peach slice, paying special attention to any area with exposed flesh.
 Layer the cut peaches into an airtight, freezer-safe container or jar.


Packing the jar snug will limit the amount of air inside it, thereby preserving the peaches longer. You should not squeeze the peaches together, though, since doing so could damage the fragile flesh.
Fill the jar roughly three-quarters full. This will give the peaches adequate room to expand during the freezing process.
 Place the peach-filled containers in your freezer and use them within 10 to 12 months.


Thaw the peaches before use. Transfer the frozen peaches to your refrigerator for several hours or let them sit out on your kitchen counter for 30 to 45 minutes.

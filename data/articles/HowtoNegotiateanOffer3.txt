 Don't start in negotiating about where you're going on vacation if your spouse is trying to deal with cooking dinner or getting the kids ready for school. Choose a quiet time when you are both calm, and have time to talk it out., When it comes to negotiating with a family member, it will be necessary for you to make compromises to preserve the relationship. That means that you need to know where you will stand firm and what you're willing to give up., When you're negotiating with someone you love, you have much more at stake than with a stranger. Don't be afraid to be open and honest with the person, as more communication will lead to you both understanding what the other person wants., Really listen to what the other person has to say. Even if you can't give into everything he wants, you should let him know that you hear and understand what he's feeling., That is, instead of blaming the other person, discuss your feelings, and be specific.For instance, instead of saying "You're so annoying sometimes." you could say, "When you play your music so loudly, I find it hard to concentrate."

, A little levity can lighten up the situation. However, don't take it too far, as your family member or friend may think you're not taking them seriously., That is, take some time to think through the problem together. Maybe you can come up with a creative solution that makes both sides happy.Don't forget that in every relationship, you're on the same team. Try not to pit yourself against the other person.

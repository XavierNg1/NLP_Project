 If your dog has reflux, he may begin showing some of the following symptoms:


Spitting up food.
Pain when swallowing (your dog may whine when he tries to swallow).
Weight loss and a lack of appetite.
 The vet will use an endoscopy to determine if your dog has acid reflux or not. An endoscopy involves sending a small camera down your dogâ€™s throat to inspect the lining of the esophagus.A dog with acid reflux will have a red, raw, sore, ulcerated looking esophagus near the opening to the stomach.
 While this article outlines the steps you can take to help your dog, it is important to work with your vet to make sure that your dog gets the appropriate treatment given his specific medical history.

In Mark 12:31 it says, "The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.”, The only way to truly know if you feel like you belong to an individual church is to go their mass. Just because you visit does not mean that you have a responsibility to that church. The most important thing is that you feel a sense of belonging and feel as if the church can lift your faith and help fulfill you. If you don't feel that way because of the church, the ministry, or congregation, then you should try going to Mass at a different church.

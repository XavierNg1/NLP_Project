 Sibling rivalry is common and this can often lead to fighting and arguing. Support your sibling by trying to get along with them. Avoid petty arguments and fights. Use your communication skills to mediate any issues you might have with your sibling.Take a time out if you get upset. Step away from the conversation and take a five minute time out where you go off on your own to calm down and think. Then, return and start the conversation again with your sibling in a more relaxed manner.
 Sometimes siblings can be divided when one sibling sides with one parent or with other relatives. Try to support your sibling when they are in a conflict with a family member, even if you may not agree with their choice. Listen to their concerns and remind them that you love and care for them, despite the conflicts in the family.

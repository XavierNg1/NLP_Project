 This will affect how many ring links you need, as well as the amount of rubber bands you'll need.
 Variety of colors is a good look for this necklace, although if you'd prefer a one-hued or single-toned necklace, that's fine too.


Choose good quality, medium sized rubber bands.
You will need approximately four to five rubber bands per ring link.
The rubber bands can be all one size, or for more interesting effect, they can form an effect like hooped earrings, with the sizes descending or ascending. The only issue with this is that you must be very careful to align the sizes exactly for every single ring, thus it's a good idea to have a large workspace to assemble each loop set before assembling the necklace.
 The beads are optional but make a nice addition to "jazz up" the look of the necklace when completed, giving it a more artsy finish. The beads can be placed every few links, for best effect. Choose either all one color, or complementary colors.


The beads should not be too small or too large. They shouldn't dominate the necklace, nor should they be hard to see.
 Open the first ring link using the pliers. Slip on 4 to 5 rubber bands. Also slip on the next unopened ring. Using the pliers, close the ring. This forms the first chainlet.
 Slip on four to five rubber bands and the next unopened ring. Close the ring.
 Every three to four chainlets, add a bead as well and close it into that specific ring.
 The rubber bands will start to get in your way as you work, so be patient and take it slowly, carefully moving aside prior rubber bands to avoid catching them inside new chainlets.
 This makes it easier to undo and do up the necklace. Be sure to place a bead or two either side of the clasp and to keep the rubber bands well away from this area, as it's easy to catch them up when doing up the necklace.
 The necklace will look quite amazing when worn.

 Reasons for hair loss in the first place can vary. The classic issue of male pattern baldness is due to a testosterone derivative called dihydrotestosterone and the effect it has on hair follicles.Baldness due to a condition called alopecia areata comes from the body’s own immune system attacking hair follicles.In order to treat any specific case and potentially regrow hair, a doctor will first need to determine the cause of the hair loss.


Your doctor will likely run a panel to test for any severe vitamin deficiencies that could be responsible as well. For instance, a severe zinc deficiencyor vitamin D deficiencycan lead to hair loss; however, you should still consult a doctor to determine the true cause of your hair loss before self-diagnosing and beginning an over-the-counter vitamin regimen.;
, Once your doctor has run a few tests to discover the source of your hair loss, the treatment option may be as simple as an over-the-counter or prescription pill that can stop the hair loss and in many cases regrow hair.


If you doctor suspects that the hair loss was due to a vitamin deficiency such as zinc, then a zinc supplement can often reverse the process and lead to regrowth of normal hair quantities.If your doctor determines that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is to blame for the hair loss, then he or she may prescribe finasteride, which is known more commonly as Propecia or one of its generics.Finasteride is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in cases of hair loss because it lowers DHT levels in a way that stops hair loss and often achieves a level of regrowth. Side effects of Propecia include depression, sexual dysfunction & prostate cancer.If your doctor determines that your hair loss is due to the autoimmune disease alopecia areata—which is only about 1% of the population—then recent findings have shown a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors are effective in regrowing hair.These drugs stop hair loss and promote hair regrowth by suppressing the body’s immune response to the afflicted hair follicles. The arthritis drug Ruxolitinib has shown some of the most-positive results., In addition to oral medications, your doctor may discuss topical medications. The most common topical suggestion is minoxidil (Rogaine and its generics).Minoxidil is another option for DHT-related hair loss, and it most commonly requires application to the scalp twice a day.When applied in early stages of hair loss, minoxidil can not only stop hair loss but often stimulate regrowth.One of the drawbacks to minoxidil is that it requires strict adherence to the application regimen. When a man stops taking minoxidil, he will lose the regrown hair as a consequence., Hair transplant technology has come a long way, and your doctor may discuss this option with you as a permanent solution that doesn’t require daily medication. Your doctor can test to find areas of the scalp that are not affected by DHT, and small sections of these hair follicles can be grafted to the affected area of the scalp.Despite offering a permanent solution, transplant surgery is the most expensive option, often requiring several procedures to build a full look over time.Hair transplants are also the most common method suggested for regrowing hair in those with bald patches due to burns or other injuries that damaged original hair follicles.
 Only the third nonsurgical hair loss method to receive FDA approval, laser combs are hand-held devices that stimulate hair follicles with low-level lasers.Laser combs are still in their infancy and many dermatologists are wary of their ability to permanently regrow hair since they don’t affect DHT levels; however, early trials did increase hair growth in many participants.

 (If your lungs hurt while you're doing this, stop immediately and find a different way to breath in heavily without hurting your lungs. stay on the safe side);
, The noise that comes out should sound something like the stereotypical asthma attack that you'd see on a TV show, or even the ghost in The Ring. After being able to create this harsh breathing noise, form different "oh", "oo" and "ee" vowels using your lips, and mouth while in breathing. Some can achieve a better tone by manipulating the sound with their tongue. This is done by moving the tongue into different positions within the mouth, most of which involve making contact with the roof of the mouth with the back of your tongue.
 You pull in like when your sucking on a straw. That's how it should feel, but a lot tighter. You may think that this means that a pig squeal is always high-pitched, but this is not so. If you change your mouth position, the pitch of the squeal will change accordingly. Forming the shape for an "E" or sometimes an "A" causes it to be higher in pitch, while forming an "O" will drop the pitch.
, Just try to make your throat "tighter", and then breathe in. Use your vocal cords and make a "raspy" noise. You can also try to say the words "Quee" or "Bree" or any word that ends with "ee". After weeks of training you can say almost anything! WARNING! This WILL hurt your throat the first few times you do it, don't try too hard in the beginning. The more you do this the louder it will get. Don't try to impress people with it at first because your vocal chords are still developing and you might just have a little girl squeal.
 It is possible, but unlike the inhale, it must be done with a mic and over music. when making a deep growl at your next band practice, make a hard "R" sound and you will be amazed at the high pitch yell that comes out.

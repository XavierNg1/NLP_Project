 Press and hold the Windows key on your keyboard, and press R. This should open a small box in the lower left-hand side of your screen.
 In this box you will need to copy and paste the following command: shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}


This should open the GodMode Control Panel in a window automatically on your screen.
 Once the GodMode folder is open, you may want to get to know the new control panel a little bit better. This file is quite complex, as it contains about 270 different options, from 42 different categories, that allow you to control virtually any part of your system.


Once open, right-click the top item in the new window. Select “Collapse all groups” from the drop-down menu. This will allow you to view more of the different menu categories that are now available to you.

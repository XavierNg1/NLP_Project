 Some fitness balls have concentric rings marked around the ball; use the widest of these rings around the ball's “equator” to help you align the tape correctly.
 Fitness ball sizes are listed in diameter (the distance straight from one side of the sphere to the opposite side, passing through the center), not circumference. Divide the circumference by pi, or 3.14, to get the diameter.


For example, if your ball has a circumference of 172 centimeters, its diameter is 172 / 3.14 = 55cm.
Your exercise ball may stretch up to 24 hours after you inflate it. Measure your fitness ball when it’s fully inflated to ensure it’s the right size for your body.
 Fitness ball sizes are always measured in centimeters, even in countries that usually use Imperial measurements. If you measured in inches, you'll need to make the appropriate conversion.


The most common ball sizes, translated to centimeters and rounded up to the nearest inch, are: 45cm = 18 inches, 55cm = 22 inches, 65cm = 26 inches, and 76cm = 30 inches.

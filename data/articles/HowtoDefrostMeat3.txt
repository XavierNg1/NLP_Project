 This quick method works best with smaller pieces of evenly cut meat. The microwave will defrost the meat in a matter of minutes. However, this method can also partially cook the meat or make it tough, affecting the quality of the dish.The thawed food must be cooked immediately after thawing. If you can’t cook it immediately, wait to thaw it until you need it.
 First, remove any plastic packaging from the meat. This packaging will retain moisture that will “boil” the outside of the meat.Next, place the meat on a large, microwave safe plate. If there are thinner portions of meat, place them near the center of the plate to stop them from cooking in the microwave.Microwave safe plates include ceramic and glass plates that don’t have any metal embellishments.
Some frozen meats come on Styrofoam trays. These trays are not microwave safe and should be discarded.
 Each brand of microwave is slightly different. However, most brands have a special “defrost” button. To thaw the meat, place the meat in the microwave and press the “defrost” button. Then, your microwave will ask you to enter the weight of the meat. This measurement will be used to determine the thawing time for the meat.


Before using the “defrost” feature, read your manufacturer manual.
 Gently touch the sides to see if they’re warm. If they are, let the meat cool for a minute or so before continuing to defrost the meat. Once the microwave has finished defrosting the food, remove it from the microwave.Use a hand towel to remove the plate from the microwave to avoid burning your hand.
Wash your hands before and after touching raw meat to avoid food contamination.
 When you use a microwave to thaw frozen meat, you expose the meat to warm temperatures that can encourage the growth of bacteria. Therefore, the meat must be cooked immediately to avoid any food contamination.If you want to refreeze the meat, you must cook it first.

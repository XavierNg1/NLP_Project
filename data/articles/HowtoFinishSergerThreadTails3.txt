 Another way to secure the tail and prevent it from unraveling is to stitch over it with your serger. To do this, fold the tail over the edge of the fabric so that it is aligned with the other stitches.You can fold the tail right over top of the other stitches.
You can also fold the tail onto the backside of the garment to make it less visible.
 Next, place your fabric under your serger needle and serge over the tail to secure it. Stitch to the end of the tail. You only need to go over the tail once., After you reach the end of the tail, remove the fabric from the serger and snip off the excess thread from this new stitch.If desired, you can also add a dab of stitch sealant or fabric glue to the end of the tail and new stitch to help prevent fraying.

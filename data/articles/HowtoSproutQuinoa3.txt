 Transfer the quinoa from the bowl or sprouter to a large tray or plate. Move the quinoa away from direct sunlight to a darker area at room temperature. Cover the quinoa with a cloth to keep away dust or bugs.
 Once the quinoa is in a dark area you still have to continue to rinse it. Place the quinoa into a sprouter or a bowl again to repeat the rinse and drain cycle. As mentioned previously, continue to rinse and drain the quinoa every 8 to 12 hours over a period of 2 days. Allow time for the quinoa sprouts to dry out for future use after the final rinse and dry cycle.
 Put the tray of quinoa back into a dark room to continue the sprouting process. Place the cloth back over the quinoa for protection. The quinoa should eventually sprout into a plate full of spiral-shaped roots that are at least one-quarter inch in length. Let the quinoa sprouts dry out for up to 12 hours, since excess moisture damages the quinoa crop.

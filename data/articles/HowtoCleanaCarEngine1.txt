 Before you begin cleaning the engine, remove any leaves, grass, twigs or other debris from the engine bay. This debris can become an issue and even cause fires if left to sit on the engine or electrical system long enough.It is common for pine needles and leaves to collect at the bottom of the windshield and then fall into the engine bay.
Look for small animal nests, particularly as the weather becomes cooler.;
, Spraying water directly into your engine bay could cause some of the electrical components to arc, blowing fuses or causing other damage. Prevent this by loosening the bolt on the negative terminal on the battery and sliding the ground cable off of the terminal.You may choose to disconnect the positive terminal as well to remove and clean the battery outside of the engine bay.
If you leave the battery in the vehicle, tuck the ground cable to the side to prevent it from coming into contact with the terminal.
 While your engine is fairly waterproof, wrapping plastic around some electrical components can offer you a higher degree of safety. Cover the spark plug inlets, loose wires and the distributor cap if your vehicle came equipped with one.Small plastic bags or plastic cling wrap work well to offer protection from water.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual if you are unsure if it came equipped with a distributor or where to find the spark plug inlets.
 Grease on the engine will be much easier to remove when heated. Start the vehicle and allow it to run for five or so minutes. This will allow the engine to get to normal operating temperature and loosen any stuck on grime.Don’t leave the engine running for too long, or you may burn yourself when you begin to clean again.

 Before you begin with the upgrade, keep in mind that it might take some time before the download is finished. It is therefore best to prepare your device before you start downloading.


To make sure that there will be no interruptions, plug in your device to a power source that will keep your device powered-up for the download time.;
, The iOS 8 system update takes up about 1 GB of space, but iPhones and iPads needs to have 4.6 GB of free space before they could download iOS 8. It is better to first back up your files using iCloud or iTunes and remove your files to free up your device space.
 Updating your device wirelessly is the easiest way to upgrade to iOS 8.


Connect wirelessly via the Wi-Fi. Open your device and look for the Settings icon. The Settings icon is the gear-like icon. Tap on the application to launch it.
Once inside, look for the word “Wi-Fi” and tap on it. Turn on the Wi-Fi by sliding the white circle beside the word “Wi-Fi” from left to right.
After the available networks are shown, choose the network that you are going to connect to by tapping on it. If required to provide a password, type in the password and tap on “Join.”

, Go back to the Settings menu by tapping on “Settings” on the upper left corner of your screen.


Once you are under Settings again, swipe your finger over the screen upward until you find “General.” There should be a white gear with gray background on the left side of “General.”
After tapping on “General,” go ahead and look for “Software Update” and tap on it.
Inside the Software Update page, look for “Download and Install” located on the bottom part of the screen, and tap on it. Updates might automatically download if your device is connected to a Wi-Fi and a power source.
If an alert appears giving you options “Later” or “Install,” you can tap “Install” if you want to proceed with the installation, or tap on “Later” if you want to update your software at a later time.

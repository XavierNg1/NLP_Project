;
, Be careful not to get any shell into the mixture. After stirring, add the egg white and mix.


If you are planning on using the cocoa powder, add it with the eggs prior to mixing.
A kitchen machine, such as a food processor, will get better results than using a hand mixer.
 A part of the milk can be replaced by 1-2 little cups of cold espresso or a portion of instant coffee powder to obtain a slightly brown colour and coffee taste.


Best results will occur when mixing the flour and the baking agent in a separate bowl.
,,,,, Should the mix be too sticky, make a roll of the mix in a coated paper (baking paper) and bakeÂ it on the paper in an oven pan. You will obtain a cake in the shape of a German loaf of bread.
 To check if the cake is ready, insert a toothpick into the middle. If it comes out clean, the cake is cooked.
, This step is completely optional, but will add an extra kick to the flavour.


To make a rum-flavoured icing, combine 100 g powdered sugar with 2 tbsp. rum. Spread onto the cake. If the icing is too liquid, then add a spoonful of powdered sugar to obtain a higher viscosity. A flavourless icing can be made by using vodka instead; after the mixture hardens (15 minutes), the alcohol will be gone, and the resulting icing will be a thick cream-white coating, providing a good surface for an additional layer of chocolate, if desired.
For a chocolate coating, melt about 125 g of chocolate and spread onto the cake.
For a fat-free version with the taste of chocolate, use the flavor-free product and add a heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder. It will look as if covered in chocolate, but with less calories.

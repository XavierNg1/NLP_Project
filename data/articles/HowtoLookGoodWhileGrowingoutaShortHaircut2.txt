 Draw attention away from your hair by making your face look more arresting. Do a bold, smoky eye, or wear a bright lipstick. (Remember, though: choose either a bold lip or a bold eye - doing both is too much). Extra-girly makeup can help you feel feminine and attractive while your hair is transitioning.
 Undoubtedly you already own eye-catching and attractive clothing, so really try to “wow” with your clothing while your haircut remains in the awkward stage. When shopping look for bright colors and provocative patterns; nothing distracts from a poor hair-do like an outfit that works.


Non-hair accessories are desirable here as well. Necklaces and earrings especially (being so close to your head) are excellent style tools to draw the eye away from your hair.
 Now’s the time to replenish your stock of hairbands, attention-grabbing hair clips, or anything else you can think to adorn your hair with. Take this time to be creative with the idea; try putting flowers in your hair, or think about wearing a hat even though you’ve never thought of yourself as a “hat person.”, Having a mix of colors or high/lowlights will draw attention to the ways in which your growing cut appears awkward. Unfortunately different colors will highlight the ways in which your layers might be growing lopsided, or make those runaway strands more visible. Having your hair all one color serves to disguise these potential flaws.

, On a separate piece of paper, write down key goals. Be sure to include the “Five W's” in the news release: who, what, when, where and why.


Who – name the people who are involved in your story.
What – describe what happened.
When – include relevant dates to explain when this happened.
Where – tell your reader where the action occurred.
Why – sum up the point of your story. Why is it important? What ramifications might it have? Why did you want to share it with your reader (or the public)?

, Once the goals have been clarified, write a rough draft of the news release. Keep the news release brief (300-400 words) as editors and reporters work on quick deadlines.Write a catchy headline for your news release that sums up the point of the material.
 Be sure to check all facts and dates for accuracy. Check for spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
 Double space and start writing your news release. At the end of the news release, in the center of the page, type ### or 40 to show the news release has ended.
 Set the news release aside, if you have time, for one final edit. If you look at it with fresh eyes, you're likely to notice small mistakes you overlooked the first time.
 Take photos, if appropriate, and insert them in the folder. A two-envelope folder is good for this as you can put the news release on one side and the photo on the other. You can also include a disk with the information, if you know the format used by the local media. The disk can include the news release and photo, if desired. If this is done, include a hard copy of both the news release and photo along with the disk.
 Print your company name and logo on the label. Place the label on the front of the folder.
 Seek out press releases online from major corporations and small businesses. Model your releases on the best examples you can find.

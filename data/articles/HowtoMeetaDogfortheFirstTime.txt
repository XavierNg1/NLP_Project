 Some dogs, who tend to be docile animals, aren't docile and can get spooked when approached. If the owner seems as though the dog and the owner are not friendly, then hold back. If the dog seems unfriendly or misbehaved, reverse course and don't go towards it, as the owner then needs to take charge.;
, If the dog thinks you are fearful, it will claim higher authority and possibly get sassy. But the best way is to let the dog approach you first, then you can make friends with it.
 Show it the back of your hand to sniff with your your fingers held together. This stance with your arms is a commonly-inherited trait to most dogs should (or will come to understand). The dog should have some knowledge about not biting you. Come down to this dog's eye level with your hand. Make all of this seem natural, as it will be if you've used it enough over time.
, The dog could get worried because it does not know you. Make this step done slowly.
 Dogs don't tend to like long meetings with strangers.


If you get caught up in a conversation with the owner, lightly stroke the dog so that they know that you still are giving a little attention; though it's not necessary as just being around a balanced person is nice for a dog.

 Cover an area with newspaper or plastic cloth to protect it. Set out the things used for making the pinata.
 Knot to keep the air in. The amount of air you add depends on how big you want the pinata to be.

Where you tie the knot, attach a long length of ribbon or twine. First, wind the ribbon around the center of the balloon, over the dip in the balloon. Tie a strong knot to keep in place. This ribbon is essential for hanging the pinata.
You can also attach two regular balloons until you got the shape of a heart.
 Pour the flour into the mixing container. Add a cup of water. Stir well with the spoon. The paste that forms should be lump-free., The width is ideal around 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) across. Make as many strips as can cover the balloon several layers thick., Dip each strip into the paste container to cover, then apply to the balloon. Take care to maintain the heart shape as distinctly as possible; this may mean shifting the strips around at times.

Apply layer one first, then leave to dry for 12 hours or overnight.
Apply layer two and let it dry too. On average, each layer will need about 12 hours drying time.
Continue with a further two layers, drying each layer in between.
 To do this, insert a pair of scissors into the bottom of the balloon, to one side. Create a small hole which will allow you to stuff the balloon., Then, cover the hole with strong tissue paper, or glue more newspaper on and leave to dry., Good colors include red, pink or orange but you are free to choose any color you like. If adding decorative touches over the painted layer, allow the painted layer to dry properly first before painting on additional designs.

You can add paper cut-outs, glitter, buttons and other items to improve the decoration of the pinata.
 Find a long stick or use a pinata stick. Guests are blindfolded before taking swings at the pinata in the hope that they'll break it open and reveal lots of candies!

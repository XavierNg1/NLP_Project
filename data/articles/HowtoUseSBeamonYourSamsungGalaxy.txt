 Take one of the S-Beam capable Samsung device you’ll be using and open its notification panel. Do this by swiping down from the top of the screen.;
, Swipe the quick settings ribbon until you see the S Beam icon, and tap it to enable the feature.


You will know it is enabled if the quick setting button for S Beam is illuminated.
 Get the second S-Beam capable Samsung device and enable its S Beam feature by repeating Steps 1 and 2 on it.
 S Beam transfers pictures, videos, contacts, web page links, .apk files, and Play Store links. Once S Beam is enabled on both devices, open the content you wish to send on the source device.
 There will be an audible sound and both devices will vibrate, indicating that they are detecting each other.
 The content on the source device will zoom out a bit, and a “Touch to Beam” text will appear. Tap the content you wish to beam.
 The source device will prompt you to separate both of the devices; do so and the content should begin transferring to the other device using Wi-Fi direct. The content will then be displayed or played on the other device once the transfer is completed.


If the content is of a large file size, the transfer will take a bit longer than a smaller content, such as pictures or links.
 You can find the file in a folder called SBeamShare, which you can access by using any file explorer application and looking for the folder in the Internal Storage.

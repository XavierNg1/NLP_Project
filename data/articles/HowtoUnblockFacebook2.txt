 A proxy website is a proxy server that is running a website interface. You visit the proxy website and enter in the address you want to access. The proxy server retrieves the information and then transfers it to your browser. Your network only sees the data being sent to and from the proxy website, and not to and from Facebook.Logging into Facebook using this method is not secure, and should only be used to view pages. If you want to log into your own account, or use any website where you need to log in securely, use one of the other methods in this article.;
, There are lots of websites that list tons of proxy websites you can use, but these are typically blocked by your network administrator. You'll want to visit these listing sites at home so that you can see them. Popular listing sites include:Proxy.org
Web-Proxy-List.co.uk
Webproxylist.biz

, Network administrators are constantly adding new proxies to their block lists, and new proxy websites come out every day. You'll want a decent list of sites to try so that if one is blocked you can try the next.
 If the proxy website is blocked, try the next one on your list. Continue until you find a proxy site that is not blocked by your network administrator.


There's a very good chance that using the proxy website will alert the network administrator, and you may find that same site blocked tomorrow.
 Proxy websites typically have a field that you can enter a website's address into. Type in facebook.com or paste in the address for a Facebook page and click the button to load the site.
 Once you've loaded the site in the proxy, you can start using it. Because the information is being displayed through the proxy in your browser, certain elements on the page may not load properly. This usually means that the layout won't look correct, or videos won't play.

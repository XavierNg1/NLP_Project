 Open the Firefox browser by clicking on its icon, which will either be on one of your phone’s home screens or in your App drawer.
 Once you have the browser open, click the “Options” button on your phone. Once you hit Options and a menu is displayed, look for “Settings” and tap on it.


If you’re using an Android device, the “Options” button is usually on the bottom-left side of your phone.
 Once the Settings window opens up with a list of options, click on the second option, which is “Customize” to display a new menu. Select and tap on “Tabs” from this menu.
 On your smartphone, you are presented with the option to have your tabs stay open or not after you close Firefox. When you click on the “Tab” button, you will see a preference setting: you can either select “Don’t restore” or “Always restore your tabs” after closing Firefox.


The latter option is great especially if you realize you want to go back and review something you had viewed earlier on one of the tabs.
Once you settle on an option, you will be brought back to the Settings screen, and you can browse as usual. Firefox mobile automatically saves your changes.

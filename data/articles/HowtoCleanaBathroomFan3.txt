 Before reinstalling the fan, make sure that you cleaned off all the dust from in between each of the blades and dried it thoroughly. Carefully reinsert it into the exhaust pipe and screw the bracing back into place. Use your fingers and spin the fan around a few rotations to make sure that it is not rubbing against anything., Plug the fan back into the outlet and reset the breaker for your bathroom. The fan is now dangerous again, so do not touch it or continue to clean it after this point.., Once the cover has dried, either screw it back in or bend the prongs until the cover snaps back into place.
 Turn the fan on again to make sure everything works as normal. The fan should be quieter than it was before and provide a higher amount of air flow.

 In order to reduce the friction associated with shaving, apply a salt and water solution to your underarm prior to shaving. Mix together Â½ a teaspoon of salt with a cup of warm water. Dip a cotton swab into the water and then dab the mixture on your armpit. Let stand for 10 minutes.This will soften the hair, reducing the likelihood of developing razor burn or underarm pimples.
 You should also use a thick layer of shaving cream to reduce irritation while you are shaving. Never shave your underarm when it is dry. This will lead to irritation, redness, and may cause the development of pimple-like bumps under the arm., To prevent the development of razor burn and underarm pimples, you should always shave in the same direction as the hair growth. This can be tricky with your armpits because they are hard to see and not all of the hairs grow in the same direction. Try shaving in a t-shape:Start at the top of the armpit and shave down through the middle. Then shave from one side of the armpit across the middle to the other side.
 It is important that you always use a clean and sharp razor when shaving under your arms. This is because a dull razor will cause you to press harder, thus damaging the skin. It is recommended that you change your razor or razor blade once every two weeks.If irritation persists, you should avoid shaving and talk with your doctor.
 If you find that you develop underarm pimples as a result of shaving, you can try a few alternative methods for removing this hair. For example, you can remove this hair through laser treatment. Laser hair removal will help to get rid of any skin irritations and ingrown hairs that may result from frequent shaving.The treatment lasts approximately 10 minutes and you need to have between 8-10 treatments for permanent hair removal.
The cost of treatment is around $145 per session.

 In a small saucer, dish, bowl, or container, mix baking soda and liquid dish soap until the two form a paste. This combination is excellent for breaking up tough dirtiness and difficult stains.


A little bit goes a long way, and you can always mix more, so you may want to prepare a small amount first to prevent any going to waste.
Use your finger or a stirring tool, like a spoon, to thoroughly mix the baking soda and soap until the paste is consistent throughout., You may want to clean your cutlery one at a time to ensure nothing is missed, or you may want to do all of it at once to save time. Gently scrub your paste into dirty areas with a nylon scrubber or a soft bristle brush to break up gunk and dirtiness.If you're trying to save time by cleaning your cutlery in a large batch, you may want to use a tub or bucket to hold silverware and contain your cleaning paste.
Using this special cleaning paste is especially useful for removing scorch marks and dark spots from your cutlery. However, it may take some time and effort before the mark is removed.
 Even after your thorough cleaning with your baking soda/dish soap paste, some stains might remain on your cutlery. If this is the case for you, use a clean nylon scrubber or soft bristle brush to scrub these away with undiluted white vinegar.The surface of your stainless steel utensils can become scratched and cloudy over time by abrasive cleaning tools. Even when using a nylon scrubber or soft bristle brush, clean dirty areas gently., After all remaining food, stains, and other dirtiness have been removed, you're nearly done. Rinse your cutlery under water and then use a soft, dry dishcloth to wipe away excess moisture, as hand drying will help prevent the formation of spots.


If, over the course of your drying, your towel has become especially wet, swap this out with a new one that's clean and dry.

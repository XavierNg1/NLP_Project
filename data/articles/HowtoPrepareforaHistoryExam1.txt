Make a list of them, then create flashcards with a word on one side and its definition or explanation on the other.If you have trouble coming up with a list, try asking your teacher what key dates, figures, and other information might show up on the test.;
, Seeing, saying, hearing, and touching at the same time help your brain make stronger connections and memorize information more easily. Try reading your textbook out loud as you study, and say what you’re writing as you create your flashcards.You could also try recording yourself reading your textbook or flashcards. As you listen to the recording, follow along in your notes or flashcards.

Even better, they’re also an effective way to keep your facts straight.For example, the mnemonic device Neighbors Actually Persuaded Lovely Yvonne To Shut Her Window will help you memorize the British royal families in chronological order: Norman, Angevin, Plantagenet, Lancaster, York, Tudor, Stuart, Hanover, and Windsor.

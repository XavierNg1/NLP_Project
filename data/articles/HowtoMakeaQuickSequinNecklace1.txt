 This project is a little bit messy sometimes, so it's best to be prepared. Since the mess is just sequins, though, you can be a little bit more conservative in your setup. If you are in quite a hurry, you can just skip this step altogether.;
, If you want a sparkling choker, make it the length of the circumference of your neck. If you want it to be a bit longer, or even long enough to loop around your neck more than once, cut a larger piece of tape.
, Repeat until the tape is fully covered, then brush off the loose sequins. If this leaves the tape rather bare, you may wish to try again, but be aware that the second time you place the tape in the sequins, it will be much less sticky. You will probably be better off if you simply brush off all the sequins from the tape, and cut yourself a new strip.
 Use yet another piece of tape to fasten it and wear your new sequin jewelry!

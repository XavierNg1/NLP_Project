 Buckets may appear in dungeon chests, or you can craft them yourself. They have a wide variety of uses, including gathering milk from Cows and Mooshrooms.


To craft a bucket, you'll need 3 Iron Ingots. Open your Crafting window. Place an Ingot in the middle square of the left column, the bottom square of the middle column, and the middle square of the right column. This will create a bucket.;
, Cows spawn in most environments, except deserts and ocean. Mooshrooms only spawn on Mushroom Islands. Both Cows and Mooshrooms give the same amount of Milk.


You can lead Cows and Mooshrooms by holding Wheat. You can also give two adult Cows or Mooshrooms Wheat to breed them. Click here for more instructions on breeding cows and Mooshrooms.
You can only milk adult cows and Mooshrooms. Babies will need to grow into adults in order to get milk from them.
 You'll need to be holding the Bucket in your hands in order to get milk from the cow or Mooshroom.
 Your Bucket will fill, and the icon in your action bar will change to indicate that it is full. If you're playing Minecraft PE, tapping the Cow will attack it, so press and hold on the Cow or Mooshroom to get milk.


Some users report difficulty getting milk from the Cow. Try aiming for the lower half of the Cow when milking, or try to milk while standing a level below the Cow.
Some users report problems getting milk in Creative mode. This is a bug from earlier versions of Minecraft, recent versions should have this fixed.

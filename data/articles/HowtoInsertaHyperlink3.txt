 HTML is a type of coding used to create formatted websites. Hyperlinks increase a website’s search engine optimization and usability.
 Right click on your mouse and select “Copy” from the drop down menu. You can also use a keyboard shortcut, such as “Control” and “c” to copy the address.


The URL should be copied with the http://www. intact. Make sure to copy the link in its entirety.
 Sign in so that you can edit the HTML code on the website.
 Press “Enter” until you have a new line on which to place your hyperlink code. You will be using the <a> tag to denote a link.
 This is the beginning of your opening tag.
 Surround the address with quotation marks and then close your bracket. For example, <a href=”http://www.example1.net”>.
 The entire hyperlink should follow our example, <a href=http://www.example1.net”>Click Here</a>. Repeat as necessary to insert hyperlinks on each web page.,

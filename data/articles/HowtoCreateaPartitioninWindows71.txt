 When working with hard drives and computer storage, there are a few technical terms that will be helpful to know. These will make working through the wizards much easier.


Partition - This is a segment of the hard disk that is set aside and acts like separate physical hard drive. Each partition can have it's own file system and operating systems can be installed on them.
Volume - While "partition" and "volume" are used fairly interchangeably, there is a small but important difference. The "partition" is the space on the disk that is set aside, while the volume is the file system on the partition that makes it act like a separate disk.
Logical drive - This is a partition that can store data like normal, but cannot be used to boot an operating system. Each disk can support three primary (boot) partitions, and then all subsequent partitions are created as logical drives.
 While this process shouldn't affect your data, it's always a good idea to have a fresh back up of all your important files when making changes to the partitions. Click here for some ways to quickly back up your data before you begin.

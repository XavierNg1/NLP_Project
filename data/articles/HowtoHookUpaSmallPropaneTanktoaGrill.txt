 Make sure that your grill is safely positioned far away from any flammable material and that the grill cover is completely open. Never attach propane to the grill with the grill cover closed: If the propane is accidentally turned on with the grill cover down, it could accumulate under the cover and explode in a fireball, causing serious harm.


Make sure the gas is turned to the off position before hooking the propane tank up to the grill.
Remove the empty tank from the grill if you haven't already. The grill is now ready for your safe set up!;
, The plastic cap will be perforated, making for relatively easy removal, and should boast a bright color, like red or blue.
 The propane tank should fit snugly into the gas line.
 Make sure the coupler is fully screwed in, but not so tight that you won't be able to unscrew the coupler when the time comes to put in a new tank.


Consult your grill's manufacturer's manual as an extra resource. It may contain useful information on the amount of propane you want flowing out of the valve, as well as answer any troubleshooting questions you may have during the setup process.
 Your valve should be in the shape of a triangle and etched with the words "OPD," or overfill protection device., Once that is done, you are ready to turn the grill on again and enjoy a finger-lickin' season of bbq.

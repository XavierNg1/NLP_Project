 Grease all exposed moving parts after cleaning with any lubricant that does not create buildup, such as WD40., If the head is embedded in the ground, remove any grass or weeds that are too close to the unit. If the sprinkler is above ground, make sure it is on a level surface with no obstructions. Try placing a board underneath your sprinkler to give it more stability and prevent its components from directly coming into contact with dirt and future debris.
 Clean them at least twice a year. It is most important to do so before storing for the winter, in order to keep them working in ideal conditions. This will help prevent major clogging, and your lawn will thank you.If you still have poor water distribution, a clog may not be the only problem, check your water pressure and for any kinks in the hose as this will interfere with your sprinkler's ability to function properly.

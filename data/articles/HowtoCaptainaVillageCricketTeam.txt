 You can never take anything for granted. 14 players on a Thursday night quickly turns into 9 on Saturday morning. Have everyone's phone number and make sure you confirm participation with everyone in good time.;
, If players are rewarded for doing the right thing, they'll do it more often. Always chose youth over age in close selection calls.
 Think about the conditions, the points system and the relative strength of your team. If in doubt then go with your teams strength, if you've lots of good bowlers then bowl first. If you all bat then bat first. Once you're on top, you'll probably win.
 Bowlers bowl better with attacking fields. Always attack the new batsman. If a batsman hits two similar shots into the same place then put a fielder there. Always have a plan - or look like you have one. Never keep the same field for two different batsmen. Be active!

,, The fielder to the point gully should be quick. Practise catching and throwing more than any other team at the nets and before a game. Catches really do win matches. No-one means to drop a catch so encourage everyone to go for everything and praise everyone for every genuine attempt. Keen fielding teams win most of their games.
 This will always give a good impression. There is nothing worse than looking like slobs on the field.

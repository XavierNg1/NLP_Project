 A five-strand braid looks a little more intricate and elegant than a standard three-strand braid, and it's easy to do once you get the process down.









When you're first learning, consider pulling your hair into a ponytail and starting the braid there, so you're working with a stable base.
It's easiest to braid a five-strand braid when your hair is wet or greasy from going a few days of being unwashed. This will help to keep the sections together, and prevent fly-aways from getting tangled up in other strands.
 It's easiest if you hold the two leftmost strands in your left hand, and the two rightmost strands in your right hand, allowing the center strand to hang loose.


Numbering the strands can help you keep them straight. They should look like 1 2 3 4 5.
 Move it over strand 2, and under strand 3, so that it's now in the center.









You should now have 2 3 1 4 5.
You are essentially weaving your hair, moving the strands from the right to the left, and the left to the right.
 Move it over strand 4 and under strand 1, so that 5 is now in the center.









You should now have 2 3 5 1 4.
 Keep alternating outer strands and moving them to the center.
 Use a ribbon or non-rubber hair elastic to secure the end of the braid.

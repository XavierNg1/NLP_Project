 Select the app icon on your Android device. It’s the one carrying the Avast logo.
 Tap “App Locking” from the main menu of the main screen. You will be brought to a list of all your apps, including Play Store, Settings, and all other standard apps.
 Beside each app is a checkbox. Tap the checkboxes for the apps you want to lock.
 The first checkbox you tick will trigger a PIN request. Type in a four-digit PIN for locking and unlocking the apps.
 Just press the Back button of your device to exit, and once you exit the menu, the selected apps will now be locked. All the locked apps will require the PIN you set in order for you to unlock and use them.


Once you’ve set a PIN to lock apps, opening Avast Mobile Security will also require the PIN. This is to protect the locks you’ve set in place.

 Timing is very important when making caramel, since it can easily burn, and you don't want to have to search around your kitchen for a measuring cup while your sugar is boiling.;
, A two to three quart pan works well. Be sure to use one that's nice and heavy, so it cooks the sugar evenly.
 Pour the sugar into the saucepan, and turn the heat to medium high. Start whisking it immediately so it doesn't burn, and keep going as it comes to a boil and begins to melt. Stop stirring once all of the sugar granules have melted.








Be sure to stand there stirring the entire time, since sugar can quickly overcook once it's caramelized.
If you cook it too long, the caramel will come out hard or even burn.
 Be careful, since this will cause the mixture to froth up. Continue to whisk until the butter is completely melted.
 Wait 10 seconds or so for the mixture to stop boiling.
 Pour it slowly into the pan, and continue whisking until the caramel is smooth.
 Sprinkle the salt over the caramel and pour in the vanilla, along with any other flavorings you want to use. Stir until they're well incorporated throughout the caramel.
 Reduce it to a simmer and cook for one more minute before removing it from heat.
 Once it is no longer piping hot, transfer to a heat-proof jar or container. Store your homemade caramel in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

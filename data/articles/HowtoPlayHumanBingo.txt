 Use a standard 5 x 5 square grid (as used in the regular bingo games). Create one card for each person attending the gathering.

Also have pens or pencils for each card.;
, Think of interesting human characteristics, personalities, and life facts for the bingo matches. Some examples could be:

owns or has owned a pet
commutes to school/work
has never smoked before
has gone to a sporting event
has visited another country
has tried a different cuisine outside of their own
has ever won something
has more than two pets
has worked in another state
has a social networking account, etc.
, You could do this either as you hand out the cards or once everyone has arrived and is ready to get to know one another.

Tell the players that they must interview each other. Have each player go around the group and ask other people to check off one box that applies to them. Names or signatures on multiple boxes won't count.

If your party has a very small amount of people, the signature rules are more lenient and can be signed upon if any trivia applies to the person.


Reinforce that socializing is a must! This entire game is based around getting to know each other, so encourage chatting and getting to know one another.
 Let the players know to come to you when their card is full and you can call out the winner.

Alternatively, you could declare winners when a row (across, up, down or diagonal) has been checked off; this depends on whether you want to speed things up or not.
Offer a small door prize such as a chocolate bar, or a cake, to the winner.

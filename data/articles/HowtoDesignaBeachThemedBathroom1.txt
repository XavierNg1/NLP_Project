 Cool tones, such as blue, green, and teal are perfect for a beach themed bathroom. These colours create the feel of water and can help to complement some beach themed trinkets and decor. You can use the colours on the walls or in the floor and shower tiles.Try pairing green or blue walls with white trim.
Alternatively, you could pair the wall colour with beige or sandy coloured countertops.;
, Perhaps you take your inspiration from the sand, not the water. If this is the case, you should choose a warmer earth tone such as a light beige or pink. These warm tones can be paired with white trim and aquatic blue/green tiles., A nautical look using navy blue, white, and hints of red can also give a bathroom a beach theme design. For instance, try painting the walls navy blue and then complimenting that with white trim, white counter tops, and white fixtures.You could also achieve a nautical look with navy blue and white striped wall paper.
 You may want to decorate your bathroom with a more tropical beach theme. If this is the case, use bright colours that are inspired by tropical flowers. For example, you could paint the walls white or grey and then create a tropical feel by selecting bright pink and yellow towels.Alternatively, you could gain a tropical feel by using patterned wall paper or shower curtains that contain palm trees or tropical flowers.

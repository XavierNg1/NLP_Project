 To get started, open your favorite web browser (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) by tapping on its icon on your desktop, and go to https://www.google.com/drive.;
, If you are not already logged in, Google Drive will ask you to sign in with your Google account information. If your account name is already indicated on the page, just enter your password; otherwise, type in your username and password on the fields provided.
 The spreadsheet should open in a new tab or window of your browser.
 Do this by clicking and dragging across the column labels (usually A, B, C, etc.).
,, Click the red “Create” button near the top-left corner of the tab. The Create menu will appear.
 A new Google Sheet will open in a new tab or window.
 The option should be on the file menu above the toolbar.
 All of the cells from your old Google Spreadsheet will be pasted into a new Google Sheet.


If you have multiple sheets in your spreadsheet, repeat steps 4–10 for the remaining sheets.

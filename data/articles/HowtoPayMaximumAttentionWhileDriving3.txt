 Many people choose to listen to music or talk radio while driving, but in order to ensure you minimize distractions, don’t try to change the station or show until you are stationary.Making changes to what you are listening to can distract you from what’s going on in front of you.
Changing the station or show while stopped will permit you to focus your attention on the road, instead of the radio.
 If you need to use your phone while driving, always utilize a hands-free device that allows you to communicate without having to control your phone with your hands, which can draw your attention from the road.Remember to keep your focus on driving when using hands-free devices.
Never look at your phone to connect a hands free device while you’re driving.
 In order to ensure you are not visibly distracted, keep your cell phones, lap tops and tablets safely stored within the vehicle as you drive. The best way to ensure you cannot be distracted by your cell phone while you’re driving, however, is simply to turn it off. While your phone is off, phone calls will be sent to voicemail and text messages will be saved until you can access them.


It is illegal to use your phone for text messaging or other similar tasks while driving in most places.
If the phone call is important, they should leave a message you can return upon pulling over.

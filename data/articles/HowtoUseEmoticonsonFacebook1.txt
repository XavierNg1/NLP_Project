 You can add emoticons to any text field in Facebook. This includes new posts you make, comments you leave on your friends' posts, and messages.


This method will work for the Facebook website, mobile app, and Messenger app.;
, Facebook has a set of basic emoticons that can be added to posts by typing the right code. The code will be converted into the proper emoticon when you send the post. You can find a full list at fbicons.net. Some of the most popular ones include:


Smile - :) :] =) :-)
Frown - :( :[ =( :-(
Tongue - :p :P =P :-p :-P
Devil - 3:) 3:-)
Angel - O:) O:-)
Pacman - :v
Shark - (^^^)
Like - (y) (Y)
Poop - :poop:

, Beyond the standard Facebook emoticons, you can copy and paste virtually any emoji from the standard sets. The easiest way to do this on a computer is to go to fbicons.net and find the emoji you want to add. Highlight the character to the right of the listing and copy it to your clipboard. Even if it just shows up as a square on fbicons.net, it will appear as the correct emoji when you paste it into your Facebook post, comment, or message.


You can right-click on the highlighted character and select "Copy," or highlight it and press Ctrl/⌘ Command+C. Then right-click in the post and select "Paste," or press Ctrl/⌘ Command+V.
If you're using a mobile device, you can use your keyboard's emoji section to add emoji characters without having to copy and paste.
 Your typed symbols will be converted to the Facebook emoticons once the message has been sent. Anyone will be able to see the emoticons and emojis that you've added to your post.

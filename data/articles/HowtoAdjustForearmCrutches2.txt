 After adjusting the height of the crutches you can go ahead any make any necessary adjustments to the cuffs. The cuffs are the ring-shaped pieces of plastic which you place your arm through when you are using the crutches. When you put your arm through and stand up, the cuffs should be situated around your forearm, just below your elbow.


Or, more precisely, one or two inches below the bend in your elbow.They should not restrict your ability to bend your elbow.
 If the cuffs are not in right place, you will need to make some adjustments to enable you to use the crutches easily and safely. Adjusting the cuffs is much like adjusting the height of the handgrip. Find the spring button in each cuff. The button will be at the back of the cuff, where it is attached to the crutch itself.


Push the button in and shift the cuffs up or down according to your requirements.You will see that the cuffs move up and down a series of adjustment holes that are visible along the side of your crutch.
If your cuff is more of a horseshoe shape and has an opening, the opening should be facing forward, the way you are facing.
 When you have the cuffs at the right height and they are comfortable, you can fix them in place. First, check that the spring button is secure and not too easy to push in. Next you just need to tighten the collars below the cuff on each crutch. You should also check that the collar you tightened after adjusting the height is still secure.


Sometimes with forearm crutches you can widen or narrow the width of the cuffs so you get a good fit around your arm. You want to be able to move freely, but with a secure fit.

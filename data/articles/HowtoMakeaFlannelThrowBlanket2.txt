 You will need two pieces of flannel fabric, 2¼ yards (2.1 meters) each.It needs to be about 44 to 45 inches (1.2 meters) wide. You can use two different solid colors, two different patterns, or a solid color and a pattern.
 Spread your first piece of fabric down on the floor, right side up. Place your second piece of fabric on top, right side down. Make sure that the long edges match up with the long edges, and the short edges match up with the short edges. Pin the two pieces together along the edges.
 Sew around the blanket using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the pins as you sew. Leave a gap in one edge that is big enough for you to turn the fabric inside out. It needs to be about ¼ to ½ the length of one edge., Try to get as close to the stitching as you can without actually cutting through it. This will help reduce bulk, and make your blanket lay smoother.
 Use something blunt, but pointy, like a pencil or knitting needle, to push out the corners. This will make them nice and crisp.
 Be sure to use a flannel or cotton setting. When you reach the gap, carefully tuck the raw edges into the blanket so that they match up with the rest of the hems. If you need to, use pins to keep the gap closed.
 You can use matching or contrasting thread colors for the topstitching. A matching thread color will blend in more easily, but a contrasting thread color will make a nice design.


If you need to, use sewing pins to hold the gap shut. Remember to remove the pins while you sew.

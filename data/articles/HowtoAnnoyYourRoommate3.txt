 Say no to sharing cake, a book, or anything. It will really annoy him if he sees you sharing with others but not him. Another way to annoy the is to offer him something once, but never again letting him borrow something.
 While your roommate is sleeping turn the T.V. or music slightly louder than it needs to be. Subtlety is always a better way of getting underneath someone’s skin. This will frustrate your roommate and make him annoyed.


Listen to your music loudly in your room while he is trying to study or when he’s in the room. Start singing along to the song., Call him to say you forgot the key to get into the room.Tell him it's an emergency and it won't happen again, but keep doing it. This will take time out of your roommate's day to come and help you. Always make sure to have your key just in case he can't come and let you in.
 Have your friends over all the time and have them stay late. When you have your friends over try to be loud and silly. They can also make the room a mess and not clean it up. On school nights have them stay late when your roommate is trying to study or sleep.


Another way to get under his skin is by throwing a party without him knowing., If your roommate asks you for an opinion, reply, "sorry, no idea" or "I couldn't care less." When your roommate buys something new and shows you, just tell him that the item is okay and leave it at that.
 Always use *69 before you dial their number to mask your identity. Try to convince him that this is a legitimate phone call. You could say you are from their work and tell him how he was suppose to come in an hour ago.


Try to keep him on the line. The longer you can keep him on, the better the prank.

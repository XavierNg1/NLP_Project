 Look for the Google Earth app on your mobile device and tap on it. The app icon has a blue sphere with white lines on it.


Once launched, you will see a beautiful 3-D rendition of our world.
 Use the search field on the upper right corner and enter the exact and complete address of the house you want to view. Tap the Search button on your keypad to continue.


Just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered. At first, the area view may be too far up to be able to focus on the house.
 Before you can view the house, you have to focus on it first. Swipe on the screen to move around until you locate your house.


To move, use a finger and touch any point on the map, then drag it until you’ve reached the view that you want.
To rotate, use two fingers and touch two points on the map, then rotate your fingers until you’ve reached the perspective that you want.
To zoom, use two fingers and touch two points on the map. Move them away from each other to zoom out and move them away towards each other to zoom in.
 Wait a few moments for the details to load for the house. Once it’s done, you can see the house very clearly, as if you’re right in front of it. The quality of the pictures will depend on the size and capacity of your mobile device.

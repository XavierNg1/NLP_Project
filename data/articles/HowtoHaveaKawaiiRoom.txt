 Colours like baby pink, lavender, peach and foam green can make for a girly, kawaii room. Maybe paint a wall or two a different colour?

, Go to a fabric shop and find a metre or two of fabric with a cute design, and remember to look for pastel or bright colours. Hang it on your wall. This gives a quirky, unique twist on wallpaper.
 Plushies are collectible soft toys, and many of them are kawaii. You can display them around your room, or sleep with them at night.
 Find cute bedding and add extra pillows, cushions and plushies for the kawaii feel. Wind fairy lights around your headboard as a reading light for that finishing touch.
 Posters from anime (Japanese cartoons) like 'K-on!' and 'Lucky Star' are especially kawaii!
, Fluffy rugs in the shape of a heart are awesome.
 Now your room is exploding with kawaii power. Enjoy your new spot to have some well-deserved me time.

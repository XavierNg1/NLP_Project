 To make a frisbee out of paper plates, you will need the following supplies:Two regular sized paper plates
Scissors
Tape or a stapler
Colorful markers or crayons for decorating your frisbee.
 Position the plates as if you were going to put food on them, with the right side facing towards you., Turn the plates upside down and decorate them as you wish with markers or crayons. You can put animals, shapes, or flowers on the plates. Make sure the decorations remain on the upside down area of the plates so they are visible when the frisbee is thrown in the air.You may also want to put circular shapes on the plates to mimic the movement of the frisbee when it flies in the air or create an interesting design on the plate that appears when the frisbee is flying in the air.
 You can do this by placing the plates together so the decorated sides are facing outward and cutting the circle out of the center of both plates. You can also do this one at a time by cutting the circle out of the center of each plate.Start by cutting a diagonal line from one end of the center of the circle to the other end. Then, cut another diagonal line so you have an "X" shape in the center of the circle. You can then cut out the center using the "X" cut.Try to cut only the center of the plate out and leave the rest of the plate intact.
 Use tape or staples to seal the edges of the plates together so the plates stay together. You should now have a frisbee with a hole in the center.

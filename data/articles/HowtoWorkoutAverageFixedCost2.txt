 This is the total amount of money it costs to produce a product, equal to the total fixed cost plus the total variable cost. Every element of production must be factored into the total cost, including labor, commissions, utilities, marketing, administrative costs, office supplies, shipping and handling, materials, interest and any other cost that pertains to the specific product. It is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost., The ATC is the total cost, divided by the number of units.Going with our previous example from method 1, if the total cost is $35,000 over the two months when 10,000 units are produced, then the ATC will be $3.50 per unit.
 Variable costs change according to the quantity of product produced, increasing as production goes up and decreasing as production goes down. For example, the two most predominant variable costs are manufacturing labor and materials. Variable costs also include utilities that vary with production, like the electricity and gas used in manufacturing, for example.Continuing with the same example, imagine the total variable cost is comprised of $2,000 in materials, $3,000 in utilities ($1,500 per month for two months), and $10,000 ($5,000 per month for two months) in manufacturing wages. Add these numbers up to get a total variable cost of $15,000 for your two month period.

, So, for our total variable cost of $15,000 when 10,000 units are produced, the AVC would be $1.50 per unit.
 Subtract the average variable cost from the average total cost. The answer will be the average fixed cost. In the example, the average variable cost of $1.50 per unit would be subtracted from the average total cost of $3.50 per unit in order to reach an average fixed cost amount of $2 per unit. Note that this matches the average fixed cost calculated in method 1.

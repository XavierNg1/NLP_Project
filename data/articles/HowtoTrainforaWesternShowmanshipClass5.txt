 The same method applies for backing, but instead of moving entirely back with 4 footfalls, only two are used, and then a degree of turning.
 In showmanship, the horses are placed higher if they pivot this way, however they do not get punished for pivoting on the hind near leg. If they pivot any other way points are taken off the score.
 As you progress, increase the pivot time until you can do it in a click of your fingers.

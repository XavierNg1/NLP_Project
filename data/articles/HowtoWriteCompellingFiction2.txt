 The plot is the story. It’s what your readers latch into. The plot should be compelling and keep them turning the pages.
 You need to have some idea of where the story is going, though of course, the story is going to take some unexpected turns (even for you). If you are having trouble coming up with a story, read newspapers and watch the news. Sometimes truth is more interesting than what you can make up.


Use real life stories as inspiration for coming up with a plot. Of course, you’ll want to change some details, but it gives you a starting point.
 What is going to be the driving force of the story? Compelling fiction has conflict. Conflict can be a messed up relationship, a murder, a person who needs to figure something out for him or herself, or any number of other things. However, every story needs conflict; otherwise, it’s like living in Mayberry or some other 1950s utopia television show.
 This resolution should happen just after the climax of the story. The climax is the high point of the action just before the end. The climax is where the conflict comes to head—where it must be resolved somehow.
 Your reader should be surprised by your fiction for it to be compelling fiction. For instance, maybe your character figures out a way to take the job and stay together with her girlfriend at the same time without having to make a choice between the two, which has been the driving narrative of the book. Maybe the murderer ends up being the sweet old lady next door that no one saw coming.


One common idiom is “No surprise for the writer, no surprise for the reader,” and it’s true, meaning if you don’t surprise yourself a bit, you won’t surprise your reader, either.

 "Night Shift" is a recent feature for newer iPhones that changes the color temperature at night, shifting blue colors to a redder hue. This can make the screen easier on your eyes in low natural light. There is some evidence that reducing blue light exposure in low natural light can help improve your sleep. If you use your phone a lot before bed, Night Shift may lead to a better night's sleep.Night Shift is only available on the iPhone 6 model line and newer running iOS 9.3+.
 This will open your iPhone's display settings.
 If you don't see this option, you're likely using an older iPhone, or your iPhone 6 is not updated to iOS 9.3+.
 Night Shift is designed to be used at night when the sun has gone down an you don't have natural light to see by. Set the schedule to approximately match your local sundown.
 You may want to leave it at its default setting at first, so that you can get used to the new colors. Once you've tried Night Shift for a while, you can use the slider to adjust the intensity of the color change. Night Shift makes the colors on your screen warmer by shifting them towards orange and red.


Night shift does not make your screen black and white. instead, it change teh hue of the colors to make the screen easier on your eyes at night.
 Swipe up from the bottom of your screen at any time to open the Control Center. From here, tap the Night Shade button, which looks like an eye with a moon for a pupil. You can then select "Turn On For Now" to turn it on immediately.

 Shred the cheddar straight out of the refrigerator, while itâ€™s still cold. You can also use pre-shredded cheddar, if you prefer, although it will have a better flavor if you shred it yourself. Divide the cheese into several small, heat safe bowls. Ramekins would be a good choice.This method is best used when you only need to melt small amounts of cheddar. For example, you could steam-melt cheese to put on hamburgers for a rich, delicious flavor.
 Fill a saucepan one-third full or less with water and bring it to a rolling boil on your stovetop. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the temperature of the burner to keep the water at a simmer., Situate a steamer basket into the saucepan, directly over the simmering water. Then, place the bowls inside the steamer basket. Let the water simmer for one to five minutes while your cheese melts. Check the cheese frequently. You do not want the cheese to melt too much.Ensure that the oven-safe bowls fit in your steamer basket before you transfer the cheese.
Consider tossing the cheese with a couple tablespoons of flour if you want it to have a very smooth, sauce-like texture.

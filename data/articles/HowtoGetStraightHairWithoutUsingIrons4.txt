 Stir 1 egg into 2 cups (.5 liters) of milk and then dip as much of your hair as you can. This will straighten the protein bonds in your hair for longer periods of time.









Keep your hair in the milk for 10 minutes, then cover your head with plastic wrap and let it sit for another 30 minutes.
Afterward, shampoo as usual and either blow your hair dry or brush it dry in front of a fan.
 Divide freshly washed and combed hair into two even sections. Lift the left section and wrap it over your head, across the right section. Coil it around your head and secure it in several places with hairpins. Lift the right section and wrap it over your head in the other direction, securing it in several places with pins. When your hair is completely dry, remove the pins and brush your hair straight.
 Divide freshly washed and combed hair into two or more even sections. use soft cloth hair fasteners to bind your hair.









Start by placing the first fastener over your hair at the base of your head.
Add a second fastener directly beneath the first one. The two fasteners should be touching.
Continue adding fasteners until the entire section of hair is bound to the tip. Repeat for all sections of hair.

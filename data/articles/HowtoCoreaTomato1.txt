, If you are coring a tomato that has a pointy tip, you can set it to one side and core it at an angle.
 Insert the knife tip at an angle of approximately 25 degrees from a vertical axis. Push the knife down approximately 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) at this angle.









Stop inserting the knife when you think the tip of your knife is at the center point of your tomato.
 When you reach your starting point, you can pick up the tomato core and dispose of it.

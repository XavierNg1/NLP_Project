 Local animal shelters will likely be able to help in some way. Specifically, they may offer affordable veterinary services, especially for animals in emergency situations. They may also be able to pay your veterinary bill and allow you to repay them in more manageable monthly payments.If your local shelter is unable to offer veterinary care, they will likely help you find other local organizations who may offer inexpensive care or provide financial assistance.
 Many veterinary schools have low-cost clinics where vets that are being trained work with experienced vets to learn how to care for animals. Note that many of these institutions offer their services only to those within a certain income bracket.Check The American Veterinary Medical Association's website, as well as VeterinarySchools.com for lists of veterinary schools in the U.S.
 The Humane Society website features an extensive list of US organizations that can help you cover your catâ€™s veterinary expenses. Use the list to search for organizations in your area, which may be especially willing and able to help.Keep in mind that every organization will differ in terms of qualifications and rules regarding their services.

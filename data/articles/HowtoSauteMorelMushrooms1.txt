 Cut up dried mushrooms first, if desired, so that they will rehydrate faster. Place the mushrooms into a bowl of lukewarm water. Let them soak for at least fifteen minutes, checking them occasionally. Strain them through a sieve once finished.The mushrooms are ready when they feel soft and pliable, and don’t split easily when you bend them.
If you want to save the soaking water, you can use it as a base for soup or sauce. Run the water through a coffee filter to remove any dirt.;
, Wipe the mushrooms with a soft brush or damp cloth to clean off dirt.Avoid washing them unless you can't remove debris otherwise. If necessary, rinse them lightly and quickly, then pat them dry. If you see signs of insects, you can let the mushrooms sit in a bowl of salted water for at least fifteen minutes.Washing morel mushrooms can result in soggy texture.
 Cut the mushrooms lengthwise. Inspect them for any dirt or insects you may have missed (wipe them down again, if needed). Trim off the ends, as needed.Morel mushrooms are typically sauteed cut in half, but you can cut them in quarters or dice them, if desired.
Don’t wash the mushrooms before refrigerating them, or they will absorb too much water and can deteriorate.

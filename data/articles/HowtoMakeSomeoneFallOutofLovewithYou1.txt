 Over communicating with a person can be just as destructive to a relationship as failing to communicate with that person. Make yourself appear needy and insecure by constantly check-in with them via phone call, text, or direct message. Further your cause by contacting them at inappropriate times, such as in the middle of class, a meeting, or a family meal. This will demonstrate that you have little respect for boundaries. With each passing day that you blow up their phone, they may fall more and more out of love with you., Partners accepting of each otherâ€™s flaws and quirks. Cast yourself in a shallow and unflattering light by nitpicking every action and decision made by the person who loves you. Criticize their hair, clothing, movie selection, career choice, and car. Your incessant negativity may just drive them away., In many relationships, partners are able to retain some degree of autonomy over their own life. Deny the person you wish to drive away the ability to make a decision without consulting you first. Your domineering facade may motivate them to cut ties with you so that they can regain control of their life.

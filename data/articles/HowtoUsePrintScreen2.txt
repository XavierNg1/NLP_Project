 This will bring down a list of Snipping Tool options.
 There are four options that allow you to use print screen in different ways.Here are the options and how they are used:



Free-form Snip. This option allows you create and capture any shape around your screen.

Rectangular Snip. This will allow you to snip a rectangular area of the screen.

Window Snip. This option allows you to capture one full window.

Full-screen Snip. This option allows you to snip the whole screen.
 Based on the option you chose, you will now select the area that you will capture.


If you used the "Free-form Snip," then you'll use your mouse to draw around the area you want to capture.
If you used the "Rectangular Snip," then you can draw a rectangle across the screen.
For "Window Snip," just select the window you'd like to capture.
If you selected "Full-screen Snip," then it would have already captured the image.
 Just click the disk on the top left of the Snipping Tool to save the image. The image has already been automatically copied to the Windows clipboard.

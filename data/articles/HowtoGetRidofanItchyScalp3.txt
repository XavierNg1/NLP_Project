 Your scalp needs to “breathe” just like the rest of your skin, in order to remain healthy. If you always wear a hat or frequently wear a wig, you are likely restricting air flow to your scalp, which can cause your scalp to itch.If you notice your scalp itching more when you wear hats or wigs, take a break from the head coverings and let your scalp air out.
 Dehydration will affect your skin, and skin without enough water becomes dry and itchy. Although it’s important to keep your hair hydrated through the use of hydrating, non-drying shampoo, you can help your scalp by avoiding bodily dehydration in general.Talk to your doctor and he or she will tell you how much fluid you should be drinking for your age and weight. Average male and female adults should drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) and 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluid a day, respectively., Anxiety can play havoc with a body in general, and it has an effect on your scalp, too. If you do not have a rash but feel itching on your face and neck, stress could be the primary factor causing these symptoms.Easy ways to decrease your daily stress and anxiety include:


Spend more time relaxing with family and friends.
Talk about your stress or anxiety with a close personal friend or a therapist.
Participate in a calming practice like yoga or meditation.
Take an hour away from screens (phone, computer, TV, tablet) before your bedtime.

 While there isn't an AssistiveTouch function you can use on Android to record hands-free, you can use a rubber band to hold down the Volume Up button which will prompt your Android to begin recording., It's the white ghost icon outlined on a yellow background.

If you aren't already logged into Snapchat, tap Log In and then enter your username (or email address) and password.
 You'll need it to cover the Volume Up button without wrapping around the Lock button or obscuring your phone's camera.

You may have to double-wrap it.
 Doing this will prompt your Android to begin recording. The rubber band should hold the Volume Up button in place which will ensure that your video records for the full 10 seconds.

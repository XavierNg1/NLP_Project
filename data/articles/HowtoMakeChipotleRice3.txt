 Put the rice in a large mixing bowl. Fill the bowl with just enough cool to lukewarm water to cover the rice completely.


Strictly speaking, this step is not absolutely necessary. Doing this can separate the grains of rice more effectively, though, which means that the rice will be less mushy when done.
Drain well and drain carefully once the rice has had a chance to soak.
 Cook the three ingredients over low heat, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or less.


The rice should be well coated with the oil and sugar when done. It should also begin to release a pleasant aroma.
 When the rice becomes fragrant, cut open 2 limes and squeeze the juice from both into the rice. Stir and cook for an additional 1 minute.


Make sure that the lime juice evenly coats the rice before proceeding.
The smell of the lime juice should also be intensified as you cook it.
 Stir slightly to make sure that the rice is completely submerged by the water.


Reduce the heat down to medium-low so that it drops to a steady simmer.
If you prefer rice with more "bite" or "crunch," reduce the amount of water down by half.
 Cover and cook the rice until all the water has been fully absorbed.


Once ready, the rice should be tender and no longer soupy.
 Add the chopped cilantro and give the contents of the skillet another quick, light stir.


If you prefer a stronger citrus twist, squeeze the juice of one or two more limes into the rice and stir.
 Let the rice sit for another 1 to 2 minutes with the lid on. Then, transfer it to a serving dish and enjoy.

 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of butter or cooking oil, such as olive oil or canola oil, to a large skillet and heat over medium.
 Shiitake mushrooms should be cleaned and trimmed before cooking them using this method.


To clean the mushrooms, either rinse them quickly under cool running water or wipe the caps clean with a damp paper towel. Do not soak.
Use a sharp paring knife to trim the stems at the point where they attach to the cap. The stems are too tough to eat, so you can discard them or use them to add flavor to stock later on.Use your knife to cut the shiitake mushroom caps into small, bite-size pieces.
 Toss the shiitake mushroom caps into the pan of hot oil. Use a heat-resistant spatula to spread the mushrooms out so that each cap touches the bottom of the pan.
 Saut√© the mushrooms over medium heat, stirring them frequently with your spatula until they turn an even and rich brown.
 Remove the cooked mushrooms from the heat and season with salt and pepper, as desired. Toss to coat before serving.

 Check your rabbit to see if there are any bumps, protuberances, broken or dislocated bones, etc. If your rabbit had a recent injury, s/he is probably in pain. Has s/he lost lots of weight unexpectedly? If you find anything odd or wrong with your rabbit, take him/her to the vet as soon as possible.;
, Is s/he reluctant to move? Not being curious and inquisitive to the environment? Is one of his/her feet limp? Is s/he leaning back on his/her hind feet? Is s/he being more aggressive than normal or hiding in a corner of the cage? Is s/he being more territorial? Is his/her head tilted to one side with a loss of balance? Is your rabbit squinting in pain? These can all be signs that your rabbit is in some pain and should be taken to a vet.
 A light grinding can mean that your rabbit is content, but if s/he has loud, "rough" teeth grinding, that is one of the most common signs that your rabbit is in pain.
 This is also one of the more common signs that a rabbit may be in pain after an accident or injury. Rabbits may breathe heavier when outdoors because there are many smells. This is not a problem- but if it's coupled with any thing else, it can be a sign of pain.


If a rabbit is hot (and their ears are pinker/red in colour) they will breath more rapidly to try and cool down.
 A rabbit in pain or one that is sick will not have a big appetite or thirst. As well, the rabbit's pellets will be either small, wet (diarrhea) or none. The urine (if consuming little or no water) will be very concentrated in colour. If any of these are the case, take your rabbit for a checkup at the vet.
 Even if you aren't sure if s/he is in pain, take your rabbit to the vet.

 The easiest way to get rid of an annoying friend's posts in your News Feed is to go to their profile and "unfollow" them; this feature is similar to "muting" an account on Twitter.


If you aren't logged in, you'll first need to enter your Facebook email and password.;
, This is at the top of Facebook's page. If they have a recent post in your News Feed, you can also click on their name there; doing so will take you to their account page.
 This should be to the right of their name.


On mobile, this will be below their name and profile picture.
 This will remove their posts from your News Feed; however, you will remain friends on Facebook!


You may have to refresh your News Feed for their posts to disappear.

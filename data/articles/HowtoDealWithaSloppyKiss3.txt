 You could turn the kissing problem into a fun game to camouflage that you’re really trying to change the way your partner kisses.


Ask questions such as, “How do you like being kissed best?” Or “what’s your favorite way to kiss?” And then describe your own answers.The goal here is not to seem critical, but rather to make it clear you’re asking the questions to try to learn more about each other. It works both ways. Maybe there’s something your partner wishes you would change when it comes to kissing too. This will help you learn that!

, You could tell your partner that you read in a magazine about a new way of kissing and ask if you can try it.


Make it sound like it’s a fun experiment or adventure. Say something like, “In the magazine, they mention that you should try to kiss gently, and without using too much tongue. It might be fun to try that.”
Keep it lighthearted, and tell your partner that you read this in a women’s or men's magazine. Don’t make it sound like you were seeking out the information, though., In this game, you mirror how each other kisses. Don’t be critical, just suggest playing the game because it sounds fun.


Here’s how you play it. You kiss your partner a certain way, and then your partner has to kiss you back in exactly the same way, and so forth.
You could say, “I love kissing you” before you play the game to put your partner in the right mood. Your partner should be able to figure out how you like to be kissed through playing this game.

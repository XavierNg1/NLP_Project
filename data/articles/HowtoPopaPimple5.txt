 Place one fingertip on either side, just below the tip of the whitehead. You should be able to feel the sebum-filled area easily. After you've located the sebum-filed area, very gently wiggle your fingers together to coax the fluid out.


If no pus comes out, position your fingertips in a slightly different place around the pimple, then try again.
If the pus still remains in the pimple, stop trying to pop it. The pimple is not yet ready to be popped; either wait a few days or let it go away on its own., This will encourage the remaining pus to come out; keep doing it until the pimple is completely drained. Don't touch the pimple itself, except to blot away the pus with tissues. There may be some bleeding. If you see blood, stop pushing at the pimple, and leave it alone - it will only put more pressure on the swollen area, and may cause scarring.
 Again, the important thing is to make sure bacteria doesn't invade the opening in the skin. Also, consider applying a small amount of bacitracin ointment to protect it.

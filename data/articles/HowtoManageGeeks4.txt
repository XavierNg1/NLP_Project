 Since managers may not understand the work geeks do very well, itâ€™s hard for them to recognize and reward a job well done, which hurts motivation. The solution is to work together to define a set of goals that both parties agree on. When these goals are met the geeks are doing a great job.
 Because managers and geeks are different types of people, managers may end up leaving the geeks alone. This makes leading them difficult, and geeks need good leadership - the same as all other personnel groups.


Without fail, have regular one-to-one meetings with your geeks.
 Geeks are smart, and will spot the weaknesses in your benefits packages and corporate bonus policies in a heartbeat - that's part of the skill set of a successful geek producing high quality code! So find out what your geeks really value - you may find voucher schemes that your general staff value are as good as worthless to your geek community. Giving them mid-range technology or cheap gadgets that would impress other staff may even be seen as an insult worse than no gadgets at all!

If you haven’t changed the homepage yet, the default page when you create a new tab is the Google Search bar. Below it are thumbnails of some of the frequent sites you go to.;
, A small translucent X (close) button will appear at the upper right of the thumbnail.
 Click on the close button to remove it from the most visited list. If you’ve been to a lot of sites lately, the site next on the list will replace that one you removed.

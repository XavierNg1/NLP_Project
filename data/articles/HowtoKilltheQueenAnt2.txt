 One natural way you can try to kill the queen ant is to use water to flush the colony. Start with about two to three gallons of boiling water. Pour it directly onto the ant hill. This should kill any ant it touches, including the queen ant.Don’t do this to fire ants. If you accidentally get any on you, you can get injured.
 Making a solution of borax or boric acid and a sugary substance can help kill ants, including the queen. Mix ¾ of microwave heated maple syrup or honey with ¼ cup of borax. Stir until smooth and combined. This creates a liquid bait for the adult ants. To make a solid bait that will kill larva, use the same ratio of powdered sugar to borax, mixing until it is combined.Place large drops of the baits in the middle of a trail of ants, including any walls, railings, or sidewalks. Place the liquid and solid mixtures along the trail as you near the nest. If there are multiple trails, do it on each trail.
Don’t place borax in the garden or on soil. If you have ants in your garden, place the solution on something to protect the soil and your plants.
You can buy borax at the supermarket or home improvement stores.
Borax is toxic. Make sure to prevent pets and children from getting into this solution.
 Cornstarch is another natural method you can try to kill the queen ant. Place a line of cornstarch around the nest or ant hill. The ants will take the cornstarch into the colony to be used as food. The fiber content in the starch will make the ants swell and die, including the queen if she eats the cornstarch.This may take a while to work, but may be more effective and long-lasting.

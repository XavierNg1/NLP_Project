 Adults often develop a loose tooth due to grinding their teeth or gum disease. In some cases, the tooth can be knocked loose due to trauma to the mouth. If you have a loose adult tooth or you suspect the tooth is infected, see your dentist for treatment.A tooth is likely infected if it is sore or painful to the touch. The gum area around the tooth may also be painful, swollen, or red.
If you notice your child has a loose tooth that appears infected, bring them to the dentist right away.
 Your dentist will assess the tooth and determine if it is infected. They may provide extra support to the tooth, such as a small flexible splint, to keep the tooth anchored and stable. You will need to wear the splint for two weeks so the tooth can heal and go back into place.If you have a loose tooth due to grinding your teeth, known as bruxism, you may need to wear a special mouth guard at night when you sleep.
If you have a loose tooth due to gum disease, you may need to have deep cleaning done on the tooth.
 If the tooth is too loose to be saved and is very infected, the dentist may recommend removing it. They will do a tooth extraction, numbing the area so you do not feel any pain when it is removed. You may then need to wear a dental implant or a partial denture to replace the tooth.Having an implant will prevent your other teeth from pulling out of their sockets to try to fill the space.

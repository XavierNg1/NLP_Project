 "Be confident on your decisions."


If a teammate is open and you are being blocked, pass it to them immediately. That will give your teammate more of a chance to get an easy shot.
It's often tempting to take a shot as soon as you get the ball. Unless you have an unblocked jump-shot or an easy layup, do not take the shot.;
, Bend and release quickly in one swift motion, since you may have too much pressure to take proper time to aim.
 Keeping your head up can not only give a player a better shot than you, but it can give you a shot as well if they pass it back.
 Passing it high in the air is not a good idea. Pass firmly, as it should be flying through the air quick enough so that any opponent player cannot intercept it.
 If you shoot and it's clear that the ball is not going into the net, try to grab an offensive rebound. ,

, You will never grow to be a better basketball player if you do not take risks. If you never try shots that you haven't done before, you will never improve!

, Besides helping you improve, a coach will notice this and pick you above somebody else who may not work as hard. Don't be afraid to get your butt on the ground and dive after some loose balls.
 A good shot is an open shot that you can make a high-percentage of and nobody else on your team has a better scoring opportunity. If you take bad shots, you'll be on the bench.
 Any time you get in a huddle, always sprint to the front and make eye contact with the coach while he is talking. The coach will notice this and know that you care and are listening intently.

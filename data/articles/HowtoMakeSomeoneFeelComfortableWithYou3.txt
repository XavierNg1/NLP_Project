 If you are shouting across the room to someone, this can make for an uncomfortable conversation. Pull up a chair or stand close enough to them so that you can speak in a normal tone and be easily heard. If you can’t hear them, there is a good chance that they can’t hear you., A good rule of thumb is to remain an arm’s length from someone you are talking to. This allows the other person to feel comfortable and not threatened., In addition to giving someone their “bubble space,” you should keep your hands, feet, face, etc. to yourself. Do not touch another person unless you have their permission and know that they are comfortable with the contact. This includes things as innocent as patting someone on the shoulder.

 Fill it with water and set it on high heat. Cover it with a lid to get a roiling boil.


Do not add salt to the water because it will take longer for the water to come to a boil.;
, The larger the batch of kale you want to blanch, the larger your stockpot and ice bath should be. Fill it one half full of water, and then add a dozen cubes of ice.
 It will speed up the process of drying the leaves.
 You may want 2 layers of towel for faster drying of the blanched kale leaves.

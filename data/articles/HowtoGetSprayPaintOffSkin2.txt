 Choose a heavy lotion or cream and squeeze a generous amount over the skin stained with spray paint.









Baby lotion is often recommended.Any lotion will do the trick, really, but baby lotion contains little to no added chemicals, fragrances, or dyes, so it is the gentlest and best suited for areas of skin that could be sensitive or prone to irritation.
Lotions, hand creams, foot creams, and similar moisturizing products usually contain oil, which can bond with the oil in spray paints in order to lift it up and off of the skin.
 Scrub the lotion into the skin, restricting it to areas covered by paint. Use your hands to rub the lotion in, applying firm pressure without being abrasive.









Avoid letting the lotion spread to untouched parts of your skin. There is some chance that the paint lifted out and carried into the lotion could spread to previously unstained areas of skin in this manner.
 Let the lotion sit on your skin for one or two minutes before wiping it off with a clean paper towel.









By allowing the lotion to sit, you give it a chance to penetrate the pores deeper, sinking further into the skin and coming into contact with more of the spray paint.
You could also use a clean rag instead of paper towels.
 Depending on how much spray paint you got on your hands and how deeply it sunk into your skin, one application may not be enough. If you notice some change but some paint still remains, repeat this method again until the rest of the paint lifts out.

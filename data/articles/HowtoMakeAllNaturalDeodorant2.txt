 Some people also develop redness and irritation from using baking soda on their underarms. If this happens to you (or even if you just want to try another method), then this recipe is for you. Begin by gathering the necessary ingredients. You’ll need a digital kitchen scale to measure out the ingredients. This recipe calls for:30g coconut oil
20g Shea butter
10g carrier oil (your preference of almond, castor, or avocado oil all work well)
10g beeswax
15g arrowroot powder
15g food-grade diatomaceous earth
1 vitamin E capsule (400 IU)
10 drops of essential oil

, If you have a double boiler, you can use it to melt these ingredients together, or you can simply place all of them in a heavy, heat-safe jar and place the jar in a pan of boiling water.Use low heat and stir everything in evenly. The beeswax will take the longest to melt, but have patience., Once the beeswax finally melts and you stir it in, remove the mixture from the heat and give it a couple of minutes to cool—up to five., Before the mix hardens and begins to solidify, mix in the rest of the ingredients (break the vitamin E capsule to add it). Whisk all of the ingredients together well to ensure an even distribution of the materials.If you’ve never tested the essential oil you’ve chosen on your skin before, then try a drop or two on your underarm first and wait several minutes to make sure that it doesn’t irritate your skin at all.
 This recipe will set into a roll-on solid deodorant fairly quickly.Once the final ingredients are whisked in, you can pour it into a storage container of your choice. A shallow jar will do. You can simply rub some of the deodorant onto your fingers and then apply it to your underarms as needed.If you prefer the familiar, roll-on stick form, then you can pour the mixture into popsicle molds and place them in the freezer for an hour before removing them. Wrap each individual stick in wax paper or parchment paper before storing them to help avoid having them melt together.

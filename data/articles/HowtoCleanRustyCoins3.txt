 Hold the coin by its edges: touching the surface directly can leave small scratches in the surface. If you want to protect the coin’s surface, don't rub it.
 The higher your water pressure, the better. Make sure to not use a high-powered water jet that could go straight through the coin.
 If dirt remains, lightly scrub the coin with a soft toothbrush and dish soap. Run the toothbrush under warm water to further soften the bristles. Rinse the brush and the coin frequently to avoid scratching the coin with the loosened dirt. Do not apply much pressure, and focus on brushing only the soiled area of the coin.


Toothbrush bristles come with varying degrees of firmness — you want one labeled as soft or extra-soft. If you use a firm bristle, you risk damaging the coin.
 Especially on ancient coins, there may be dirt that remains after soaking and brushing. To remove this, use a small, sharp implement such as a toothpick or a precision screwdriver. Carefully pry and chip off the encrusted dirt, and try not to scratch the surface of the coin. You can spot-clean more precisely if you work under good lighting and use a microscope or magnifying glass.
 Wait about ten minutes, then rub the vinegar off with a toothbrush. This may give the coin a more polished finish. Consider using anything acidic: lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and even sodas have been said to help clean rust off of old coins.


Consider adding salt to your vinegar/citric acid/soda. The combination of acid and chloride may make your cleaning solution even more powerful.
 After soaking, thoroughly rinse the coin under very warm, running water. If the coin is clean enough for your taste, proceed to drying. Don't leave the acid on the coin, or it will keep etching and produce an unsightly green coating of copper salts.
 Pat the coin dry with a soft, lint-free cloth, and then lay the coin on a soft, dry cloth to finish drying. Do not rub the coin dry.

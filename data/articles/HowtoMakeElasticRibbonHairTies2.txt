 Sometimes, it's labeled as "elastic ribbon." You can find it online and in fabric stores. It's a smooth elastic with a crease down the middle. It comes in many different colors and patterns.
 You can find these alongside the fold over elastics. You can also use a small, decorative buckle, as long as it does not have a prong. Look for a round, square, or oval ring with a vertical bar running through it.


Choose a design that matches your elastic ribbon.
Make sure that the ribbon slide fits over the elastic.
 Something around 8 or 10 inches (20.32 or 25.5 centimeters) would work the best. As a general rule of thumb, the thicker your hair is, the longer you'll have to cut it.
 Push one end of your elastic up through the right-hand opening on the ribbon slide. Pull it up a little, then push the end back down through the left-hand opening. Slide the ribbon slide a few inches down the ribbon.Don't worry about the slide's placement. You can adjust it later.
Make sure that the fancy side of the ribbon is facing out.
 The patterned or shiny side should be facing out. The decorated part of your slide should also be facing out.
 Fold both of the ends into a loop, then pull the ends through the hole. Adjust the knot's placement until the elastic is the size you want it to be, then gently pull on the ends to tighten the knot.
 Trim the ends at an angle for a nicer touch. Hold them near a flame to seal them so that they don't fray. At this point, you can adjust the placement of the ribbon slide.

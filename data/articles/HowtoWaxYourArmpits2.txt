 Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax.









Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time.
Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair stands to get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.
 Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place.









If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip.
Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off.
If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.
 Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit.









If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip.
If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.

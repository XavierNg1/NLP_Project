Choose a jean that comes down to the top of your foot but does not drag on the ground. You should be able to show off the stiletto heel, but do not make the heel the focal point of your entire outfit.
You can select nearly any fit. Trouser jeans, straight-leg jeans, skinny jeans, boot-cut jeans, and flared jeans can all be worn with stilettos; base your decision on your body type rather than on the heel.
Medium to dark washes often look better than extremely light washes.;

A loose, free-flowing skirt creates a more casual appearance when paired with a stiletto than a form-fitting skirt does.
A skirt or dress should also have a bit of length. Aim for skirts that fall just past the knee or lower. Anything shorter than that will either look too flashy or too trashy.
 Even though stilettos work for casual looks, some shorts are a little too casual to wear with them.


Stick with dressy, designer shorts. These shorts are not typically worn as casual wear, but you can dress them down by pairing them with a simple fitted t-shirt or a menâ€™s button-down shirt to create a casual look that is still chic enough to work with stilettos.
Try a fitted capri that goes down to your knee or mid-calf. While not technically a short, capri pants do offer a shorter option for hot days where long pants may prove too uncomfortable.

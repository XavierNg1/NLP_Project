 The rules of football are fairly simple. The only one that is difficult to grasp is the offside rule. Otherwise, the rules are very basic. Here's a quick list of them:

You can't touch the ball with your hands. That's a handball.






If you commit a handball in your own penalty box, you will give away a penalty to the other team. If the handball was on purpose, you can even get sent off.


No reckless tackles. That's a foul.






If you commit a foul outside of your own penalty box, you will give away a free kick.
If you commit a foul inside of your own penalty box, you will give away a penalty kick.
If the foul wasn't too bad but was notable, you may receive a yellow card. Think of it as a strict warning. Two yellow cards means you get a red card.
If the foul was very dangerous, you may receive a red card. Even with just one red card, you will be sent off of the pitch and not be allowed back on until the end of the game. The same rule applies if you get two yellow cards.


You must take a throw in with both feet on the ground and both hands above your head.

 If you have a channel like ESPN or Sky Sports on your television, take full advantage of it. Don't only watch your favourite team play, watch lower and higher leagues play too. This will allow you to notice what the better team did that the lower team didn't do and how it affected the game. For example, one team might have passed really well, leading to a lot of scoring opportunities, leading to a lot of goals. Try to incorporate these kind of tactics into your games. Make sure you take note of every position, but especially the one you hope to become proficient in.

 Before you begin your fast, make sure that you are drinking plenty of water. Getting enough water is not only necessary to maintain your health, but it can also help curb your appetite.Men should drink about 13 cups (3 liters) and women should drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) a day.Drinking enough water will help you curb your cravings and ease into your fast.
 In the days or weeks before the fast, try gradually easing your way into it. If the fast will last for a few weeks, consider adopting an eating schedule where you only eat on designated days of the week.For shorter fasts, you may want to slowly cut back on how much you eat as you near the fasting period.Either way, if you begin limiting how much you eat before the fast, it will be much easier to maintain it once you begin.


Before you begin your fast, you should also stop snacking. This is also a good practice for controlling your hunger and it will help you practice restraint.
Avoid eating a large meal before your fast. This will momentarily enlarge your stomach and increase your appetite as you begin your fast., As you near your fast date, consider eating more whole foods and skipping processed items, particularly sugary foods. Eating foods high in sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which increases your appetite. If you are looking to curb your appetite going into your fast, try to eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains. These foods will keep your appetite steady and make it easier for you to begin your fast.


You may also want to consider eating lean meats and other proteins. Protein rich foods will help you stay satiated longer.Avoid high-fat foods, which can also increase your hunger.

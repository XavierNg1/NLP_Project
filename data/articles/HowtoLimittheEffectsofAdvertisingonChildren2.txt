 Children who watch more than 4 hours of television a day are more likely to be obese. This means that children are both susceptible to junk food ads and they are less active.


The American government has pressured advertisers not to advertise junk food during shows geared toward children who are 12 years old or younger. However, the pledge that these companies made does not extend to popular family television shows that air during the evening.
 This is usually where the fresh food is located. In the inner aisles, there is candy and other foods that are packaged to appeal to children, with bright colors, cartoon characters and illustrations.
 Have conversations with them so that they know why they do not eat advertised junk food. Teach them about the food groups and moderation of sugar and fat, so that they know how to make good food decisions despite the advertising.
 This will limit the amount of time children spend looking at cereal boxes or other packaging that is aimed toward their demographic.
 Many junk food companies are offering "rewards" for people who buy a lot of their products. These sites encourage children to spend money on unhealthy purchases to receive gifts.

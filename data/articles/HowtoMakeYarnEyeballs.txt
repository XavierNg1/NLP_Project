 Make the length about half the diameter, so if the straw is a quarter inch from edge to edge, make the segment an eighth inch. This isn't precise, so you can make your best guess. Cut as many equal-length segments as you want eyes and make the length consistent.
, Leave a long tail, about the width of your hand. It will make the project easier to handle and give you something to use to secure the eyeball to your creation., Pull it snug, keeping a bit of tension on the tail. Don't pull so tight that the straw collapses.,, You may go around the straw multiple times.,





 Tails in back and one sideways stitch.

This leaves the original tail in back and a new tail out the side, plus one stitch going sideways across the center of the eye. Leave it pointing out the side if you plan to attach the side of the eyeball to the craft.




 Under one more loop (optional).

If you want to attach the back of the eyeball to the craft, instead, work through one more loop of thread towards the back.
Leave the tapestry needle on the eyeball for now. It will help you attach it later.
, Leave a little tail here, too., On the last couple stitches, run the needle back under the stitches to create a knot and hold the stitches in place.,
Optionally, instead of just trimming the ends at this point, you could work the tails up through the center of the other color, so that the tails end up at the back of the eyeball.


If this is a side-mount eye (shown), cut the back tails short, leaving the side tails long.
If this is a back-mount eye, tie all the tails together at the back and leave them long.
 Note that you will probably have to do this before the head is stuffed, while you can still reach both sides of the fabric., Tie them tightly and, if needed, trim them short.

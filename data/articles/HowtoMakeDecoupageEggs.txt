 Poke a larger hole on the rounder end of the egg.;
, Blow the contents out carefully through the larger end.
, Allow to air dry on a drying rack. They can also be gently dabbed with a cloth or paper towel.
 You can draw a triangle on but after a few cuts, you'll get used to doing this without having to follow a template.
 Add a bit of water to thin it; mix together. Paint this over the egg and any other eggs. This seals the surface of the eggs. Place the glued egg inside a shot glass to dry.
, Smooth it from the center out to the edges, to remove any air bubbles and to ensure that it is sticking properly.
 Overlap the edges to ensure that the egg surface is completely covered up.
, When dry, brush each egg entirely with a coat of the thinned glue. Let dry completely. This seals the paper and prevents it from curling up or getting damaged if it's accidentally sprayed or gets a little wet.
 These eggs would look great inside a glass bowl, on a cake stand, inside a tall wide vase or in other decorative uses as you'd like. Done.

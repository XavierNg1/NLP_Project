 If you don't have all the necessary equipment, you can try placing a glass or ceramic bowl into the water, but it may be a bit harder to work with. A double boiler slowly melts the chocolate, preventing it from bubbling up and burning to a crisp.


Add your chocolate chunks, stirring often. If it gets too hot, turn the heat down. Once they are near completely melted, remove from the heat, stirring until smooth and warm. Not hot.

The handy microwave is always an option. Heat on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through. Note: With a microwave, there's a greater risk of scorching your chocolate.
 Raise it and allow the extra chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Roll it around, turning the stick, allowing every bit of the apple to get a nice, thorough coating.


If the bits next to the Popsicle stick are proving a bit hard to reach, grab a spoon and dash on a pinch to any hard to reach spots. Even it out; the layering should be equal on all sides.
 You may have to use your hands and get in there to ensure the entire apple is coated evenly. If the topping is dripping off under the weight, pat it down on each side.


If you're using a drizzle, place the apples on the cookie sheet, Popsicle stick up. Then, simply take a spoonful of your drizzle and hold it about six inches (15 cm) above your apples, creating lines of varying thickness across the paper.
 The Popsicle sticks should be pointing up. Put it into the refrigerator to chill, until the chocolate is set.

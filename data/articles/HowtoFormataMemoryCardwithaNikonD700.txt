The Trash button is located on the back face of the D700 body next to the Preview button, and the MODE button is located on the top of the D700 body next to the shutter button and power switch. If done correctly, the letters 'For' should appear blinking in the shutter-speed sections of both the view finder and control panel.
 This will delete all photographs on your memory card and format it. Do not turn off the camera or remove the memory card while the card is being formatted. If you do not want to format the memory card, simply do not press the Trash and MODE buttons the second time and wait for the blinking 'For' to disappear, which it will do after about 6 seconds.
 The display will now show the full amount of photographs that can now be taken on the formatted card.
 You can access this by pressing the MENU button on the back of the D700 body, selecting the Setup Menu and pressing Format Memory Card, OK. This will format your memory card immediately.

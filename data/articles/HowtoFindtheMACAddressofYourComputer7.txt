 You can find the Settings app on your Home Screen. Tap the General category.
 This will list information about your specific device. Scroll down until you see Wi-Fi Address. This is the MAC address for your iDevice.


This works for all iOS devices: iPhone, iPod, and iPad.
 If you need the Bluetooth address, it is located directly beneath the Wi-Fi address entry.

 All cellular and digital phones will show the number of the person who is calling. Some home phones can be equipped with a caller ID device, too. If the phone or phones your child is most likely to answer are equipped with this device, instruct your child to look at the caller ID and use the information to decide if they want to answer the phone.If you wish, you could teach your child to only answer the phone if the incoming call is from a certain number (yours, for instance).;
, When a call comes in on a landline phone, accessing the caller is as simple as lifting the phone from the receiver. After picking it up, they should place the earpiece near their ear and the mouthpiece near their mouth.

Tell them that if they imagine the phone as a “C,” the earpiece is the portion that is curving out and away from the top of the phone.
 When answering cellular phones, there is often a button you must press or a technique you must utilize in order to access the caller. For example, you might have to press a button labelled, “Accept,” or swipe your finger across the phone’s digital screen., Explain to your child that sometimes, in the middle of a phone conversation, someone else might call them. In this case, the phone will make a sound – sometimes, one beep, sometimes, two or even three. Tell your child that if this occurs, they should check the caller ID and let the person they’re speaking with know that they have an incoming call.Typically, it is possible to switch between calls simply by pressing the “Accept” button or performing the action that enabled them to answer the phone initially.

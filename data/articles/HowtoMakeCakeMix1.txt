 Place the all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt into a sifter or a strainer. Sift into a bowl, eliminating any clumps.


Sifting helps lighten the flour from where it's been packed down. It also helps to mix the dry ingredients together well.You can also use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour in this recipe.
For a chocolate cake, add a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder with the other dry ingredients.;
, Stir in the the sugar a little bit at the time. Pour a little into the bowl, mix together, then pour some more.You can adjust the amount of sugar based on preference.
At this point, an alternate step can be added. You can mix shortening into the mix until small crumbs form., Place your mix in an airtight container. A jar works really well for this. The cake mix should last for at least 6 months this way.If you add the shortening to your mix, store it in a sealed plastic bag at room temperature.

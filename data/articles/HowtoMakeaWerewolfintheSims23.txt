 If it's already nighttime, your Sim will transform instantly. If it isn't, you won't notice any difference until 8PM Sim time. That's when your Sim transforms.
 If you ever want your Sim to stop being a wolf, just call the obedience trainer and buy Lycanthropic-B. Or, if you have Apartment Life, just have a witch or warlock that your werewolf knows make the potion.,

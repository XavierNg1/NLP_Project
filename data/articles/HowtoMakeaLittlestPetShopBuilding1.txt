 Glue the small boxes together in a row or stacked, depending on how much room you have to store and display the building.


Alternatively, use one large box. Take off the lid and get some large rectangle cardboard pieces from another box, and stick them inside to make different floors of the mall. Secure with glue, tape or staples.;

Draw a door outline on one part of the box or several doors on different boxes. A double door is best for stores.






Cut out the inner part of the doors.






Cover with plastic to make them appear like glass doors.






For an external exit door, simply cut a rectangle on one side of the box and write EXIT over the top of it.
 For example, draw an outline of or make an elevator, escalator and soda machine.

 These are relatively inexpensive and require a minimum time commitment. These are a good idea even if you donâ€™t intend to become fully qualified as they will allow you to be given greater responsibly and show your commitment to your equine education. If you do intend to become fully qualified you may be able to take a lower qualification within the same route or get an exemption.
 They offer internationally recognized progressive exams. Gaining the highest will often mean an exemption on a professional course.
 If they are affiliated they may offer exams similar to those of the Pony Club.

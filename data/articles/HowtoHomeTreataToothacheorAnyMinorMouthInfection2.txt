 Dissolve one teaspoon of salt water in 1/2 cup of warm water and swish around your mouth for a minute.You can also use baking soda for a similar effect. Dissolve the same amount of baking soda as you would salt in a cup of warm water. Yet another option would be to mix a 1/2 teaspoon with a few drops of water to make a paste that you then apply directly to the sore for pain relief. All of these methods can be used as often as you need.
Note that the salt water rinse may sting when you do it.
 Milk of Magnesia is a liquid suspension of magnesium hydroxide and can help reduce the pain of your canker sore and speed up the healing process. Apply a small amount (enough to cover the sore) of milk of magnesia on your canker sore a few times a day.Alternatively, apply the milk of magnesia after applying a half hydrogen peroxide and half water solution directly to the sore. Hydrogen peroxide works as an antiseptic and can reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth.
 Citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, chilies, hot sauce, and anything else abrasive can exacerbate the pain of your canker sore., Eating or drinking something very cold is a great way to numb your mouth and provide temporary relief. Smoothies, ice cream, and milkshakes are all good options.You can also directly apply ice to your canker sores by allowing ice chips/cubes to slowly dissolve over the sores. Just be careful not to choke.
 Make sure to use a soft brush that won't irritate your canker sore as well as toothpaste that doesn't foam, such as Biotene or Sensodyne ProNamel.Take your time and go gently over your teeth to avoid aggravating of your canker.

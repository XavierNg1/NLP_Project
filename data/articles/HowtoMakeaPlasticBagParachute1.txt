 These are extremely common place, and large enough to pick up air. First cut the bag so that it can lay flat on a surface. Next, using scissors or a precision knife, cut the largest square you can from the material.


The larger your parachute, the slower it will fall.;
, Next, fold the triangle in half using one of the long ends as the divider. This should result in a much thinner triangle. Repeat the same fold to your thin triangle. Once you have your third fold, cut the wide end off with scissors. This will cut all the degrees of the circumference at once. Once you have accomplished this, unfold the plastic to reveal your circle.









Alternatively, you can cut the corners off the square to make an octagon shape. Any additional amount of angles is good; what's important is that it starts to resemble a circle., You should make marks with permanent marker to ensure the highest visibility. These marks will ultimately become the holes for your parachute strings.









Six marks is optimal because it allows for the parachute to hold its shape and isn't overly complicated.
 Take a small square for each hole from a roll of paper tape and run it over the top and bottom of the hole. Because the tape holds its form better than the bag will, it will give you an easier time when it comes to stringing up the parachute.
 Because the plastic is fairly fragile, you won't need much force to do this. Hold up the bag and push it gently through. If the nail you're using is large, don't push it through all the way. The parachute holes should be just big enough for the strings to fit through.

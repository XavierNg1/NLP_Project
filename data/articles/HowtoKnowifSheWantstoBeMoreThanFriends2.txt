 Is she acting differently around you lately or asking for your input on major life decisions? Some people might read this as a sign of a strengthening friendship, but it could also be a sign that she's ready to take things to the next level.
 Does she consistently return your phone calls and text messages? Does she show up at important events that you ask her to attend? Someone who consistently makes times for you could be interested in being more than just friends.
 Ask your friends what they think about her attitude towards you. If the general consensus is that she likes you, you can feel comfortable about trying to move forward. If they all think she just sees you as a friend, you may want to back off from making any strong advances.

 Equip the command block by pressing E and dragging it into your action bar. Then right-click to place it on the ground.
 Right-click the command block to open the menu that allows the user to set actions.
 In the text box at the top of the menu, type in a command in the same way you would in the chat box. The command block functions just like the chat; however, it can be attached to a button or a circuit to execute commands automatically.


For example: On a command block attached to a button, right-clicking and typing “/xp 100 @p” into the console command textbox then pressing Enter or the “Done” button at the bottom of the menu will cause the player to get 100 experience points each time the button is pressed.
 Press / on the keyboard and type in “help” followed by the name of what you want to create a command for.


For instance, typing in “/help time” will display “Usage: /time <set:add> <value>”. This means you can set or add the time according to a certain value. Putting this into a command block: “/time set 12000” would set the time in game to 12000 ticks at the press of a button (a Minecraft day consists of 24000 ticks).

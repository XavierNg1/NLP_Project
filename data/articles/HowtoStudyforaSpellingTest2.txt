 To use the trace, copy and recall method of study, you'll need three pieces of paper. One piece will be for the list of words you want to study and trace, another sheet will be for you to copy the words onto, and the final sheet will be used for you to write words down from memory. Go ahead and get these sheets of paper ready before you get started.You can write the function of each sheet at the top of the paper.
On your tracing sheet, write down every word that you want to study.
Leave your copy and recall sheet blank for now.
 Once you've gotten your tracing paper prepared, having written down a list of the words you want to study, you can begin tracing the first word. Take your time to carefully trace over the letters, saying them out-loud as you do. It can also help to read the word out loud both before and after you trace it. Tracing the word will help build familiarity with it, allowing you to recall it from memory later on., Once you've traced the word on the tracing sheet, copy it down on your copy sheet. You can look at the word on your tracing sheet to make sure you are spelling it correctly. Try to say the word out-loud before you write it down and make sure to say each letter as you write it. Copying it from your tracing sheet will help you build muscle memory, allowing your hand to form the lines more easily during your test., Now it's time to write the first word on your list from memory. Take a look at the first word on your list and memorize it. Now, turn your copy and tracing sheets over, hiding the word lists from view. On your recall sheet, write down the word you've been practicing from memory. Saying the entire word out-loud as well as every letter can help you to recall the word as you write it. Once you've written the word down, look at your tracing sheet to compare and see how well you did..

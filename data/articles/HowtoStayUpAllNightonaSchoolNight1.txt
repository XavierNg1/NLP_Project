 Bring a coffeemaker into your room, if you have one. The coffee will help you stay awake and bringing it in your room will decrease noise level. You may also drink tea, soda, energy drinks, or any other caffeinated beverage.


Bear in mind that coffee won't keep you awake forever.
Don't overload on coffee, or you will become shaky and frazzled. Drink as much as you need to stay awake.;
, The shock of the cold water may help wake you up. Also consider using a cold, wet washcloth, or taking a cold shower.
 Anything you can do to elevate your heart-rate can keep you energized for a little while. Do jumping jacks, jump on your bed, or even jog in place for a few minutes. Small bursts of physical activity when you get tired can help you stay awake.
 Your mind associates your bed with sleep. If you lay in your bed, you will trigger the process of falling asleep, and you may find it more difficult to keep your eyes open.
 Shut your eyes and set your alarm for about twenty minutes. When you wake up, you'll likely feel rested and re-energized. Be careful not to sleep much longer than 20 minutes, however, or you may wake up groggy!


When you awake from your power nap, get up immediately. Don't lie in bed, and don't hit the snooze button. The longer you stretch the nap, the more likely you are to slip into sleep.
 Keep the lights on and don't keep staring at only one spot. Look at bright colors, or stare at your computer screen.
 Try to eat protein-rich foods such as sandwiches, nuts, and dairy products. Sugary foods may make you feel awake for a little while, but they can eventually make you feel drowsy as you crash off the sugar high.

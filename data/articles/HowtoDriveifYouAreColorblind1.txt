 The primary difficultly of driving a car when colorblind is dealing with traffic lights. Red-green colorblindness is the most common form, and as such, many colorblind individuals cannot distinguish between these two traffic lights. In order to adapt, you must memorize the order in which the traffic lights appear.Red (stop) is always positioned at the top.
Green (go) is always positioned at the bottom.
Yellow (slow down/yield) is always positioned in the middle.;
, If you are unable to see the color of traffic lights, it may take you just a split-second longer to determine what the light is communicating. Get into the habit of slowing down when approaching intersections, in order to verify the position of the light., Many colorblind people experience difficulty noticing the brake lights of the car in front of them. In order to prevent accidents, maintain a larger-than-average following distance. This will give you more time to recognize that the car in front of you is slowing down or stopping.For most drivers, a two second following distance is recommended.
If you are colorblind, use a three second (or greater) following distance.

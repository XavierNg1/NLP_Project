 Ask one of his friends or try if you can find his email address at his Internet profile. If you have the wrong address it could be very embarrassing!;
, Maybe it's too childish or something, then go and make a new one.
 Tell him a few facts about you and don't be afraid to let him know you're writing that email just because you're a bit shy. (If you know he will laugh about it - don't write it in the first mail, tell him later!)

, How to start? Hello, Hi, Hey, Dear xxx ... ? Don't be too formal, don't be too close - write "Hey xxx". That would be okay.
 You could start with some questions that are not that personal. Ask something bout the football match last week or just something like that. Write you've seen him at the cinema or another place, maybe he has seen you too - so tell him you were for example that girl sitting on the bench on the other side of the street. Please don't write a whole book, that's just the beginning part.
 You wanna see him again ? Tell him you will meet your friends at the park and that you would like to invite him there (maybe you ask him to bring some friends with him, if you don't wanna let him know you really like him.)

, If you're brave enough ask him out. You two could meet at the mall but remember your/his friends could be there too.
 Do you just wanna write mails only or rather meet him after you were writing with him for a month ? Then tell him about your aims, it's better to let him know what you really want.
 and your name - for your first mail that is fine.
 If he won't write back at the same day - chill. Maybe he's too busy to answer. If you've waited for one or two weeks without a sign ... then he's not interested or he deletes your mail. Be strong !

, If he has not answered yet don't say anything, but if he smiles, smile back.

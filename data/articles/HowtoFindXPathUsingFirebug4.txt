 You don't need to install anything to find the XPath in Internet Explorer. Open the website that contains the element you want to inspect.
 The developer tools panel will appear at the bottom of the window.
 You'll find this in the upper-left corner of the developer tools panel.
 This will select it and highlight the code for it in the DOM Explorer.
 Each of the tabs along the bottom of the panel is an XPath expression for the element you have selected. You cannot copy it in XPath format like you can in Firefox with Firebug.

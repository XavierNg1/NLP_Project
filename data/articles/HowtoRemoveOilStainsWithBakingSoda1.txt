 Try to use a plastic bristled brush, like the kind you'd use on a bathtub. Do not use a metal-bristled brush. It can damage the concrete, especially if a bristle gets caught in a crack and rusts.If the stain is very stubborn, add a few drops of dish detergent.
It's a good idea to save this brush for future oil stain removal as it will get grimy.
 Repeat as needed until the stains disappear. Rinse out the brush and put back in storage.

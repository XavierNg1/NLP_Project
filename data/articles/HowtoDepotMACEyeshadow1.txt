 While the goal is to keep the eye shadows in tact when you depot them, you may sometimes nick the powder and cause dust and particles to come loose. It’s a good idea to cover the table or counter that you’re working on with paper towel, newspaper, or some old towels that you don’t mind getting stained.


Because you’re working with heated items, you should also have a trivet on your work area to protect the surface from the candle or flat iron.;
, At the front of the compact, you’ll notice a small notch where the compact snaps shut. Just above it, you can see a thin line where the pan’s plastic housing fits into the compact. That’s where you’ll need to work to separate the two., When you’ve found the groove between the plastic housing for the shadow and the compact, take a small, thin tool with a pointed tip and work it into the groove. Wedge it in the groove to give yourself some leverage.You can use a pointed kitchen knife, craft knife, or pointed, flexible makeup spatula that you can usually find on beauty supply or cosmetics websites.
 Once your tool is wedged between the eyeshadow pan’s plastic housing and the compact, wiggle it back and forth to loosen it. The more you move the tool, the further you’ll be able to stick it under the plastic housing. When you have enough leverage, you’ll be able to pop the plastic housing and the eyeshadow pan inside it free.Be sure to take your time when you’re prying the eyeshadow’s housing free from the compact to avoid breaking the plastic and damaging the shadow. If you feel strong resistance, continue gently wiggling the tool back and forth until you can feel the housing start to come loose.

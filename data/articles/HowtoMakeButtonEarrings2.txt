 You can use plain 2-hole or 4-hole buttons for this. You can also use coat-style buttons with a loop on the back, or even fabric-covered buttons.
 If you are using 2-hole or 4-hole buttons, you do not need to prep them. If you are using a coat-style button, or any other style of button that has a loop on the back, you will need to cut the loop off with a pair of wire cutters.When you are done, use a piece of fine-grit sand paper to smooth away any roughness or jagged edges.
 This will create the loop for your earring to hook on to. It needs to be a little bit shorter than the button itself.Alternatively, you can use a small piece of gold or silver wire, and then bent it into a narrow U-shape. Be sure to match the color of your wire to your earring hook. For example, if your earring hook is gold, you should use gold wire.
 Make sure that the top part of the paperclip is sticking out over the edge of the button. It does not need to stick out by muchâ€”just enough so that you can thread your earring hook through.The best type of glue to use for this would be a thick, industrial-strength or epoxy glue. If you are using a basic 2-hole or 4-hole button, however, super glue may also work.
 If you move on too soon, the next step might weaken the paperclip loop, and cause it to break off.
 Do not pull the loop apart, as this may distort it.
 When slipping the earring hook on, making sure that it is facing the right, otherwise, your earrings will be backwards when you put them on!

, Once you can done this, your earrings are ready to wear!

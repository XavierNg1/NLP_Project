 To create a rose ring, you will need to start with a chain of 11 stitches. This will make a small crocheted rose. You can make the chain longer if you want to make a larger rose., Skip the first link in your chain, and then half double crochet twice into each stitch all the way to the end. You should have 20 half double crochet stitches when you reach the end of the row.Cut the tail a few inches from the last stitch and pull it through to secure it.
 Begin to coil the strip of half double crocheted stitches by rolling it starting at one end. It should begin to form a rose shape.When the rose is coiled up to your liking, thread the tail through a darning needle and sew through the bottom of the rose to secure the shape.
 Next, you will need to attach the rose to your ring band. To do this, thread the starting tail or an extra piece of yarn through a darning needle and then use this to sew the rose onto the ring band.After the rose is secured, tie the yarn through a stitch in the band to secure it and cut the excess.

, Run your tongue across the roof of your mouth. The hard part is called your hard palate and the fleshy bit behind it is called your soft palate.You need to create space at the back of you mouth in order for a richer tone to be produced. We do this by raising our soft palate. To raise your soft palate, yawn or laugh. That feeling of space is your soft palate being raised. You should have the feeling every time you sing.

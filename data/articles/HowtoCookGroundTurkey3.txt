, Place the meat, the spices, the onion and garlic, the tomato paste, the egg and the breadcrumbs in a large mixing bowl. Mix all of the ingredients together using clean hands. Knead the mixture for several minutes until everything is thoroughly combined.
 Scoop some of the mixture into your hand and use both hands to roll it into a ball. Place the meatball on a nonstick or greased baking sheet. Continue making balls of the same size until you've finished forming the rest of the mixture into meatballs.


To make it easier to create balls of the same size, use a small ice cream scoop or a measuring cup.
Use a pan with high sides to prevent the meatballs from rolling off.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook the meatballs for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Remove them from the oven and serve with marinara sauce.

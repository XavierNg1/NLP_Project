 Whether you use the shape method or the phonetic one, many people find it easiest to remember images if they are placed in a story, or spatially in an imagined "mind palace."To begin, imagine all your images in one place.


This can be especially helpful with very long numbers.
Any place will do--a house, a park, a sailing ship, whatever you like.
 Create some memorable sequence using these images. This can be done either by making up a story in which each of the images appears, or by imagining walking through the space you have imagined your images in, seeing each image one at a time.


For example, you could come up with a short story like this: "It was a sweltering hot day. A robot (32) picked up a fan(82). He began to wave it at a panting dog(17) to cool him off." Note that every concrete noun (man, fan, and dog) corresponds to digits in our number.
Another approach is imagine yourself walking through a space (a "mind palace" or "memory palace") and seeing each image in sequence.Using this technique, you might imagine a robot opening the door into a hallway where you a greeted by your favorite type of dog. You turn the corner in the hallway and feel the breeze from a large fan spinning on the ceiling above you.
 Make your story or memory palace journey as memorable as possible. Picture details, and make them vivid so they'll stick in your mind. Some people find it helpful to make their story dramatic or even gross.Sticking with our simple example, imagine what the robot looks like. Is it short? Tall? is it metallic or has it been painted some color? Is it boxy and awkward like in an old sci-fi film, or sleek and futuristic? What type of dog is it? What color? What does the fan look like? Imagine the cool breeze of the fan on a hot afternoon.
 Finally, you'll decode your story or journey by breaking it down into words and then breaking those words down into numbers.

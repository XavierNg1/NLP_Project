 They are: ch = chain; dc = UK double crochet (US single crochet).;
,, Leave 1cm on each end for sewing on towel.
 Turn to the side. Continue the row for 4dc down the edges of the rows.
 Continue to dc down the row edges, but work both pieces of fabric together. Skip every other row or so to turn it into a curve. Upon reaching the edge of the 5th row from the start, continue to work on one piece of fabric only. You have now formed a simple crochet loop.
 Ensure that the stitching is firm but invisible.
 The hand towel will now hang from a hook in the bathroom or kitchen areas, as required.

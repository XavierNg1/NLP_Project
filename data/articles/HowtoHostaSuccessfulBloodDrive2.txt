 The more people recruiting, the easier it will be to find donors.
 Put posters up around town, and use bulletins on your website or in your newsletters. Send a press release out to local papers.
 Ideally, you should ask them in person. If that is impossible, do so over the phone.


Do not wait until late at night or at dinnertime—you have the best chance of getting the person’s full attention if they are not in the middle of doing something.
 Ask them to share their story. This will make the prospect of donating blood more personal.
 People are more likely to help if they know that their donation will get your organization that much closer to its goal.
 The person you are talking to is more likely to be excited about the prospect of donating blood if you are excited about it. Speak with confidence, and remind them that their blood can save another person’s life.


While enthusiasm is key, it is important not to pressure or guilt anyone into donating blood.
Remember that the prospect of giving blood can be scary—especially for first time donors. Explain to a potential donor all that is involved in donating, and answer any questions that they may have. You should also inform them how their donation will help those in need.
 Divide your organization into multiple groups and see who can recruit the most members.
 While you can still offer a sign up table on the day of the event, having scheduled appointments will help avert long lines and wait times.


Be sure that the donor is aware of the importance of keeping the appointment.
Send them friendly reminders of the time through phone, email, or text message as the date gets closer.
Call people who do not show up on the day of the drive.

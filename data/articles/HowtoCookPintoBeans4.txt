Cook the beans or drain canned beans as above. Alternatively, cook the pinto using a pressure cooker (in which case, it should only take a half hour).
Add oil to a cast iron skillet or pan. Add chopped onions and fry.
Add a little bit of hot water, about 1/4 cup per cup of cooked beans.
Add the beans and allow to heat gently in the hot water.
Mash the beans. Let them cook until all liquid is absorbed.
Serve. Mashed pinto beans have many uses, from filling to spreads, to being a simple but tasty side dish. Follow your recipe's suggestions if including in a dish.
 Presoak 1 pound/450g of pinto beans as outlined above, then add fresh water to cover the beans by at least an inch or two (2.5-5cm).









Add 1 large chopped onion, 1 chopped clove of garlic, 1 seeded and chopped jalape√±o, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, a dash of cayenne and freshly ground pepper to taste.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and pop on a lid. Cook for 2-3 hours, or until the beans are tender.
Stir at least every 1/2 hour and add more water if needed, to keep the beans always covered.
Add salt to taste just before serving. Garnish with chopped tomatoes, shredded cilantro and shredded cheese.

Note: This recipe is an exception to not adding seasonings when the beans cook. What matters is that the salt is not added until the very end of cooking.
 Cut raw vegetables, such as celery and carrot sticks and add some dipping chips for a tasty snack.
 If a stew calls for adding beans to it, use the pinto beans. Or, make a pinto bean stew from scratch.

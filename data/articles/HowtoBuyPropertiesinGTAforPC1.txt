 This can be done by either double-clicking the GTA Vice City shortcut icon on the desktop if you have it there, or by following this Start Menu sequence: Start button >> All Programs >> Rockstar Games >> Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.;
, Press Enter repeatedly to skip through the pre-game animations till you arrive at the Main Menu. Click “Start Game” and then “New Game” to start GTA Vice City from the beginning, or click “Load Game” to load a previously saved file and continue from there. This will enter you into the game world.
 Walk (use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the character) to the nearest car you can find and press F or Enter to enter it.


Drive around the city (use the same keys for walking to control the car) on the lookout for these properties. A property on sale will have a pink marker with a green icon of a house inside it.
 Once you see a property you like, get out of the car by pressing F or Enter, and then walk and stand in the pink and green marker. A message will appear on the top left-hand corner of the screen, instructing you to press Tab in order to purchase the property for the price stated in the message.


Hit the Tab key to purchase it. A message and an animation will be played on the screen to confirm that you have purchased the property. The money will be deducted from your in-game cash, which is displayed on the top right-hand corner of the screen.
Depending on what kind of property you bought, you may earn revenue from it, store cars there, or save your game progress (and lose your police wanted level in the process) by walking into the building. For properties that have that option, earned revenue is collected by walking into the icon of a pink marker with a dollar sign that replaces the original purchase icon after buying the property.

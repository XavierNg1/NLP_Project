 You have to be logged in before you can file a dispute. Enter your email address and password into the text fields to the right, and click on “Sign In” to access your account. This will bring you to your Elance profile page.
 Once logged in, you will be on the “My Jobs” page; this is where you need to find the job you are trying to dispute.
 Beside the job name is the Actions tab. Click on the tab to make a drop-down list appear. Near the bottom of the list is an option that says “Refund, Cancel, or Dispute.” Click on this option.
 A screen will load explaining the dispute process for both the freelancers and the contractors. Scroll down to the gray button that says “File a request,” and click on it.
 Indicate whether you would like to cancel the job, request a refund, or file a dispute, and click on the corresponding bubble beside it. To continue with the filing of a dispute, click on the third bubble. A white text box will pop up.
 Click inside the white box and describe in detail the dispute.


Examples of common disputes are clients who refuse to pay and freelancers who cut off contact in the middle of the job.
 Double-check your explanation for the dispute. When you’re satisfied, click on the green “Submit” button below your dispute.
 It can take anywhere from a week to a month, but Elance will get back to you and let you know their decision regarding the issue.

 Place the aspirin in a dish with a flat bottom. Then, use a blunt object, such as the back of a spoon, to grind it into a fine powder. Break up as many big pieces and clumps as you can—this will make it easier to blend with water.


Aspirin is often used orally to treat pain and swelling, but it will also work when applied topically.
A single tablet should be more than enough for most bumps. If the irritated site is so large that one won’t do the trick, forego the home remedies and see a doctor right away.
 Pour in the water gradually until you achieve just the right consistency, stirring as you go. The paste should be roughly the same texture as cake icing. That way, it will be thick enough to cling to your skin.Avoid adding too much water. If the mixture is too thin and runny, it won’t be able to hold.
 Scoop up a glob of the aspirin paste with a cotton swab and brush it lightly over the affected area. Dab on enough to completely coat the bump and a small portion of the surrounding skin. If possible, use a small bandage to cover the bump once you’ve smeared on the aspirin.Be careful not to jab at the bump with the cotton swab.
Your skin should be clean and dry before you apply the aspirin paste.
 It will take a few minutes for the medicine to begin working. Once it does, you should begin to feel relief fairly quickly. After treating the bump, rinse out your ear with warm water to flush away the residue left over from the paste. Repeat this process up to twice a day to keep tenderness and inflammation under control.Applying the aspirin directly to your skin effectively cuts out the middleman of ingesting it and waiting for it to make its way through your bloodstream.
After a few days, you should be able to notice the bump shrinking.

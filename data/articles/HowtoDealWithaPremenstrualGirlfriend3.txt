 Dealing with anybody on a short fuse can be trying. If she snaps at you, or does something to get under your skin, don't lose your temper and fight back. It will just make things worse. Instead, take a few deep breaths, walk away from the situation for a moment, and return when you can be calm with her.Cut her some slack during this time but still maintain your boundaries. Even if she is not feeling great, she should not be yelling or cursing at you.
 During this time, her emotions might get the best of her and your best defense against this is to remain level-headed and calm. Rather than lashing out at her, even when you feel that she is being illogical, simply say "Ok, I understand, let’s talk about this later.”, Think about a time when physical changes made you cranky. Was there ever an instance when you weren't getting enough sleep, and you became rather abrasive as a result? Put yourself in her shoes. Not only might she be experiencing bothersome physical symptoms, but her hormones are also in flux, affecting her emotionally.


Use these reflections as a way to develop more compassion for her.
 In addition, while your girlfriend is PMSing, check in and see what she needs from you. Though it is great to take initiative and do some things on your own, there may be some things that she needs that you hadn’t considered. She might need you to run some errands for her or perhaps she just wants to be held. Whatever her needs, do your best to fulfill them.

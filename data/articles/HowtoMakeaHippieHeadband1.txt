 Pick out one or two shapes to use on your headband. Draw the shapes on paper and cut it out to use as a pattern. Place the pattern on the felt and use a permanent marker to trace around the shape. Trace eight to ten shapes on the felt. Use scissors to cut out the shapes.Make sure the shapes are small so you can fit them on the headband. Shapes that are about one to two inches wide work great. If you want bigger shapes, you will just have less on your headband.
Hearts, stars, flowers, and circles look great on a headband.
You can use two different shapes to alternate in a pattern.;
, Measure the elastic by wrapping it around your head. Pull the elastic to stretch a little while you measure. The elastic should be about one inch longer than the circumference around your head. Pinch the elastic with your fingers where you need to cut it, and bring it down to the table. Use scissors to cut the elastic where your fingers are., Use a hot glue gun to glue your shapes onto the elastic. Start in the middle of the elastic and glue one shape onto the elastic. Move down the elastic about two inches from the center shape and glue another shape on. Glue another shape about two inches above the center shape. Continue adding shapes in both directions until you have about two inches of elastic left on either end.


You should have the same amount of shapes on either side of the center shape.
 Overlap the elastic ends so that one end is on top of the other and glue them together with the hot glue gun. There should only be about one inch of overlap.
 You can add finishing touches to the headband by adding embellishments to the felt shapes.


Sew around the edges of the felt shapes to create a hand sewn look.
Glue jewels or buttons on the felt for a unique look.

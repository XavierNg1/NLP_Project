Add and Subtract. Fractions can only be added, or subtracted, if they have the same denominator, otherwise the answer is incorrect. For example, 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5. To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, the first step is to find the lowest common denominator. For example, 3/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 + 1X2/2X2

= 3/4 + 2/4
= 5/4 or 1 1/4
3/4 - 1/3 = 3X3/4X3 - 1X4/3X4
= 9/12 - 4/12
= 5/12


Multiply. To multiply fractions, divide the numerator and the denominator by any common factors. Any mixed numbers should first be converted to improper fractions. To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal.

/9 X 3/4 = 8/9 X 3/4
= 2/3 X 1/1
= 2/3








1/2 \ 6/7 = 7/2 \ 6/7








= 7/2 \ 7/6

the reciprocal of 6/7 is 7/6.*


= 49/12

12 \ 49 = 4 R 1.*


= 4 1/12

an integer number line and integer chips are tools that can help you understand operations with integers. You may also think in terms of profit and loss.
Add Integers:

-2 + 5 = 3 OR 2 + (-6) = -4


Subtract Integers:

-4 -9 = -4 + (-9) OR 3 -10 = 3 + (-10)
= -13 = -7

OR -2 - (-4) = -2 + 4
= 2




Multiply or Divide Integers:

X (-5) = -45 OR -6 X (-7) = 42 OR 20 \ (-4) = -5
OR -16 \ (-2) = 8

- 3(4Â² + 10)
= 7 - 3(16 + 10)
= 7 - 3(26)
= 7 - 78
= -71



, This way, you can clearly understand the problem, devise a strategy, carry out the strategy, and reflect on the results.
 You may use other strategies too.


Make an Organized List
Look for a Pattern
Work Backward
Draw a Diagram
Select a Tool
Use Systematic Trial
Use Logic or Reasoning

Pennies are laid out in a triangular pattern; the first triangular pattern has two on the base, 1 on top. The second has three on the base, 2 in the middle, 1 on top. The third has four on the bottom, three on the next line, two on the next one, and one on top. How many pennies do you need to form a triangle with 10 pennies in its base?

, Read it again. Express it in your own words.


A possible strategy is to identify and continue the pattern started in the diagram. Copy the diagram into your notebook.
 Describe how the pattern develops. Use your description to extend it to a triangle with a base of 10 pennies. Record your numbers in a table with the following headings: "Diagram Number" and "Number of Pennies".
 Can you find another pattern that could help you solve this problem?

,
identify and describing a pattern is a strategy that can be use when a sequence of operations or diagrams occurs.
When solving a problem, you will often use more than strategy. Here are some problems solving strategies:

Draw a diagram.
Work backward.
Make a model.
Make an organized list.
Look for a pattern.
Find needed information.
Act it out.
,




Solve a similar but simpler problem.
 We currently represent numbers using the numerals 0, 1, 2, and so on. Ancient civilizations used different symbols to represent numbers.



How can you represent numbers with ancient symbols?
about 5000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians used symbols to represent numbers. (See image.)
How would the Egyptians represent the numbers 13, 126, and 1291?

EXAMPLE Use a Diagram to Communicate



,, Communication can take the form of words, diagrams, and symbols.
,,,, You can make connecting mathematics to real life easier by drawing a diagram to illustrate the situation. You can then use the diagram to help you solve the problem. You can also use other strategies, such as making an organized list or looking for a pattern.
 For example, to find the amount of paint needed, you would use measurement, geometry, and number skills.

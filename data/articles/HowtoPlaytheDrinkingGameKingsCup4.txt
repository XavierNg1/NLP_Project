 With this rule, players are required to imagine that they have a little green man sitting on top of their cup. Throughout the game, they must mimic removing the little green man from the top of their cup every time they take a drink and put him back afterward. If they fail to do so, they get an additional penalty drink.
 With this rule, players are forbidden from saying the words "drink", "drank" or "drunk" for the entire duration of the game. If a player accidentally says one of the three D's, they must take a penalty drink.
 With this rule, right-handed players can only pick up their cup with their left hand and left-handed players can only pick up with their right. If a player is caught picking up a cup with their good hand, they must take a penalty drink.
 This rule is fairly self-explanatory. Players are not allowed to point at anyone or anything for the entire duration of the game. If they are caught breaking the rule, they must take a penalty drink.
 With this rule, players must pick a body part (lips, hair, ears, etc) that no one is allowed to touch for the duration of the game. If a player is caught touching the forbidden body part, they must take a penalty drink.
 Again, pretty self-explanatory. No swearing is allowed while the game is in play. If a player swears, they must take a penalty drink. It might help to outline the list of included swear words before the game begins.
 Every player is given a nickname at the start of the game. If at any point a player fails to refer to someone by their nickname, they must take a penalty drink.

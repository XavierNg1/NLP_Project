, There’s an Update Status box at the top of your Facebook News Feed and Timeline.
 This is not necessary if you just want to share a meme, but if you want to add your opinion on it, just type it in the Update Status box.
 Click the camera icon at the left side of the box, and a file explorer window will appear. Use it to locate and select the meme image file from your computer. Once you’ve found it, click “Open.”


The file will be uploaded on the page and a progress bar will display the status of the upload. The upload time will depend on the size of the file and the speed of the connection.
The maximum file size of the meme that can be uploaded is 25MB. The file formats supported are JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF, and TIFF.
 Once the meme has been completely uploaded, a preview of it will appear. To add more memes, click on the “+” adjacent to the preview. Again, the file explorer will appear to find and select the additional meme.


There are no restrictions on the number of memes you can upload at one time, but the size of all memes combined should not exceed 25MB.
 Once you are done, you can now share the meme by clicking the “Post” button next to the Status Update box.

 The bug acquires the infection while sucking the blood of an infected animal. The parasite then multiplies within the intestine of the bug and is excreted in its feces. The parasite enters you through the wound created when the bug bites you.Triatomine(reduviid) bugs usually come out at night for feeding when people tend to sleep. Their favorite site to bite is the face (which is why they are called “kissing bugs”).
The parasite can also enter the human body through the intact mucus membrane of the mouth or lips if the bug deposits excreta near the lips. Conjunctiva of the eye may be infected while rubbing the excreta against the eye.
 The kissing bug is found in parts of Central and South America. It generally lives in the walls and cracks of substandard houses, or out in the woods. The countries where it has been found include:


Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela.
 Sometimes, chagas disease does not have any symptoms that go along with it. If a person is asymptomatic, meaning they don’t have symptoms, and they donate blood, they might give someone else the disease.The same goes for organ donation if the donor is infected.
 In that case, the baby may be born with problems like abdominal swelling, jaundice, or lungs or heart defects.

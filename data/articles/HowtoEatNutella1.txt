 This is probably the most common way to enjoy Nutella, and certainly one of the simplest aside from eating it straight off the spoon (which is perfectly acceptable).


Try it on a nice crusty baguette.
It’s also tasty on a toasted bagel.
Enjoy it with Crepes.;
, As a quick online search will tell you, waffles and Nutella is a popular breakfast. It may not be healthy, but it is guaranteed to to be satisfying.


Try warming the Nutella in the microwave for a few seconds (take care not to microwave it in the plastic container). It’s hard to beat a warm chocolate-hazelnut drizzle.
 If you’re looking for a quick snack, try spreading Nutella between two Ritz crackers.


Some people prefer the saltiness of a Ritz cracker, but you may use any cracker you like.
Try spreading Nutella on wafer cookies. A lot like spreading Nutella on crackers, only a bit more indulgent. Certainly for those with a serious sweet tooth.
 The ultimate combination of sweet and salty.Cook bacon to desired crispiness and let it cool.
Warm the Nutella over low heat while the bacon is cooling.
Using a spatula, and taking care not to break the bacon, coat the bacon in Nutella.
Refrigerate to let the Nutella set on the bacon.
Enjoy.

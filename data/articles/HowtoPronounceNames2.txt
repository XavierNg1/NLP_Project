 This can be as sneaky as you're capable of. "Hey, who's that guy we're working with on the etymology project again?" Maybe your friends don't know either!


Don't be afraid to ask the person yourself. Odds are if you don't know, people butcher their name all the time. Say to him or her, "What's the native way of pronouncing your name?" to get them to pronounce it how they would back home. They'll love that you're making an effort.
 Once you have it, don't let it go. As Dale Carnegie said, "Remember that a person's name to that person is the sweetest and most important sound in any language."


Repeat it in your head seven times. You'll be less likely to forget the correct way to say it when you have it logged in your memory. If the pronunciation surprises you, think of a rhyme to ease recall.
 Because the world has become such a global village, there are quite a few websites out there dedicated to just this.


Hearnames, Pronouncenames, and Inogoloare all useful tools to circumvent the wonder.

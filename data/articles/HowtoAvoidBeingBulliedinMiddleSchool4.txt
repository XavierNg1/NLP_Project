 Bullying has come to light as a major problem in recent years. Many groups have been dedicated to addressing bullying in schools. If your school has an anti-bullying group, sign up. You can also start a group in your school to address bullying.In addition to helping combat the issue of bullying, a group will provide you with emotional support.
 If you can't stop a bully on your own, talk to an adult. Do not think of this as tattling. Bullies can cause major issues for you and other students and the issue should be addressed by someone older.You can talk to a parent, who may be able to talk to the school for you. You can also talk to a teacher you trust and who will advocate for you.
 Instead of focusing on people who are mean to you, focus on students worth your time. Spend quality time with close friends to strengthen your bonds. If you have strong, secure friendships, it will be easier to tune out bullies.

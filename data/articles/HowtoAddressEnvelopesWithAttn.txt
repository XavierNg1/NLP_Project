 The "Attn" line should always appear at the very top of your delivery address, just before the name of the person you're sending it to. Use a colon after "Attn" to make it clearly readable. This line signifies to the mail carrier exactly for whom the letter is intended.


For example, write "Attn: John Smith," where "John Smith" is replaced with your recipient's name.
As an alternative, you can write out the full word "attention."

, The name of the company where the person works goes underneath the "Attn" line. The company name should be written on the second line of the destination address.


If the company is large and the person to whom you're writing works for a particular department, include the department name on a line of it's own before you write the company name.
Not including the company name on the envelope will not usually prevent your letter from being delivered. However, your letter will look less professional, and may not get delivered promptly, if you don't include the company name.
 The full street address should be added in a single line. Make sure to include any directional signs (such as "east" or "west"), suite number, or unit number. Suite and unit numbers should not be placed on a separate line unless absolutely necessary.


Make sure you know the exact street address where your recipient works. Many businesses that are located in multi-story or other large buildings will include a suite number in their address. Including this number is crucial.
 If you know the "ZIP+4" postal code, include it to further ensure that your letter reaches the correct address., When you're satisfied that all the details are right, put a stamp in the upper righthand corner and send your letter.

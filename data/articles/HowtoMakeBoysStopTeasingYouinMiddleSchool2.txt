 Teasing is usually done to get a response from the victim. You can send a clear message that you do not care what they have to say if you simply ignore the teasing. Just walk away holding your head high and confident. If the teasing takes place online or in text, do not reply., By saying something humorous, you can show the bully that you are not affected by their words and also turn the focus on them. This may be enough to get them to lose interest and stop.


Try saying something like, "You must really like me! You put all your time and energy into noticing everything I do. I'm flattered!"
Or, you can try, “Look, I’d really like to stay and chat Billy, but I don’t want to be late to class. You can stay out here as long as you want though!”Then, just walk away.
 You should avoid a physical confrontation. Physical confrontations can quickly escalate to someone being hurt, and can get you into a lot of trouble. Instead, stand your ground and tell the boys to stop teasing you.Saying something like “I would appreciate it if you kept your opinion to yourself,” can send the message that you do not care what they think, but will stand up for yourself if they continue to harass you.
For example, if you are being teased, you might look at the person doing the teasing and say “I would really appreciate it if you stopped trying to tease me.”

, Teasing is often done in an attempt to gain attention from other people around. If your friends stand firmly with you and send the message that nobody is amused by the teasing, this can help to stop the teasing. Tell your friends how the teasing makes you feel and ask them to help you stop it.Just having a friend around can deter the bullying. Ask your friends to hang out with you in places that you know you would normally have to deal with the teasing.

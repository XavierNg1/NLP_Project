 Cut an 18" piece of 1x12, two 12" pieces of 1x12, and then split (lengthwise) a final piece of 16.5" long 1x12 into three, long, equal pieces.;
, Glue the 12" piece to the 18" piece to create the legs, keeping the long side of the 12" pieces flush with the edges of the 18" piece. Drill pilot holes and then use 2" decking screws to drill through the top of the 18" piece and into the sides of the 12" pieces.
 Glue and then fit two of the 16.5" pieces halfway along the 12" pieces and then use pilot holes and 2" decking screws to secure these in place as well.
 Sand the whole stool once the glue has set to prepare it for painting and give the edges a finishing look.
 Paint the stool or use a stain, depending on the look you want. You can also do things like add rubber runners along the bottom of the feet to keep them from sliding around.
 Enjoy your new stool!

This allows you the opportunity to express kindness and compassion, which will improve how you feel about yourself, provide you the opportunity to receive gratitude, and help you to feel productive.;
, Find a cause your are passionate about. If an organization doesn't already exist to serve a cause you care about, consider working with others to start one. This will provide a highly productive outlet for your energy and present opportunities to share in successes.


If you are unsure where your passion lies, there are even organizations dedicated to helping you find the right cause for you.You might consider working for a cause that helps people in situations similar to your own.

 Acknowledging the good in the world and your life redirects your attention to the positive away from the negative. Some may refer to this as "counting your blessings." Expressing your gratitude to others will allow you to benefit from the experience of increasing the optimism of others.


Expressions of gratitude should be worked into your daily routine. Consider designating time each day to devote to updating a gratitude journal. If you are spiritual, create a routine of expressing gratitude in prayer. If you are more socially inclined, you can commit to sending a note or text of thanks to a different person each day.

 As soon as you get stung, get the stinger out of your skin. This is the most important thing you can do! Some people suggest that scraping the stinger out with a credit card is better than pinching it out, but this is more likely to slow down the removal. Some scientists don’t think this is even true, and that removing the stinger as quickly as possible is the best thing you can do.Get it out with your fingernails, if possible. Otherwise grab tweezers or whatever else you have handy.;
, The cold water will be soothing and the soap can help wash away any residual dirt or venom. Lather up well and rinse the area thoroughly., Even if you’ve been stung by a bee before without any problem, be on the alert for signs that you’re having an allergic reaction. Allergies can develop or worsen over time. Severe reactions (anaphylaxis) can by life-threatening. Watch out for any of the following signs of anaphylaxis:Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or throat

Dizziness, fainting, or a drop in blood pressure
Skin reaction like hives, flushing, itching, or paleness
A fast, weak pulse
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
Restlessness and anxiety


, If any of the above symptoms are present, call for emergency help right away. While you’re waiting for help to arrive (or on your way to the hospital), take Benadryl or another antihistamine. If you have an EpiPen, use it.


After you’ve been treated, see your doctor for a prescription for an EpiPen – a shot of epinephrine that you keep on hand in case of another reaction.

, Hyperkalemia is the presence of too much potassium in your blood.The condition often has few symptoms, but you may notice nausea, a weak or irregular pulse, or a slow heartbeat to the point of collapse.If you experience any of these symptoms in association with an increased-potassium diet, then you should see your doctor immediately.

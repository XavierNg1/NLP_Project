 For this “bomb,” you’ll need one cup of vinegar, tissue paper, a plastic bag, and one tablespoon of baking soda. The beauty of these experiments is the ease of access to the supplies. You might also want access to a clean sink and protective eyewear.


If you plan to do this project with a younger child, make sure that you supervise them through each portion of the process., Lay out a small strip of tissue paper, about two squares, on a flat surface. Measure out a tablespoon of baking soda and dump it onto the paper. You can then either fold up the tissue paper or roll it up. Do whichever technique you like best. Do not wrap the baking powder too tight, or else you may create a tear in the paper.


If you are rolling the tissue paper, make a simple fold on the tips to ensure baking soda doesn’t fall out.
 Hold the bag upright so it won’t tip over when you add the vinegar. Measure out one cup of vinegar and carefully add it into the bag. Add the tissue wrapped baking soda to the bag. Seal the bag once you add the tissue paper.


If you are supervising a smaller child, hold the bag while they pour.
You might notice the reaction start to take effect based on the bubbles that begin to form.
 The best place to activate the bomb is somewhere outside. You could also use your kitchen sink, but this could also cause a mess. Don’t shake the bag too much, but give it a few shakes (no longer than five seconds). Place the bomb in the spot you picked for it to explode. Take a couple of steps back.


If you feel the bag start to expand as you shake it, set it on the floor immediately! That bag is about to explode.

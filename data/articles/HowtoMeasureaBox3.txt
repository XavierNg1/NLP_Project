 If you are filling the box with a material that flows—like earth, sand, a liquid, or a gas—rather than large, discrete objects, then it may behoove you to calculate the volume.


Volume is measured in cubic inches, cubic centimeters, cubic feet, etc. A "cubic inch" describes a cube with three measurements—length, width, and height—that each measure exactly one inch. In order to find the volume, thus, you will need to multiply the length of the box by the width of the box by the depth of the box.If the box has thick walls (thicker than, say, a quarter inch), be sure to multiply by the interior depth rather than the exterior height.
 If you are filling a box with something, it is not enough merely to know the volume of the box. You will also need to figure out how much (of the earth, sand, liquid, etc.) you have, and compare that figure to the size of the box itself.


You might use a program for this rather than doing the calculations yourself. Try searching online to find a suitable one.
 For example: if your box is 10 inches wide, 15 inches long, and 9 inches deep, you'll multiply 10" x 15" x 9" to get 1350 cubic inches. You can use an online unit converter to find the volume in liters, gallons, or other units.


If your box holds an irregular shape, consider using an online volume calculator for more complicated equations: http://www.calculator.net/volume-calculator.html

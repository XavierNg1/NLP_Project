 If your ink stain isn't particularly dark, this may be all you need to do. Make sure the washcloth is clean. Take care to protect the doll's hair, eyes, and cloth body before cleaning. Dampen the cloth, and scrub with pressure on the stain. Do this for awhile, continuously checking the stain. Hopefully, the stain will begin to fade as you do this. Again, this works best for faint ink stains., Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball or a paper towel. Like with other techniques, make sure the doll's hair is out of the way before you apply the rubbing alcohol to the face. Scrub the stained area thoroughly. After a bit of rubbing, check to see if the stain is fading. You may need to remoisten the cotton ball or paper towel with more rubbing alcohol, and keep going until the ink has faded completely., You can find this in the cleaning supply aisle of most grocery stores. Because the Magic Eraser is pretty large and you'll most likely be cleaning a small area of your doll's face, feel free to cut it into a smaller pieces. Put water on the Magic Eraser, and start scrubbing the stain. After you scrub for a bit, use a dry towel to dry the surface., If nothing you try at home works, you may need to send your doll to the American Girl Doll Hospital. Professionals can address the issue, and send your doll back looking brand new. She will even come back with a hospital gown and bracelet!

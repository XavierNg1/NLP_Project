 This method is used most frequently by nurses in calculating dosage for a patient since dosage is often in kilograms while the patient's weight is typically in pounds.Example: Convert 46 lbs. Subtract 4 from 46 lbs, which equals 42 lbs. Divide 42 by 2, which equals 21 kilograms. (The answer using the formula is 20.87 kilograms, which can be rounded up to 21 kilograms.)

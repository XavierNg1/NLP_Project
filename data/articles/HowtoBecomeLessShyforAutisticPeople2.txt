 If you don't know how to do something, ask someone. You may go to an autistic support teacher, a counselor, a family member, a close friend, or someone else that knows about your social issues and is willing to provide help.

, When you make conversation, you don't need to talk the whole timeâ€”in fact, many people love it if you let them do the talking! Practice showing interest in what they're talking about, and asking questions to get them to talk more. Most people just want to be heard and have their feelings validated. This will make them walk away from the conversation feeling happy and thinking that they like talking to you.


Validate their feelings.
Ask questions to clarify if need be.
 Stand up straight, look at the speaker (eye contact is not needed), stim quietly as needed, and nod or say "Uh huh" and "Mmm hmm" to show you are listening. You can try practicing in front of a mirror or with a therapist or family member.
 Learn to know when you're stressed so you can back out of situations when you need to. You don't want to push yourself too hard, and it's important to take good care of yourself.
 Neurotypicals have social trouble too, so there are plenty of books you can read. There are books to analyze people, become well-liked, and feel less afraid. There are even books written with autistic people in mind!

 This will determine how much of the island you'll get to see or do; like Disneyland, it's nearly impossible to be on every ride and see every attraction in one day without rushing.;
, In the summer months, several yearly fairs take place, such as Bayfest Hawaii (located at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Base), the 50th State Fair (at Aloha Stadium), and the Farm Fair (also at Aloha Stadium). There is also the famous "Triple Crown Surf", which takes place at North Shore (same area as Turtle Bay Resort) and weekly to bi-monthly local entertainment and concerts at Ala Moana's center stage. During the fall and winter months, HIFF (Hawaii International Film Festival) and numerous parades celebrating the holiday season take place in cities throughout Oahu. The largest of these include Honolulu's "Honolulu City Lights" Parade. Check out the Honolulu Star-Advertiser's "TGIF" section for the latest activities throughout the specific week.
 This can be a very hard challenge; as most tourist attractions on Oahu can take up most of the day (or at least your energy). Places like Polynesia Cultural Center, U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Sea Life Park, and Bishop Museum have all day tours or attractions at specific times. Like any place else, traffic is everyone's favorite enemy. Oahu is notorious for having some of the worst traffic in the nation. The top traffic spots on Oahu include Kamehameha Highway (99) in the North Shore and Pearl City areas, the H-1/H-2 freeway merge, the H-1/Moanalua Freeway/H-3 freeway merge, the Middle Street (H-1/Moanalua Freeway) merge, the H-1 freeway passing Downtown Honolulu and Waikiki, and Kalanianaole Highway from Hawaii Kai westward.
 Who wants to go to the beach when it's forecasted to rain that weekend? However, Hawaii (as a state) has it's unusual weather patterns, as it can be forecasted as "sunny, 84 degrees, light variable winds", but even a minute pour-down can ruin a person's day.

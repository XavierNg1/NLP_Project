 Flowers are the reproductive parts of plants. They have male parts called stamen and female parts called the pistil. The stamen produce pollen, and the pistil attaches to the ovule.








When pollen reaches the ovule, the flower is fertilized (or pollinated).;
, Touch the stamen of one flower with a small brush or cotton swab. Some of the pollen will stick to the brush. This allows you to transfer the pollen from that stamen to another flower.








If the flowers are far apart, scrape the pollen into a gelatin capsule. Gelatin capsules are clear tablets that you can separate and fill with herbs or powdery substances, such as pollen. When transferring pollen, you don't want to risk losing the pollen you collect.
 With your pollen coated brush or cotton swab, touch the stigma of the other flower. The stigma is the top of the pistil that is designed to collect pollen and transfer it to the ovule. Coat the stigma as best you can with the pollen.

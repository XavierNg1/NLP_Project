 Playdates for small children who are learning how to interact with others should be in a location that's free from distractions. This will prevent them from feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Consider having the playdate at a calm place that one or both of the children are already familiar with.


For example, you might meet up at a cozy corner of the library or choose a park in the neighborhood. Just ensure that you go when the location isn't popular or busy.
 Keep the playdate small so the kids don't become overwhelmed. Only have two kids around the same age at the playdate. It may help if one of the kids is already engaging in parallel play. This way, one child can model the behavior to the other kid.If you have three or more kids at the playdate, one of them will probably feel left out. It will also make it more difficult for the kids to share their toys.
 Have the children sit near each other and give one child an activity to do. This could be any activity or object that both kids can eventually interact with together or on their own. For example, have one child start playing in a sand box, with play doh, or paint. The other child will become interested by watching the kid play. Both kids should soon begin playing next to each other.


Ensure that you set out enough of the objects or activities so the kids don't start fighting over the items. For example, avoid only setting out a couple of blocks which only one child could play with.
 Don't expect the kids to play well for an extended period of time. Cut the playdate off around one hour if it's the kids' first time playing near each other. As they get older and more comfortable playing around each other, you could extend the playdate to two hours.If the kids become cranky, bored, or aggressive, they might just be done with the playdate.

 They come in all sorts of different sizes and determine the look of your stitch. A circular knitting needle will be easiest for this project.









US #8 is pretty standard. Anything up to size 10 will be fine.
You may use double-pointed needles, but those are typically easier for smaller items, like socks. A circular needle is best and will be assumed for the purpose of this article.

Knit a swatch. Take note of how many stitches there are per inch.
Multiply the measurement of your head by the number of stitches needed per inch. (example: 21 inches x 4 stitches per inch = 84 stitches.) This is the number of stitches you will need at the base.
You may want to round down to a number divisible by eight; this will make it easier to reduce later, for the top of your hat.

Rounding down is safer than rounding up; yarn stretches easier than it shrinks.

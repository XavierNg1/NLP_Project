 Cut the cauliflower in medium sized florets and remove any out leaves. If you desire, peel the lower part of the stem to remove the tough outer skin, however if the cauliflower is very fresh and in season its not always necessary.


The size of the floret should ideally be large enough to place in the mouth, rather than being too small so a spoon is needed, or too large, where they may be watery.;
, Blanch the cauliflower for 2-3 minutes or until just tender, drain and put aside. Do not overcook them as they will be reheated later.
 Heat the butter in a medium saucepan and when melted, add the flour to form a roux, stirring until the paste is formed. Allow to cook gently at least one minute. Add the milk in batched, stirring until the milk and roux is smooth. Add the bay leaf and cook for a few minutes, or until when tasted the sauce is not floury. Add half the cheese, salt and pepper and stir until melted. Check for seasoning.


The sauce may be microwaved, however it is never as good as cooked on the stove.
 Pour the cauliflower on top of the sauce and pour the remainder of the sauce on top.


Some methods advise to add the cauliflower to the sauce and then the mix to the pan, which is fine. You just want enough sauce to coat the vegetable, rather than the vegetable to be lost in sauce.
Any precooked vegetable, or any fresh vegetable such as broccoli may be cooked and added at the same time.
 If desired, sprinkle with breadcrumbs for extra texture. Bake at 185C or 365F for 5-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot.


Any leftover gratin may be blended up and stirred into soups, included into lasagna, or mashed gently and wrapped in pastry and baked as a delicious "leftovers" meal.

 You'll used Run to access the Disk Cleanup utility. Depending on your operating system version, there are a couple of ways to open Run:


Hold down the ⊞ Win key and tap R. This should work on all versions of Windows.
For Windows 8 or 10, hold down the ⊞ Win key and tap X to open user task menu, then tap or click "Run" near the bottom of the menu.
 Exclude the quotations. This command will start the Disk Cleanup program.


Click "OK" or tap ↵ Enter to run your command.
 Depending on how long it has been since your last temporary file flush, this may take a few minutes.
 Do this by clicking the check box next to each file type you wish to delete.As a general rule, you can clear every file type; however, leave the "Compress old files" option alone, since it can cause issues when trying to retrieve old files.
You can also click the "Clean up system files" option, which will cause Disk Cleanup to reassess your temporary files while considering system files. This will usually free up significantly more space than clearing the default temporary files will.
 This will begin the temporary file flush.
 You may have to reboot your computer to see a change in performance.

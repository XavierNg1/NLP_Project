 A simple trap that many bloggers fall into is overloading their writing with keywords. This will lead to fake-sounding content and will actually provide little in the way of extra traffic. This is because as soon as a reader clicks your link and sees a jumbled mess of keywords, they’ll most likely leave immediately.
 This tool will show you what search words are driving people to your site, as well as popular searches on the web. You can also see how long users stay on your page, which is an essential tool for determining how worthy they find your content.
 Use Analytics to see what your readers are searching for on the web. Use these results to tailor articles specifically towards your readers’ interests.
 Instead of placing keywords all over your article, focus them in the places where they matter most.


Make sure that your Title tag has relevant keywords, as this is the part of your blog that is given the most weight in search engine results.
Write a powerful title. The title of your blog post is the second-most important aspect of your blog when determining search engine placement. Anything in the "H1" heading is given more weight in search engine results.
Optimize your content, but don’t overdo it. Good content will be much more valuable than a collection of keywords. Make sure that your post is well thought out and informative first, and then optimize it for the keywords that suit your content best.

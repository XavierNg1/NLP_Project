 Don’t allow yourself to get separated from your friends while you are boarding the ride. If the person working at the ride tries to seat you separately, tell them that you prefer to sit with your friend. A familiar face by your side will give you the courage that you need., If you can, aim for a seat near the middle of the train. If you’re already scared, it’s best not to sit in the front row where the ride can seem the scariest. The middle is the best location for those who feel nervous because it offers the smoothest ride and places you in the midst of the other rows so that you feel more secure., After you have sat down on the ride and are harnessed into your seat, grab hold of the bars near your chest. Rattle them as hard as you can so that you can see that you’re firmly strapped in, and that even with all your weight pressed against them, the restraints will hold.Holding onto the bars during the ride also helps you to feel more grounded and secure.
 Breathe deeply to relax your body and your mind before the ride starts. When people are nervous, they often hold their breath or breathe shallowly, which only adds to a quickened heart rate and feelings of anxiety., Even though it may seem counterintuitive, it’s actually better to keep your eyes open rather than shutting them during a roller coaster ride. Closing your eyes will prevent you from seeing what is coming on the ride, and psychologically makes you feel like you have less control over what is happening.When you are able to see that you are going to go down a big drop or go upside down, your body instinctually braces itself. If you don’t do this, the ride feels much rockier and wilder.
 Screaming on a roller coaster keeps your blood flowing and helps you to release your tension and anxiety. A roller coaster is one of the only places where you can scream your head off without any judgment, so go for it!

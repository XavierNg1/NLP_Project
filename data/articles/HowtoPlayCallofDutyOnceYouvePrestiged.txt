 Do you really want to turn in all your earned guns and perks? If so, then go to the menu and click prestige.;
, Now the weapons you'll have won't have very much perks to them but it's better than nothing. For example, if your playing CoD 4: Modern Warfare...you'll want to either get the MP5 or the Sniper Class. This is the best way to which you can get kills.
 Remember back when you were just starting the game and you got mad cause almost everyone killed you? That is the worst part about prestige is that you have to start all over again. But remember, this gains you skill. The number one player in the world didn't get there by not going prestige.
 Take all of the tricks and skillful moves you developed, and annex them onto your newer weapons. If you have an MP5 for example, then take what you've developed with the MP44 and use that with the MP5.
 Whenever you first go prestige, you want to get right back to your better weapons. This'll come with time. You can't just go through the game like that. You have to be patient and wait until you start getting in a groove and then your patience can lower.
 Don't worry about how you lost your gold Desert Eagle or how you lost Bandolier as a perk. Just play the game. Have fun and ignore the players who make fun of you cause you have inferior weapons. But be a good sport and whenever someone kills you, say to yourself, "Okay, I'm going to get them back. "Patience is the key to leveling up.

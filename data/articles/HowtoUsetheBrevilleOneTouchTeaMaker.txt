The One-Touch Tea Maker comes set with recommended time and temperature settings for each kind of tea. For example, on the medium brew setting, green tea is 3 minutes at 175 °F (79 °C). Oolong tea is 3 minutes at 195ºF/90.5ºC. Black tea is 2 minutes at 212ºF/100ºC.
You can increase or decrease the strength of your brew by changing the settings from medium to strong or mild. This will add or decrease time to the brew time.

Brew time and temperature is an art and varies by personal taste. You can customize the temperature and brewing times by pressing the up and down arrows next to the LCD screen.
, Once the water reaches the desired temperature, the tea basket will slowly descend into the water, where it will brew for the set amount of time. It will automatically rise up to prevent over steeping and beep signaling it is ready. Enjoy your tea!

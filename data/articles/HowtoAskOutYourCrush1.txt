 It will be much easier to ask him/her out if you know each other, and he/she will be much more likely to say "yes." Start by striking up a simple conversation. Just casually say "hey," and introduce yourself.


If you're in class together, ask about the homework assignment or ask your crush for help understanding the material. If you are in a club together, strike up a conversation about the theme of the club.
Ask your crush about him or herself. Ask how his/her day is going. Ask if he/she is excited about anything this weekend. It's easy!;
, You don't need to be best friends, and you don't need to tell each other everything. However, friendship involves a certain amount of trust, and it will make you more of a known quantity in your crush's eyes. Try walking to class with your crush, or hanging out in a group setting. If you are a good fit for each other, he/she might even develop a crush on you!, Don't try to make your crush think that you are someone you're not. Misleading this person is neither the best nor the most sustainable way to get him/her to go out with you. If you lie, it will come out eventually. If you try to act "cool" or imitate someone that you think is "cool," you might just make your crush uncomfortable. Don't bother with illusions.


If you are being true to yourself and doing the things that you really want to do, you will put more passion into those things. Many people find passion attractive.
 If you want your crush's number, ask for his/her number – don't look it up elsewhere or ask someone else. If you want to know what your crush did this weekend, don't stalk him/her on Facebook – just ask. Following your crush around or putting him/her on a pedestal is no way to start a healthy relationship.

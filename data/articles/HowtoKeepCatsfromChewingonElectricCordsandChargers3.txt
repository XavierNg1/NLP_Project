 Spray or wipe down cords with something distasteful to the cat. There are commercial product solutions and homemade solutions. If making your own, consider using such things as hot sauce; lavender oil; a homemade citrus or vinegar paste; garlic, cayenne pepper, Vicks, dish soap, lime juice,or chili oil or paste. Some people use a light coating of sports ointments (the really strong menthol sort) or deodorant . Be sure to let the applied substance dry completely before re-plugging the cord into the wall and you'll need to reapply homemade fixes periodically. Avoid using anything salty because cats love licking salt., Commercial products include "Chewsafe™" and "CritterCord™", which are clear, flexible protective cord covers infused with a citrus-scent to keep the cat away from the cord. These are easy to add and don't require topical re-applications., Both foil and double-sided tape can work. These can be purchased from the hardware store and are easy to wrap around the cords. With the foil tape, cats dislike the alkaline taste in their mouth and will refrain from chewing anything coated in the tape. With double-sided tape, cats hate anything sticky and won't touch it. The problem with this method is that it is sticky, and therefore tricky, and will also collect a lot of fluff for you.

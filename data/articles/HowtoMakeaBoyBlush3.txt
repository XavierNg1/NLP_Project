 The more unique the compliment, the better. For example, does he have a quirky habit or unusual hobby that you find endearing, but he often gets teased about? Pick a feature or interest he seems to be, or should be, proud of.If you know him well, then compliment a strong, positive personality trait. Say something about how confident, kind, or humorous he is.Compliments are a great way to make someone feel self-conscious and lead to blushing, but in a positive way. As long as they are genuine and meaningful, compliments show you are paying attention to him in a way that is not creepy and will (hopefully) make him feel better about himself., A sincere compliment is specific, to-the-point, and personal.Avoid giving compliments that are ambiguous or inappropriate.Also, avoid giving compliments too frequently, as you will risk him blushing because he's annoyed rather than flattered.Examples of sincere compliments include:


Expressing your appreciation for something he did, such as helping you with a project or to drag your heavy suitcase onto the bus.
Tell him that something he did inspired you, such as how he worked hard to achieve a certain goal, how he came up with a creative solution to a unique problem, or how he volunteers his time to help others.When giving a compliment, timing is important.While you do not want to miss an opportunity, randomly inserting a compliment into conversation or blurting it out without introducing yourself will come off as sounding too rehearsed and awkward.
 Ask yourself what qualities (physical feature, personality trait, accomplishments, etc.) you admire in him or that you find attractive.Especially if he is shy, he might not be used to receiving compliments. Practice what you want to say before hand, making sure it is respectful and sincere. This is not only a way to make him blush, but also show you are attentive and genuinely interested.

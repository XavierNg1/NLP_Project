 The fine teeth will allow you to cut the laminate flooring face up without chipping it.



Hold a piece of paper around the pillar or pipes and trace around the objects.
Cut out the paper pattern, and then lay it back down to test for accuracy. This may take a few attempts to get the exact shape you want the laminate to be. Once you can successfully place the pattern around the obstacle, you're ready to draw the shape onto the laminate flooring.



With a standard jigsaw blade, flip the laminate plank upside down. Place the pattern on the backside of the laminate, making sure to flip the pattern, so your cut laminate is positioned to come out correctly when the plank is flipped face up. Hold the jigsaw vertical, so the blade runs smoothly from one edge of the laminate to the other.
If cutting the laminate face up, place painter's tape on the laminate along the pattern to keep it from chipping. Mark the cut line on top of the tape and cut with a jigsaw with a special blade.

 Your child may have heard that people have a choice about mental illness. Generally speaking, this isn’t true. Educate them on why mental illness is believed to affect certain people and not others.

Talk about how biologic factors, like chemical imbalances, can cause a person to have mental illness. You can discuss how certain environmental situations, like being exposed to war, can bring about other mental issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Let them know they can’t help it and don’t want to have it., Some believe that mental health issues only attack people who are weak. They think that if the person was stronger, they could fight the symptoms they experience.

Instead, tell your children that realizing there is a problem and then asking for help is a sign of strength. That it takes real courage to admit that you’re not perfect and need someone to help you., Parents are often afraid to expose their children to people with mental health problems because they fear they will harm them. Although this can be true in some cases, it’s not the truth in every situation.

Explain to them that people with mental issues are not always scary, especially when it is someone they love., Although a person may always struggle with mental health problems, they can get better. Medication and therapy often help improve a person’s life and allow them to become themselves again. Letting your child understand this can help them feel better if someone they love suffers.

You can explain how therapy and medication can help to restore the balance in a person’s brain and make them feel better. You can explain your situation and experience, as well, if you’re going through illness, yourself.

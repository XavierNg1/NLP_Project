 This can be used for gift wrapping, floral arrangements, hair accessories and party decorations. Lay the ribbon length down on a flat surface.
 Bring both halves of the ribbon to the middle and overlap them in the center. There should also be tails at the ends.








Hold the ribbon in the center to keep it secure.
 Wrap a fine piece of wire tightly around the middle (neck) of the bow. Wrap ribbon or tape around the wire to conceal it. Use the same color as the bow or a complementary color. Either glue or stitch the wound ribbon piece in place.
 Adjust the loops and tails as needed to ensure symmetry. Cut the tails for increased protection from fraying. Add the wired bow to your next gift or wreath.

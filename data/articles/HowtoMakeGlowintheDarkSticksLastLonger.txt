,, Take the stick out before you intend to use it, to allow it to defrost (at least one hour in advance).
 The freezing method will allow your glow-in-the-dark stick to last at least several more turns before it gives up. Instead of lasting for at least 12 -24 hours, it can last at least for a day or more.

 This will keep your clan organized, up-to-date, and give everyone a place to talk. Don't make a clan website, because they are too hard to let your clan know about without breaking RuneScape's rule against advertising websites.;
, You might lose the one you have already when PK-ing.


Get about 280 pieces of food in your bank, preferably lobsters or swordfish.






Get some fishing gear, a hatchet, and a tinderbox; you will need this for when your food supplies are low.






Get some amulets, you can sell/give those to your fellows.
 Write down all the rules and make sure your clan members know them! Be tough -- don't let people break them or in any minute your clan will fall apart.


Don't make self-serving rules like "All profit goes to me!!" or you will discourage membership into your clan.
 You want to have 3 melees, 2 wizards, and 2 rangers. Make rules for each type of member.
 All members wearing the same gear presents the look of an organized clan! For example:


Melee: full rune, rune scimitar, red cape, fancy boots, strength amulet
Rangers: Full green 'd hide, mithril or adamant arrows and a power amulet
Magers: runes, full blue mage costume, mage amulet.



Melee: Varrock teleport, an alternative weapon to knock-out, a strength potion, and fill up with food
Rangers: a free spot to pick up arrows, Varrock teleport, alternative arrows
Magers: Wizards mind bomb, bind/attack runes, fill up with food again

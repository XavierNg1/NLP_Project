 Many online discussion forums and support chat rooms can be an excellent starting point for learning how other families have coped with and adjusted to life with a child with Down syndrome.


Take advantage of the chance to ask questions and share your concerns without fear of judgment or awkwardness. Other visitors to these sites are often experiencing (or have already experienced) the same emotions as you and will be glad of your participation.
 Once you are ready for in-person meetings, local support groups for families raising children with Down syndrome can be invaluable resources.


Not only can these groups offer friendship and support, they can also give pointers about physicians, education, activities, planning, babysitters, and other essential aspects of life with a child with Down syndrome.

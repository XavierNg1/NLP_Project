The amount of liquid necessary will depend upon the size or amount of pork that you want to cook. In general, start with 1/4 cup of liquid for 4 chops and 1 quart of liquid for 6 to 8 pounds of ribs or whole roast. The liquid should cover the meat when it is placed in your marinating container.;
, Adding oil into your marinade will contribute to a crisp outer crust when the pork is cooked.



You can experiment with adding 1 or 2 minced cloves of garlic or 1 minced shallot to the mixture.
The garlic will infuse the marinade with an intense garlic taste, while the shallot will impart a more subtly blend of garlic and onion flavor.
If you want a more subdued taste of garlic and/or onion, consider added dried garlic and onion powders instead.

Dried sage, rosemary, oregano and ground cumin are typical pork seasonings.
To marinade 4 pork chops, use a blend of dried spices to equal 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. Use up to 3 tablespoons of dried herbs for ribs and roasts.
When using fresh herbs, use approximately 3 times the amount that you would use in dried form.



The bowl may be big enough to hold several pork chops.
A gallon-sized plastic bag will hold a slab of ribs, cut into 2 pieces, or a small roast.
You can marinate large roasts in the pan in which they will be cooked, if it fits in your refrigerator.
 You can place it in your bowl, or put it in your zipper-lock bag.


Allow the meat to rest, turning it occasionally.
Allow your pork chops to rest and marinade, at room temperature for 1 hour.
Refrigerate pork tenderloin, ribs or larger roasts and marinate for 1 to 2 days. It takes longer for large cuts to tenderize and become infused with the flavors of the marinade.

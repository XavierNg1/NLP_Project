 DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode is similar to Recovery Mode, and many users have reported this working when Recovery Mode doesn't. Like Recovery Mode, you won't be able to create a backup before your iPod is restored., Your iPod will need to be turned off completely before you can enter DFU mode. Hold the Power button and then slide the Power slider to turn it off.
 You'll need iTunes installed to restore from DFU mode, but you don't need to have synced your iPod with that computer in the past.


If your iPod does not have a working Home button, download TinyUmbrella from firmwareumbrella.com. Run the program and click "Enter DFU Mode" to proceed.
 Count to three out-loud so that you don't mess up the timing.
 Start holding the Home button after you've held the Power button for three seconds.
 Continue to hold the Home button after releasing the Power button.
 Your screen should stay black, but iTunes should report that it has detected your iPod in Recovery mode. You can now release the Home button.
 Your iPod will begin restoring, which may take a little while to complete.
 Once the restore is complete, you can setup your iPod as new. If you have an existing backup, you'll be able to load it, otherwise all of your existing data will be lost.

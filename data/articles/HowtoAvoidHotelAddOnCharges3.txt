 Many hotels will charge an “early check-in fee,” if you should arrive early. Instead of checking in early, ask your hotel to store your bags (which most will do for free) so that you can begin exploring the location. Then return in a few hours and check into your room on time.Always ask whether or not there will be a fee for storing baggage before doing so!

, You should never use the phone in your hotel room to do anything but call the front desk. Not only do hotels charge for long-distance calls, but they usually charge for short local calls as well. Use your own cell phone to avoid these charges., Although some hotels offer free parking, many others will charge a fee. Spend some time walking around your hotel. You might locate free street parking or an inexpensive parking garage. You may also consider staying slightly outside of a city (like in the suburbs) where parking is easy and cheap., You should never have to pay for Wi-Fi. If your hotel levies a fee for such a service, try to find an internet connection elsewhere. If you use a smart phone, you can create your own personal hot spot. Alternatively, there is likely a coffee shop nearby where you can catch a signal. If all else fails, consider unplugging for the length of your trip. It might do you some good, while saving you money.

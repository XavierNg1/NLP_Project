You’re probably not going to approach a girl if you believe she’s going to turn you down. And if you do approach her, your lack of confidence will show. Having confidence in yourself gives you the courage you need to approach beautiful girls, and girls find it attractive.Think about all your positive qualities. Take a moment to list at least 10 reasons a beautiful girl would want to go out with you.
For example, think about how you can make her laugh, your great smile, how dependable you are, and your sense of adventure.


You never know when a beautiful girl is going to cross your path, so try to always look as good as possible.You don’t have to change your style or buy a new wardrobe or even dress up, but you do want to make sure you practice good hygiene and present yourself well.

Make sure your hair is combed, breath fresh, face clean.
Sometimes you might not look your best (maybe you just came from playing soccer) but you can still present yourself well by your attitude.


Practicing how you will approach a beautiful girl makes it easier to do once the time presents itself.Think about what you will say and how you will say it. Rehearse the exchange in your mind and out-loud until you are comfortable.

Practice in the mirror or with a close friend.
Video tape yourself to hear your voice tone and pace.
Try different variations of what you want to say.
For example, you might practice, “Can I contact you sometime?”; “Is it okay if I contact you?”; “How can I contact you?”; “Is it alright if I contact you?” and figure out which one feels most comfortable for you to say.

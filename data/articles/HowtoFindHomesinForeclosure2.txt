 Government foreclosures are properties taken due to delinquent taxes, crime or for other reasons. This includes government foreclosures at the county, state and federal levels. Locating these properties is possible through a real estate agent or through various websites.


The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides links to several U.S. government organizations selling foreclosed real estate. This includes properties foreclosed on by HUD, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the IRS and the Small Business Administration. Properties are listed on the HUD.gov website.
Properties sold by the government outside the United States may be listed on state websites or on third-party websites.

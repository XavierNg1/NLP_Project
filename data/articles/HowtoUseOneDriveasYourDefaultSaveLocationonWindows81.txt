 Just open "File Explorer," and right-click on your folders in "This PC."


For your reference, “This PC” used to be known as “My Computer” in previous versions of Windows. The folders generally containing essential files are Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos.;
, Choose the Properties option in the drop-down menu of each of the folders you want to migrate to OneDrive.
 In the "Properties" window, select the "Location" tab, click on "Move," and then pick a location for a particular folder in your OneDrive account. You might need to add new folders in OneDrive for transferred folders.
 You will need to replicate the process for every folder you want to move.
 If you have other PCs that run on Windows 8.1, then you will need to do the same process on each of those computers.


Don’t worry, it’s much faster than it sounds, and the reward of ease will be worth it. Once done, the folders in "This PC" will be synchronized among all your different PCs and your OneDrive storage.
 Several programs may have their own choice of a default location for saving files. Start by clicking on the specific programs that you want to move if they are not saving yet to OneDrive by default.
 Once you’ve clicked on a specific program, open the "File" options, and look for the "Default Save Location" option.
 Once you’ve chosen OneDrive, it becomes your chosen programs’ default save location.

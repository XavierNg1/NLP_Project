 Drive the seat back by pushing off with your legs, not pulling with your arms. Keep your elbows straight as you drive back with your legs. You should only pull at the very end of each drive.If you feel yourself coming off the rowing seat, it means that you're pushing up, not back.
 Practice will improve your technique and thus your overall speed. If you notice that you're having a hard time with a particular portion of the stroke, you'll want to concentrate on that stage more. Practice doing the part of the stroke you're struggling with, like the catch or the recovery, without doing the full stroke to perfect your technique., Watching a video of your technique will clue you into the areas that need improvement. Have a friend or teammate videotape your stroke and review the video so that you know what you should concentrate on improving.

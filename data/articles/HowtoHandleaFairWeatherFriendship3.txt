 It is important to distinguish fair weather friends from real friends before you decide who you need to “unfriend.” You want to look for patterns such as not being available when you need a shoulder to cry on and avoiding talking about negative things. You may also find that this friend is insulting, insensitive, and needy without giving in return.</ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-spot-and-end-a-toxic-friendship/</ref>


Think about what they do when you ask to process an event or emotion. Do they make excuses so that they don’t have to talk about it?
When you are with them, do they tend to keep the conversation about things that are meaningless or at least lack depth?

, When evaluating your friendships and deciding who needs to go, you need to remain objective. Don’t be tempted to give in to this friend and make excuses for them. You may need to ask others in your life that you know for certain are not fair weather people for their perspective. They may be able to identify patterns that you can’t see.
 You may need to get serious with yourself and ask questions to determine if someone close to you is a fair weather friend. Ask questions like, does this person make jokes at my expense? Do they take resources from me without paying me back? Do they use me?


Fair weather people tend to be untrustworthy, and lots of behavior goes with this: making a big deal out of small things, only thinking of themselves, sharing secrets and spreading rumors, and so on.

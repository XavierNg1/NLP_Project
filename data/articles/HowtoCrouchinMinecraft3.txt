 If you're playing on an Xbox or PlayStation, you can toggle crouch on by pressing the right stick into the controller until it clicks.


If you're playing on a PlayStation Vita, press Down on the directional pad instead of clicking the right stick.
 You'll stay crouched until you toggle it off again.


On the Vita, press Down again to toggle sneaking off.

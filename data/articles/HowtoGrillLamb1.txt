 Spread olive oil on either side of your lamb chops and add the seasoning of your choice. Some typical seasonings are salt, pepper or dried rosemary.
 Let the meat cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side before turning it over. Cook the loin chops until they are grilled to your liking., Allowing the meat to cool for about 5 minutes before you eat it will help the juices settle and give you a more flavorful piece of lamb.

 Engaging in contact with a friend during the test is definitely a potential way to cheat, but it's a high risk method. In most testing situations, whispering, talking, and passing notes between test-takers is not permitted. It's also pretty easy to catch from a distance.
 This method is an updated version of Morse code, which involves communicating with another person with predetermined signals. Find a friend in your class who be a good partner for this. This should ideally be someone who isn't very far from you (ideally next to you) and someone who knows the subject well.
Develop a tapping code. For example, tap 5 times for number 5. If it's a number like 2647, tap your pencil on the desk 2 times, pause for about 3 seconds, and then tap it 6 times and so on. If it's a multiple choice test using the alphabet, try coding A, B, C, D, E, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively.
You could also try different versions of this method that operate on the same principle. Instead of tapping, cough or sneeze to communicate an answer. You could also use sign language - especially fingers for methods - to communicate with a friend., Have a friend create a distraction while you cheat (or vice versa). Your friend, for example, might pretend to feel sick so that the instructor's attention is diverted away from you and other students and placed solely onto him or her. This will give you a bit of time to consult notes or other aids you've prepared to help you cheat.

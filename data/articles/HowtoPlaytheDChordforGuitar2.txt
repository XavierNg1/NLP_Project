 This is a slightly "thicker," higher-pitched D chord. It is also much easier to get to when you're further down the neck, and easily transitions into other barre chords.


If you already know it, this is simply an A-major barre chord located on the 5th fret, 5th string. This note is a D.
 Barre from the 1st to the 5th string with your index finger. Strum once to ensure that all of the strings are properly pressed down.
 You can also place your pinkie on the 2nd string, seventh fret, your ring finger on the 3rd string, 7th fret and your middle finger on the 4th string, 7th fret. Most people find it easier to just barre the string, but you will get a cleaner sound with individual fingers.


If you slid the entire thing up the neck, using open strings instead of a barred index finger, you'd have an open A chord.
 The top and bottom strings are the least essential for your chord. If you can strum just the middle four strings, you'll have a better-sounding chord, but you can also strum the high-e string for a little more noise.


Do not strum the top string.

 Letting your nails get jagged and rough can make them weak, which causes them to weaken and break off. For nails that grow long and strong, it's important to keep them well-manicured and clean.










Shape your nails with a nail file, making sure you use the right technique to avoid ripping them.
Buff the surface of your nails to keep them in good shape.

Don't rip off acrylic or gel nails; have them removed by a professional manicurist, or use a peel off base coat.
 Drug stores sell polishes you can paint on your nails to help them get stronger. Look for a clear polish that contains nutrients that promote nail growth.

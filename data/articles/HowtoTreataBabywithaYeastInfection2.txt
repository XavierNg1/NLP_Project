 Usually, babies defecates and pee a few minutes after they are fed. You should always change the diaper when it gets wet to prevent moisture from accumulating around the bottom of the baby. Fungus thrives in warm and moist environments, so always change the diaper after defecation or urination to prevent rash from occurring.


Also, when securing the babyâ€™s diaper, make sure that it is not too tight to allow air to circulate.
 Avoid using scented baby wipes as the chemicals can irritate the yeast rashes. You can use mild baby cleansers when cleaning the bottom. Be sure to rinse and dry it thoroughly, to avoid moisture build up that will cause the yeast infection to spread.
 This will ensure that the baby's bottom is fresh and moisture free. Air exposure will definitely prevent rashes from occurring, or if one is present already, will facilitate fast recovery.


You can put a waterproof sheet or a towel underneath to prevent a mess from the baby pooping and peeing.
 Yogurt is rich in probiotics and contains live microorganisms that can help boost the normal flora. You can apply the yogurt to the bottom, but make sure that there are no open wounds when applying it.


Apply it in a circular motion, and allow it to stay for 15 minutes. Then, rinse the baby's bottom with water and let it dry before putting a new diaper.
Do this three times daily.
However, you cannot let the baby take yogurt orally, as yogurt is not good for babies under one year of age to eat.

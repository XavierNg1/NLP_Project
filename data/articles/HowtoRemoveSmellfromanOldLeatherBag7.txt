 Place the potpourri inside a sachet.
 Leave it there for at least one week.
 Do not leave it in a dark cupboard; instead find somewhere with fresh air and indirect, cool light.
 It's a good idea to leave the sachet in the bag when using as well, as the scent will continue to improve the bag's own scent.

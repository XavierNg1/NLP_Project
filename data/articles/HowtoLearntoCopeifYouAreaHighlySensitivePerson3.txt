 Because highly sensitive people are more attuned to subtle changes, they often recognize danger before others. Dr. Aron experienced this when she saved her entire family from a house fire when she was easily woken by the first light of the fire.To make her clients think about how valuable being an HSP can be, Dr. Aron asks them to respond to the following prompt: “Think back to one or more times that your sensitivity has saved you or someone else from suffering, great loss, or even death.” , Accept the fact that being more sensitive than some other people does not make you any less valuable. Viewing HSP as part of your unique personality, rather than as a disorder or a hindrance, can help you accept it.
 This inner critic should be challenged, questioned, and ultimately silenced as you learn to accept yourself for who you are and treat yourself as you would treat a dear friend, not an enemy. Part of this involves realizing that you are having a negative thought, stopping yourself, and reframing the thought.


For example, your inner critic may say, “I am so embarrassed that I am the only person who has ever cried at work in front of others. There must be something wrong with me.” You can stop yourself and reframe that as, “I am sensitive and that is okay. Even though I cry at work occasionally, I am also the person that my coworkers feel comfortable approaching for advice or empathy for their personal problems.”

, Then, underneath each trait, write about how that trait is positive and valuable. This can help you realize how special you are.


For example, you might write “aware of others’ feelings.” Beneath this, you can write all of the benefits of that: you’re a good friend, you try to be kind to others, you know when someone needs a hug or a laugh, and you are able to mediate between people experiencing conflict.

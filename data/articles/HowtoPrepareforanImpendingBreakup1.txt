 Before you go about separating yourself from the relationship, make sure you aren't jumping to inaccurate conclusions. Evaluate where your relationship really stands and where you think it is going. Figure out where you are emotionally and maybe where your partner is, before you start mentally detaching from the relationship. Once you begin to distance yourself it can be hard to come back.


Ask yourself about the quality of your relationship. Are there more good times than bad times? Are you exhausted or unhappy because of the constant ups and downs?;
, Consider what you have done to try and address whatever problems you have had. Be honest about who, if anyone, is committed to making the relationship successful. If the answer isn't both partners, then the relationship is likely not going to be saved.


Have you talked about it with each other? How many times have you both tried to change things? Have you tried counseling?, If you have determined that your relationship is past the point of saving, then begin to accept that it will end. Instead of waiting for it to end, spend time focusing on the good things in the moment and the good things about your relationship. Use this time to discover what good memories you have, what you can learn, or what you can take away from this experience.

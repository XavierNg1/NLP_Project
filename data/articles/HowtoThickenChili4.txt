 If you have a thin chili pot that doesn't spread heat well, don't like to stir the chili, or want extra thick chili, it's best to wait until the end because thickening will decrease convection that spreads heat throughout the chili mass without creating hot spots that can scorch.
 Start with 3 or 4 crackers, adding more to bring the chili to your desired thickness.


You could also use miniature oyster crackers, but it is still a good idea to break them up so that they can absorb more of the liquid.
To add an interesting dimension of flavor, you could also use flavored gourmet crackers. Try garlic-and-cheese, green onion, or four-cheese flavored crackers, for instance.
 Add a layer of crushed corn chips into your bowl before ladling the chili in. Stir to combine.


While corn chips do not thicken the chili quite as much as crackers do, many prefer the flavor of corn chips to the flavor of crackers for chili. While they do not thicken the liquid itself, they do thicken the overall texture of the chili by adding another solid to it.
 You can sprinkle 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of dried potato flakes into a large individual serving of chili while it is still hot.


The potato flakes will lighten the color of the chili slightly. They may also alter the flavor, giving it a heartier taste, but the difference is not especially dramatic.
 The cornbread will absorb some of the liquid, making the chili seem thicker overall.
 The cheese adds rich, creamy smoothness to the lucky partaker's palate.

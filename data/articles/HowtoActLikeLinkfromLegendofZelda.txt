 Link is the holder of the Triforce of Courage, so first and foremost, you must always follow your heart and do what you know to be right, even if it's the harder thing to do, even if you're surrounded by monsters, have half a heart left and Navi won't stop shouting in your face.;
, Don't expect payment for everything you do, and do things to help others, not yourself. Put yourself out there and go outside your comfort zone to help others.
 Half the fun of a Zelda game is all the extras you discover. New lands to be discovered, new friends to be madeâ€”always be on the lookout for a new experience.
 Princesses don't rescue themselves, and it's hard work being a hero! Know how to defend yourself, and take good care of your body. Lift weights, run, and get into gymnastics. It takes a lot of practice, but it's worth it for a healthier life (and to be like Link).
 While Link may go a little overboard, what with three Bomb Bags, a Boomerang, and a Fishing Pole, always know what you are getting into and be prepared for whatever may arise.
 If you want to help others, first you need to know how to help yourself. You can't do any princess-saving if you get stuck in the first dungeon.
 Just because you're not really out there fighting monsters and saving lives doesn't mean that you can't really help people. Be kind to everyone, and know that even the smallest things make a difference.

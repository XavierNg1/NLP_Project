 Review the various degree programs you have located and choose the one that will best help you in the career of your choice. When choosing your degree/career:


Consider your natural talents and abilities. Are there things that you instinctively understand, such as poetry or medical terminology? Do you have any skills or natural abilities that would help you in a certain field?
Think about the type of work that you would enjoy. For example, if you don't like being outdoors much, a career studying plants or animals may not be the best choice for you. On the other hand, laboratory work might be just the thing you'd love.
Identify degree programs that will help you get the type of work you can be passionate about. If you love to read and value books, for example, a degree in the library field may be the best choice for you.

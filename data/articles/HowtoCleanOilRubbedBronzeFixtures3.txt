 Sand down the finish on your fixture if it has become severely damaged and you decide to repaint it. Starting with sanding will create an even surface, but isn’t always necessary depending on the fixture and damage.


Think carefully before you remove the existing oil rubbed finish on a fixture, as it is has been carefully treated and aged over time, which you cannot easily replicate with simple spray paint or aging materials.
Use a high-grit automotive sandpaper or steel wool to sand down the metal without unevenly scratching it., Try a spray paint that mimics an oil rubbed bronze finish. Use this method for a quick update to a fixture.Apply a thin coat of spray primer to your fixture after sanding and before painting. You may find that your oil rubbed bronze spray paint has primer already included, in which case you may skip this step.
Spray several thin coats of your spray paint on rather than one thicker coat to help it bind and cure better to the metal.
Remember to spray screws and any other related hardware with the same paint finish. You can insert a spare key into a doorknob you’re painting so that the paint doesn’t clog up the keyhole., Use an aging solution on brass to help achieve the same cured look created by oil rubbed bronze. Do this only for very damaged oil rubbed bronze fixtures.


First remove existing lacquer using a lacquer thinner and fine-grade steel wool.
Use an aging solution intended for bronze and brass. Don rubber gloves and safety glasses, as the chemical nature of these solutions can be damaging or harmful.
Soak your fixture in the solution as instructed by the specific product, then rinse in cool water to halt the chemical reaction. You can rub some mineral or vegetable oil on after drying to add shine.

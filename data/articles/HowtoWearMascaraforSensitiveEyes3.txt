 Many people suggest that you should apply mascara as close to the lash base as possible. If you have sensitive eyes, this might cause a problem because it gets too close to the eyes.Instead, apply mascara just to the middle and ends of the lashes.
 Though most people remove their makeup at the end of the day, sometimes they may get home late and not do it. You should get into the habit of removing your makeup when you get home. Not removing your makeup can lead to problems like inflammation.Use gentle makeup remover to wipe your eyes and lashes.
 You shouldnâ€™t keep the same tube of mascara for too long. Bacteria from your eyes can build up in the mascara tube. This can lead to infection. To help reduce this risk, change the mascara every three months.Sensitive eyes may be more vulnerable to bacteria.

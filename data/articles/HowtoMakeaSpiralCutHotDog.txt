 Usually boiling or steaming provides the best method to achieve a nice, sleek spiraled effect.;
, Make sure hot dogs have cooled slightly before placing on the spears, to save your fingers. (You can reheat the sausage in the oven or microwave after you’ve created the spiral.)


Simply hold the bottom of the shish kebab spear and poke the sharp end into the bottom of the hot dog, lengthwise.
Pierce the entire dog until it rests in the middle of the spear.
 The key to cutting the dog is to not cut all the way through. Cut only to the spear:


Cut the hot dog beginning from the top and work your way down. For a fancier spiral, cut the hot dog on an angle.
Make a cut every one to two inches, depending on the size of the hot dog. Make sure you don’t make cuts too close together as they may run together and ruin the effect.
As you are cutting, roll the hot dog away from your for the cleanest cut. This may take some practice, so you may want to test drive this method on a few hot dogs first.
 Since you’ve already cooked the hot dog, don’t leave the sausages in boiling water for more than a minute or two.


Reheat one or two spears at a time in the boiling water, depending on the size of your pot.
Use tongs to remove the spears from the hot water.
Rest the removed spiral hot dogs on a paper plate. The paper will help absorb any residual water.
 Be careful performing this step. If you pull too aggressively or too quickly, you could sever the hot dog. When removed successfully, the result should look like a long, spiral hot dog.
 Add mustard and ketchup and whatever else you like to eat with hot dogs.

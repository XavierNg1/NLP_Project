 Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom.This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead.Do not bow from the waist.
 The Queen may or may not offer her hand, although there is no special significance to one decision or the other. If she does offer her hand, take it in a brief, gentle handshake.


Do not offer your hand first.
 A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply.
 If you are stuck for words, say "Hello, Your Majesty. I am delighted to meet you." Any polite greeting is acceptable, however.
 For the rest of the conversation, say, "Ma'am," pronounced to rhyme with "jam." You may use the term "Your Majesty" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but "Ma'am" will do most of the time., Most likely, the Queen will be guiding the conversation. But if you contribute your own small talk, avoid asking her about her family or personal life., Remain facing her or standing to the side throughout the conversation. Turn away or leave only when the conversation is over.And of course, don't forget to give her a proper good-bye and thank Her Majesty for the unexpected opportunity.

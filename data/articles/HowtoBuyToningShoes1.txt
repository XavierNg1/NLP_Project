 Toning shoes' soles are designed differently for runners, walkers and everyday users. The 3 most common designs are rocker bottom soles, curved soles and collapsible heel soles.


If you walk often, choose collapsible heel toning shoes. They provide the feeling of walking in sand, which can help to strengthen your legs as you go about your daily errands.
If you want to improve your posture while you walk, choose ridged rocker bottom soles. They have a thick sole that allows you to rock back on your heel. They may also provide relief if you suffer from heel pain.
If you want to walk and jog, choose semi-rigid rocker bottom shoes or curved sole toning shoes. There is some flexibility in the soles, so they have some speed versatility. Do not do any kind of cross-training in these shoes, because they don't offer enough lateral stability.
If you want to walk, jog, run and cross-train, choose flexible rocker bottom shoes. These are the best choice if you want to wear them at the gym. They will allow you extra stability so you can do lateral movement without injuring yourself.;
, Many of today's toning shoes have very thick soles, and may not fit your current style. You can find smaller toning shoes, leather shoes and even Mary Jane styles, if you plan to wear them to work rather than the gym.

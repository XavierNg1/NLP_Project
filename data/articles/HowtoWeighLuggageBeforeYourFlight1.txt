 Scroll to the bottom to find the general restrictions for baggage weight. Go to the airline’s website and type “baggage” into the search bar to find a complete set of baggage rules.;
,, Get on the scale and look at the weight reading below. Write down your weight.
 If your baggage is heavy and you have back problems, you may want to ask a healthier family member to do this for you. Keep the luggage in the air while you get on the scale.
 Then, write down that weight.
 This is the current weight of your packed bags. Remember that if you add anything to the luggage after this point, it will no longer be accurate.


For example, if your initial weight was 160 lbs. (72.5kg), and then you weighed yourself with your bag and it was 184 lbs. (83.5kg), then the weight of your luggage is 24 lbs. (11kg)., Remove items from the bag and repeat until you drop under the weight requirement.


Some experts report that baggage scales are often wrong. It is ok to ask the airline to reweigh the bag on another scale or reset the scale, if you weighed it at home and found it was less than the limit.It is a good idea to keep the baggage at least a lb. under the limit to avoid problems with scales.

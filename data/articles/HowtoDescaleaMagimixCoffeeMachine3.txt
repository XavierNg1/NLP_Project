 Before you begin descaling, take care of the following:


Remove any coffee capsules.
Empty the drip tray.
Remove the steam nozzle and place a cloth under the hole. You may need to unclog the steam nozzle separately with a needle or a special nozzle cleaning tool.
 Pour in 500 mL (17 oz) of water and one 100mL (3.4oz) packet of Nespresso descaling solution.


You can make a cheaper descaling solution with a 20:1 mix of citric acid and water. Never use vinegar.
 Place a large container under the nozzle. Start the descaling process as follows:


Magimix 200: Turn on the machine and set the switch to hot water.
Magimiz 200A: Turn on the machine. Once it's warmed up, press and hold the two coffee buttons simultaneously for three seconds. Press the coffee button whenever the water runs out, until the tank is empty (about five presses).
 If using the 200 model (not 200A), pour the collected liquid back into the water tank. Move the switch to "Coffee" and let the tank empty again.
 Rinse the tank thoroughly and fill with fresh water. Run the water through the machine until the tank is empty.


Magimix 200A: Turn the machine off and on again to return to brew mode.

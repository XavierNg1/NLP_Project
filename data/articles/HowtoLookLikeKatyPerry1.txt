 Katy is notorious for changing her hair color and style but eventually, she always returns to her comfort colour, black.If black is too dark for your skin tone, try a dark or medium brown. Keep highlights to a minimum and use gloss to maintain shine.


If you feel comfortable, try cutting some bangs into your hair. Katy often has straight-across bangs.If this feels too bold for you, try side swept bangs instead, which can be easily blended into the rest of your hair.;
, Since Katy is always changing her hair color, you may want to experiment too. However, constantly bleaching and coloring your hair is expensive and may cause some major damage. Pull a “Katy” and wear a wig instead.A wig can be a fun way to have colored hair for a day or even a week, without damaging your natural hair.


Know what your wig is made of. You cannot use heat styling tools on a synthetic wig without damaging it.You may also not be able to use hair products on synthetic hair making it difficult to manipulate or blend to your natural hair.
 While Katy sometimes uses a single color, she often adds length, colored stripes or other textures to her hair.Again, constant coloring and bleaching can really damage your natural hair. Purchase some inexpensive clip-in extensions for a fast way to change your look.Be creative and experiment with bold colors, feathers, or lengthening extensions.

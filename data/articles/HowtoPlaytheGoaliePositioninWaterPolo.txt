 This is a form of treading water by moving each leg in opposite circular rotations that helps you stay above water. While egg beating, move your hands shoulder distance in front of you and move them side to side near the surface of the water. (Both hands scoop water towards each other, both hands scoop water away from each other).;
, If you don't know where the ball is, you can't block it.
 This is most important when preparing for a shot.
 Shots usually come unexpectedly from the outside or from the set position.
 Have your hands treading water lightly on the surface ready to come up out of the water.
 Don't forget, if they are close enough to the goal, you can attack the player or knock the ball out of his/her hand.
 This will bounce the ball back out at the opposing team giving them another chance to shoot. Have you're hands ready to hit the ball down into your possession or out of bounds if necessary.
 Always be lunging distance away from all possible places where the ball could be shot. Try to position yourself between the ball and the center of the goal.

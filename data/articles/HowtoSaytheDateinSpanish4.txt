, This means "the."

, Unlike in English, where you say "the second," or "the third," to switch the forms of "two" and "three," you don't have to change the forms of the numbers in Spanish, so you can just say the numbers from 1 to 31. The only exception is the number 1, which becomes "primero" when you say it aloud. Here's how to say the numbers:


1 = uno (primero), 2 = dos, 3 = tres, 4 = cuatro, 5 = cinco, 6 = seis, 7 = siete.
8 = ocho, 9 = nueve, 10 = diez, 11 = once, 12 = doce, 13 = trece, 14 = catorce.
15 = quince, 16 = dieciséis, 17 = diecisiete, 18 = dieciocho, 19 = diecinueve.
20 = veinte, 21 = veintiuno, 22 = veintidós, 23 = veintitrés, 24 = veinticuatro.
25 = veinticinco, 26 = veintiséis, 27 = veintisiete, 28 = veintiocho, 29 = veintinueve.
30 = treinta, 31 = treinta y uno.
 First, say "del año," which means "of the year," to show that you'll be talking about a year. Next, to say the year in Spanish, you have to first say the thousandth, hundredth, tenth, and first place of that year. Here's how you do it:


To say a year in the 1000s, say "mil," or "one thousand." To say a year in the 2000s, say "dos mil," or "two thousand."
Next, say the hundredths place. 100 = ciento, 200 = dosciento, 300 = tresciento, and so on. Add an "s" at the end of these numbers to make them plural.
Say "y" or and, before you add the last step.
Say the tenths and ones place. Learn to say the numbers from 1-99.


Ex: 1: The year 1943, for example, is "mil novecientos cuarenta y tres."

Ex: 2: The year 1991 is "mil novecientos noventa y uno."

Ex: 3: If the year is 2013, just say, "dos mil trece," or "two thousand and thirteen." Note that you don't have to say "y" or "and" because the hundredths place is empty.
 Combine all of these elements to create a sentence that states the date.



Ex. 1: If the date is June 10, 2013, just say, "Hoy es el diez de junio del año dos mil trece."

Ex. 2: If the date is February 18, 1995, say, "Hoy es el dieciocho de febrero del año mil novecientos noventa y cinco."

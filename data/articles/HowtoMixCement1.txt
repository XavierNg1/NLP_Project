 Type 1 Portland cement is the most-popular option because of its mix composition, but there are other types available that offer sulfur resistance or temperature sensitivity. Research online or in the hardware store to understand what will work best for you.









Over 92% of Portland cement produced in the United States is Type 1, 2, or 3. Type 2 is specially designed to fight against sulfate attack, while Type 3 is typically used for added early-strength.;
, You will need to purchase twice as much sand and three times as much gravel in order to get the proper cement mixture.
 This includes bags for mixing and a heavy-duty wheelbarrow, since the mixture will be heavy once combined.
 Use your small spade to shovel a ratio of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts gravel into the wheelbarrow.









For example, one wheelbarrow full should be a mix of 2 spades of cement, 4 spades of sand, and 6 spades of gravel. If you're working with bigger quantities of cement up front, you might have a ratio of 4 spades of cement, 8 spades of sand, and 12 spades of gravel.
 Though they'll be mixed later, it's a good idea to have the dry mix thoroughly incorporated before adding the water.

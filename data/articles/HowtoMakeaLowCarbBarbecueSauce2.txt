Making your own barbecue sauce is a matter of combining a base flavor with sweetness, tartness and spices. Tomato paste makes a great low carb base for any barbecue sauce, and vinegars add sour flavors to offset any sweetness. Sweetness can come from low carb or sugar-free syrups, juices or artificial sweeteners. The kinds of spices you use is up to you but garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, mustard powder, thyme and oregano are all common spices in barbecue sauces.



Tomato paste on its own is very concentrated. You'll need to dilute one 6 oz. (170 g) can of tomato paste with 2 cups (240 ml) of water. To that, add 1/2 cup (120 ml) vinegar. You can use apple cider vinegar, red wine vinegar or balsamic; use whatever you prefer. Then, add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce to give the barbecue sauce depth. Add your spices of choice 1 tbsp. (15 ml) at a time; don't forget to season it with salt and pepper.



In order for all the flavors to blend and the sauce to thicken, you need to heat it on the stove. Put your mixture in a pot and heat it on medium, stirring, until it reaches a boil.



In order to thicken your barbecue sauce you'll need to combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of cornstarch with 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of water. Stir this until combined. Add it slowly to the barbecue sauce with the heat off, whisking it to combine. When all the cornstarch has been added, turn the heat on medium and whisk it until the sauce boils and has thickened.



Taste the sauce. Adjust the seasonings and spices until you have a sauce that tastes good to you.



Barbecue sauce should be cooled in the refrigerator, in a container with no lid. Once the sauce is cool you can use it right away or cover it and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

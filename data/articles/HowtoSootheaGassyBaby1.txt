Place her facing downward with her belly across your lap. Gently move your legs to massage her abdomen. This slight pressure may help move the gas. You can also gently rub her back.
 If your baby’s belly is hard and bloated with gas, she may already be fidgeting, waving her arms, and kicking her legs.The movement may help get bubbles unstuck and move them through the intestines, so your baby can pass them naturally.
If your baby resists and does not want to have you pedal her legs, don’t force her.

Try putting her in her car seat and going for a short drive around the block. The change of scenery and soft background noise of the motor may soothe her and cause her to fall asleep even though she’s gassy.
Put the baby in the stroller and go for a walk around the block. The movement and gentle bouncing of the stroller may help her to pass the gas.

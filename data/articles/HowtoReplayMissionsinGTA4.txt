 If you have a physical game disc of GTA: V, insert it into the game console, and load the game. For those who have the game saved in the console, locate it in your game’s list, and load it from there.
 On the game’s main screen, opt to load a saved game. Select the saved game file from the list, and you will be taken to the game world.
 Do this by pressing Start on your controller. A window will open, with the Map displayed. There will be several tabs at the top of the window for each menu option. Select the Game tab.


The Game tab will display “Replay Missions,” “Load Game,” and “New Game.”

, Use the D-pad on your controller to scroll down to “Replay Missions” and press A (Xbox) or X (PS3) to select. A list of all the missions you have accomplished will be displayed. Scroll through this list and select the mission you would like to replay.


Take advantage of this feature to get 100% in each mission as you can replay missions as often as you want.

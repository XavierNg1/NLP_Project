 Grab the clasp opener and pinch it firmly between your thumb and the side of your index finger.The official Pandora clasp opener looks like a flower. It has four petals, each with a flat edge that you can use for opening Pandora clasps.
If you do not have the Pandora clasp opener, you can use a generic clasp opener or thin metal coin (e.g. a dime) in the same manner.
 Turn the clasp using your fingers. Stop once you see the vertical gap running along one side of the clasp.
 Wedge one flat edge of the clasp opener into the vertical gap. Press the edge into the gap as far as it will naturally go without applying excess force.


You may also need to hold the clasp steady by bracing it against your fingers or against the side of your body.
 Wiggle the clasp opener up and down, causing the inserted side to rock up and down, as well. Do so while applying firm, careful pressure and continue until the clasp pops open.


The clasp may seem stiff and difficult to open at first. If you cannot open it during your first attempt, adjust your grip on the clasp and try again.
 Look at both bracelet ends and identify the removable side. Pinch this loose end in between your fingers and lift it straight up to remove it from the clasp. Once you finish doing so, the bracelet should be fully opened.

 Use a powerful vacuum to clean your carpets, rugs and furniture. Move your furniture out of the way to clean the areas under and behind it. Vacuuming removes fleas and ticks as well as their eggs, so its important not to skip this step.


Vacuum the pillows and cushions on your sofa. If possible, use the vacuum extension to clean the underside of your sofa and other soft furniture.
Concentrate on the areas your pets frequent, such as rooms where they play and sleep.
Don't forget to vacuum out your closets, too, especially if they're carpeted.
If you think your car may also be infested, give it a thorough vacuuming, too, so that you don't end up carrying fleas and ticks back into the house.
 Use the hot water cycle to wash your couch cushion covers, blankets, bed linens, and clothes. Use the highest dryer setting to dry them thoroughly and make sure all insects and their eggs are removed.


If you have an item that could be damaged by washing it in hot water, like a wool coat, put it in a plastic bag and seal it. Plan to take it to the dry cleaner to make sure no fleas and ticks are hiding there.
Wash camping tents, tarps, and other fabrics that could make a home for fleas and ticks.
 Use a spray cleaner and a rag to clean window sills, baseboards, and other areas where fleas and ticks might thrive. Focus on the rooms where your pets spend most of their time.

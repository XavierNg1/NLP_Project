 Do not try to force a kitten to do anything when it's scared or startled.;
, This will make it easier to trim the cat's nails later on. Touch, hold, and squeeze the paws often. Put the kitten in nail-cutting position and pretend to clip its nails, so the kitten gets used to having to be in this position for the required amount of time and doesn't fight it when it gets older.
 Many adult cats don't like having their bellies touched, and might claw or nip at strangers who come too close. If you get the kitten used to having its belly rubbed a lot, though, it's more likely that the cat will enjoy being pet there later. A hyper kitten won't particularly like being put on its back and having its belly rubbed, but it won't fight it aggressively, either, and will probably start to enjoy the attention.
 Those little claws can't do much damage yet, but now is a good time to teach the kitten to use a post. Spend a lot of time near the post (which should stay in one place) and gently put the kitten's paws on the post occasionally.
 Many cats are uncomfortable being held, but a kitten will tolerate it quite well, so this is a great time to get it used to the feeling of being held.
 Many cats learn to be wonderfully friendly, but only to their caretakers. If you get your kitten used to being around other people, it won't be as skittish later in life. Most people are eager to play with fluffy kittens anyway. Ideally, have them do the above steps as well.

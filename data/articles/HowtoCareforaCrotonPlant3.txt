 Use water-soluble houseplant fertilizer with a balanced ratio of 5-10-5 or 7-7-7. Mix 1 teaspoon of fertilizer into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of aged water.


Do not give crotons fertilizer from mid-fall through winter. They will not use the fertilizer during this dormant time and it could damage the roots.
 Never give the croton fertilizer before watering as it could burn the roots.
 Indications that a croton needs to be repotted are slowed growth, an excessive mass of roots in the pot or simply looking too big for the container. Get a container that is only one size larger than the current container.


If the new container is much larger than the old one, it will hold too much potting soil which will retain too much moisture around the roots. This excessive moisture and lack of air circulation could cause the croton’s roots to rot which will kill the plant.
 Pour 1 to 2 inches of moistened peat-based potting soil into the bottom of the container. Turn the croton on its side and gently pull it out of its old container. Set it in the new container and fill in around the roots with potting soil.


Water it generously to help settle the potting soil. Add more soil, if necessary, to bring it up to an inch or so below the rim of the container.

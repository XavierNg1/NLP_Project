 Visit the official 2016 Olympics broadcaster page. Select your continent, then your country to find out which networks are providing coverage in your country. Online sources are labeled "internet" or "VoD," while apps are labeled "mobile.", If your country does not have official online coverage, or if you do not have the necessary cable subscription to access it, consider a VPN extension. This will allow you to visit another country's broadcasting website (such as Canada's CBC or the UK's BBC) and trick it into thinking you're visiting from within the country.


You can install VPN extensions for both Firefox and Chrome. These extensions are available for free, but may be ad-supported.
This practice is legal in almost all countries, except for a few with heavy government censorship. It is against the terms of service, so there is a small risk you will be discovered and blocked., For example, if you plan on watching through the Canadian CBC player, click the extension icon in your browser and select a Canadian server. Your traffic will be routed through that server on the way to the CBC site, making it think you are visiting from within Canada.


If you want to watch through the BBC site, use a UK server.
 You should now be able to access the streaming content as if you were normally accessing the site. You may experience some delay and slow connections as data is transferred between the proxy server, the website, and you. If the connection is extremely slow, try switching to another server using your VPN extension's settings.
 There are a variety of sites where users can stream sporting events. These are not official sites, and finding a working stream can be a little difficult. The plus side, however, is that you don't need to install any browser plugins in order for them to work. Be aware that accessing these sites may be illegal in your country, or in a legal grey area.

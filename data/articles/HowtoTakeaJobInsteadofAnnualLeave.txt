 It might be seasonal work, there might be a big event coming up that needs short-term staff or your second job might be happy to have you work full-time for a few weeks.;
, That way everything will be novel, interesting and you won't meet the same people you might if you did something similar to your job.
 After all, it's annual leave and you don't want to return to work exhausted. Look for work that won't tax the brain too much, does not involve large amounts of training and is so easy that almost anyone could know how to do it with just a few hours of training. Consider things like:


Ushering people at sports games or big events.
Retailing at a visiting fair, festival, or outdoors event.
Selling craft items at local markets.
Pet-sitting over major seasonal breaks when many people go away.
Gardening for those who don't want to do it.
Cleaning for hotels, guesthouses, commercial properties etc.
Driving jobs
Barista work, cafe serving etc.
De-cluttering other people's houses (bonus is you can offer to take away junk and sell it online for more cash)
Tour guiding (sometimes this requires a lot of knowledge but you might just have what it takes)
Take on a bed and breakfast while its owners have a break
Washing vehicles, boats, etc. by hand
Child-minding or education.
 Seasonal work such as fruit-picking, produce sorting and tourist work can be a good break even solution to still having a trip away and getting some pay out of it. Naturally, this all depends on prior planning, prior arrangements being in place, and having adequate time to travel and work.
 If you have a long break, clearly you can fit a lot of different things in, including a job for a bit. If you only have a short break, factor in how much time you need to just relax and whether a job will fit into this.

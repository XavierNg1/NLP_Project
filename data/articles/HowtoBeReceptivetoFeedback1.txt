 When receiving feedback you should make eye contact with the person providing the feedback. Maintaining eye contact during your conversation will help build trust and create a more comfortable atmosphere for both parties.Try to maintain a neutral facial expression (which is different than a "blank" expression). Your eyebrows should be relaxed, you may have a slight smile on your face (if appropriate), and you can nod to show that you are engaged. Try to avoid looking hostile, upset, or like you are zoning out.;
, Standing with your arms crossed will make you appear defensive or not receptive to feedback. Instead use open body language to appear receptive to the feedback.Lean in toward the person who is providing the feedback.
Keep your arms relaxed and open. Don't cross them!
Refrain from crossing your legs.
 When someone is giving us feedback, it’s often second nature to interrupt the person before they’ve finished speaking — especially if the feedback is not positive. This prevents the person from completely conveying the feedback and hinders your understanding of what they are trying to say.


When someone is speaking don't think about your response. Use all of your energy to listen.
If you feel yourself getting ready to interrupt, gently bite your tongue to remind yourself that you need to listen fully to the feedback being given.
 It can be helpful to repeat the feedback after you receive it. This can clear up any misunderstandings you have about what is being said. Summarize what you feel are the key points.Try saying, "Thanks for your feedback, Angela. What I garnered from this is that I need to be more alert during staff meetings, correct?"

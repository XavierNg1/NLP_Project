 If you are not already on the intended recipient's channel, you should navigate to it by clicking the nearest available link to that user's channel.


If you are watching a user's video or have just finished watching one, the username will usually appear just below the video box.
If you are subscribed to the user's channel, that username (and a list of other usernames you are subscribed to) should appear under the “Subscriptions” sidebar on the left side of your home page.;
, Once you reach the user's channel home, you should notice a variety of options or tabs just below the channel title. The "About" option will usually appear toward the right side of this task bar.


Note that "About" is usually just to the left of the search option, which is represented by a magnifying glass icon.
 Within the first section of the user's "About" page, there should be a button labeled "Send message." Click on this to be redirected to the new message page.


If the user has personal information or contact information, this usually appears above the "Send message" button. Otherwise, the button will likely be the first option at the top of the page, right next to the flag icon.
 Type your message within the "Message" field. If you want to provide a title or subject line, type that into the "Subject" field.


Note that, when using this method, the "To" field is automatically filled in with the user whose channel you were redirected from.
 With every message, you have the option of attaching a video for the intended recipient to view. Click on the down arrow on the drop-down menu next to the "Attach Video" field. Click once on a video from the list to select it.


You can choose from videos you uploaded and videos saved to your favorites.
 Review the message once more to verify that all the information is correct. Once this has been done, hit the blue “Send Message” button just below the body of the message to send it.


This completes the process.

$2.00 per night stayed
Airport Skycap: $1.00 per bag. ($2.00 for your entire boot collection), but chances are, if you're using a skycap, you have several bags, so you should usually give $5.00 or more, depending on the load.
Cabbie: Always round the bill up by a dollar and the change. In other words, if the cab is $5.50, leave $7.00. If it's more than $15.00, give him 15%

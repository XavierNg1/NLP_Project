 Using a tape measure and Sharpie, mark the cuts on your 1-inch PVC pipe. 1-inch PVC comes in 10-foot lengths at most hardware stores. However, if you have your measurements handy, you should ask the sales associate if they would be able to make your cuts for you.Regardless, you will need the following pieces:


8 12-inch (30.48 cm) pieces
4 1¾-inch (4.45 cm) pieces
2 50-inch (127 cm) pieces
4 30-inch (76.2 cm) pieces

, Once you have marked your cuts, use a pull saw (hacksaw or miter saw) or circular saw to cut your pieces. Make sure that you cut straight along the lines that you marked. Because you are making two jumps, you will have 18 pieces total, 9 pieces for each jump., While you are cutting your pieces, take the 10-foot (3.1 m) pieces of ¾-inch (1.9 cm) PVC pipe and cut off four 50-inch (127 cm) pieces.An easy way to do this would be to mark and cut off a 20-inch (50.8 cm) piece from each pipe, and then cut the remaining large piece in half to get two 50-inch (127 cm) pieces. You can then use tape to mark the bars or use newspaper and spray paint to make more complicated markings.Ul


You should end up with four 50-inch (127 cm) pieces of ¾-inch (1.9 cm) PVC pipe.
Depending on how exact your measurements are, you may find that you need to trim a little off the ends of your jump bars to get them to fit properly in the cups. You should not need to take off more than a quarter of an inch (6.35 mm).
 Slide two 12-inch (30.48 cm) pieces into the top and bottom ends of a tee joint. Then put caps on the ends of the 12-inch (30.48 cm) pipe. Repeat this process three more times to make all four feet for your jumps.If the pieces do not slide together easily, you might consider using a hammer and block to tap them together.
 For each foot, insert a 1¾-inch (4.45 cm) piece into the open end of the tee joint. Then attach another tee joint to the top of the 1¾-inch (4.45 cm). You should have four individual feet with tee joints facing in. Finally, take two jump feet and, with the middle openings of the tee joints facing each other, insert a 50-inch (127 cm) piece of 1-inch (2.5 cm) pipe in-between them.Once you insert the 50-inch (127 cm) piece, the base should stand on its own.
 Insert a 30-inch (76.2 cm) into the open tee joints at the tops of each base and put caps on the open pipe ends. Then clip two jump cups onto the 30-inch (76.2 cm). With the cups facing each other, place one 50-inch (127 cm) piece of ¾-inch (1.9 cm) in-between each jump cup. This should give you two parallel jumping bars for each of your jumps.You should be able to find the jump cup clips online. You can also make your own.
If the bars do not fit perfectly, consider sawing off a little at the ends until they fit. The bars should rest securely but fall easily if bumped.

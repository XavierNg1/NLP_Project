 A really dedicated poser can easily purchase fans, views and followers. This will artificially inflate their social media accounts, making it seem like they have a large following. To get to the bottom of this, look at the relationship between your suspected poser and their fans. You can also check the profiles of their followers; if the profiles are empty, they’re not real followers.


Social media is essentially a more complicated, high tech conversation. If there are no comments or likes on the suspected poser’s posts, it’s a one way conversation and you might be dealing with a poser., Buying a following means posers don’t have to worry about putting out quality posts. Even without a following, posers will focus on posts that can bring the most attention, rather than putting out something important and creative.


People who are passionate about their hobby or interest will release content that helps to educate others or celebrates their passion.Posers treat it like a science; they’re just after the views.
 The scheduling of a person’s posts can tell you a lot about how they treat their social media accounts. A poser might try and use their social media accounts like a brand or company: minimizing effort and maximizing their following. Someone who’s passionate is more likely to post as the mood strikes them; maybe they come across something particularly funny or important they really want to share.


If the suspected poser runs their social media on a tight schedule, your suspicions likely have some truth to them.

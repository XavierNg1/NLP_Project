 This is a quick and effective way to “spot treat” your roach problem. If you see live roaches, droppings, or egg cases, vacuum them up and dispose of your vacuum bag or the contents of your vacuum canister in a garbage container outside of your building., These types of traps can help reduce the number of roaches in your apartment, and can also be useful for helping you identify areas in your apartment where roaches are most likely to gather.


You can purchase sticky traps in most hardware stores, drug stores, or department stores.
You can make your own traps by lining the inside of a jar with Vaseline and placing a slightly moist piece of bread and some slices of raw potato inside as bait. You can kill the roaches you trap in the jar by filling the jar with soapy water.Dispose of the trapped roaches in a garbage container outside your building.
 Pest control experts are permitted to use chemicals that private citizens are not, such as Avermectin. Contact your landlord to find out if they already have a working relationship with an exterminator in your area.

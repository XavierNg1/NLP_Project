 Focus on the ends when you wash the asparagus. This is where dirt and grit tend to collect. You will also want to remove the scales using a vegetable peeler. When the asparagus is clean and de-scaled, hold it by each end and bend it. It will snap right where the wood and tender parts meet. Toss the hard, woody part and keep the tender part. For more details on preparing asparagus, see the section on preparing, above.


Consider cutting the asparagus into smaller, bite-sized pieces.
 Make sure that the dish is large enough to fit the asparagus., Start laying the asparagus stalks down side by side until the entire bottom is covered. Lay down more asparagus on top of the first layer. Keep doing this until you have 2 or 3 layers of asparagus., Run your finger around the rim of the dish to seal it. Be sure to tuck the wrap under the dish.
 This is very important. If you don't do this, the steam will get trapped inside the plastic and cause it to pop. The plastic wrap may also melt over the asparagus.
 Check on the asparagus after about 2 and a half minutes to check for doneness. The asparagus is done when it turns bright green.
 Be careful while doing this so that the steam doesn't burn you. Consider using a fork or a pair of tongs to lift the plastic wrap off. Serve the asparagus immediately.
 Dampen several sheets of paper towel and wrap them around the asparagus. Place the bundle, seam-side-down on a microwave-safe dish. Put the dish into the microwave, and heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Be careful when removing the asparagus from the paper towel; it will be very hot.

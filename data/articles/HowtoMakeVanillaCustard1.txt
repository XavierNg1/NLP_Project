 An ice bath will quickly stop the cooking custard, which allows it to cool rapidly without curdling. While you can make custards without one, professional pastry chefs know that this little trick will make better custards every time., A shallow cut all the way down the pod should allow you to gently pry the pod open. Save both the husks and the beans inside.









If you are using vanilla extract, ignore this step and add the vanilla later, after cooking., This is your last bit of prep. Separate the yolks from the whites and then lightly whisk the yolks with a fork -- they don;t have to be pure liquid, just "roughed up." Set this aside near your ice bath.
 Stir until their are no more clumps of cornstarch or sugar, even if it isn't totally dissolved yet. Once it's mixed, use the end of a knife to scrape out the vanilla seeds and toss the husks in as well.
 Stir the mixture occasionally. You want the mixture to "scald," which is when small bubbles start forming around the edges of the surface. When it does, stir for 20-30 seconds and remove from heat.
 This is called "tempering" the eggs, which brings them up to heat faster. After you add the hot milk, use your whisk to whip the whole mixture together.
 This should only take 2-3 minutes. You want it too coat the back of your stirring spoon or spatula without immediately dripping off.









If you're using vanilla extract, stir it in now., Make sure, of course, that water cannot get into the custard. Then simply cover it with a towel or cheesecloth and let it cool down to room temperature.









For an even smoother custard, run it through a fine-mesh strainer before pouring into the chilling bowl., The custard should keep for several days in the fridge. It can be severed with berries, on it's own, or stuffed into pastries, like eclairs.

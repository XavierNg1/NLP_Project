 Before cooking, cover your lamb shanks in salt and pepper. Make sure to wash your hands before and after touching raw food. From there, heat your olive oil in a large, heavy pan. Make sure it has a lid that fits.Cook the lamb shanks until they're completely brown. Take your time doing this, as it may take awhile.
Do not stop cooking until every side of your shanks is brown. Remove the meat and set aside when you're done.;
, Use the same pan you used to cook the lamb. Add the celery, shallots, and garlic. Cook them in the juices from the lamb until they're golden brown., Once the vegetables are brown, add the meat back to the pan. Pour in the wine and broth, as well as the bouquet garni, and bay leaf. Cover your pan completely. Allow it to simmer over the stove for an hour at medium-low heat., Once you place the olives and sun-dried tomatoes in the pot, it may be a little dry. If this is the case, pour in a little more wine. Cover the pot again and allow it to simmer for an additional 30 minutes., Once everything is cooked, the lamb should be falling off the bone. At this point, salt and pepper your medley to taste., You should pull the meat off the bone before serving. This medley can be served as a stew. However, it also works great as a sauce for pasta.Make sure anyone eating knows the olives still contain their pits.

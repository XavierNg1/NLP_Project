 Use a microplane to finely zest one medium size lemon. When you’re finished zesting it, juice the lemon, and set aside both the zest and the juice for a moment.If you don’t have a microplane, you can use a vegetable peel to remove the skin from the lemon, trying to take as little of the white pith beneath the skin as possible. Next, finely chop the zest with a chef’s knife., Add 1 ¼ cup (225 g) of pitted Nicoise olives, ½ cup (170 g) of coarsely chopped roasted red peppers, 2 anchovy fillets that have been coarsely chopped, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil, a garlic clove that’s been coarsely chopped, ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of fresh oregano leaves, the lemon zest, and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of the lemon juice to a food processor, and process until the ingredients form a coarse paste.It should take approximately 5 pulses that are 1 second long each to get the tapenade to the right consistency.
 After you’ve finished processing the tapenade, give it a taste. If you think the flavor needs more brightening, mix in some extra lemon juice.Be sure to add the juice gradually. You’ll overwhelm the flavor of the tapenade if you add too much.
 When you’re happy with the flavor of the tapenade, scoop it into a serving bowl. Serve it with vegetables, crostini, or crackers.You can store the tapenade in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2 weeks. When you serve it, though, allow it to come to room temperature first.

 Either put your book, device, and earbuds away entirely, or make a point of looking up from them frequently.Avoid missing visual or audible clues that a sudden turn, stop, or acceleration is about to happen.
 Note how many people board and/or depart at each stop. Move to the back of the bus if needed to avoid crowding.Also keep an eye out for anyone who’s moving up or down the aisle while the bus is in motion.
 Watch outside for upcoming bus stops, traffic lights, and stop signs, as well as other cars or anything else that may prompt your driver into braking, switching lanes, and/or turning onto another street.
 The speed of the bus and the severity of braking will effect your balance according to each.The faster the bus is traveling, the more likely the bus will tip forward and then backward if it makes a very sharp and sudden brake, causing you to skid forward.Prepare yourself for the possibility.
 If it’s your first time riding, check the route map to see how frequently the bus stops for both scheduled stops and traffic lights. Familiarize yourself with the route the more you ride it. Pay attention to the quality of the road’s surface as well as the time of day and how that factors into traffic congestion to better anticipate how often the bus may slow down, brake, or stop.

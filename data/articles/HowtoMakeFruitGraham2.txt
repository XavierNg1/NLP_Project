 You can do this by pulsing them in a blender. You can also put them into a plastic baggie and smash it with a rolling pin. You want the crackers to be finely crushed, like coffee grounds or sand.
 This will create the crust part of your cocktail and help it hold together., This will take about 5 minutes., Continue mixing until the sugar, vanilla extract, and heavy cream are all evenly combined.
 The shape of the tip does not matter. You will simply be using the back to make filling the glasses easier. If you do not have a piping back, you can use a plastic zippered back with the bottom corner cut off instead.
 Pack the mixture down using the base of a spoon or a smaller glass (a spice jar would be ideal). This recipe makes enough for three glasses. Save the rest of the graham cracker mixture for later layers.
 Place the nozzle of your piping bag inside the cup, and swirl it around while squeezing it gently. Stop when you can't see the graham cracker crust anymore.
 Spread some fruit cocktail pieces across the cream, then cover them up with another swirl of cream. If you can't find any fruit cocktail, you can use another type of fruit instead.
 Use a spoon or fork to spread a think layer of the graham mixture across the cream. Do not pack it down this time. Top it off with a thick swirl of cream.
 A simpler decoration would be a sprinkle of finely-crushed graham cracker and a maraschino cherry. You can also leave the cocktail un-garnished.
 Depending on the temperature of your fridge, it may take as little as 30 minutes to as long as 4 hours for the cream to firm up.

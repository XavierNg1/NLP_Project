 To start, use a whisk or a fork to stir together the flour and salt. Keep stirring until you have an even mixture free of lumps. This should not take long as you do not have a lot of dry ingredients., If you have a pastry blender, use this to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. If you don't, you can simply use your fingers. Make sure you wash your hands first.Use the pastry cutter or your fingers to gently mash the butter into the flour.
Do not expect the butter to mix like it would if you were, say, creaming butter and sugar. There is not enough butter to mix completely with the flour. When you're done cutting in the butter, your dough should resemble fine crumbs., Use a spoon to carve out a small well in the center of the flour mixture. Gradually pour in your milk and water into the center of this well. Use the spoon to stir the flour, water, butter, and milk together.Keep stirring until you have an even mixture. When you're done, everything should be mixed uniformly together. You should be able to easily handle and form the dough.
 Lightly dust a surface, such as plate or cutting board, with flour. Set your dough in the center of this surface.Wash your hands then then form your dough into a loaf. You want to form a circular loaf of bread that's about 8 inches across.
Take sharp knife. Use it to cut a criss-cross pattern across the top of your loaf of bread.

 Set it out in some free space of your room.;
, Choose fabric that is nice and soft, such as polar fleece or an old unwanted woolen/cashmere sweater or even a unwanted blanket.
 Add words such as the stuffed animal's name, initials or words that correspond with its personality. You can draw pictures too!

, This could be a scarf, folded up. You could tuck any fabric inside a small box to make an easy bed.
 Go around it in tape; make sure it's bigger than your stuffed animal. Paint it, cut and take the tape off. Add to the box, so that your stuffed animal can get in by itself.
 If you have old dollhouse furniture, add that to the house. Cut paper to size fold over a small part of it and glue it to the wall like the table.
 Throw a housewarming party to make your little friend feel loved.

 Remove any dirt or coating and wipe down. Let dry before proceeding.;
, Scoop out all of the flesh.


Use the flesh to make orange juice or to bake with.



If the oranges tilt, use small blobs of poster tack or similar to keep them from rocking.
 However, use less water than the instructions suggest, as this will help the Jell-O to set more firmly.
 Fill right to the top of each shell.
, Make this one as usual; it will be turned into "sea" later. Place in the refrigerator to set.
 This will make quarters, with the Jell-O (jelly) already set in place.
 You'll need one of these per boat:


Draw triangle sail shapes on plain paper. The triangle should be about half the size of the baguette roll, to make it look balanced.
Cut out the triangle sails. Decorate if wished––this can be as simple as writing on the child's name or sticking a fun sticker onto it.
Poke the cocktail stick or toothpick through the sail's "back". Do this by threading it through two holes in the paper.
Adjust the sail as needed.
 You now have little Jell-O (jelly) boats.
, Using a fork or a butter knife, cut it up into little chunks. This will form the sea underneath the boats.


Avoid mushing it, the Jell-O (jelly) should still look appealing enough to scoop up and eat.
 Sit the boats upright with the masts sticking upright. Vary the colors around the plate or platter to enhance the look.
 Place the Jell-O (jelly) boats on the ocean platter on the serving table.

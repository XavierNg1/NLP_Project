 Links show you if a player has chemistry with another player. A player does not have to have a good link with all players, only players in positions near them. For example, the goalkeeper does not need to have a link with the striker, but he does have to have one with the center backs.;

There are two ways to get a good link. The first one is players having the same nationality. The second is players being in the same league. There is a bonus for players being in the same club, but it is not required.
 If a player isn't in his preferred position, then there will be a chemistry penalty for that player. For example, a left back playing right back will get a chemistry penalty. A way around this is using position change cards.
 A manager will increase the chemistry of players that have the same nationality or are in the same league he is in. This is useful, because a player has 9 chemistry max without a manager, but can have 10 chemistry with a manager.

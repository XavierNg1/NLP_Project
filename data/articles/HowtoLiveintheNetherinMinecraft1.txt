 Be sure to build with materials that are not flammable, because there is a lot of fire in the nether.Â Some good materials to use are cobblestone, anything made of stone, or blocks made of iron or gold.;
, To get to the nether and back, you'll need a portal. Make sure to build this in your house, to always be protected from the mobs. Also, this will help make sure that no mobs from the nether enter your portal and appear in the overworld.
 You cannot place water in the nether unless you use ice blocks, so you can store it in a cauldron. To keep safe when burning, hop into a cauldron and you'll be cool. You can also use these to store water to craft things with or brew.
 You will need all of your materials that you have, because you can't find any of them in the nether. Because of this, you'll want to bring lots of dirt, water, sand, plants, and lots of saplings to grow trees.

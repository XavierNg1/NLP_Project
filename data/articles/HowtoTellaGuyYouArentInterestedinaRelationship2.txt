 This is harsh sounding and puts an end to the connection. While you don't wish to date this guy or get on intimate terms with him, it still remains important to respect his dignity and let him down gently.
 Begin by explaining that you're flattered by his interest in you and that it is very kind of him to ask. However, you'll also need to explain your lack of interest in general terms, without suggesting that there is anything wrong with him. For example, you might say something along these lines:


"That's nice of you to ask but right now I'm still looking for the right guy."
"Thank you for your attention, that's so sweet and I am really flattered. The trouble is, I'm just not interested in dating anybody at the moment. But it was so kind of you to ask."

, Avoid laughing or using jokes as a way of negating what he has just asked you. Make it clear that you've appreciated the effort and his courage but that's the end of it; no need to rub salt into the wound.


If you do wish to make humor, use the self-deprecating sort that rebounds on you, not on him or anybody else. And don't overdo it, or it'll look as if you're trying too hard.
 If possible, tell him that your current focus is absolutely on your career, your new business start-up, your university exams, your overseas trip, whatever. This way, it doesn't feel like a personal rejection but is simply an outcome of a broader reality that you're just too wed to something else.


It's not your place to butter up his ego but it's always a nice thing to offer a soft letdown to anyone who receives rejection.
 Don't drag it on and become nervous, chatty or full of excuses. Any of these things will make it more awkward for you than it is for him and opens up too many possibilities for him to try to convince you to make space for him in your life.

 Not all, but most could get their wings for what they have done for you. The times they stayed up with you all night when you were sick or stood up to your math teacher in high school. Mothers in my book are the closest to God. Speaking of mothers I believe that her prayers for our sake have the greatest power.;
, They are the littlest angels. They are pure and wise beyond their years and need to be treated with loving care.
 All angels speak with a message of truth straight to your heart. That best friend who told you the truth when no one else would is an angel to you.
  Totally honest people are angels.
 Maybe your father died and speaks to you in a dream and tells you something you need to know. You might want to think of what he told you, he can be an angel now with a heavenly message.
  The teaching occurs for us at the time we are ready for the message.
 Sometimes they can teach you great life lessons just by watching them. The homeless man on the street can make you appreciate what you have.  The special needs child that makes you smile as you watch her accomplish a task. Who is to say they are not angels.
 Remember the lady that screamed out to you “You are going down a one way street, turn around” and saved your life. That is what I call an angel. 

, Remember when they stopped you from making a mistake? 

, How many times were they moved to do just the right thing to protect you or even spare your life? They are your angels.
 The lady who taught you read, or spell, her patience was that of an angel for sure. You could not read this now without her help then. In conclusion, we can all be an angel; we can all be the hand of God by helping our fellow man along life’s path.

 Remember that hot foods should always be kept above 140˚F, refrigerated foods should be kept between 35˚F and 40˚F and freezer foods should be kept below 10˚F.
 This includes prep time. If it has been that long, either reheat or refrigerate the food to lessen the possibility of contamination.



Never partially cook poultry, meat, fish, or seafood and then set aside to finish later (even if you refrigerate it). This can actually aid in bacterial growth, increasing your chances of food poisoning.
 This also includes takeout and leftover restaurant dishes. Break up large amounts of leftovers into many smaller containers to that they chill more quickly.


When you refrigerate lots of warm leftovers, make sure to adjust the refrigerator to a slightly colder setting. Change back to the original setting after about 8 hours.
Be sure to reheat the food to at least 165˚F. Use a cover to retain moisture and help heat the center of the food. All gravies should be brought to a rolling boil.
 Never thaw it at room temperature. Cook immediately after thawing.


If thawing in the refrigerator, allow 5 hours per 1 lb. of frozen food. If thawing in the microwave, follow the manufacturers directors.
 Different parts of the fridge are slightly different temperatures, so it's important to know what to store where.


Store eggs in the carton on a shelf inside the fridge. Avoid storing them in the fridge door, as this compartment doesn't get cold enough to safely preserve them.
Store chicken in the meat compartment. If you don't have one, find the coldest part of the fridge and store your chicken there. Alternatively, you can freeze the chicken.
Store a turkey in the coldest place it will fit. If possible, store it in a tray so that the juices don't leak onto the rest of your food.

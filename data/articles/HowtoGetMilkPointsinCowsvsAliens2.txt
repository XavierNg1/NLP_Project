 Look for the game app on your device. It has an app icon with a cow on it. Tap on it.
 This is found on the upper right corner of the welcome screen. You will be brought to the game’s shop.
 Under the Special section of the Shop, tap the “Go” button. You will see all the available milk packages for sale. Swipe left and right to see all of them.


There are four different packages you can purchase, ranging from 5,000 milk at $1.99 to 75,000 milk at $19.99.
 Tap on the price button for the milk package you want to buy then follow the on-screen instructions to complete your purchase.


If you’re using an iOS device, the iTunes Store will process your payment. If you’re using an Android device, the Google Checkout will do that.
Once the purchase is completed, you will receive your milk.

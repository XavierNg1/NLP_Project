 This step is one of the most crucial techniques in order to ascertain the quality of the tea. This step has three most important goals to achieve; color, smell and taste. The idea is to completely destroy the activity of enzymes in the fresh leaves in order to put an end to the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols. This  technique also achieves the characteristic glassy flavor for green tea in order to release its aroma and evaporate the water  content present in the fresh tea leaves. The procedure enhances the toughness of the leaves to prepare it for the next step rolling.;
, From the withering racks, the leaves are now twisted and rolled so that the leaf cells could be broken up. The purpose of rolling is to make the shape of the tea leaves tighter so that it is easier for them to follow the next step easily. The tea leaves are twisted in this stage in order to make their quality better for an easy brew to the tea liquor. Oils released during the process gives the distinct aroma to the tea leaves. In the case of green tea, the process of rolling is carried out with hands.
 The drying of the produced tea is responsible for many of its characteristic compounds. This is also the technique which improves its appearance. Firing the tea stops the process of oxidation. After the all the above mentioned steps are taken care of, and you get the final processed green tea which is ready to be brewed into a fragrant and sweet light tasting beverage.

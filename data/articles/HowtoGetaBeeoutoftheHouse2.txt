 If your windows have screens of storm windows on them, open them as well. If you have to remove the screens, place them somewhere close by the window so they do not get misplaced or mismatched to a different window later. Raise the curtains or blinds so the bee can exit.


If the sun has set and you have a light directly outside the window, you can turn it on and turn off the lights of the room the bee is in. When the bee leaves to hover by the light outside, close the window behind it., If you have an additional screen door which has a spring-loaded latch on it which causes it to close automatically, use the small locking latch near the hinge of the spring mechanism to hold your door open. If you have a security door, you can leave it closed, assuming there is no screen on it. If there is a screen on it, open it as well.


If you have sliding glass doors, remove any curtains concealing them so the bee can see the world outside. When you notice it bump up against the door, carefully open it to let the bee out., With the doors and windows open, the bee will seek a way to return to its hive and explore nearby flowers. While waiting for the bee to make its exit, keep and eye on your doors and windows to ensure birds and other wildlife do not enter. Close your windows and doors as soon as the bee leaves.

 A microwave-safe pie plate works well, but any microwave-safe dish that is large enough to allow you to spread the seeds out on a single layer will work. Make sure the seeds are spread out evenly to prevent any from burning.;
, Drizzle the oil or melted butter over the seeds. Stir the seeds with a fork, making sure that all the seeds are coated in the oil. The oil adds flavor to the seeds and helps the seeds brown.
 If you feel the need to cover the seeds to prevent oil splatters, only cover the seeds loosely with a paper towel.
 After the first minute passes, stir the seeds with a fork. Gently shake the dish to spread out the seeds and return them to a single even layer. Continue cooking the seeds for another minute.
 After each minute, stir and check the seeds once more. The sunflower seeds are done once they appear lightly browned. This could take anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes total.

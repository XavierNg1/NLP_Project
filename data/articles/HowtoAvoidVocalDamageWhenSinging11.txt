, Watch the conductor for tempo, dynamics, etc.
 When asked for a pianissimo, find your own pianissimo. If you can't become soft enough for the group without vocal tension, lay own on that part and come back in subtly when the volume increases. Same with small voices, don't push harder than is healthy when asked for fortissimo. Sing "your" fortissimo., If you have natural vibrato and want to sing in a straight-tone group, seek the help of a capable teacher to learn how to sing with a simpler tone. You may, however, want to seek out a group that uses a style you produce more easily.

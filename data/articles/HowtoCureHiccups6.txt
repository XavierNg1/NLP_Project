 A number of prescription medications can be used for treatment of hiccups. These include:


Chlorpromazine (marketed under the name Thorazine) - This is the one of the most widely-used medications for hiccups, and it is suitable for short-term therapy.
Metoclopramide (marketed under the name Reglan) - This is a drug most commonly used to help the stomach empty, but it works for hiccups as well.
Baclofen - This is a muscle relaxant which can treat hiccups.
Other less commonly used drugs include anti-seizure medications, amitriptyline, stimulants, and anti-arrythmic drugs.

Two days is nothing. Charles Osborne, from the great, great Hawkeye state of Iowa had them for 68 years. He died a year after they went away.Maybe they were keeping him alive?



, For some reason, not chewing our food well enough can lead to hiccups. The theory behind it is that air gets trapped between pieces of the food, gets swallowed, and results in the nasty side effect. Eating more slowly means you'll chew more, eliminating the possibility.


Eating slow can also help your waistline. Hey, that's killing two birds with one stone!, Some scientists (and moms) believe that eating too much and getting the hiccups is the body's way of saying, "Stop! I need time to process." If you find that you often get hiccups after a meal, considering eating less (eating more slowly will help with that, too).


Same goes for drinking. If you drink too much, the esophagus gets irritated and is forced to expand. Neither of those are good things for you or your body. And just like spicy foods, alcohol irritates your esophageal lining, so it's best to keep moderation in mind.

 One of the most common ways of getting Growtokens is by making a mini-game world. Mini-game worlds are exactly what they sound like: a world full of mini-games, usually short park hours.
 Try to use good-looking blocks. Don't use materials like Dirt, as it makes the world look "nooby" and will repel players along with lowering the given rating. Even normal Wood Blocks are good, but the most common material used in these types of worlds are the colored blocks (Black Block, Red Block, Blue Block, etc.). Don't forget to add doors at the end of each mini-game with an ID you can remember., Add items like Spikes, Lava, and other items that harm the player. A good idea is adding a Checkpoint at the start of each mini-game so players don't get annoyed by having to continuously respawn and go back to the mini-game they're playing., Make sure the barrier isn't impossible to get through. Some common barriers include:

A "water fall" where you have to fall down a large strip of water while dodging objects such as Spikes, Sharks, etc.
A "dirt run", a long area made of dirt you have to run through before you reach the prize. This adds time to the Grow token timer. Try not to make it too long, otherwise players might get bored and leave.
A "password door" area is another option. Don't make it an impossible answer; do something simple like 1-10, or ask easy questions like "What's the owner's name?"

, Link the door ID from the end of the prize barrier to a door that leads into a "hallway" where players can jump up and select their prize. Make the prizes worth what they spent their time on; don't have a bunch of cargo shorts in the prize area if you have a 10+-minute dirt run., A broadcast can help. By the end of the day, you might just have a Growtoken, or possibly many!

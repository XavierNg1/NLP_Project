 Confirm that the area is dry, and positioned in an open space.
 Make sure that you empty all of the remaining materials from the previous firing out of the kiln., If you are firing big pieces, separate the shelves more, and if you have smaller pieces you can reduce the distance between each shelf., The cone number used for firing clay, and the cone number for firing glaze is completely different.

Since the firing number varies for different types of ceramic pieces, make sure that if you are firing glazed pieces, only put glazed pieces in the kiln for that round of firing.
 Be very gentle, and lift the middle metal prong, and set the cone across the bottom 2 prongs., If it is not completely covered, the piece may blow up in the kiln., Make sure that you separate each of the ceramic pieces at a safe distance from each other. If there were any air bubbles in a piece, it will blow up in the kiln, and if it is too close to another piece, then both pieces will become destroyed., Make sure that nothing else is plugged into the socket, since the kilns require high voltages. Do not use an extension cord., Keep the temperature on low for the first hour, medium for 2 hours, then turn it to high and wait for the cone to bend on its own, which will turn the kiln off., If you open the kiln too soon, it can crack the pieces.

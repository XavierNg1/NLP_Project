 Even in this case, make them as visual as possible: proper nouns and abstract ideas should be turned into physical objects., Once you know where the presentation will take place, visit the room in advance and try to notice as many details as possible. If it’s a room you already know well, you can just revisit it mentally. However, going there in person will give you an opportunity to focus on extra details you’d never noticed before.
 However, make sure you associate each key point to items that won’t be removed on the day of the presentation.


If there’s a used coffee cup on a desk, don’t bother taking note of it. It will certainly be trashed before your presentation day.
It’s better to go clockwise as you link your key points to each item. This will make it quicker for you to find the next cue as you present., If you have a chance, it’s always better to practice your presentations a couple of times in the actual room. If you can’t do it, just memorize the room on your first visit and then picture it when you’re practicing.
 Even if you have full access to the room, practicing in a different location is always a good exercise. You never know what might happen on the day of the presentation: having a mental picture of it is safe if there are any last-minute changes. For example, if the room is moved, you can use your mental picture of the previous room as a Roman Room. Picture it in your mind as you present and you’ll find all your items there, instead of in the room where you’ve been moved.
 As you deliver your presentation, look for the cues in the room that you've linked with your key points.


Memorizing a presentation will impress your audience and make your performance more engaging.
Remember it’s always safer to still have some notes with you, in case your memory fails you.

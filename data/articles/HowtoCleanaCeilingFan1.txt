 Many vacuums come with a dusting attachment that allows you to affix a brush over the vacuum’s hose, making it easy to dust surfaces without having to worry about scattering dust everywhere. You’ll need a dusting attachment if you choose to vacuum your ceiling fan. If your vacuum doesn’t have one, they can usually be purchased for around $10.For best results, use a dusting attachment that is wide and flat, not circular.;
, Stand slightly off to the side below the ceiling fan and hold the vacuum handle at arm’s length. You may need to be elevated to reach the top of the fan blades if you’re short, have high ceilings or if the dusting attachment on your vacuum doesn’t have a curved structure. Make sure you’re able to move the vacuum hose along the length of the fan blade from where you’re positioned.


If need be, find a crate or step-stool to lift you closer to the fan. When standing on an object for support, be careful that the sweeping motions you make to clean the fan don’t sway you off balance.
 Turn on the vacuum cleaner and begin brushing the fan blades. The brush attachment loosens the settled dust so that the hose can promptly suction it up. Complete a full sweep of each blade, moving the hose slowly in a single direction first, then going back over the blade to catch any dust that you missed.Make each pass with the vacuum smooth and straight, rather than jerky back-and-forth motions, which can send dust flying.
 Even with the vacuum method, you may have knocked some dust off the fan and sent it drifting down below. Make sure there isn’t dust on the floor or on any furniture in the immediate area below the ceiling fan. If there is, this dust can also be vacuumed up, or you can quickly wipe it up by hand.

 Lenders will collect interest for the current month at the closing, so set your closing date for as late in the month as possible to ensure that this amount is low. Closing at the beginning of the month means that you pay for an entire month of interest, but closing at the very end means that you will only pay a small fraction of a months worth of interest.

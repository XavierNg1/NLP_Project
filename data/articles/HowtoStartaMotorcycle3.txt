 You can almost always find this between first and second gear.
 For electronically fuel-injected motorcycles, the engine management system will automatically look after fueling needs whether the engine is hot or cold. There is no choke lever on these motorcycles. Use a small amount of throttle when starting either hot or cold.
 It's usually on the the left-hand side. Many riders choose to also pull in the front brake (on the right handlebar) at the same time.
 This is usually located on the right handlebar, near the bottom of where the hand will naturally rest.
 If the motorcycle does not catch and start, try using the throttle while pressing the start button. Make sure to keep the clutch held all of the way in while doing this.

 If you want a quick fix, or the wood underneath the old finish is clean and scratch-free, you may want to use a chemical stripper instead of sanding down the whole floor. If you choose to use a chemical stripper, always follow the instructions on the label and use proper safety precautions.


Use gloves, goggles, and be sure to ventilate the area you're working in. Chemical strippers are designed to peel off the finish from wood; you don't want it interacting with your skin, and you don't want to inhale too much of it., Don't be timid about applying too much of it. You also don't want to cover too much of an area at once as you will want to be able to clean the area in plenty of time.
 Once you've applied the stripper to the finish, let wait the suggested time without interfering. You will notice the old stain bubbling and lifting from the wood.


Don't wait so long that the stripper dries on you. When you remove the stripper, you want it to still be wet.
 You can do this in two steps:


Hit the area with a putty knife to scrape off the stripper along with the finish.
Use denatured alcohol in a disposable aluminum pan to clean off the remaining stripper with the help of steel wool. Do not put too much denatured alcohol in the pan, as it does tend to quickly evaporate.
 Different chemical strippers will need to be cleaned using different methods. Some strippers need to be cleaned with turpentine or paint remover, while others can simply be rinsed with water.
 Water or moisture and your new finish don't work well together; be sure to allow the area to dry completely before moving on to the next step.
 You may need to sand any problem areas before you apply the new finish to your wood floors.

 Separate the strands of useful length the embroidery thread and thread one strand through an embroidery needle and tie a single knot at the end.;
, This might be the middle of a button, a specific place on a canvas or on a pocket, etc.
 This will be called A, the center of the daisy.



Bring the needle back at A.
Reemerge at a point distant from A (which is the end of the petal, named here as B). The exact distance from A to point B is determined by how large you need to the petal to be. For a button cover, this would be quite confined, while for a pocket, it could be much longer. For the sake of explanation, assume a 4mm/ 1/16th distance from A to B, which will make quite a small petal.
Loop the thread under the needle tip.
Pull the thread through slowly. To anchor the point B stitch, take the needle to back over the loop, at a position just above B. When done, you will have completed the first petal.
Pull the thread through at point B. Then bring it back up under point A again.
 Using the same method as for the first petal, bring up the needle at a new point (C) to make the next petal. This should be an even distance away from the first petal, at the same length. As with the first petal, make a loop, anchor the stitch and bring the needle back to point A.
 This time, follow the same stitching method but come up at a third point (D), again evenly spaced across from C. With three petals in place, you will now have a "Y" shape. Make the loop, anchor and return to point A as for the first petal.
 Space these evenly between petals B & D and C & D to complete the arrangement. Use the same stitching instructions as for the first petal, returning to point A each time.
, The five petal daisy is now completed. If wished, it can be finished off with a French knot to form the middle.

 Washing your hair every day dries it out, since it doesn't give your scalp the chance to produce the oils your hair needs to stay healthy. Try washing it two or three times a week instead.


Style your hair in an updo or with a hat on the last day before you wash it.
Use dry shampoo or a little baking soda around your roots and bangs to absorb your hair's oil.
 Hot water damages hair, but cool or cold water causes the hair shafts to lie flat, giving your hair a shiny, glossy appearance.
 Has a stylist ever asked you if you're a swimmer? Chlorine causes damage that builds up over time. Always wear a cap when you go swimming.


If you go swimming without a cap, make sure to wash out the chlorine with a good natural shampoo.
Don't sit in the sun after swimming without a cap, because the sun's rays will compound the damage done by chlorine. Wash it out before you sunbathe.
 Like other parts of your body, hair is affected by what you eat and drink. Get plenty of water, vitamins and essential nutrients.


Omega-3 fatty acids are good for hair and skin. Eat salmon, walnuts, flax seeds, and other sources of this beneficial fatty acid.
Eating spinach, kale, carrots, and avocados improve the health of your hair.

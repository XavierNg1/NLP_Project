 Washing your face with water, then apply a little moisturizer all over your face and let it sink in. Don't apply too much as it won't ever sink in and you can't put make-up over the top.;
, Primer gives your makeup a smooth surface to glide over, but it isn't necessary. If you want to use it, apply it like the moisturizer - all over the face. Leave this for a minute and make sure that your skin is only a little dewy before continuing to apply more makeup.
 You may also want to put it around the nostrils and in the corner of your eyes. Make sure that the concealer matches your skin tone.
 You can apply this with a foundation brush, a makeup sponge, or with your hands. Using a foundation brush is recommended as it gives an even finish. Apply all over the face and make sure that it is blended in (so it doesn't look streaky). Again, the foundation should be the same colour as your skin tone.
 Applied on brow bones, eyelids and cheeks most commonly, it will make you look pale and elegant, like Bella.
 Take a powder brush and put a little on it. Get a paper towel and tap the excess powder off of the brush before you sweep it around the face. Only use in places where it's too shiny as we still want a bit of a natural dewy effect to look like Bella. Be sure to apply a little over the eyelids to make them nude, clear and matte.
 Use sweeping movements up to lengthen and curl your lashes. Dark brown or black mascara is preferred.
 Work with the direction of the hair to make it look as natural as possible. Make sure to choose a colour that is as close as possible to the colour of your eyebrows.
 Go for a neutral coloured lip balm such as light pink, or nude for daytime. Go for slightly darker colours for night like berry colours. Finish with some clear gloss over top.

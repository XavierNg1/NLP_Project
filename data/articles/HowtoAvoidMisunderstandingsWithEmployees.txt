Avoid misunderstandings with employees by holding regular staff meetings and encouraging employees to address questions or concerns. Make these meetings neutral and friendly so employees feel comfortable voicing their opinions and clearing up any misunderstandings. Hold separate meetings for employee-related topics and business-related topics so employees don't feel their needs are being overshadowed by business deadlines or goals.



Avoid employee misunderstandings by letting them know they can come to you and discuss issues or concerns they have without repercussions. If employees feel you will listen with an open mind and treat them with respect, they will be more likely to come to you with problems or areas of confusion.
, Gossip and rumors can lead to misinformation between employees and distrust for one another. Discourage this behavior when it happens and encourage employees to support one another and keep lines of communication open between everyone.



Outline the job description and expectations for each staff position. Review these guidelines when hiring new staff members and provide them with a hard copy for future reference. If employees have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, there will be fewer misunderstandings about job responsibilities, quotas or workplace expectations.



Reference your company's employee handbook and encourage employees to familiarize themselves with it so they understand company policies and procedures. The handbook should clarify regulations and guidelines for employees, preventing misunderstandings about the basics of their jobs.



Avoid employee misunderstandings by posting any new policies or changes to current guidelines where all employees can read them. A public posting or email will make this information universally accessible to all employees.



Show each employee the same amount of respect and concern. If you bestow extra attention upon an individual employee, other employees could misunderstand this behavior as favoritism, which will cause them to distrust you and that employee. Treat each employee professionally and courteously so the level of communication is equal between everyone in the workplace.

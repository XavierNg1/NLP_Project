 Turn on your oven and get it heated to about 450ºF (230ºC).
 Heat 1 tablespoon of olive, canola, or other vegetable oil in a cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan on your burner, over high heat.
 Place your steak in the hot pan once it begins to smoke. Reduce heat and sear on each side for 4 minutes, until brown, for rare. For medium rare, sear for 1 minute longer and for medium 2 minutes longer.
 Remove the skillet from the burner and transfer it to the preheated oven and roast for 6-8 minutes.
 Remove the steak from the oven if it is charred to your liking. Use a small sharp knife, to make a small cut in the middle of the steak. If it looks done, allow it to sit for 10-15 minutes as this allows the flavors to mix and settle. If not, roast for another 1-2 minutes. Allow it to sit for about 10 minutes as this allows the flavors to mix and settle. Serve whole or sliced.

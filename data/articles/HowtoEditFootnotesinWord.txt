 There are two different ways to do this:

Double-click the document's name to open it in Word.
Open Word (you’ll find it in the Windows menu under “Microsoft Office” or the Applications folder on a Mac), click File, click Open, then double-click the file.;
, An icon that looks like a tag will appear., Now you’ll see an editable version of your footnote., You can click anywhere in the footnote to insert the cursor, then insert text, backspace, and/or delete as desired.

While you’re in this mode, you can also highlight words to add colors and text styles.
 This takes you out of the footnote editor. Your footnote is now updated.

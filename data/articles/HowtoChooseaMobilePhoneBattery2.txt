 For devices that don't have easily-interchangeable batteries (e.g., iPhones), you may need to purchase a new charger to combat falling battery life.


While you can send an iPhone in for a battery replacement, to do so is often expensive if your battery is no longer under warranty., If you're trying to use a three-year-old charger for a six-month-old Android, for example, you'll notice a decline in battery charge speed.
 While many chargers can be used for several generations of phone, knowing your phone's exact make and model can help you pinpoint a newer charger.


Knowing your device's serial number will also help narrow your search.
 You'll want to find chargers stocked by your manufacturer; any chargers from third-party sources are liable to cause damage or perform inadequately.


Amazon and Overstock are great places to look for chargers.
 While online purchasing is convenient, stores are less likely to accidentally stock inventory from third-party manufacturers than online retailers.


For example, an iPhone user might go to one of Apple's store locations in order to buy a new charger.
 If your charger fails to perform adequately, you'll be able to return it for a replacement or a refund.

 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is Spider-Man with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 On the main screen, tap the corresponding buttons for the game you’d like to play. Equip the Spider-men slots with your choices by tapping on the slots to the right of the screen.


Tap the “Start” button on the bottom right corner of the screen to start the game.
 When the game ends—usually this happens when you bump into something, fall off the building, or get hit by laser—you will be given around three seconds to resume from where you left off. A “Continue” button will appear. If you’d like to resume with your current score from where you died, quickly tap the “Continue” button.


The first Continue costs 1 ISO-8.
 When the game ends again after your first “Continue,” you’re given the option to resume once more. A “Continue” button will appear. Quickly tap on it.


The second Continue costs 2 ISO-8.
 When the game ends again after your second Continue, you’re given the option to resume for one last time. A “Continue” button will appear. Quickly tap on it.


The third and last Continue costs 3 ISO-8.

 Expect the conditions for beta testing to vary from company to company and project to project. Some may rely totally on telecommuting, while others may require you to report via phone or even in person. The timeline for one project may be much shorter than the next, and may even change mid-project.Some companies may offer monetary payment, while others may compensate you instead with a discount on the finished product.Consider whether these conditions are an acceptable use of your time before applying.;
, Expect companies to be more picky with the people they choose to test hardware. Improve your odds by focusing on products and/or specific brands that you are already familiar with. Increase your value in their eyes by offering some experience with their existing products and/or similar hardware.For example:


If you are a gaming fiend, focus your search on companies that design consoles and attendant gear.
If every device that you own is made by Apple, target them.
 If your focus is on a particular type of hardware, rather than a brand, widen your search. Write down companies whose products you already own or know of. Search online to find others that have slipped your mind or escaped your attention.


For example, if you want to test new mobile phones, develop a list that starts with Apple, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, LG, and Nokia.
Be aware that some companies may expect you to test whatever type of hardware they send you, and not just your preferred piece of tech., Research each company that interests you, even if you have little to no experience with their products. Remember that companies are always looking to expand and reach new customers who may have never used such hardware before. Expect them to value your status as “beginner” just as much as long-time users with lots of technological know-how.

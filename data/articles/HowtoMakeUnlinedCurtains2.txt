 In order to know where to measure your fabric, you need to know from how high you will be hanging it.


To give the illusion of high ceilings, hang the curtain rod as near to the ceiling as you can, or a foot or more above the top of your window.
If you want your curtains to puddle on the floor, measure them 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) longer than the total length from the curtain rod to the floor.
 Depending on what appearance you are looking for, the width of the fabric may differ.


If you want your panels to completely cover your window, each should measure the width of half the window plus two inches. For example, if your window is 48 inches (121.9 cm) wide, then each panel should be 24 inches (61.0 cm) plus an extra two each, 26 inches (66.0 cm) for each.
If your panels are only ornamental, measure them to be 1/4 of the total width of the window.
 You will want it to measure about half an inch in on every side. You will create the hem by folding the edge of the fabric over, thus giving a clean edge to the curtain.
 The tape should meet the edge of where the hem will begin, so that you can fold the edge of the fabric over and use the iron-tape to secure the folded section.
 Make sure your fold is straight, and hem the edge with the tape in between. Iron over the folded top so that the heat can cause the tape to stick to the two pieces.
 If necessary, apply extra ironing tape at the corners to get them to stick.
 Evenly space them along the top of the curtain to allow for even draping.
 Slide the clip-on rings over the curtain rod and adjust the hang to meet your aesthetic preferences. Enjoy!

 To perform this, sit on the floor with one leg extended in front of you, and the other one drawn up with the knee bend and your foot flat on the floor. Reach forward with both your arms to touch the toes (or reach past the toes) on your extended foot. Keep your leg straight with no bend in the knee, and hold it for 5-10 seconds. Repeat this several times on both legs.
 This is performed similar to a push-up and builds abdominal strength and endurance. Lay on your stomach, and then lift yourself up using your toes and your forearms, keeping your entire body straight as a board. Hold this for at least 15 seconds to start, and gradually add on time.
 You can do this a multitude of ways, but the easiest is to stand and lift one foot off the ground at a time, rolling your ankle in small circles in each direction., Pull your shoulders back and down. Make you neck long, and keep your chin parallel to the floor. You must only squeeze the inner-upper parts of your arms so they stay directly by your side, with your hands in the shape of fists. Your legs should be straight with locked knees. You should always be on your toes, and even if a leg in the air, all toes on both feet should be points. Also, your feet must be pointed outwards. It is a hard concept to grasp, but after a while of dancing it will be second nature to dance with your feet turned outwards. Try walking around home, school, work, etc, with your feet turned out for a half hour everyday. It will train your feet, telling them that they need to stick out. Another way to teach your feet to turn out is to go ice skating. When you skate, your feet have to be turned out to accelerate. Pay close attention to your feet next time you go ice skating

 Aside from providing clean, easy-to-breathe air, salt lamps can also help you feel energized throughout the day. In order to receive these benefits, however, you’ll likely need multiple salt lamps.Have you ever felt refreshed during a visit to the beach, standing next to a waterfall, or simply in the shower? Each of these expose you to negative ions that are effectively the same as those generated by Himalayan salt lamps.
The shift won’t be immediate, but you’ll likely feel more energized about a week after installing lamps in the rooms where you spend a lot of your day.
 Especially if you store electronics in your living room, it’s worth featuring salt lamps as well. Since large electronics in particular emit plenty of positive ions, it can be beneficial to place salt lamps right next to computers or televisions.If you work in an environment that will allow it, place a salt lamp near your work computer as well.
 One of the most advantageous locations to place a salt lamp is your bedroom. This is in part because concentrations of positive ions can diminish your quality of sleep. The negative ions dispersed by your salt lamp, however, can help remove these positive ions and encourage oxygen supply to your brain.If the light emitted by the candle keeps you up, consider placing the lamp outside of your line of sight. You can also leave the candle on during the day to filter the air, and turn it off during the night.
 The air in your home is probably especially dirty and positively charged during the winter months. This is largely because closed windows means air is circulating much less than it does when it’s warm out.Not only can salt lamps be especially useful in cleaning indoor winter air, they can also help prevent you from getting sick from the cold and flu viruses that are also more common during the chillier months.

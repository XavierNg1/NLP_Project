 After the smudge sticks have dried, now they are ready to burn. Holding the stick at the base, use a match or lighter to ignite the top end of the smudge stick.

Allow the sage to catch fire for a moment, and then carefully blow out the flame. Let the stick smolder and white smoke will start to travel upwards. Hold the sage over an ashtray or bowl to catch any fallen debris. Traditionally a shell is used for this purpose.
 Gently wave the smoke from the smudge stick around the room where you want to clear the energy. The smoke will remove any negative energy left behind and leave a nice fragrance in the room. The same process can be done on a person. Slowly moving the smoldering sage around the personâ€™s feet, limbs and head to help cleanse the energy around them., Press the smudge stick down to stifle the smoke completely. Try to avoid using water to put out the smudge stick because this can damage the stick for future use. Never leave burning sage unattended.

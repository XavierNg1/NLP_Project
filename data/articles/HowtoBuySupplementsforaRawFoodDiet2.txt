 Vitamin B-12 is essential for the health of your central nervous system and red blood cell health. Individuals deficient in B-12 may suffer from anemia, depression, dementia, or a serious problem with the nervous system.


Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in meat and dairy products. If you include milk, cheese, eggs, and occasional sources of animal meat proteins in your diet, you will be significantly less likely to become deficient in vitamin B-12 or to need a supplement.
 Because raw food diets can be low in other essential nutrients, such as calcium and vitamin D, taking a multi-vitamin formulated for your sex and age may be an easy way to ensure that you are not missing certain nutrients primarily found in animal products.
 Over-the-counter niacin supplements can help raise levels of healthy cholesterol in the blood, but prescription supplements have fewer side effects and better contributions on HDL levels than store-bought supplements.


If you prefer to raise your HDL levels through food products, consider eating more healthy fats. Nuts and plant-based oils, such as olive or flaxseed oils, can also help raise HDL levels without supplements.
 Iron pills should only be used until healthy blood levels of iron are achieved. Afterward, it is preferable to consume sufficient iron through leafy green vegetables.
 Eat a variety of colors and types of foods every day.


Consider adding cooked foods or certain animal products to your diet a few times each week to prevent deficiencies in B-12 and HDL cholesterol. A varied diet and the inclusion of some cooked and animal-based foods make a raw food diet more sustainable over the long term.

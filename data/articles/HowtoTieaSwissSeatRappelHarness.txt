 Place the fold in the center of your lower back, ends out to either side of your body so that you're holding an equal length in each hand.;
, Pull one side under the other to make a half hitch. Repeat so that the rope turns twice around itself. This will eventually be where the carabiner is placed and it keeps the rope from pinching down on your testicles (if you have them). Drop both of the free ends so that they dangle in front of you (probably touching the ground).
 Pass each free end up through the portion of the rope wrapped around your waist. The free ends should now be between your body and your 'belt'.


Place the free ends over your shoulders so that the ends are dangling down in front of your chest, one on each side.
 This is an important step as this is what will tighten your harness. Stand up and squat several times while pulling on the free ends. You should feel it squeeze you between your legs â€“ make sure key parts are not between the rope and your leg.
 This binds the seat in place. Pull the free end towards your front, along your hips.
 Most right-handed people will place the square knot by their front left hip.
 Note that the half hitch must pass around both 'belts' of rope that now exist.
 Make sure that the rope is in a place that it won't interfere with your carabiner during a rappel.
 Now attach your carabiner and happy rappelling.

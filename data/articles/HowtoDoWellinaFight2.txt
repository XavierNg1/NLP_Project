 The best way to avoid getting hit is by avoiding a fight entirely. Try to calm the guy down. Swallow your pride and apologize if you unknowingly did something that offended your attacker. While apologizing or calming the guy down, try to keep a look of confidence about you. Confidence can be intimidating.
 Don't look away even for a second--the one moment you look away may be the moment that he decides to go in for a punch. Instead, follow his movements with your eyes. Use your peripheral vision to keep track of where you are in the space that you are fighting in--you wouldn't want to trip over something.
 If he has to stretch to hit you, chances are he won't take that challenge. Instead, keep a bit of space between you and your opponent so that you can determine when you want to go in for a punch. By controlling the distance between you, you can begin to control the fight.
 Whether or not you are the one who instigated this fight, you will have to participate if it is in self-defense. An important part of avoiding getting hit is staying as alert as possible during the fight. Do not let yourself get distracted.
 You may be able to win the fight without ever having to throw a punch (or taking one). Simply keep moving, forcing your opponent to really work to keep up with you. Chances are, if you are really determined, you will wear your opponent out before he has a chance to attack.
 If you can't get out of the fight and it doesn't seem like your opponent is going to let up, you might consider going on the attack. This could be a punch or, if you are defending yourself, an end-it move like a kick or knee to the groin.
 Whether this means tiring your opponent out, going in for a big hit, or simply walking away, you will need to end the fight. Assess your situation and choose the best option.

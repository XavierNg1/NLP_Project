 You’ll need one that fits around the front of your teeth and goes around the back. The best kinds to use are the small rubber bands used for tiny braids. You can find these at drugstores and beauty supply stores., You’ll need to snap one earring back on for each tooth that is visible when you smile. Put them all onto the rubber band facing the same way. The flat part of the butterfly back will be against your tooth, with the bumps facing outwards. These will look like the brackets of braces., Be careful to stretch the band gently so that it doesn’t snap. Once the rubber band is looped around all of your upper teeth, you can adjust the butterfly backs. Slide each one until it’s centered over each tooth.The butterfly backs can cause gum irritation and scratches to your teeth, so make sure you only wear these for short spurts of time. Take your fake braces off when you’re eating and sleeping.

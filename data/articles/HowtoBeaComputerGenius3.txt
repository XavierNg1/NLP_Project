 Once you have nailed the basics, venture into advanced territory. Knowing how to code separates the computer geniuses from the casual users. Research what different programming languages do and select one to study.


Get a book on the language. Starting with a beginner’s book will build a great foundation for your advanced study
Look into classes that provide hands-on coding experience. You will have to pay for some of the more prestigious courses available through coding academies, but you’ll find the occasional free class through Coursera and Khan Academy., Getting one computer on the Internet is simple, but what about configuring an entire network of computers? Challenge yourself to learn different ways to connect computers to the Internet, share files across systems, and set up firewalls.
 Knowing how to set things up is a great start, but protecting your handiwork from security threats is a whole new world. Research things like Denial of Service attacks, code vulnerabilities, database hacks, and worm viruses to prepare yourself for what’s possible.
 Having a community of computer geniuses (or those who are still in the aspirational stage) will give you the opportunity to ask and answer questions, as well as learn about new technology that might interest you.


Research local meetup groups in your area.
Discover chatrooms and forums full of computer users that are accessible 24/7.
 Becoming a computer genius will not happen overnight. It takes hard work, dedication, sharp problem-solving skills, and a genuine passion for information.


Technology is always evolving, so you will need to to stay current. The information you know now may be obsolete next year. Read computer magazines, follow popular computing blogs, and stay familiar with the latest in software technology.
Upgrade to the newest operating systems when they are released.
Join beta-testing groups for various operating systems and apps so you can be among the first to get hands-on experience.

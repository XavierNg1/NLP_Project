 You won't be able to style your hair after applying the chalk, so it's best to get that done before you apply the chalk.
, Since the chalk absorbs better when the hair is wet, start by getting your hair wet in sections. Dyeing your whole hair is going to take a while, so only wet a section of the hair you'll be working with — one section at a time.
 Do this is the same way you would while highlighting. Again, the more chalk you rub into your hair, the more intense the color of the dye is going to be.
 Wet a section with water and rub a piece of wet chalk into it — lightly for a transparent color, firmly and repeatedly for a darker, more vibrant color. If you want some ideas of which colors to use, consider the following:









Try a rainbow effect using 4 or 5 different colors, arranged in a gradient.
Try some neon colors in lighter hair for a vibrant effect.
Try segmenting your hair into two portions and dyeing one portion one color, and the other portion another color.

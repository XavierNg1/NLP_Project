 Rinse the peppadews under running water, using your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt or debris.


Completely dry the peppadews with clean paper towels before continuing.;
, Pack the whole peppadews in a thick resealable plastic bag labeled for freezer use. Leave little to no headspace.


Label the bag using a permanent marker. List the contents (peppadews) and the current date. Doing so allows you to keep track of how long your peppadews have been in storage.
 Place the bagged peppadews in your freezer. Store them for up to 8 months.


It is recommended that you keep your freezer at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or below., When you are ready to use the peppadews, remove the stems and seeds before thawing them. If you plan to cut them up, you should do that before thawing them, too.Peppadews are easier to cut while they are still frozen.
To seed the peppadews, begin by cutting off the stem end and slicing the pepper in half lengthwise. Run a spoon or gloved finger down each half to brush the seeds away.
Note that peppadews lose some of their crunch after being frozen and thawed, so keep that in mind when you choose this preservation method.

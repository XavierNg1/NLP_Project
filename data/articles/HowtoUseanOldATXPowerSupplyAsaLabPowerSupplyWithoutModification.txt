, Create a circuit map to follow so to avoid confusion.


Remember that there will be a difference between older and newer ATX PSUs. Older PSUs will mainly utilize the 3.3V and 5V rails, with excess current being handled by the 12V rail. Newer versions will use the 12V rail as their main output.
, The color guide is as follows:


Black: Ground






Orange: +3.3V






Red: +5V






Yellow: +12V






Blue: -12V






Green: Power On






Purple: +5V Standby






Gray: Power Good






Brown: +3.3V Sense






White: -5V (Old PSUs only)







, (Remember to label these so you which is which.
,






Use a current limiting resistor as you connect the green LED between 'Ground' and one of the positive outputs of the power supply (i.e. +12V for the newer models, +5V for older)






Use a current limiting resistor as you connect the red LED between 'Ground' and '+5V Standby'







, Isolate these resistors then connect them to your ground and positive output wires.
 Make sure there are no unexpected connections, and that the proper connections are made.

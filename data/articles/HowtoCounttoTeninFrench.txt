 It might take a while to memorize all the numbers.
The first number is un. It is pronounced like someone has punched you in the stomach. "euh!"



 


Two is deux. It's pronounced like the letter "d" as in d-og or d-ance. Not pronounced like Dee. Stretch out that "euh" part so it's like "deuh".






Three is trois. If you can't pronounce French R`s, this may be tricky for you. It's pronounced t- (French r) -wah. Because the r isn't that noticeable, it sounds more like "twah"






Four is quatre. Another French R here. It`s pronounced c-a-t(French R, but a small, not-as-noticeable-one.). Because the r isn't as noticeable, it sounds like "cat".





;
, Move to the next numbers:
Five is cinq. This is an easy one. It's pronounced like "sank". Yet again, try to say it with a French accent, and it's perfect!






Six is six. Though it's pronounced differently. In French, "six" is pronounced "seece" - s-ee-ce. Say it fast, but not so fast that it sounds like you're rushing to get the word over with. Basically, it shouldn't be pronounced slow so it sounds like "seas"






Seven is sept. It's pronounced "set". Yet again, with a French accent on i i, just say "set". Like "I set" something on the table.






Eight is huit. It's pronounced similarly to "sweet" without the s; also similar to "wheat". The tricky part is saying the French "U". If you can, find a video of someone pronouncing the French "U". Try to say this with a French accent.






Nine is neuf. It's pronounced like n-euh-f. The "F" at the end is short.






And, finally, ten! Ten is dix. It's pronounced (similar to six) like "deece". d-ee-s.

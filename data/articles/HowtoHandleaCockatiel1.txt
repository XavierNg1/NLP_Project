Loud noises coming from you can scare the bird.;
, When preparing to hold your pet bird, you should remove all other animals from the area that could be a risk to it. In most cases, this means keeping dogs and cats out of the room while you hold your cockatiel. This will help to assure that the bird does not get scared while you are holding it and that it does not get attacked while it is outside of its cage.

If your bird is used to your other pets, and they show no interest in your cockatiel, then you may be able to keep them in the same room while handling your cockatiel.

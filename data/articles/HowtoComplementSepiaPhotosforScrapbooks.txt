 Good tones that match sepia well include whites and creams. Try to get scrapbook backing paper in these tones as they will set off the photos well.;
, Sepia colour splashes that work well include maroon, forest green and deep blues. It is important, however, to choose one or two alternative colours at the most, to avoid over-colouring and removing the suggestion of antique elegance.
 When laying out your photos in the scrapbook, avoid overwhelming the pages of the scrapbook with differing colours; rather, keep it simple and elegant by sticking with one colour theme and even then, only use it moderately.
 If you are trying to capture the old world elegance, Victoriana floral emblems and similar designs are likely to be ideal additions, provided that they are not over-coloured. Small ribbons can also work well, giving an authentic old time touch.
 Once you have chosen a pattern for paper or decorative additions, stick with it for the entire scrapbook; in doing so, you will create the simple elegance of an antique-style scrapbook.

 If you can afford your current medical expenses without touching the money in your HSA, that leaves more tax-deferred money in the HSA that you can potentially invest.Keep in mind that just because you can use your HSA to pay for medical expenses not covered by your health insurance doesn't mean it's required. If your expenses are low, it may be better to simply pay them out-of-pocket and leave the money in your HSA alone.
If you do have to tap into your HSA on occasion, you still should try to pay as much out-of-pocket as you can to make the most of the tax benefits by allowing the money in your HSA to grow over the long term.
 Although you typically earn interest (tax free) on the money in your HSA, you can earn even more and make the most of your account by investing in a mutual fund or other brokerage account.Most HSA administrators have investment options available, at least after your account is funded up to a certain level. However, administrators typically don't invest your money automatically â€“ you have to ask them to do it.
There should be information about the investment options available in the handbook or introductory materials you received regarding your account,. You also may be able to find further information on the administrator's website.
 Some HSA administrators require a specific minimum balance before you can tap into the investment options they have available. There also may be additional options available as your balance increases.With some administrators, fees are lowered or waived depending on the balance you maintain in your account.
 If you're shopping around for an HSA with investment options, find the one that best meets your financial needs and has the lowest possible fees.Look for accounts that offer mutual funds or other long-term investment options, rather than active brokerage accounts, which typically have higher fees.

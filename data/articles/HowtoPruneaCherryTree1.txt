 Using dirty, dull pruning shears to make cuts on a tree leaves it prone to disease. Make a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water. Dip your shears in the solution and rinse them off with hot water. Once your shears are sterilized, dry them off with a clean towel. It might take a few extra minutes, but it's worth it to ensure your tree won't be harmed by the pruning process.
Make sure your shears are sharp, so that they don't damage the wood on your cherry tree.
Sterilize your pruning shears every time you prune your tree.;
, Before you prune the tree, measure it with measuring tape or a yardstick to see if it's tall enough. If the sapling is short, wait until it's well over 30 inches (76.2 cm) before inches before heading it. Waiting until the tree is more established before you cut the top will ensure that the cut won't weaken the tree., Cutting the top of the tree is called heading. Use your sharpened shears to cut the tree with your to 24 to 36 inches (61.0 to 91.4 cm) in height, on a 45-degree angle. Heading the tree will reduce the potential for disease and rot. Do this within the first year or two of planting the tree so you can control the shape the tree takes as it grows.If you wait until spring, the tree will have developed buds and the energy that went into bud formation gets wasted.
Making the cut before buds have formed allows the tree to use that energy to produce healthy branches.

 Note that your dog needs to be at least two years old. This when dogs are considered to have reached adulthood., Now you will have an estimate of your dog's age in dog years.For example, if your dog is 10 years old, then his age in dogs years is 53.
 Because this method does not take your dog's size into consideration, it cannot be completely accurate.


This calculation will be more accurate for smaller dogs than larger dogs. For example, as we calculated above, when factoring in size, a Great Dane at 10 years old is 80 in dog years, whereas this method would calculate his age in dog years to be 53.
However, this method is an easy trick to calculate dog years quickly if you don't know your dog's size or are in a hurry.

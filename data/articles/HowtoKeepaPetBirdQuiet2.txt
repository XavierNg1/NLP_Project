 Some birds feel over-stimulated when exposed to too much sunlight. As a general rule, birds exposed to more than 12 hours of light each day can have elevated hormone levels, aggressive behavior, and increased noise output.Close the curtains in the afternoon to limit sunlight exposure, and put a sheet or cover over your bird's cage when you go to bed.
Make sure there's enough air flow coming in under the sheet you use.
Do not use polyester, as this fabric does not breathe well.
For best light-blocking abilities, use a black cloth.
 Some birds respond to environmental sound with their own sound. If you're watching television or listening to music at home, keep it at a relatively low volume. Once your bird becomes accustomed to a quieter home environment, he may become a calmer, quieter bird.Talk quietly. Birds will often quiet down to hear what you are saying.
Never yell at your bird. Try to avoid talking loudly or excitedly around him as well.
 It's possible that you or someone in your household is moving too quickly around your bird, causing him to feel anxious or over-stimulated. Move slowly around your bird, and encourage everyone else in your household to do the same.If you have children living at home, teach them not to run through the room your bird is in.
Never let children handle your bird without strict supervision.
Teach everyone in your household to handle the bird gently, and to avoid quick or jarring movements around him.
 A bird will notice subtle differences in how his owner looks and acts. It's possible that your bird is distressed by the sight of certain new physical characteristics of you or your family.Seemingly minor changes like wearing a hat, wearing certain types of eyewear, or even wearing certain colors can upset your bird.
Avoid wearing whatever upsets your bird, or expose him to it slowly and gradually so he becomes used to it.

 For the silkiest hair, it's good to rinse the dirt and grime out at the end of each day to keep your hair clean and smooth. Using clean fresh water to rinse your hair will help to keep the healthy effects of the natural oils, and will make it easier for them to replenish. It's not necessary to shampoo your hair daily, and doing so will dry your hair out in time.

If you can't take a whole shower, combing a wet comb through your hair, or even rinsing your hair in the sink can be a perfectly effective way of keeping it clean. If you do take showers daily, you don't need to shampoo every time.
 In general, it’s best not to wash your hair more than once every three days. Depending on how oily your hair is naturally, you may need to shampoo more or less often. For some people, once a week is sufficient to keep hair clean, lustrous, and healthy, while others may want to shampoo as often as every other day.


Use shampoo sparingly, no more than a small pea-sized amount. Wet your hands and create a lather in your hands before massaging it into your hair, focusing on the tips of your hair and working in toward your scalp. Massage gently and rinse thoroughly with warm water.
If you don’t use any heat treatments (like straightening or blow-drying your hair) and your hair is not dry, you may be able to wash your hair every day.
 Some people elect to condition their hair more regularly than shampooing, perhaps choosing to shampoo once a week and condition the hair three times throughout the week to keep the hair feeling silky, depending on the health of the hair and the oiliness. Use the same technique as when you wash with shampoo, then rinse thoroughly with warm water.

It's very important to get all the shampoo and conditioner out of your hair every time you wash. If you have longer hair, it's somewhat difficult to get it all rinsed out, which can make your hair gunky and sticky when it dries and forms a residue.
 After rinsing, shampooing, or conditioning your hair, you need to dry it with a towel as much as possible, then let it dry on its own in the air. Drying your hair gently and slowly will help it stay strong and healthy, creating a silky shine.

Avoid using blow dryers that involve directly heating your hair, which has a tendency to dry hair out and make it bristly. Don't heat-dry your hair.
 A few times a week, after using shampoo, it's a good idea to use one of the natural hair balms described above to comb gently into your hair. Coconut oil and other types of natural oil can be scooped onto a fine-tooth plastic comb and combed directly into the hair, or can be massaged into the follicles with the hands, then combed out for the same effect.

Avoid adding hair oil more than once or twice a week, or you can weight your hair down unnaturally and attract more dirt, making it difficult to keep clean. Use hair oil or tonic sparingly.

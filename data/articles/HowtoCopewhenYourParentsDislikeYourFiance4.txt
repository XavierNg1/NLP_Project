 Don’t try to ignore or deny the problems caused by your parents’ dislike for your fiancé. If anything, use it as added motivation to strengthen the relationship you have with your partner. Communicate openly and often about your feelings and concerns, listen attentively, and seek support and solutions from each other.For instance: “You’ve probably noticed I’ve been feeling down about my parents’ refusal to accept you. Can we talk a bit about it and see if we can come up with any ideas?”

, Your parents’ negative attitude will weigh on you, but it will also impact your partner. They will likely feel some amount of guilt for causing this rupture between you and your parents. Be clear with your fiancé that you don’t blame them and that you support and love them just the way they are.


Watch signs that your partner is stressed, sad, or feels guilty about the issue, and also be mindful of the signals you are putting out. Are you acting like your fiancé’s partly to blame even if you keep saying “It’s not your fault”? Talk and listen openly and honestly., Family disapproval can destroy romantic relationships by sowing seeds of doubt or distrust. If you truly want your forthcoming marriage to succeed, don’t be afraid to seek out professional help in working through the problems caused by your parents’ dislike for your fiancé. Being determined to make a relationship work is a sign of strength, not weakness.


Talking with a therapist can help reduce the stress created by the unpleasant reality of your parents’ disapproval. You can also engage in stress-reduction strategies with your fiancé by doing things together like exercising, meditating, trying yoga or deep breathing, or taking up relaxing hobbies.
The therapist will use their judgment on whether to include your parents in a session or two. Sometimes an outsider can connect with parents better in this kind of situation.

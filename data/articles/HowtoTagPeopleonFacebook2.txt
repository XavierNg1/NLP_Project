 Tagging someone in a text post is similar to the tagging process for photos, but even quicker. As you start to type your friend's name, a list of matches will automatically drop down. Proper spelling and capitalization count here — mistakes can make it so that your friend doesn't show up in the list.You can do this for both status updates and comments. The process is the same for both.
 Click on your friend's name from the list to make a tag. His or her name will appear in your post highlighted in blue to show that this person has been tagged.
 One nice thing about text posts is that, unlike photos, they let you tag Facebook pages and groups as well as people. In this case, Facebook won't detect that you're trying to make a tag automatically, so start by typing the @ symbol, then type the name of your group, like this: @Star Wars.Click the page you want from the list that drops down.


You don't have to like a page or be a member of a group to tag these things in your text posts. However, pages and groups you are connected to will show up at the top of the list.
 You can have as many tags per post as you want. Repeat the steps above to add each new tag.
 If you want to, you can type a message along with your tags, or you can post your tags alone — it's up to you. Either way, your post won't be "posted" until you press enter or click the "Post" button.


One common way to use tags is to incorporate them seamlessly into your message, like this (italic text signifies a tag):



"Having a great time with Jane Smith at @Davenport Beach."




You can also just put the tags at the beginning or the end of your message — this is also common. See below:



"Having a great time. Jane Smith @Davenport Beach"




Finally, you can just post the tags by themselves without a message.

 Be honest with yourself about what happened to you and how it impacted your life. Don’t try to ignore your past or sweep the abuse under the rug. To heal and reconcile with your parent, you’ll have to acknowledge the abuse and work through your memories.You may feel all kinds of emotions bubbling up when you think about the past, and that’s okay. Don’t judge yourself for what you’re feeling.
 Take a deep breath and commit to living as well as you can in the here and now. Make up your mind to salvage what you can of your relationship with your parent, even though they hurt you in the past. Don’t waste your energy dwelling on things that neither you nor your parent can change., Connect with your parent in small ways to improve your relationship with them. Keep your interactions at a level you’re comfortable with. For instance, you could have a fifteen-minute phone call with them every week, or you could invite them out to lunch now and then.


If your parent isn’t willing to accept that they were in the wrong for hurting you, you may not be able to interact with them in a positive way.
You’re not obligated to see your parent if they’re still abusive towards you. Remember that you can’t fix the relationship by yourself.
Keep your expectations reasonable. An occasional visit with your parent won’t make up for years of abuse. However, it will give you a foundation for a more positive relationship in the future.
 Unfortunately, many abusers continue to use the same tactics all their lives. Don’t be disappointed if your parent slips back into old habits or refuses to admit they did anything wrong. You can’t make them change, but at least you’ll know you did your best.

 Bleach is great for sanitizing all kinds of kitchen items, but always wash the items first. Use regular dishwashing detergent and hot water. Scrub the items thoroughly to remove all food residue from them. Rinse the dishes after you wash them., Drain the hot soapy water from the sink. If you have an empty one gallon jug, fill this a couple of times to fill the sink. If you know about how much water your sink can hold, go ahead and run the water straight into the sink. You’ll want to use two to three gallons., Use a much weaker solution for items that come into contact with food than you would for other surfaces. One or two teaspoons (5-10 ml) to one tablespoon (14.8 ml) per gallon (3.8 L) of water is the best ratio., Place the already-washed dishes into the bleach and water solution. Let them soak for at least two minutes so the bleach has time to sanitize and kill any germs that remain on the items., Never put dishes, glasses, or utensils back in the drawer or cabinet while they are still wet. Leave the items to sit and let the remaining water and bleach evaporate off of them. There’s no need to rinse after the soak.

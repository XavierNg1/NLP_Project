 A quiet confidence (humble, yet proud of yourself) will endear people to you. Imagine a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being downtrodden and 10 being cocky arrogance. A 5, smack in the middle, is a safe bet. But even then, don't be shy about projecting toward a 7 or 8 to keep people from taking you for granted.
 Smiling is a great mood enhancer. You'll feel better and everyone around you will feel better too. It's also a great way to show the world that you are good natured and indefatigable. A smile tells people that nothing can get you down.

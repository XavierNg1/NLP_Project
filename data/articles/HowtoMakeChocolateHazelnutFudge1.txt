 Place a large sheet of aluminum foil into an 8-inch (20 cm) square pan. Press the foil against the bottom and sides of the pan. The foil should come up and over the edges of the pan. You'll also need to get out 3/4 of a cup (115 g) of hazelnuts and chop them coarsely. Set them aside while you prepare the rest of the fudge.You'll use the excess foil to lift the finished fudge up and out of the pan.;
, Open a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk. Spoon it into a heavy saucepan and add 13-ounces (368 g) of chocolate hazelnut spread. Stir the mixture constantly and cook it over medium heat. Once it starts bubbling, turn off the heat and remove the pan.Heating the sweetened condensed milk and chocolate hazelnut spread will help the sugar breakdown and make the fudge smooth.
 Add the chopped hazelnuts and 1 cup (175 g) of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the pan with the sweetened condensed milk and chocolate hazelnut spread. Stir the fudge mixture until the chocolate chips melt.For a sweeter fudge, you could use white chocolate chips. Or for a peanut butter hazelnut fudge, use peanut butter chips.
 Pour the chocolate hazelnut fudge into the prepared pan and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon or a spatula. Wait a few minutes and sprinkle the fudge with 1 teaspoon of coarse sea salt. Refrigerate the fudge for 2 hours so it sets up and becomes firm. Cut the fudge into 64 1-inch (2.5 cm) squares.For an extra decorative touch, you could sprinkle colored sugar or extra chopped hazelnuts over the fudge before it sets up.

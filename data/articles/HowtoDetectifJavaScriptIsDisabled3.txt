 Begin by typing "about:config" into your Firefox address bar, and press â†µ Enter. A warning prompt will appear, at which point you should click "I'll be careful, I promise!" button.
 You'll find it listed under the "Preference Name" heading. To find it more quickly, perform a query for "javascript" in the provided "Search" bar (not the address bar in which you typed "about:config").
 If JavaScript has been disabled, it should say "False" in the "Value" column next to "javascript.enabled." If it instead says "True" and you wish to disable JavaScript, simply right-click on "javascript.enabled" and select the "Toggle" option. The "Status" column will then say "User set," and the "Value" column should say "False." Close the "about:config" tab when finished.

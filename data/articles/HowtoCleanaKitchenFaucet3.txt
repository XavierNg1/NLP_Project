 Most faucets have a small removable filter at the end. Wrap it in a towel so that it does not get scratched up. Then use a wrench to turn it counterclockwise and loosen it. Once it is loose, you can finish unscrewing it with your hand.
 There should be several components of the filter. Take it apart, observing how the parts fit together. You will need to remember how to put it back together before reinstalling it.
 Run the filter through warm water. Use a tooth brush to get in the hard to reach spots and remove build up.








Alternatively, you can put a pin through the holes in the filter to remove build-up in the small holes.
 Put white vinegar on the stove and heat it to a near boil. Let it sit for about an hour and then rinse it off after it cools.








This step should only be necessary if you see a red build-up on the faucet.
 Put the filter back together as it had been. Use your hand to turn it clockwise and tighten it. Then, use a rag and wrench to tighten it back up.

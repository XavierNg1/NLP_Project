 You should observe the horse during physical training and notice if it struggles during any movements or tricks. If your horse has difficulties with certain movements, this may be a sign that it is not as strong in certain muscle areas as it could be, and this could lead to fatigue. You should try to include more training that uses muscles on your horse that appear weak or underdeveloped.If you are not already doing physical training with your horse, you should do so, as physical training can help your horse get used to exercising its muscles. This can help to combat fatigue later on.;
, You should pay attention to how the horse feels after a long training session. Place your hand on your horse and feel if it is very hot the touch. This is a sign it may be overheating due to physical strain and needs to be cooled down. You may then dump buckets of cold water on the horse, scrape it off with a sponge, and then reapply it again.You should also notice this issue when your horse does intensive physical activity, such as endurance racing or hunting. Horses tend to get more fatigued after doing these kinds of activities and you should do your best to cool the horse down so it does not get overheated and overtired., Most horses do well with a 10 minute warm up session before you start any physical training with them. A warmed up horse will perform better during physical training and be less likely to develop fatigue. If you do not warm up your horse before training, this may be a contributing factor to the horseâ€™s fatigue.Try to get in the habit of warming up your horse before training with a 10 minute trot around the stable or the grounds. Doing this could prevent fatigue.

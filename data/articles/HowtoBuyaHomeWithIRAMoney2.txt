 If open for at least 5 years, you will avoid taxes on any earnings withdrawn. However, you can withdraw contributions at any time without paying taxes or penalties. Contributions are the funds you deposit into a Roth IRA, while earnings are the funds gained from investments or interest. , There is no restriction on how much of your contributions (funds deposited into to a Roth IRA) can be withdrawn without paying taxes or penalties. However, any earnings (funds gained through interest or investments) you withdraw are subject to a $10,000 limit, and will be penalized unless are a first-time home buyer (as defined above). You might want to withdraw Roth IRA contributions to avoid restrictions. But in some cases it is better to withdraw earnings under the first-time home buyer exemption. That way your contributions can continue to generate interest.
If you exceed the $10,000 limit on earnings withdrawals, you have to pay income tax on the amount over $10,000. However, you are not charged an additional 10% fee by the IRS., If you only withdraw from your contributions, there is no need to buy your home within 120 days. However, this time-restriction still applies if you draw on earnings.Remember that a Roth IRA is only available to people whose annual income is below a certain level ($116,000 for an individual in 2015). If you believe that your income will grow above this level over time, it may be wise to use your Roth IRA to buy a home sooner than later.

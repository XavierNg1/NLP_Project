 Locate the app’s icon on your home screen or app drawer, and tap on it to open.


If you don’t have Seen yet, you can download it for free on Google Play.
 Use your Facebook credentials on the fields provided to log into Seen.


Your friend with whom you wish to video chat with should also have Seen on his/her device, though it is not necessary that he/she has the device open at the time of your call.
 Once you login, the welcome screen will display a list of your Facebook friends who are using Seen and are available for video chat. Swipe across the list to locate the contact you wish to make the video call to. Tap on the name of the friend, and a pop-up will open asking you to choose how you would like to chat with the contact.
 Select “Video” from the options in the pop-up. Seen will make your call, and if your friend accepts your call, you will see him or her on the screen. Otherwise, a message will be displayed on the screen notifying you that your call has failed.


To end a call, tap the red phone icon.

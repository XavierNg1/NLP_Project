 When we argue with people, there tends to be a lack of thoughtfulness and overall awareness going on, both of ourselves and the other person. Mindfulness can help you stay centered in your experience and non-judgmentally aware of the situation. This will help you gain clarity and freedom to choose how you respond.


Acknowledge your thoughts and emotional state. View thoughts from the perspective of an interested observer, without "buying into" them. Name your emotions without judging them. A single word description can be useful to get a handle on them. If you feel yourself getting worked up over what the person is saying, pay attention to the sensation of your breath flowing through your nostrils.For example, if you start to feel yourself get irritated while the person is talking, take a moment to say "I'm feeling irritated" silently to yourself. This will help you stay in touch with your feelings.
Emotionally distance yourself from the moment by putting it into perspective. For instance, youâ€™ve probably had to deal with criticism in the past and were able to work through feelings of hurt. You could also remember that in the grand scheme of things, this one criticism is a very short experience from which you can grow.;

You can also use this while you are receiving criticism, such as being disciplined by a parent, in order to help you deal with it more effectively and less defensively.
 If you're able to get away from the argument for a little while, which is advisable, take that time to get your body moving.Aerobic exercise like jogging will provide mental benefits in areas ranging from stress and anxiety to self-esteem.

As an example, you can say: May I be free from danger. May I be happy. May I be free from suffering. May my mind be healed. May I make friends with my body. May I dwell in peace. May I be at ease.

Repeat this mantra with the other person in mind, replacing "I" with the person's name.
You can alter this mantra for the situation, such as replacing "danger" with "hurt," "suffering" with "personal harm," and "healed" with "conflict-free."

, Acknowledging your experience of feeling hurt is the first step toward responding more carefully and with less ego involved. Rumination stems from failing to recognize our experience; like an open wound, we return to the feeling of hurt again and again until it's given the attention it needs.The words of a friend, family, or co-worker can hurt, and you shouldn't pretend that everything is okay if it isn't.

 You can use "negative assertions" if the person has a genuine point about your behavior and you want to let them know that you agree with the specific criticism, without allowing the criticism to define you as a person.Admitting fault doesn't have to reflect on you as a person, especially if you recognize the behavior is negative and have a desire to change.


Example: If you are frequently late to meetings, you can say yes, I've been late to a lot of meetings recently. I'm sorry about that. I'll try to be on time from now on.

 Be generous about the other person's intent. They may actually want to offer constructive criticism and help you do a better job in the future.

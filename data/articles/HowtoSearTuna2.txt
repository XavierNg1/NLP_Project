 Making a marinade is easy. All you need to do is mix ingredients and seasonings that you like. The recipe above will make you a delicious soy-orange marinade, but you can easily make your own. A few guiding rules for making your marinade are below:Marinades almost always contain at least one fat and one acid. The fat is generally oil, while the acid can be vinegar, citrus juice, wine, or another acidic ingredient.
In addition to this, most marinades have a few other ingredients to give the meat added flavor or aroma. These include herbs, spices, sugar, salt, pepper, and more.
In the example marinade recipe above, the orange and lemon juices are the acidic ingredients, the olive oil is the fat, and everything else is for flavor.
 Once you've made your marinade, transfer it to a sturdy plastic bag. Put your steaks in the bag, massage them so that they get well-coated with the marinade, and set the bag in the fridge. Leave it here for at least half an hour and as long as 24. The longer you let the fish marinate, the stronger the flavor will be.


You can double-bag your marinade if you're worried about spills.
 Heat a pan on the stove, adding oil when it's hot. Remove the steaks from the marinade. Shake off excess moisture. Sear the steaks at high heat for 1-2 minutes per side or as needed â€” just like you normally would.
 As you cook the meat, you can add flavor by basting the meat with a little extra marinade. When you flip the meat, the marinade gets caught between the fish and the pan, searing and caramelizing.


Since the marinade contains the juice of the uncooked meat, for sanitation reasons, make sure you never add marinade to the top side of the meat right before serving it. You want the marinade you add to touch the hot pan so any germs in it can be killed. If you do add marinade to the top side of the tuna, flip it and cook briefly before serving.

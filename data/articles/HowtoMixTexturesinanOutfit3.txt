 To create a classic look while using varying textures, aim to keep the textures within the same color family. Neutrals like black, blue, grey, and beige can subdue an unexpected combination, and colors within the same family can unify the look. Your look will have visual interest while appearing curated and thoughtfully planned.Try pairing a gray tweed blazer with a gray cable-knit sweater for an effortlessly sharp look.
Pair light blue linen pants with a light-washed denim jacket for an easy look for summer nights.
Leather or pleather pants in a neutral color can keep an outfit edgy while toning down a fur vest or a fringe sweater.
 If you are wearing too many textures at once, your look may seem a bit haphazard and jarring. Avoid this problem by mixing in simple, everyday fabrics like leather, cotton, or linen. A plain belt, a cotton t-shirt, minimal jewelry, or a neutral coat can help keep the focus on the outfit and not on the individual pieces., Opt for mixing fun, tactical pieces with interesting patterns, too. Certain patterns, like a geometric or floral print, may appear to have a texture or three-dimensionality of their own. Experiment by mixing your favorite patterns and textures to create a unique look that is all your own.

Corduroy pants and a plaid button-down shirt can create a dapper and casual outfit.
 Put the finishing touches on your outfit with accessories that are made out of unique or trendy fabrics and textures. Suede boots or an oversized pleather clutch can bring attention to a simple dress, while a canvas messenger bag or backpack can spruce up a chambray button-down shirt.

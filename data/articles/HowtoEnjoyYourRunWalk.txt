 Scientists have proved that when you are listening to music while doing some form of physical exercise, you tend to move to the beat of the song. Choose a song to suit your mood and what you are doing, because you don't want to listen to some slow dance song while you are running. The best songs are those with a very upbeat rhythm.;
, You'll have much more fun, and you might even have a race which will be fun and make you more active. You could also have deep intense conversations and because exercising releases endorphins (something that makes you happy), you won't feel sad while talking about something bothering you.
 You may think, how is this fun? But at least you'll have that pressure off your back and you can relax when you finish exercising and go home.
 Just shout out random stuff or start doing a weird dance while running-if you are alone you'll have tons of giggles, and if you just pass somebody doing something random you'll love the confused look that they'll have on their face. If you are with a friend and you do this you both will laugh your heads off!

, This may seem 'immature', but if done sparingly, it can be done without getting in trouble and without killing the joke. An appropriate prank could be that prank when you knock on somebodies door and then run away before they can answer the door.
 You can't exercise when you are acting like Negative Nelly.

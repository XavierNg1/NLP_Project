 Before you seal them closed, make sure you press out all of the air from the baggies, or at least as much as you can. Oxygen can lead to loss of flavor and faster spoilage. Once the bags are air-free, seal them tightly so that no air is able to get into them.


To be safe, it’s best to wrap the plastic baggies first in aluminum foil and then in moisture-proof freezer paper before placing them into your freezer., This is an alternate way to safely freeze fresh fish without having to seal the pieces in plastic baggies. Place the fish meat directly into a clean, freezer-safe refrigerator container. Fill the container up with water until the water is just covering the fish. Place the container into the freezer.


The frozen block of ice surrounding the fish will prevent oxygen from reaching the flesh., As long as you’ve prepared the fish well in air-tight baggies before storing them in the freezer, most frozen fish will be good for up to twelve months. For the absolute best taste and freshness, consume the fish within the first three months. Keep in mind that lean fish will have a longer shelf life than fatty fish.When you’re ready to cook the fish, thaw the meat by placing it into your refrigerator overnight.
Never thaw fish in a microwave or by setting it out at room temperature.

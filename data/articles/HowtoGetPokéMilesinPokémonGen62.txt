 1000 steps in-game = 1 Poké Mile, so this is the least effective method, although Wonder Trading depends on the distance between you and the other trader, generally you will get 50-150 Poké Miles per Wonder Trade. Since Pokémon eggs take time and steps to hatch, you can get Poké Miles and new Pokémon at the same time!, In Pokémon X and Y, there is a loop around Prism Tower in Lumiose City. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, you can press the up button when going around the island at the Battle Resort, and as long as you hold that button you will go in an infinite loop.

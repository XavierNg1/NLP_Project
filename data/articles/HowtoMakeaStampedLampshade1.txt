 Make your project that much easier by letting someone else make your stamp! Choose from any number of designs, such as geometric (circles, squares, triangles) or themed (Christmas trees, skull-and-crossbones, or jack-o-lanterns). Or buy a letter stamp set so you can spell out your favorite quotes, lyrics, or passages from books!You can find these online or in-store at arts & crafts shops, office supply stores, or even boutiques specializing in stamps.;
, Design your own stamp by tracing your outline on a foam sheet and then cutting it out with scissors or a utility knife. If the sheet is very thin, place a second piece underneath the first when you cut out the design, and then glue the two together with a hot glue gun.Once you have cut out your design, cut a second or third piece of foam that is slightly larger.
Make it square or rectangular, and glue it to your design-piece as backing.
This will give you something to grip so you don’t squeeze the design-piece by accident and ruin your stamp.
 If you want firmer material for your homemade stamp, use a raw potato and cookie cutters. Peel off the skin with a potato peeler. Then slice off a rounded side with a paring knife so you have a nice flat area to use as a stamp. Press your cookie cutter (or any other hard, suitable outline, like the rim of a tin can) into the flat flesh. Then trim away the surrounding flesh from the outline.Once you’re done, place the face of the potato (the area that will be your stamp) onto a paper towel so the moisture is drawn out.
Then place it on a new, dry towel to test for any remaining moisture before you begin stamping.
 Look around for any suitable items with a geometric design, like circles or squares. Remember: you’re going to be dipping it into paint, so only use items that you are willing to part with. These could be anything from:Empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls
Empty cans
Plastic cups

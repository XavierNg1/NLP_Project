 While a bit of unruliness and excess energy is normal for puppies, restlessness can be a symptom of health ailments as well. Monitor your puppy's eating, eliminating, and sleeping patterns to look for any red flags. For instance, if your puppy has not had a bowel movement in over 24 hours, its restlessness is likely due to constipation.To stay organized, keep a journal to track your puppy's health. Note any other irregularities that may occur (e.g. skin irritation).;
, Food allergies are very common in dogs, and often due to a diet of highly processed dog food. If your puppy demonstrates other signs of an allergy (e.g. a lack of appetite, poor weight gain, skin irritations) its restlessness might also be a symptom. Try changing to a better quality pet food (with no preservatives and additives) over the course of several days to avoid shocking your puppy's digestive system, and see if the restlessness subsides.Introduce a bit of the new food in with your puppy's regular food, reducing the regular food accordingly. Over the next few days, increase the portion of the new food until you replace the old food completely.
 If your puppy's restlessness is intense enough to cause concern, bring it to the vet immediately. Unusual or aggressive behaviour can be a sign of serious health ailments like tumors, parasites, or diabetes. A veterinarian will be able to determine if the underlying cause of your puppy's restlessness is a physiological issue, and suggest other options if it isn't (e.g. changes to diet, exercise, and living environment).

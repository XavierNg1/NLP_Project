 Type or copy the row and column labels that you want to use to consolidate Excel data.
 On each worksheet, enter a formula that references the cells that you want to consolidate. In the first cell where you want to include the information, enter a formula such as: =SUM (Department A!B2, Department B!D4, Department C!F8). To consolidate Excel data inclusively from all cells, enter a formula such as: =SUM (Department A:Department C!F8)

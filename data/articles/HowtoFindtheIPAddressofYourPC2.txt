 Almost all routers can be accessed through a web interface where you can see and adjust settings. Open the web interface by entering the router’s IP address into a web browser. Check your router’s documentation for the specific address. The most common router addresses are:


192.168.1.1
192.168.0.1
192.168.2.1

, The location of the external IP address will vary from router to router. Most have it listed in the Internet, Router Status, or WAN (Wide Area Network) Status pages.If you are using a newer Netgear router with the Netgear Genie configuration software, click the Advanced tab to load the Advanced Home section.
 Under the "Internet Port" or "Internet IP Address" section in the Router Status, Internet, or WAN page, your IP address should be listed. The IP address is 4 sets of digits, with up to three digits per set. For example, it might look like 199.27.79.192.


This is the IP address of your router. Any connections made out of your router will have this address.
This IP address is assigned to you by your internet service provider. Most external IP addresses are dynamic, which means they change from time to time. This address can be masked using proxies.

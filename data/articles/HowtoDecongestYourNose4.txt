 Your doctor will take a detailed history of your current symptoms and past medical history as well as any associated symptoms/signs such as fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, etc.


During your exam, your doctor will look at the inside of your nose with a penlight, check your ears for any fluid buildup, touch your cheekbones and/or forehead for sinus tenderness, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes around your neck.
Your doctor may also order blood work to check the number of immune fighting cells present in your body (WBC). If they are elevated, chances are there is an infection or something causing inflammation such as allergies.
Your doctor may refer you to an ENT physician (ear, nose, and throat doctor) for the referral if further expertise or tests are needed.
 Most nasal decongestants can be purchased over the counter without a prescription. Depending on the cause of the congestion, other medications may be needed. For example, sinus infections may require antibiotics to fight bacteria, while asthma and other serious inflammation disorders may require the use of steroids.
 In some cases, congestion may become severe or be accompanied by other serious symptoms. Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following:


Nasal congestion is lasting more than ten days.
You have a high fever, and/or it lasts more than three days.
Your nasal discharge is green and is accompanied by sinus pain (pain around your cheekbones or forehead) or fever. This may be a sign of a bacterial infection.
You have asthma, emphysema, or you are taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as steroids. This may increase the risks of infections.
You have blood in your nasal discharge or a persistent clear discharge after a head injury. The clear fluid or blood may be coming from your brain after a head injury.

 Before you master a legend like Hendrix you must be well acquainted with some basic guitar skills. This will make it easier to go along. Rather you are holding a guitar for the very first time or a seasoned pro. Lessons and practice are always a great way to get started or refreshed on the proper techniques and new technology and advances of this interest or hobby. Different people learn things better in different formats. Some learn better with a book and chart, others learn better with visuals like videos on the web and DVDs. Still others learn better enrolling in a class with an actual instructor. Find the learning format that best suits you.


Make sure the courses or materials you get involved in or purchase for the lessons are relevant and accurate. Some "courses" are actually non-existing and may be scam. Not all up to date books on guitars are really accurate and are just repeats of older books.This also applies to web sites and Youtube videos be careful.
It really doesn't matter if the person on the video is a music legend or not. As long as the music note lessons are correct and the sound is equal to Jimi Hendrix.
Make sure you also get chord charts that are available in many music stores or download them from websites. These are really handy for memorizing chords and notes.
 This will give you basic knowledge of the instrument. An instructor could help too, but Jimi didn't have one (but then again, at first he didn't have a real guitar either). Whenever starting a new craft or interest it's always a great idea to learn the rules and basics first. Once you know the rules you can break and bend them as many artists do after learning them.
 This is how Jimi got his solos. Make sure you learn blues scales to improvise on. Elvis, B.B. King, and Muddy Waters were Jimi's influences. So listen to these and other styles of music as well. It's going to feel frustrating, but if Jimi taught us one thing, it's to never give up.

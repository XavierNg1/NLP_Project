 This method will not delete your account, or even change your Skype account name, but it will remove your name, birth date and other personal information that could be used to track you down in person., When open, log into your Skype account.



On Windows, in the menu bar, click Skype -> Profile -> Edit Your Profile...
On Linux, click your Skype Name and select Edit Profile.
On Mac, click File -> Edit Profile.
 Clear out your name, picture, mood, phone number, and email addresses.
 After you have removed all personal information, there's only that. However, people can still find you and attempt to contact you with that screen name.


Note that you cannot erase your birth date. Simply set it to a meaningless date, as shown above.
Also note that if somebody has accepted your contact request, you cannot remove your account from their contact list. Only the contact can remove you from their list.
 If you are simply abandoning one account and opening another, consider leaving a status message in your About Me section with your new Skype name.


If you're leaving Skype completely, you can leave a message that you are no longer active on Skype.
 If you have been automatically recharging your account, you will need to disable this too to prevent continued billing.


Go to your payment settings and click the "View Settings" link. It should take you directly to the auto-recharge page.
Click the disable auto-recharge link.
 If you have any remaining credits or subscriptions, you can request a refund from Skype.

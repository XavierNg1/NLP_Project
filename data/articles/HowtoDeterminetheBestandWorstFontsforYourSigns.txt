 Some examples of professional and simple fonts:


Garamond
Arial
Times New Roman;
, You may want to use a unique font on your sign to make it stand out. However, if the font is too unique, it may become difficult to read or distract from the sign’s message. Some fonts you may want to avoid:


Corsiva
Crafty
Lobster
This sign would be difficult to read from the road with the unique fonts.
 Beware of giving your fonts too much embellishments, such as making them bold, italicized, or underlined because this can make the sign too difficult to read. However, embellishing one phrase or word can make it stand out.


By bolding the name, “Stein,” the eye is drawn to it.
 It may seem like fun to use different fonts on your sign, but use caution. Too many fonts, for example, can make your sign seem cluttered and detract from your sign’s overall message. Stick to one or maybe two simple fonts.



A good rule is for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of text, you get about 10 feet (3.0 m) of visibility. Consider at what distance you need your sign to be readable. It’s extremely important to make sure your sign can be read from the road. If a driver can’t read your sign, then they won’t become a customer.

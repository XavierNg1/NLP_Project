 Make a bed for it.


If you're getting or making Rainbow Dash, just get a pillow and a blanket for her because she sleeps on Clouds.;
, At first, your pony will feel a little nervous, of course. Wouldn't you, if you were in a strange new place? Tell your pony it's in a good place; try to make it relax.


If your pony is lonely and misses its friends, try to buy or make these friends. That way, your pony will have companions.
 Pick some grass and let it dry out. Then you can give your pony fresh hay.
 Your pony will get sick. It's not much fun to have to clean up pony barf.


If your pony does get sick (for example, if your brother or sister or dog shook it), it will get dizzy. Let your pony lie down and watch television until it feels better.
 If you can't, have your best friend or another person you trust babysit your pony.
 Don't forget to wish it "Sweet dreams!".

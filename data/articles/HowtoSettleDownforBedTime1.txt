If you stop drinking beverages, then it’s less likely that you will need to urinate during the night. , The brain needs time to decompress before it goes into sleep mode. At least an hour before bed, stop doing anything that works your brain too hard. Don’t calculate bills. Thinking about money is stressful, so don’t get your mind all worked up if you want some rest.
If you’re a student, put those textbooks away if you can. Staying up all night cramming for a test is not a great strategy. You might not perform very well if you are exhausted.

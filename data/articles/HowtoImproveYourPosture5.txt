 Not only is good posture recommended simply for good posture's sake, it's also important for more practical safety concerns. Your car's seating and protective systems were designed for people sitting in the seat properly, and can actually have an impact on safety in the event of a collision.









Keep your back against the seat and head rest.
Adjust your seat to maintain a proper distance from the pedals and steering wheel. If you're leaning forward, pointing your toes, or reaching for the wheel, you're too far away. If you are bunched up with your chin on top of the steering wheel, you're too close.
 The head rest should be adjusted so that the middle of your head rests against it. Tilt the head rest as needed, to maintain a distance of no more than four inches (10cm) between the back of your head and the head rest.

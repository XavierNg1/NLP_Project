 Write this number down or type it into your calculator. If you wrote it down, be sure to label it "inches."


Let's follow along with an example problem. If we want to figure out how tall a 70 inch-tall girl is in feet, we'll start by writing down 70 inches.
 You're looking for the number of times that 12 fits inside your number of inches. If it fits exactly into your inches a certain number of times, you'll get a whole number as your answer. If it doesn't fit perfectly into your number of inches, you'll get a decimal, a fraction, or a mixed number.


In our example, dividing 70 inches by 12 gets us 70 / 12 = 5.83. We can also write this as 5 & 10/12 (5 & 5/6) or 5 remainder 10. See below for more information on remainders.
 The answer you just got is the number of feet you were looking for. Label it "feet." If you're doing this for school, you may lose points if you forget the label.


The answer we got was 5.83, so we would write it as 5.83 feet. The girl is 5.83 feet tall.
 Once you have a feet measurement, just multiply by 12 to get back to feet. Since multiplying is basically dividing backwards, you'll end up with your original number of inches.


In our example problem, 5.83 × 12 = 70 inches. This was our original number of inches.
 Inches aren't always written as whole numbers. If you have an inch measurement that's written as a fraction or decimal, use the same process as above. See WikiHow's guides on dividing decimals and dividing fractions if you need help.


Let's use an example problem to show how to do this. We'll figure out how many feet 15.4 inches and 15 & 2/5 inches are. These are the same numbers, just written differently.

Decimal: 15.4 / 12 = 1.28 feet


Fraction: 15 & 2/5 = (75 + 2)/5 = 77/5 inches.



77/5 inches / 12 = 77/5 × 1/12 = 77/60 feet, or 1 & 17/60 feet

 This means respecting the privacy and decisions of your adult child. For instance, even if your child was always present for holidays when they were growing up, they might be less inclined to come home for the holidays as adults, especially if they have their own families to attend to, or if they live far away now.Additionally, do not drop by unannounced if your child does not invite you over to their residence. Not only do you risk wasting your time if they are not home, but you also risk souring their mood if they feel put-upon and inconvenienced by your coming over.
When visiting your child’s residence, do not treat their house as an extension of your house. Obey their rules. For instance, if you do not take your shoes off when entering your house but your child does ask guests to take their shoes off in their house, conform to your child’s rules and take your shoes off when visiting.
If your child still lives with you as an adult, permit them some extra space. For instance, knock before you enter their room.
 Let your adult child know that you will be there for them when they need you. Listen to what they’re going through and offer empathy and understanding. For instance, if your adult child is having a hard time with a relationship, say, “Wow, that sounds like a difficult situation” or “I hope you can work it out.”Providing emotional support primarily requires listening, not problem-solving. Offer advice or material aid only when asked to do so.
 For instance, if your child does not pursue a PhD even though you really want them to, do not continually bring it up or needle them to obtain a PhD. You might see comments like, “You should really get a PhD” or “You might be able to get a better job with a PhD” as helpful suggestions, but your adult child might see them as pestering or nagging. If your adult child says they are not interested in acting on your unsolicited advice, accept their decision., If you contact your children via their preferred mode of communication, they are more likely to respond and reply to you. This might require changing your preferred mode of communication, but if you can make it easier for them to respond to you, you might be able to spend more time with them.

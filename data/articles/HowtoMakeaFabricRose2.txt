 To make a French Pouf rose, you'll need a few feet of fabric, scissors, and a hot glue gun.
 Draw a basic flower shape on a piece of fabric the size that you want our flower to be. It can be as large or small as you'd like, but working with flowers smaller than about two inches across will be difficult. Around 4" will work well. Cut along the line. Then use the first flower shape to trace the same shape on four to nine other pieces of fabric. Cut out all the flower shapes.To draw a flower shape, start with a circle, then draw half circles around the circle. If you want, you can print out and use of the templates provided here http://www.oneprojectcloser.com/make-fabric-flowers-tutorial/.
How many flower shapes of fabric you use depends on how thick the fabric you're using is. Make fewer when using thicker fabric.
 Cut out a small circle of fabric. If you cut your flower shapes around 4" wide, a 2" inch wide circle will do. Place a dot of hot glue in the center of the circle.
 Fold one of the flower shapes in half. Place the edge of the flower on the dot of hot glue so that when the flower is unfolded it is centered on the circle

, For each of the other flower shapes, place another dot of hot glue in the center of the flower, fold the flower shape in half, and place it on the hot glue. Rotate the base slightly in between gluing each flower shape so that the shapes aren't aligned. Stop before you use the last two of your flower shapes.
 For the final two flower shapes, fold them in half, then push the two outer edges inward so that they touch. Do this with both of the last flower shapes. Then glue them to the center of the flower., If your fabric rose is lying a little flat, you can use your fingers to ruffle and wrinkle the petals. That way it looks more flower-like.

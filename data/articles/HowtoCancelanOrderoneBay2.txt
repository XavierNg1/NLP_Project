 If you've received a cancellation request from the buyer, you can process it through "My eBay" so that you don't get any negative marks on your account. You can also cancel any transaction up to 30 days later, but this may result in negative feedback.

You have three days to approve or deny a buyer cancellation request. Buyers who request cancellation in the allotted time cannot leave you negative feedback or a low seller rating.
You can cancel a transaction for up to 30 days after the buyer has paid if you haven't shipped, but this may be considered a defect and result in negative seller performance.
 Find the order the the buyer requested a cancellation for in your recent transactions. Refer to the order number if necessary.

You can only cancel entire orders, not individual items in a multi-item order.
 You'll find this beneath the "Leave feedback" button., This will start the order cancellation process.

You cannot cancel the order if the buyer has started an "Item not received" case or you have started an "Unpaid item" case.
 This will ensure that you don't get a defect mark against your account., If the buyer has already paid, a PayPal window will appear allowing you to refund the money that they paid. You just need to click "Send Refund" and PayPal will handle the rest.

If the buyer paid with a method other than PayPal, you have 10 days to refund them using the original payment method.
 If you've refunded a payment for a canceled order, eBay will credit you your final value fee. This should happen automatically once the buyer confirms receiving the refund. You can use this credit for future listings, but not for purchasing eBay items.

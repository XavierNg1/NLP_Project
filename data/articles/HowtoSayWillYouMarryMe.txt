, If they say yes, hold a little 'me celebration', but do not make it too big, because if the girl says no, your heart will be broken. If they say no, then do not get mad at them. Remain calm, but put on a depressed look, otherwise, if you are too calm, the parents will think that you did not love her.
 Put on your finest suit, or rent a tuxedo. Put deodorant on, shower, put a spritz of citrus body spray on, brush your teeth, wash your face, and shave, if you don't have a beard, and (maybe) get your hair styled. Try not to get anything on your suit. Right before you get there, tuck a plump red rose in your buttonhole.
 Black, in this case, is romantic for ring boxes.
 Hold her hand in your left hand, and open the ring box. Hold the opened ring box in your right hand. Say, (her full name), will you agree to be my wife? or, traditionally, (her full name), will you marry me? When she replies, if she says yes, scoop her up in your arms, laugh playfully, and kiss her. Knock and lead her in. If she says no, do the same thing with the parents. Say, Goodbye, then. Look disappointed, and lead her in. If she says that she needs time to think about it, say I understand. Smile and lead her in her house.
 When you lead her in, smile (sadly, if you were turned down), and wave. Then drive or walk back to your house.

 If your cat is normally playful, active, and generally friendly, reclusiveness could be a sign that your cat is sick. If it starts hanging out under your bed, couch, table, or any other out of reach, unusual place, this could be a sign. Cats are instinctively cautious creatures, even if they might be playfully curious on any given day. If your cat is sick, it will want to reduce his or her vulnerability by hiding from you., If your cat is accustomed to eating at a specific time or normally eats a certain amount of food each day, it may alter this behavior if it’s sick. Check your cat’s food bowl throughout the day to see if it has eaten anything.


If this is the case, try tempting your cat with slight more “exciting” food options. Even consider bringing their food bowl to them. If they are hiding because they don’t feel well, they might not be confident enough to venture out to their normal feeding place. If you place the bowl in their safe zone, they might be more inclined to eat., Many cat illnesses — ranging from colds to more serious diseases or conditions — produce fevers, but may also cause other symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. Check your cat’s litter box area. In some cases, your cat may attempt to bury this. If you have an outdoor cat, try to follow it. Check its resting areas for disturbed dirt if it normally buries its business., This is a tough symptom to identify because cats are notoriously lazy creatures. If your cat refuses to get up when you shake a treat bag, it might be lethargic. If your cat normally likes to follow you from room to room, but remains content sleeping all day in a room away from you, it might be lethargic. If you think your cat shows signs of sluggish behavior, be sure to tell your veterinarian.

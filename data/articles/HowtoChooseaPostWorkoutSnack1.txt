 After determining that your workout is purely muscle based, you need to understand what your muscles need in order to grow both in size, and in strength. Working your muscles involves the breaking down of them.


You need something high in protein in order to let your body repair your muscles.
You need something with electrolytes/salts in order to keep your body from being fatigued.
Aim for plenty of fiber in order to keep you feeling full, and to help with digestion.;
, Proteins can act differently on your body depending on the source. In the end, shoot for thirty to sixty grams of protein for your post workout.


Protein derived from whey is commonly used because it absorbs quickly into the body and is immediately put the use in repairing muscles.
Protein derived from meat is popular in building lean muscle, but is generally considered more expensive and takes longer to digest.
Other proteins can be found in nuts or beans, and can make a great snack. However, these are a bit tougher to make into a post workout as the amount of protein compared to what you may need can be on the low end.
 Now based on these things, make your final selection for a snack to have as your post workout.


Should have 30-60 grams of protein.
Should be quick and easy to eat/drink.
 You want all that protein to be absorbed while your muscles are still healing from your intense strength training or body building.

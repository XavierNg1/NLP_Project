 When a recipeÂ calls for chocolate, ground nuts can replace the flavour chocolate would've provided. Unsalted cashews, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, et cetera can fill the deep void left by chocolate depravity. When measuring, go for equal weights (100g chocolate = 100g almonds).
 Dried fruits such as raisins, cranberries, et cetera can be used instead of chocolate flavour. These also supply some vitamins that chocolate just can`t do. When measuring, go for equal weights (100g chocolate = 100g almonds).
 In recipes where the dish is not cooked, candy can provide the sweetness of chocolate without adding any death-inducing chocolate. While not as healthy as our above options, it can satisfy one's sweet tooth (or teeth) safely.

 Instead of creating check boxes for a person's gender, leave a blank space for their gender so that they can fill in the blank. That way, they aren't limited by a binary system. Many people identify somewhere in between genders, as a completely different gender, or as no gender at all, and leaving the option open is much more inclusive., If you're a medical office, you'll likely need a person's sex rather than gender. Gender is how a person identifies in society, while sex refers to biological sex. Having a question about sex is acceptable, but you should make sure to be inclusive.You could include options such as "male," "female," "intersex," "MtF female," and "FtM male."

, Think about the application or form you're creating. Is it necessary to know the gender of the person? Unless you're a medical office or something similar, it's often not necessary, so consider skipping the questions altogether.If you're asking to know what pronoun to use, just move on to asking what pronoun they prefer.
 It's appropriate to ask the person what pronoun they prefer. If they're filling out a form for you, having a space to ask for a preferred pronoun will help put them more at ease. Just make sure you and other people on the staff make use of that pronoun., In addition, ask the person if they have a name that they prefer that's different from their license. If someone is transitioning to another gender or simply living as another gender, they may or may not have been able to change their license to a new name. However, it's respectful to ask what name they prefer to be used. In addition, this practice allows you to learn everyone's preferred name, even those who just use a nickname because they like it.

 It should be warm enough to cut through and break down the grease. This can come either from a faucet or from a pot of boiling water., There should be enough rice so that it forms a thick layer at the top of the water.

The rice acts as an abrasive and each grain will do its share of scrubbing the sides down, so be sure to add enough to clean the sides thoroughly., The water, soap, and rice should wash over every part of the interior surface. Make sure to swirl the rice so that it comes in contact with the bottle. Do this until every oil streak and bit of grease residue is gone.

Make sure there is enough free space left in the bottle for allow the materials inside to pick up momentum within a few seconds of shaking.
Look at the inside of the bottle after every thirty seconds of shaking to see which spots need the most cleaning, and then alter bottle movements in order to reach those places., Let it air dry afterwards. If there are any streaks of grease still on the inside of the bottle, repeat the process with more detergent and rice.

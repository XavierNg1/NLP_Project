,, You can pick up some great bargains at after holiday sales. Just be sure it is something that will not be outdated by next year.
 If you want to be really efficient, wrap each gift and tag it as they are purchased!

, (Manicure sets, hand lotion, etc make great gifts for co workers, members of professional organizations, etc).
 When you see something great on sale, think of different ways it can be used. Sometimes you can get great deals on sets of things that can be used individually as gifts. (Dessert dishes can be used with greenery as centerpieces, used as candle holders...) Those nice red candy dishes and candle holders from the Valentine's Day sale, could also be used as Christmas or 4th of July decorations or hostess gifts.
 A large tote or cardboard box with a clipboard for your list is ideal. A hall closet or under a bed in the guest room makes it easy to check your list and store your gifts.
 Every gift you can cross off the list throughout the year is one less expense or stress when the holiday rolls around.

 When you're researching different dieting plans, products or even talking to a doctor about diets, ask as many questions as you can. Being well informed will help you choose the best diet for you and the one that is the most safe. Reputable programs and their staff should be able to answer questions regarding safety, efficacy and cost.Ask questions like:


Do I have to purchase special meals or supplements?
What type of weight loss certifications or experience does the staff or founder/creator have?
How much weight does the average person lose?
Does the program include a part to help me maintain my weight loss?
Can you show me any studies about the long-term effectiveness?

, They may temporarily help you lose weight but your goal is to begin a lifestyle change that incorporates healthy eating as a way of life.


Many diet pills and other medications that are sold over the counter are not regulated by the FDA.Always check with your doctor before taking any over the counter medications or supplements.
Remember, a diet can only help you drop your weight for as long as you maintain the plan. Once the diet stops, the weight will slowly sneak right back up on you if you haven’t developed the right habits along the way. This is why it's important to focus on long-term healthy lifestyle changes.
 Your body doesn't need to be "cleansed" or "detoxed" — that's the role of your kidneys and liver.Avoid diets that require you to fast for much of the day or drink "cleansing liquids." The body needs a certain amount of energy to function properly. Healthy food is energy.
Never starve yourself in an attempt to lose weight. Hunger is your body's way of telling you that it needs something.

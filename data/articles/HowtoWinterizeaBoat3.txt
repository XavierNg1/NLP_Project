 Dry storage may ultimately be less expensive than storing your boat in the water, and dry-stored boats are less likely to develop blisters on their hulls. However, dry-stored boats may be more susceptible to damage from sudden freezes than boats stored in the water. Consider your local climate and discuss your options with boating experts in your area., You may wish to rent a climate-controlled storage unit, store your boat in a heated garage on your property, or store your boat in a dry-stacking facility. These options will help protect your boat from the elements, and may be especially important in areas where hurricanes and winter storms are a concern., This is a good idea even if the boat will be stored in a heated garage or another type of storage facility. Your cover should be tight fitting, waterproof, and strong enough to hold up if snow or debris falls on it. Whichever type of cover you choose should be well ventilated to prevent trapped moisture inside your boat.A few popular types of boat coverings are:Shrink wrap. The major downside to shrink wrap is that it can trap moisture and lead to mildew if not properly treated and ventilated.
Custom fabric covers. While the up-front cost of a fabric cover may be high, it can be re-used for many years, and will ultimately cost you less than repeated applications of shrink wrap. Fabric covers also have the advantages of being well-ventilated and easy to remove and replace.
Polyethylene tarps. Tarps are a fairly inexpensive boat covering solution, but the tarp you select should be thick, and must be supported to prevent damage to your boat from accumulation of snow and debris. You may need to build a frame out of wood or PVC pipe that can be fitted over your boat to support the tarp cover.

 You start off each level with 50 sunshine to buy a sunflower, 2 sun mushrooms, or something else. Sunshine will fall out of the sky during day levels, but not night levels, where you will have to rely on sun-making plants.


Each sunshine ray you collect gives you 25 sunshine points. Smaller sunshine rays will give you 15.;
, There are 49 plants in total. Some plants shoot projectiles, some explode, some give you sunshine, and some that protect or modify other plants.
 For example, there are 5 lawnmowers on the path to the house. These will mow down zombies if they get past your plants, but they can only be used once. On pool or roof levels, there are other machines that can act as your last line of defense. These will only be able to be used once, and after that, zombies will be able to invade your home if they get past your plants.


You can also buy a pack of mallets or rakes to knock out zombies with coins--however, these are one time use purchases.

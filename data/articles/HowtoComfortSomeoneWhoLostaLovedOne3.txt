 After the death there is a good possibility that the bereaved will be overwhelmed by people approaching them wanting information. You could offer to post details on social media and to monitor their accounts. You could also reach out to any insurance people ASAP.


Part of this task could also involve keeping track of any necessary paperwork, such as death notices. These documents will often be required by credit card and utility companies if accounts need to be closed.
You could also organize a phone chain if the deceased was well-known and there are a large number of people to be contacted all at once.
 This is a huge area to cover, so there are a variety of ways that you can help. You could sit-in on meetings with the funeral home. This might involve discussing the finances of a funeral or the deceased’s particular requests. You could help to write or publish the obituary. You could write thank-you notes or arrange for donations to be funneled to certain charities.


On the day of the funeral itself, you could be of assistance by acting as an usher or assisting the bereaved person in getting ready. You could also act as a liaison between the bereaved and the funeral director.
 Many people who are bereaved simply don’t have the time, or the desire, to attend to basic chores around the home. Use your cooking talents to whip up a few quick meals, especially anything that could be frozen for later use. Bring over some cleaning items and do a fast clean over the house, paying particular attention to the high-traffic areas. Make sure that you have the bereaved’s permission, of course.
 If the deceased passed without leaving enough funds to cover their expenses, the bereaved person may bear the burden of figuring out how to pay for a funeral. See if you can help by organizing some sort of fundraising drive either online or in person. There are websites, such as GoFundMe, which are specifically designed for these types of purposes.

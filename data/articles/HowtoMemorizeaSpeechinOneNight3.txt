 Although it might seem tempting to stay up all night to prepare for your speech, it probably won’t help you. A lack of sleep increases your stress levels and decreases your ability to focus. Be sure that you get at least eight hours of sleep the night before your speech., It is important to remember to take care of your body even when you are cramming for a presentation. Take some time to take a quick walk. Don’t forget to eat meals and keep yourself hydrated. These steps are equally important in memorizing your speech., Make a list of things that scare you about the speech. Then, try to tackle those fears. If eye contact makes you lose focus, try looking just above your audience’s head. Try giving your speech behind a podium or while holding a microphone to keep your hands busy. Use deep breathing exercises to keep yourself calm before your speech.

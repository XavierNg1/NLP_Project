 Attempting to apply varnish to a painting before it is totally dry will create a mess and possibly ruin your work. Oil paintings should cure for several months before they are ready, while acrylic paintings should be completely dry in 24 hours., Varnish attracts dust and other impurities, so minimize these by vacuuming your workspace beforehand. Avoid sweeping, as this will only stir up more dust.








Close doors and windows to keep additional dust out.
 A wide, flat, and soft brush is ideal for varnishing. To keep impurities out, dedicate a brush solely to varnishing, not painting. Clean it after each use. You will also need some artist-quality varnish (for acrylics or oils, depending on your paints), and a shallow tray to pour the varnish into., Open the container of varnish and stir it gently but thoroughly. Pour a small amount onto your shallow tray. Load your brush by running it through the varnish, then wiping it on the side of the tray.
 Keep your work flat so the varnish does not run. Run your brush in long, even strokes from the top to the bottom of your painting. Proceed from one side to the other. Apply only a thin coat.
 One coat is enough varnish for many paintings. If you would like thicker coverage, let the first dry for 24 hours before applying a second coat. For the second coat, run your brush horizontally rather than vertically, as you did for the first coat. This will provide optimal coverage.








If you missed spots in the first coat, donâ€™t go back over it until it has dried thoroughly.
For a very thick coat, you can add a third coat of varnish after waiting for the second to dry.

 People choose to write their own eulogy for a variety of reasons, such as ensuring accuracy, relieving the burden on their family, or creating a lasting impression of who they are. Knowing your reasons will help you figure out what you want people to remember about you.;
, Think about what is most important to you. Many people will include things like family, their hobbies, and their religion if they have one. Your list will be unique to you and should reflect what’s most important to you.Ask yourself, “What do I want people to say about me after I pass?” You may want them to talk about how well you played the piano, or how many dogs you took in from the local shelter. You may realize that your priorities included sharing music with others and helping animals.
If you’re having trouble figuring out your priorities, consider how much time you spent doing particular activities.
Don’t criticize yourself for not spending as much time on a priority as you would have liked.
 You may have been a parent, spouse, friend, boss, entrepreneur, photographer, teacher, counselor, caregiver, scout leader, musician, or groupie. From your list, choose the roles that you want to be your legacy.Consider how each of your roles fits in with your priorities to help you decide what you want to focus on in your eulogy.
Don’t worry about focusing on too many or too few roles. For example, some people may have focused their lives on encompassing one role, such as parent or entrepreneur. Others, on the other hand, may have moved through various roles at different stages of their lives.
 Think about what you’ll leave behind, whether it’s a large extended family, a thriving business, or the best recipe for cherry pie your town has ever eaten. Write down a few sentences about your contribution to the world, and how you hope it’ll continue.

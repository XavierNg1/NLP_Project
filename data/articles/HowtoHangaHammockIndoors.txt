 Start by deciding what room you want to hang your hammock in. Once you have that in mind you need to think about how long your hammock is. You will need to find 2 opposing points on the walls with no obstructions. If the walls are close enough together you can use two parallel walls otherwise, use two perpendicular ones.

These are just references these spots will not be exactly where you mount your hammock.
Keep in mind that you want to pick two spots at least 4 feet high.;
, To do this you will need to use the stud finder. Sweep the stud finder slowly across the wall until it finds the edge of the stud. Mark the edge.


Your stud finder will beep or light up when it finds a stud.
 Coming from the other direction sweep across the wall until it finds the other edged of the stud. Mark this spot.
 If the two marks on the wall are not 1.5 inches apart you have not found a stud and you should move up the wall and try again.
 Measure 3/4 of an inch in from one of your marks and mark it with an X.


This is the center of your stud.
Repeat the marking process until you have found the center of both studs.
 Using the 1/16-inch drill bit, drill at least two inches straight into the spot you marked on the wall., Using the 1/4-inch drill bit, drill into the pilot hole you just made.


Repeat the drilling and expanding process for both studs you marked.
 Start by using your hand to screw a 5/16 threaded eyelet into the hole.
 Insert the screwdriver through the eye and use it as a lever. This should give you enough leverage to completely screw the eyelet into place.


Do this for both studs.
 The eyelets should now be securely in place and should support as much weight as your hammock typically would.

If you have a hammock with clips on each end, you may simply clip the ends of your hammock to the eyelets.

 If you have a young child who is going to kindergarten or preschool for the first time, it's a good idea to pick out a lunchbox that won’t be too difficult for your child to carry. At the same time, you should make sure that the lunchbox can fit all of the food that you want to send to school with your child.


Check to see if the lunchbox can fit three or four food items, as well as a drink.
Make sure your child can carry the box without difficulty.;
, Some lunchboxes seem like they were made to contain top secret information, rather than your child’s lunch. You should make sure that the lunchbox can be opened easily.


Lunchboxes with zippers work well to contain your child’s food and can also be opened easily. There are also metal lunch boxes that have easy-to-use clips.
 Some lunch boxes come with separate containers or are sectioned off so that you can keep foods from mixing.


This can be helpful if you pack your child something, like applesauce, that might spill.
 If you are planning on packing your child food that needs to be refrigerated, you should get an insulated lunchbox. This will keep perishable food from spoiling.


Some lunchboxes have compartments that are specifically designed to contain either hot or cold food.
 Thermoses can be great for hot or cold beverages. They can also allow you to pack soup for your child, as the thermos should be able to keep the soup hot until lunchtime.


Do not purchase a thermos that is too large, as your child may find that it is difficult to carry it if it weighs a lot.

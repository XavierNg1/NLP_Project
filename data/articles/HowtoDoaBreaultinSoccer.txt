 When an opposing player begins moving in on you, make sure you are in the best position to perform a Breault. If many players are approaching at once, you may have trouble with this move.;
, You must use the stronger foot. If both feet are equal in power, then dribble with whichever foot you prefer.
 Be careful not to bump the ball in this movement, as it may drift too far away from you, be mistaken as a poor pass, or be lost to another player.
 Make sure it moves to the side facing the oncoming player.
 If done correctly, the ball should soar over approaching players and ultimately land within range of the goal.

, Kittens learn pest control from their mothers. By keeping a cat and her kittens, you can train the next generation of mousers and rat catchers.Once the kittens are old enough, you should spay and neuter the entire litter, including the mother. If you do not do this, you may end up having more cats than you bargained for. Either call a Trap-Neuter-Release program or take the cats to a local vet.
 Give your local animal shelter a ring. Ask them if they have any stray or feral cats available for adoption. Typically, these organizations have too many cats to handle. By adopting an indoor/outdoor cat, you can control pests in your home and in outdoor areas surrounding your home, such as chicken coops., Give your indoor/outdoor cats a comfortable place to sleep, as well as food and veterinary care. The cats will reward you by patrolling your house and warding off pesky rodents.

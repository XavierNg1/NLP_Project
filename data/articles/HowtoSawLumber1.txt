 Use a table or sawhorse and align your body over the workpiece.;
, Place your index finger on the side of the handle, pointing down the blade, to serve as a guide.
 Don't use too much pressure.
 Once you're about 1/2 inch (13 mm) into the wood, increase the length of your strokes. Shorten the strokes once more toward the end of the cut.
 When making a square crosscut, place the saw at the edge of the wood, and line up the actual edge of the wood with the reflection of that edge on the saw blade.
 If using your handsaw requires a lot of strain, and it's difficult to make a clean cut, hold the blade up to the light. If the tips of the teeth reflect light, sharpen the saw.

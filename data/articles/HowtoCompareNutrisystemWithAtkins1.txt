 The glycemic index classifies foods that contain carbohydrates based on their impact to your blood sugar. The higher the food on the glycemic index, the higher its impact on your blood sugar levels.;
, Insulin resistance occurs in your body when a normal amount of insulin released by your pancreas no longer has the appropriate impact on your blood sugar levels. Some scientists believe that eating too many refined carbohydrates and sugars will increase insulin resistance in the body. Known risk factors for insulin resistance are obesity and inactivity.
 Low-GI foods, like fruit, vegetables and skim milk raise your blood sugar in a slow and regulated way. These foods may also help to prevent insulin resistance.
 Sugary fruits like bananas and pineapple, along with sweet corn, dried fruit and some ice cream can cause some spikes in your blood sugar.
 White bread, white rice, potatoes and watermelon are examples of high-GI foods. These foods cause significant spikes in blood sugar.
 Diets like NutriSystem claim that insulin resistance makes people overweight. Most scientists agree that being overweight is the cause, not the outcome, of insulin resistance. However, many low-GI foods are also very healthy foods that can assist with weight loss efforts.

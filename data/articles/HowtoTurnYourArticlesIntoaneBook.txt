,, How? One key step is to remove redundancies that occur because each article was originally freestanding.
 A copywriter or editor can easily do this.
 At least one-inch right and left margins because it makes the page easier to read.
 The font size for the text on the page should be at least 11 or 12 points. This is especially true if your ideal clients are over 40 years old. Many people use Arial or Verdana for ebooks since it's easier on the eyes than Times Roman.
 However, you don't want to use the clip art that came with your computer. First that art is for personal, not commercial use. Secondly, you want to look professional and not be thought of as cheap. There are low cost graphics for sale on the Internet for you to use.
 Don't underline titles because people will think that they're supposed to click on them; instead, use bold, color or italics. You can even use special fonts like Tahoma for titles.

 Either way, you will grieve.;
, There will be days when feeding yourself will be too difficult to even contemplate.
 Don't expect to be 'over' it in a few months.
 You can look in your phone book or check it out on the Internet.
 If your loved one died due to a criminal act, keep up to date with the case.
 Again, if your loved one died during a crime, the court system should have an advocate for you. Call your local courthouse and see if they can find one for you.
 Meeting others that are in the same 'boat' as you can relieve the pain a great deal. It is true what they say, 'Misery Loves Company'.

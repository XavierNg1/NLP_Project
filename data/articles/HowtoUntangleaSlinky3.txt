 Once the slinky is in a toy bin, one end of it will start to slip down between toys while the other end will stay on top of the toys. This is a good way for it to start tangling up. Instead, store your slinky on a shelf or in its original box.
 When you throw your slinky onto the ground, it can land with one end meshing into the other end. This will create a tangle. More often than not, it’s very difficult to pull it apart and you’ll need to spend time untangling it.
 When you are not using the slinky, put a ruler or another long, straight object through the middle. This will prevent one end from tangling with the other end.
 Young children are great at tangling up a slinky immediately. Keep the toy out of little hands for optimum slinky performance.

 Don't bother gaffing a fish if you're unsure if you're going to keep it. Gaffing a fish on its side will harm it, and if you throw it back it will most likely die in the water. For this reason, only gaff fish that you know you are going to keep and take home., Unless you're fishing specifically for sharks or barracudas you should avoid gaffing them all together. Many fishermen don't bring these fish on board because of the risk of getting bitten. Instead of gaffing these fish, cut your line and let them have the hook., Gaffing is especially effective for reeling in larger fish. If you are trying to catch fish that are smaller than 50 pounds (22.67 kg) you can use a net to bring them into your boat. Netting smaller fish rather than gaffing will ensure that you're not damaging the fish if you decide to throw it back.

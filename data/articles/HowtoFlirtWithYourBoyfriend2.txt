 When your boyfriend is talking, stop doing other things and give him your full attention. The world is full of distraction, from our own inner preoccupations to the vibration of our mobile phones, but try to put these aside and really listen. Chances are your boyfriend will feel much closer to you if he knows he can confide in you.
 Expressing your feelings every so often might just take his breath away. Leave a note on the fridge ("Bon appetit! I love you!"), slip a hand-written card into his backpack or briefcase, or, if you're digitally inclined, post an e-card on his Facebook wall.


Remember restraint is a key element in flirtation: rather than gushing on and on, try to express your feelings in just a few words or sentences., Being present at times when he's doing something else can be a fun surprise and also give you a slightly new view of your other half. He might get a kick out of the interest you show, and if no one else knows you're together, he gets the benefit of having a beautiful girl batting eyes at him in front of his pals.Use your judgement, however: sometimes it's not appropriate for there to be onlookers, in which case you might be an unwelcome distraction. Discreetly find out if it's okay before suddenly showing up.

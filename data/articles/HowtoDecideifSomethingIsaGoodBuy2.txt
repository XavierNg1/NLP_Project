 Often, things come in bundles, for no extra charge! If you buy something for $19.95, and it comes with like 5 items, then you got a deal!

, Coupons are like gold when it comes to making great deals. They don't cost money and don't take a lot of time. One woman used coupons and shaved off $145 off her grocery shopping.
 They often have great deals on valuable things, like a Babe Ruth baseball for $1.00! These often have people just looking to sell stuff to make room without researching it first.
 An expensive item in mint condition is a good deal. Things are often worth more in good condition then in broken, rusty condition.

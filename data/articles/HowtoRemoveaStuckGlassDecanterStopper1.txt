 Wet a washcloth in hot water and wrap it around the decanter’s neck. This can slightly expand the decanter to release the stopper.


Wait five or ten minutes to allow the heat from the washcloth to transfer to the glass.
Remove the washcloth and gently attempt to remove the stopper. You can tap lightly with a wooden spoon on the sides to loosen it.;
, If possible, allow some hot water to drip in between the stopper and decanter. This should warm and dissolve anything built up between the two.


Try this if the stopper is small and recessed enough into your decanter to allow you access to drip water into the space. If it is not, you can run hot water over the entire area to loosen it.
Gently tap the sides of the stopper with a wooden spoon to loosen it. Do not use a metal spoon or other metal object, as it may break the glass., Fill a sink or other vessel large enough to cover your decanter with water. Allow your decanter to soak in the water for several minutes.


Keep the decanter in the hot water for about 10 minutes. Add more hot water if it becomes cool. You can even let it soak overnight if it doesn’t come loose.Remove the decanter from the water and attempt to remove the stopper. Tap gently with a wooden spoon at the sides of the stopper to loosen it.

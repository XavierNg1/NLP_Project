 Legwarmers can be made from either children-sized or adult-sized knee socks, depending on the size of your baby or toddler. Generally, most babies can wear legwarmers made from children-sized knee socks; whereas most toddlers can wear legwarmers made from adult-sized knee socks.


Shop for knee socks at venues such as major local retail stores, dollar stores, thrift stores, or on retailer websites such as Amazon or eBay.






Choose knee socks with colors that match the clothing in your child's wardrobe.





;
, You will need a pair of scissors, a ruler or measuring tape, thread, and either needles or a sewing machine for sewing the legwarmers.


Buy thread in a color that matches the knee socks, so the thread can blend into the color of the material.
 You will not need the feet portions of the socks to make the legwarmers.


Use scissors to cut the feet parts of the socks off right at the ankle region.






Discard the feet parts of the socks, or set them aside to use as material scraps for other sewing projects.
 The inside of the sock should now be on the outside, so you can prepare for the sewing of the hem.
 You will need to sew or hem the "cut" portion of the sock that was previously attached to the ankle.


Take one knee sock, and fold the "cut" section (the side previously attached to the ankle) over by 1 or 2 inches (2.54 or 5.08 cm). The length you choose may vary depending on the length of your child's legs.






Repeat this procedure for the other knee sock.
 Sewing near the "cut" end of each knee sock will prevent the frayed ends of the material from unraveling later on during wash cycles or during wear.


Thread your sewing needle or sewing machine, then hem or sew around the perimeter of the sock above the cut end of the knee sock that is folded over.



Turn each legwarmer right-side out, then place them on the legs of your baby or toddler.

 Place a sheet of paper (letter size or A4 is best) on a surface that can be cleaned from oil. Oil may spill on this surface so make sure it cannot be damaged if it does spill., Purchase the oil recommended for your paper shredder by the manufacturer. Different shredders will use different oils and will usually sell the oil where you purchased your shredder.


If you are using an old and/or out of warranty paper shredder, you can use canola oil as a substitute rather than purchasing oil. The oil produced by some brands is actually just repackaged canola oil so you can save a little money by using canola oil., Drizzle the oil over the paper in a zigzag pattern on one side of the paper. Try not to saturate the paper or put too much oil or else it can get a little messy.


Make sure the zigzags stretch all the way from side to side to ensure sufficient coverage.
 Shred the oil-covered paper by running it through the machine. As the paper gets shredded the oil will coat the blades, which then redistribute the oil. This keeps the shredder operating smoothly.


Ensure that paper is not creased and damaged or it may cause a malfunction in the machine.
 Pass a few more pieces of paper into the shredder so that they absorb the extra oil left on the blades.

 Adding your favorite flair is what sets your graffiti art apart from the rest. Feet, seraphs, bits and arrows are used to decorate the letters and add balance to the word.









A foot is a blocky piece added to the bottom of a straight line. So if you've got an "E" with a bend in the bottom line, create a joint at the end of the line with a vertical line jutting up.
A seraph is like a foot, but it juts from an upper line instead. On an "E" you'd add a seraph to the end of the top line.
Bits are like blocky dots trailing off the end of a line. You can add them to any letter.
Arrows also trail off the end of lines. A letter like "T" could have an arrow extending from the bottom line or either side of the top line.
 Add a shaded edge to your letters, then sharpen the lines to make the letters look 3-D. You could also approximate a 3-D effect by making the lines thicker and narrower at different places. For example, the top and one side of an "O" might be very thick, while the bottom and other side is narrowed.
 Once your letters are as you want them, you can add additional details if you choose to. Make them personal to your style and interests. Add a lightning bolt for the dot of an "i," or eyes peering out of the holes in your "B." The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.

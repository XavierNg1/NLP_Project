 If you want to use images as a border instead of the built-in line tools, you can insert the images into your document. You can use separate images for each side of the border, or insert a complete border image. There are several ways to do this:


Click the Insert tab and select "Pictures." Browse for the border picture that you want to use.
Click and drag the image file into your document. This will insert it.
Copy an image from a website and paste it into the document.
 This will allow you to change the image position and layering.
 This will ensure that all of the text appears on top of the image file, which is especially useful for images of complete page borders. It also allows you to move the image around without making the text shift.
 You can click and drag your image around until it is in the proper location. Click and drag the boxes on the corners of the image to resize it.
 If you're building the border from multiple image files, repeat the process until all of the images are in the correct place. If you need to mirror an image (for opposing border sides), click the Rotate button in the Format tab and select Flip Horizontal or Vertical.

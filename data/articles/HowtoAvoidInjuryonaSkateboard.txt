 The most common mistake is to over tighten trucks. Loosen them up to the point where when you step on your skateboard it doesn't strain or make squeaky sounds (a spot of synthetic grease on the rubber bushings will improve this). Wiggle each truck to check that the wheels cannot touch the board during hard turns - this will cause a sudden stop. Softer wheels are better for cruising the streets, they give a lot of grip, but will distort on heavy landings. Harder wheels will distort less and create less friction with the ground, allowing more grip between your shoe and the deck, so harder wheels are more popular in mainstream skating.;
, A new skater attempting to switch 360-flip on a half-pipe is begging for an injury. Also, try whatever you like... but always be careful.
, These will come instinctively with time.
 Especially if your brain is still developing.
 This has a tendency to cause long term wrist problems. Try to land on a body part that is most padded.
, This will help prevent broken bones though it's no guarantee.
 Each time you fall on the same body part the risk of serious injury is increased. Always remember this.

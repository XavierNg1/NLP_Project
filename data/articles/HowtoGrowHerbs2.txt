 The best time to start seeds is when temperatures are still cool and the growing season has yet to get underway. This gives the seeds time to sprout and become established; they should be ready for planting when the temperature begins to rise.
 Herb seeds can be started in any type of small container, like an old egg carton, yogurt cups, or containers available for purchase at the nursery. Label the containers so you'll know what seeds you're planting in which. Fill each one with potting soil, then dampen the soil with a bit of water. Place the containers in a sunny area with a steady temperature around 70 degrees. At this early stage the seeds should not get hours of direct sunlight, or they may overheat.


Even if you plan to grow your herbs outdoors, it's easier to start the seeds inside, where you can control the water and temperature.
Most herbs need a humid environment to germinate. If you live in an area where the air is very dry, cover the seed pots lightly with plastic wrap. Don't wrap them too tightly, though - the seeds need air flow to germinate.
 This step helps to get the seeds ready to germinate. Place the seeds in an even layer between two damp paper towels. Let them soak for about 4 hours on the day you are going to plant them., Check the seed packages to determine how each type of herb should be planted. Some just need to be scattered evenly across the surface of the soil, while others won't germinate unless they are buried under the surface. Over the next few weeks, the seeds will germinate and begin to sprout and grow leaves. Keep the temperature and sunlight steady, and make sure the soil never gets the chance to dry out.
 Once the seedlings have grown leaves, you'll need to remove some of them from the pots so that the stronger ones have room to grow. Take out the less developed seedlings and leave about an inch of space between the remaining plants.

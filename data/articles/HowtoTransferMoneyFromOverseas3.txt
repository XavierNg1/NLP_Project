 Don’t confuse them with foreign exchange traders who perform a different service. Foreign exchange (forex) companies complete international currency transfers to individuals and businesses. They transfer the funds from one country to the other and exchange the currency between the two countries. Most forex companies are located in the United Kingdom (U.K.), but some are also located in North America and Asia.Forex companies should only be used for large transactions of over $3,000. The company does not charge a fee; they make money on the exchange rate.Consider OFX, an online forex company that accepts wire transfers from your bank account or you can apply to set up an ACH direct debit. Most transfers take one to two business days and you can track the progress on their app. The fees are minimal — $5 for transfers under $5,000, and no fee for $5,000 or above., If you don’t already have one, open an account with the broker. It may take a day or two to open a new account. Next pay in or transfer money from your bank account to the brokerage account. Give the brokerage the information about the recipient. Research the exchange rate.If you are comfortable with the current exchange rate, then use it to complete the transaction.
 If you need to send a large sum of cash at some point in the future, lock in a favorable rate today with a forward contract. This means that the broker agrees to use a rate upon which you agree today for an exchange that happens in the future. On the date of the exchange, the contract rate is used, not the current exchange rate.You can use this strategy if you think your local currency with weaken before the trade occurs.

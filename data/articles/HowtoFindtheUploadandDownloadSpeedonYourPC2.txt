 There are a variety of speed tests available for free online. These tests usually perform three functions: ping test, download speed test, and upload speed test.
 Speed tests usually give a list of servers nearby to connect to and perform the test. Most tests automatically select the most optimal server for your location.


A close location will give you the best results and the closest transfer rate to your maximum.
You can test your speeds to servers around the world to see how long it would take you to download files from another country.
 Wait a few moments as the test file is sent to your computer. The results will be displayed in Mbps. Compare your actual speed to the advertised speed of your service provider.

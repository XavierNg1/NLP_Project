 You can wash your hair and then blow dry it completely or let it air dry and then style after a few hours. Pour a dime-sized amount of mousse into your palm and rub it between your hands for about 5 seconds. Run it through your hair and then use a brush to distribute the product more evenly.


Mousse will give your hair texture and will help set the curls with the curling iron., Curling it while it is in a ponytail will allow you to style the hair while it is already secured in place. Secure the ponytail at the crown of your head.
 Use a large-barrel curling iron between one and two inches in diameter to curl the ends of your hair. A larger curling iron will give you loose waves and a smaller curling iron will give you tighter curls.Plug in the curling iron and allow it to heat up.
Once the iron is hot, wrap a section of your hair around the barrel.
Hold for ten to fifteen seconds.
Release the section of hair.
Comb through the curls with your fingers. This will loosen the curls and make them look a bit more natural. Wait until the hair has cooled before doing this so that you donâ€™t ruin the curl. The curl will need a minute or two to set after the heat has been applied.
Curl your hair again if necessary for extra curls.
 Spray the curls with some hairspray to ensure that the curls last throughout the day. Add anti-frizz serum or shine spray to give your curls a bit of shine! Be sure to use these products lightly so that you do not weigh down your curls with too much product.

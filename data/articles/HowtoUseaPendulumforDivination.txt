 You might want to buy commercial pendulums, but it is very easy to make a pendulum. You can make a pendulum out of a paperclip, a ring, or a washer. The string or chain should be about 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm), depending on the person.;
, You may stand, but it is easier to sit. Unfold your arms and legs, and rest your elbow on the table. Sit up straight, and get into a calm state. You may meditate if you like.
 Once you are into a proper position, ask it "Show me a Yes, please." Wait patiently. It might take a few seconds, or five minutes. It will begin to swing in a direction, whether it be in a circle or from side to side. This is your yes.
, This includes questions like "Is my name..." or "Am I am Female?" If your name is that, then the pendulum will swing in a yes direction. Same if you were a female.
 Ask it simple questions at first. As you become more advanced, you can begin to ask it personal questions. Some questions that you might consider asking are: Should I work at this job, Is it time to move, Will it rain tomorrow, etc.

 Henna usually turns hair a reddish brown color. If your hair is naturally very dark, this will likely be lighter than your normal shade. However, if your hair is naturally light, henna may actually darken it. Use henna for darker hair and if you want a touch of red., You should make your paste 12 hours before you plan to dye your hair. Mix 3 tablespoons (44.4Â ml) of henna powder with enough boiling water to make a thick, workable paste. You can either use a spoon, a chopstick, or something similar to stir. Place your mixture somewhere safe to let it cool.
 Henna stains skin and clothes, so wear an old long-sleeved shirt and gloves for protection. Spread lotion or cream on your neck and hairline to avoid staining these areas with henna.
 Use gloves when applying henna. Either cover your entire head with henna or just apply it to the strands you want to lighten. Be as thorough as possible, striving to saturate your hair or individuals strands with the henna paste. Cover your head with a plastic shower cap when you're done to keep the henna from drying out too fast.
 After two to three hours have passed, remove the shower cap and apply conditioner to your hair. Rise out the henna and conditioner before shampooing and styling your hair as normal.

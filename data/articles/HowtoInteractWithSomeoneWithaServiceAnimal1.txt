 Service animals accompany people with disabilities and perform some task that aids that person. However, when you encounter someone with a service dog, you should be diligent to treat them with the same respect and dignity that you would another person. If you speak to them, avoid asking questions about their disability or their service animal. Instead, address them with a polite hello and make the same small talk that you would with any other person.;
, In your travels, it is likely that you will come across someone with a service animal. Remember to talk to the handler and avoid engaging the animal. Refrain from asking personal questions about the service animal, such as its name or breed. You should also keep in mind that this person has a service animal because of a disability, so avoid saying insensitive things like “That dog is really nice. I wish I had a service dog.”, If a patron, coworker, or employee brings a service animal into your establishment, you might feel the need to ask questions. Keep in mind that medical privacy comes into play when discussing a service animal. While you are not banned entirely from asking questions, there are only two that you are allowed to ask under federal law:Is the animal a service animal required because of a disability? (You may not ask what disability.)
What has the animal been trained to do?

, Animals are only considered service animals if they perform a specific task that meets the needs of someone who is disabled in some way. That said, it is impolite, and in some cases illegal, to ask a person with a service animal what their disability is. They have the right to medical privacy just like any other person.This includes asking things like “Why do you have a service dog?”

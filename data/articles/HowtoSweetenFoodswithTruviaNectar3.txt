 Before you get started preparing your ingredients or making this recipe, preheat your oven to 400°F (204°C). This is especially important if you have an older model oven that takes a while to preheat. Generally, expect this to take about 10 to 15 minutes., Be sure to wash these ingredients before preparing them. Peel and cube the squash. Halve the Brussel sprouts. Dice the shallot. Then, insert these into a large mixing bowl., Take a small mixing bowl and use a whisk to mix together the olive oil, Truvia Nectar, hot sauce, and all the spices except for the sea salt. Once the ingredients are thoroughly distributed in this mixture, pour it over the top the vegetables in your large mixing bowl.

After adding the sweet and spicy sauce to your vegetables, take a spoon or a similar kitchen implement and toss the veggies until they are evenly coated., Using a wooden spoon, mixing spoon, or a similar kitchen tool, push your veggies from the mixing bowl and onto a baking sheet. Spread the veggies to create an even layer on the sheet, then sprinkle them with coarse sea salt., Insert the baking sheet into your oven. Allow the vegetables to bake for approximately 40 to 45 minutes, or until they start to lightly brown. If you appreciate more crunchiness in your veggies, wait until the veggies begin to char.

About 20 to 25 minutes into your baking, open the oven and use a spoon to stir the veggies. Redistribute them in an even layer, then return them to the oven for the remainder of the baking time., Always use proper handling implements, like oven mitts and potholders, to prevent burns to yourself or heat damage to your kitchen. Allow the baking sheet to cool for about 5 minutes, then sprinkle the veggies with feta crumbles, fresh parsley, and pomegranate seeds.To ensure an even mixture, you may want to transfer the food from the baking sheet to a clean serving bowl and then use a spoon to mix and evenly distribute the food.

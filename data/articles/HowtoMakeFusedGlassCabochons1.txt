 Assemble your glass pieces with the glass cap placed evenly on top of the dichroic, with the dichroic layer facing up. The clear cap needs to be larger than the base as the dichroic layer can sometimes seep out under the clear glass.Be careful when stacking the glasses. Dichroic glass surfaces should not face each other because they do not bond well.
Layer your glass as a gold dichroic (black base), stringers (transparent), ripple (transparent), and cover glass (clear cap).;
, If you’re using a manual kiln, set the temperature to medium for about 15 minutes. Bring up to 1500°F (815°C) per hour and hold for 10 minutes. If using a programmable kiln, ramp your temperature up to 1500°F per hour and hold for 10 minutes. Check that your cabochons have fully fused. If not, let the temperature return to 1500°F and hold for another 5 minutes.Once the glass has fully fused, turn the kiln off and open the door until the temperature reaches 1000°F (540°C). Close the door. Repeat until the temperature is stable at 1000°F.
 Turn the kiln back on and hold at this temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. This is the annealing temperature, which helps reduce the stresses and strains that build up in the glass during fusing.


After annealing the glass, turn the kiln off and wait until the glass is fully cooled before removing.
For programmable kilns, you will be able to include these steps in your firing schedule.
 After the fused glass has cooled, you can use a tile saw, a glass saw, or a ring saw to trim those edges. Use the saw to then cut the fused glass into a variety of different shapes, sizes, and pieces., Rinse the cabochon in water. Place it back into the kiln and fire it at full ramp to a target of 1350 degrees, holding it for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, allow the cabochons to cool completely between several hours to a full day.

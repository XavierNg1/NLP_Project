 A polar coordinate has two values: (r,θ). r is the distance from the center to the point and θ is the the angle between the terminal axis and the line connecting the center and the point.
 r is dependent on θ, meaning that as the equation goes around the center, the distance from the center r changes accordingly.









A circle has the equation r=k, where k is a constant number. This is because no matter the value of theta, the equation is always a set distance from the center. As you may recall that is the definition of a circle; the set of all points equidistant from a single point.

 Accrued dirt on fan blades cause bearings to become worn out, which creates a lot of noise from the fan. Every two weeks you should vacuum the fan with the crevice-cleaning hose attachment. Wipe down the blades with a damp sponge twice a summer.
 Box fans do an amazing job keeping the house cool, but often times also cause a lot of noise. Look for looseness in the fan guards, its housing, and its fan guards.








Wedge a piece of cardboard between the edges of blade guards if they are not firmly attached to the fan and their looseness is causing a rattle.Add a drop of silicone sealant to secure the decorative cap to the front guard of the fan if it is too noisy., Screw the spinner further into place and tighten it if it seems too loose. This will tighten the fan hub to the shaft and simultaneously secure the spinner into place.
 If you notice that the box fan makes noise on level or smooth surfaces instead of on cushioned surfaces, it might be an issue with its base. Pads might be missing so inspect the base of the fan and replace its pads as needed.

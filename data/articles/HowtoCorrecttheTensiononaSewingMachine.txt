 The dial on the front of the machine is to adjust the tension of the top thread. There is a screw in the bobbin housing (under the footplate) to adjust the tension of the bobbin (bottom) thread. Experiment adjusting the tension. When the tension is perfect, the stitch will meet in the middle of the cloth; the stitch looks the same on top as it does on the bottom.;
, If the top thread is lying flat and the bottom thread is coming right through, then the bobbin tension is too loose. Tighten the screw slightly in the bobbin housing (the little metal piece that you put the bobbin into). If the thread is lying flat along the bottom of the fabric and the top thread is going all the way through, then the top tension is too loose. Make sure that the pressure foot is in the lowered position and then adjust the dial slightly at the front of the machine.
 Keep adjusting by small increments. Keep testing until the tension is perfect.

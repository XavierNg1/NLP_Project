 The timpani is alone among percussion instruments in that the standard grip is the French grip. This grip is similar to the matched grip, except that the palms are at right angles to the floor. Studying and using this grip will facilitate quick and graceful changes between each drum with minimal arm movement., Perhaps even more important than playing the correct rhythms on timpani is tuning the drums correctly. Timpani heads are tightened and slackened using foot pedals, and you will need to be able to retune drums silently during a piece of music. This can be done by quietly humming into the drum head - when the drum is tuned to the pitch you are humming, you will hear it resonate back., A major error in novice timpani technique is playing closed-style buzz rolls (like you would on a concert snare drum) or playing double-stroke rolls or "diddles." All rolls and ruffs played on the timpani should be single-stroke, where you alternate your left and right hands evenly., You want a timpani to resonate. If you strike the center you will simply hear a thud in contrast to the full sound the timpani is known to produce. It may seem unimportant but the timpani is an integral part to many classical pieces and needs to be heard.

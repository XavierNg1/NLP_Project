 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cooking oil to the pressure cooker pot and select the "browning" setting.


Give the oil a minute or so to become hot.
 Add the cubed tip sirloin roast to the hot oil in the pressure cooker a little at a time. Cook, stirring frequently, until all sides have browned.


Do not crowd the meat. It would be better to remove some of the beef from the pot as you add more batches to ensure that all the meat is equally browned. When done, place all the browned meat back into the pressure cooker pot.
 Sprinkle the chopped onions over the meat and pour in the beef broth. Stir quickly to mix the ingredients.
 Cover the lid and lock it into place. Select the "high pressure" setting and cook the meat for 15 minutes.


Note that the cook time only refers to the amount of time at which the device is sitting at its cooking pressure. It will also take 15 minutes for the machine to pressure up and another 20 minutes for it to release that pressure.
 In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and water to form a slurry.


This slurry will be used as a thickener for the drippings in the pressure cooker. Without it, you would be unable to form any gravy.
 Stir the flour slurry into the broth and meat in the pressure cooker pot. Select the "browning" setting and let the liquid reach a boil. Continue cooking at a boil for a couple of minutes, or until the liquid thickens to gravy consistency.


When thickened, add a little salt and pepper into the gravy according to your own tastes.
 Spoon out the sirloin tips and gravy into serving dishes filled with hot cooked egg noodles.

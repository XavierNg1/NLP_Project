 Ever wondered how clothing stores get their scarves looking so good when they're on display? With this fold, you'll be able to show off your scarf like it's brand new. To start, lay your scarf completely flat, as above.


For this method, it's also important to straighten out any tassels at either end of the scarf (and to keep them straight throughout the fold) — this makes the fold look a little more professional when it's finished.
 When your scarf is flat, grab one of the long edges and fold it over so that it's in line with the other edge. Your scarf should now look like one long, skinny strip. Try to keep any tassels straight and flat after your fold.
 Next, fold the scarf over itself so that both open edges are in line with each other. To be clear, this is a "hamburger" fold, not a "hotdog" fold — your scarf should get shorter, not skinnier.
 To finish, fold your scarf either back over on itself either once or twice more (depending on how compact you want the finished product to look. Reverse the direction of your fold each time so that the pattern of folds "accordions." When you're done, line the edges of your scarf up so that your tassels hang straight and free past the edge of the fold.


This fold style is handy because, in addition to making your scarf look elegant and attractive, the "accordion-ing" folds make it very easy to pick up and throw on in a hurry.

 In addition to searching for friends manually, you can also make use of a list that Instagram automatically populates with users it believes you may know based on your activity on social networks that you've linked to your Instagram account. To access this list, start by navigating to the same page you used in the methods above to search for friends on Facebook and in your contacts list. See below:


For iOS: Starting on your Profile tab, click the button in the top right that looks like a silver gear. Tap "Find & Invite Friends" on the next page.
For Android: Starting on your Profile tab, click the button in the top right that looks like three vertical dots. Tap "Find Friends" on the next page.
For Windows Phone: Starting on your Profile tab, click the button in the bottom right that looks like three horizontal dots. Tap "Settings," then "Find & Invite Friends."

, On this page, below the options for getting friends from Facebook or your contacts list, you should see a list of Instagram users that you (hopefully) recognize from your connections on other social networks. Scroll down to view the entries in the list â€” below each user's name, you should see a short description of how you know this person (i.e., "Facebook Friend," "Twitter Follower," etc.)


Note that, depending on which version of Instagram you have, you may need to click a button that says "Suggested Users" or "Instagram Suggested" to get to this list.
 Just like in the methods above, you may scroll through the list and add users to the circle of people you're following on Instagram by clicking the "Follow" button next to each name. Users with restrictive privacy settings may need to manually approve your follow request for you to start receiving updates from them.

 Name your world. Decide what world your characters are in. If you're having trouble deciding what to name your world, go to a English-to-Turkish/Latin/French translator, type in a word, and find a nice name. Most names won't be very catchy at first, but will catch on eventually. You will most likely switch names many times. The world in the examples here we will call "Sasirma" the Turkish word for "wonder".;
, Our world has a mix of land masses and islands and water, all including tropical, sub-tropical, desert, tundra, valleys, mountains, swampy and many other types of land.


What are the land masses like? How many major land masses are there? How many islands are there? Is there more water or land?
What types of climate are there? Where is it hot? Where is it cold?

, If you want to create a new type of climate (different from tundra, desert, etc) you must be an extremely talented writer. Decide what the main surroundings will be (grass, sand, etc), decide the heat and what it's like, decide where fresh/salt water is and if it can support large populations.
 What cities are there? What roads are there? Where are the forests/deserts/tundras/etc?

, Our world has a mix of tundras, deserts, tropical, sub-tropical and many other climates. Our world supports billions of humans and animals, and we are 'sophisticated'. What will your world be like? Decide the following:


What species does it support? You may want to create multiple new species or find mythical creatures to add to your world. Do these animals speak?

What is the population of this world? If your animals can speak, are there more humans or animals? Do humans and animals coincide with each other to survive?

, Are there different governments in your world? Where do they occupy? What races and species live there? What government is at war with who?

, Is it simple or sophisticated?

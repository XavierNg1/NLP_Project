 The sound hole should be facing upward. Ensure that the floor around you is free of grates, nooks, or other spots in which your pick could get lost. Also be sure that you've got clearance to move your instrument around without knocking over a nearby object.;
, Finesse is key here. Gently use the guitarâ€™s interior support braces to help slide the pick directly under the sound hole, so it sits over the label inside. Grab a flashlight if the room's lighting isn't enough to get a good look inside.
 If you flip it over quickly enough, inertia will cause the pick to "stick" to the back of the guitar until the sound hole is facing down. The pick will fall in your lap.

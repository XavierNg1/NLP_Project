 Begin doing this hairstyle by brushing your hair, beginning by brushing down at the roots and then work your way up your head, still brushing down. Gently work through any knots until your hair is smooth.








If you donâ€™t normally brush your hair dry, skip brushing and instead run your fingers through your hair to eliminate knots.
This is a hairstyle that is great for most hair lengths, and can even work if you have a short bob!

, Use your fingers to comb the top of your hair back away from your forehead, then separate out the very top section of your hair. Use the highest point of your eyebrows as guides, raking the hair to make a part on each side of your head at the point that lines up with the highest point of your eyebrows. Then hold this section in your non-dominant hand.








The section of hair that you grab from the top of your head should be roughly five inches (12.7 cm) wide.
 Once you separate the section of hair, give the section a quick spray with hairspray. Then tease the section of hair by holding the hair straight up and combing through it backward with a fine toothed comb. If you have bangs, tease them as well.
 Once you tease the hair, hold it back against your head so that it creates a small, volumized bump. If you want a bigger bump, push the hair a couple centimeters forward to make the bump taller. When you are satisfied, pin the bump against the top of your head with bobby pins.
 To give your bump extra hold, give your hair another spritz all over with hairspray, focusing on the bump that you created at the top.

 Make small cards using paper or something sturdier such as cardstock. Cut small squares out and be sure to make each piece the same size. Since this is a memory game, it is important that each card looks the same so you are unable to differentiate one card from the next. , Work in pairs when writing out your review information on these cards. Write down a vocabulary word on the first card in the pair and its definition on the second. Continue writing on your cards until each review item has been covered.


This game words best when reviewing things like definitions, spelling, examples, etc. , Flip over all your cards so that the writing is underneath. Place your cards face down and organize them into rows and columns until every game piece is situated.
 Begin the game by choosing just one card to turn over. Read the definition or vocabulary word and choose one more card to turn over. If you flipped over the correct card, you should have a pair in which both cards are a match.


When first starting out, this game is sheer luck, but after a few tries you will be able to remember where each card lies and can do your best to find its correct match.
 When you have found two cards that are a match, set that pair aside so that your game board becomes smaller. Continue playing until every card has been turned over and you have created matches for each game piece. When you are finished playing, you can simply shuffle your cards and redistribute them to create your game board and play again.

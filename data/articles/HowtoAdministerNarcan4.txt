 If a loved one uses illegal drugs or takes prescription medications inappropriately, try to find out what they take. Ask them outright and let them know you’re concerned about their safety. Narcan can reverse the effects of opiate drugs such as:Heroin
Prescription pain medicine like fentanyl, morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone
Some common brand name medications such as Percocet, OxyContin, Vicodin, Percodan, Tylox, and Demerol

, If you or a loved one suffer from opiate addiction, talk to your doctor about getting Narcan to keep on hand. You may be able to obtain liquid Narcan that can be injected into a vein, muscle, or under the skin, or a nasal spray. You need a prescription to get Narcan in some states but not others.Automatic injection devices (Evzio) are sometimes available. These have voice guidance that can direct you or another on how to use the device. Use it once then throw it away. This is the BEST OPTION if you do not have medical training.You will probably not be able to administer Narcan to yourself if you are overdosing. Friends, family, and loved ones should know how to use the Narcan and where to find it.
 You may not always know what drug someone has overdosed on, or if they’ve used drugs at all. Don’t waste time, but look very quickly for some signs that the victim may have overdosed on opiates. Scan quickly for prescription drug bottles lying around, a morphine or fentanyl patch on their body (remove it!) or visible drug paraphernalia like syringes, spoons, and tourniquets.

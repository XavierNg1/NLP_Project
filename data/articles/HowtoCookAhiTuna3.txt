 Tuna tartare is a dish made with raw ahi tuna. It's a light, refreshing dish that doesn't actually require cooking, but it's one of the most popular ways to prepare the fish. It's important to get sushi-grade tuna if you're using this preparation method, since you won't be cooking the fish to kill parasites and bacteria.


To make four servings of tuna tartare, you need one pound of tuna. Either steaks or fillets will do.
This dish is best with fresh tuna, rather than tuna that has been previously frozen.
 Tuna tartare is prepared with a sauce made from fresh flavors like citrus paired with the deep warmth of wasabi. To make a delicious tartare, combine the following ingredients in a bowl:1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon minced jalapeno
2 teaspoons minced ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons wasabi powder
2 tablespoons lemon juice
Salt and pepper to taste

, Use a sharp knife to cut the tuna into 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) cubes. It's easiest to do this with a knife, but you may use a food processor to save time.
 Mix them together thoroughly so the tuna is completely coated. Serve the tuna tartare right away on crackers or potato chips.


If you don't serve the tuna right away, the lemon juice in the sauce will begin to react with the tuna and change its texture.
If you wish to prepare the tuna tartare in advance, keep the sauce and tuna separate until just before serving.

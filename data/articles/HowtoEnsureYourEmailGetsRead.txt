 If you're sending an email to someone you know, tell them to look out for your email. If they're expecting it, they may see it sooner.

, If you're trying to get someone's attention, make sure the email address appears businesslike. Using a silly username might make someone skip right past your email altogether.
 Although "URGENT!! READ NOW!!" catches your eye, a lot of spam is labeled the very same way. It would be more appropriate to title it something like: "RE: Our Meeting Last Thurs. (3/19 Proposals)" or "First Last name's Resume for XYZ Position". Avoid tacking on all-capitalized words. If it truly is urgent, it doesn't need to be in all capitals, but you can add that onto the end of it.
 Even if they open your email, there's no guarantee they'll read it. Skip the fancy colors and fonts, just make it simple and readable. Break things into paragraphs instead of sending a giant wall of hard-to-read text. Use punctuation to separate your sentences and clarify your ideas.
 First make sure you have their most current and relevant email address. If it's a business matter, use their business contact information. If it's personal, don't clog up their business inbox with your email, send it to their off-the-clock email instead. Doing this will ensure it gets to the right place for a better chance of success.
 The appropriate time span depends on what you're sending and to whom it is being sent. If it's a business matter that has to be dealt with by the end of the day, follow up with the recipient later in the day and ask if they've received your email. If it's a personal matter that might take some time to read and respond to, allow them a couple of days or bring it up when you see/speak to them next. If it's a case of cold-calling (such as sending out resumes and the like), the appropriate follow-up time is often about a week.

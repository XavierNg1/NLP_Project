 It is really important to have clean canvas when you are applying makeup. Use a cleanser to prevent acne. After that, moisturize!;
, Yes, this is important even if you are tan, it delays wrinkles later on in life and prevents skin cancer.
 make sure you're using two different types: one for pimples and one for dark circles.
 Neutral shades such as brown and coral are especially good for teens. Apply the lightest shade under your brow bone and in the inner corner of your eyes. Apply the darkest color in your crease, and the second to darkest color on your eyelid. If your eyeshadow flakes off during the day, try investing in an eye primer.
 If you have darker skin than you can get away with using black.
 Clear is good too if you are getting into the pool because it doesn't show as much when it smudges. Curling your lashes will help.
 If you are fair go with a light rose. If you are tan you can go with peach or a darker shade.
 Lip gloss adds more shine as lip balm focuses on moisturizing. Have fun!

 Budget carriers such as Spirit and RyanAir, as well as budget divisions of legacy carriers such as basic economy may only allow small personal items such as a laptop bag or backpack. Other airlines may include carry-ons but no checked bags in their base fare, while others still may allow a certain number of checked bags.Look online or call your airline to see what specific baggage is included with the ticket you are considering purchasing.;
, When looking for the best price ticket for your flight, consider how much baggage you will actually bring. If you only plan on bringing a carry-on, for example, you may not want to pay for a ticket that has checked bags rolled into the cost.Likewise, if you know you need to check bags, you may want to rule out options that charge per bag or by weight for checked luggage.
 In addition to knowing what an airline charges for baggage, know what limits and regulations they have in place for baggage. Different airlines have different regulations regarding how large or heavy both carry-on and checked items can be, so read your specific airlineâ€™s regulations carefully.It may be useful to invest in a small hanging luggage scale, which can be purchased easily online. This can help you avoid overweight bag fees.
 In some cases, a budget ticket plus baggage fees may be cheaper than purchasing a ticket with baggage included. In other cases, the baggage-included airline might be the best option. Shop around and compare prices including baggage fees to get the best deal.

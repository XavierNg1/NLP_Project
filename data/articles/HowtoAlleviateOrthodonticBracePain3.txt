Follow the directions on the toothpaste tube for proper usage.
 The bristles on toothbrushes can range from soft to firm. The softer the bristles, the more gentle it will be on your teeth and gums when you brush your teeth. Choose a toothbrush that has soft bristles.
 If you have a habit of brushing hard on your teeth, this will be especially painful for you in the first few days after you get your braces. Be gentle on your teeth, slowly and carefully brushing in a circular motion. Take your time when brushing and when opening your mouth wide.
 When you have braces, you need to brush and floss after every time you eat, even when you are out of the house. Without this attentive care to your teeth, you risk getting cavities, swollen gums or other tooth problems. During the time you wear braces, your teeth need extra care.


Carry a travel toothbrush, a mini tube of toothpaste and a small packet of floss with you when you are away from home so that you are always prepared to brush after eating.

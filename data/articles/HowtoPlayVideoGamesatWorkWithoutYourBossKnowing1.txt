 If you honestly feel that you can’t rip yourself away from playing World of Warcraft during a raid, consider making that a “home” only game. Other game considerations include a game that doesn’t require sound (a total giveaway) or a tremendous amount of flash, which may slow down your (and your coworkers') system.;
, The last thing you need is to sneak a game into work only to destroy the entire server with a virus, thus blowing your cover and most likely any security you might have at work. Run virus software for each game and/or scrub and clean the game.
 While your plan is not to get busted playing games at work, if you are discovered, you’ll at least want to make sure the games contain PG type/E-rated content and material. If you bring games that have an M rating and contain criminal or sexual content, you could be in more trouble than just being busted for gaming.

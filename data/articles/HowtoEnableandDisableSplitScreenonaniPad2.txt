 Safari's "Split View" will only work when your iPad's screen is held horizontally., It's a white app with a blue compass icon., It's an icon of two overlapping squares in the upper-right corner of the screen. This opens a drop-down menu., It's the first selection on the menu. Now you can view two Safari tabs at the same time.

Alternatively, drag an open browser tab from the top of the Safari window to the right side of the screen. Doing so will launch "Split View" and open the tab in its own pane.
To close "Split View", tap and hold the tab manager button in the lower-right corner of either browser pane. Then tap Merge All Tabs to open the tabs in both panes in a single window, or tap Close Tabs to close the pane entirely and expand the remaining window to full screen.

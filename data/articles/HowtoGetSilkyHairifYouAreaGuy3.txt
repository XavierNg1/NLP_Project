 Combing your hair is absolutely essential to keeping it feeling silky and clean. Tangled bedhead will always be difficult to manage and will serve to damage your hair and keep it feeling coarse and rough. Use a fine-tooth plastic comb and run it through your hair a few times each morning to work out the tangles and leave your hair healthy and silky.

If your hair is especially tangled, use a small dab of oil on the comb to help work it through and treat your hair. You can also use a little bit of water. Depending on the thickness of you hair, it may be more appropriate to brush it, especially with coarse hair.
 If you have coarse or curly hair, a flat iron can help you achieve a silky texture. However, keep in mind that flat ironing and other heat-based treatments can damage your hair, so use a few protective measures:Flat iron your hair while it is completely dry. Wet hair is much more susceptible to heat damage than dry hair.
Use a heat protecting spray, cream, or serum on your hair before straightening.
Avoid going over the same section of your hair more than once.
 Blow-drying your hair can also help keep your hair silky. You can take a few precautions to prevent your hair from getting dried out or heat damaged from excessive blow-drying:Towel dry your hair before blow-drying it. This can cut down on drying time and reduce the risk of heat damage.
Comb a protective serum through your hair before blow-drying.
If youâ€™re trying to achieve a smooth and silky effect, use a boar bristle brush to gently pull your hair taut during blow drying. Dry from the roots of your hair down to the ends.

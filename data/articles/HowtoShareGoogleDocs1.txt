 You can share any of your Google Docs files, either through the Google Docs site (docs.google.com) or the Google Drive site (drive.google.com). Your files will be available on both. Google Drive manages all of the files on your Drive account, while Google Docs just handles documents.


You'll need to log in with the Google account that the files are stored in.;
, This will open the Share window.


If you're using Google Drive, you can right-click on the file and select "Share". This isn't available on Google Docs.
 You can type names from your Google Contacts or email addresses to allow access to the document. If the recipient is not a Google Docs user, they will be invited to create a free account before accessing the document.


You can add a note to the editing invite.
 By default, people that you add will be able to make changes to the document. You can change individual permissions to either "Can comment" or "Can view".


If the user is able to comment, they can leave notes on the document but cannot make any changes. If the user is allowed to view the document, they can only open it. They will not be able to comment or make changes.
 Emails will be sent to all of the people that you added. They will be able to click the link in the email or find the document in the "Shared with me" section of Google Drive.

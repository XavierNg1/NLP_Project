 If you live in the city, head over to a local park or natural area. Bring a notebook with you and write down what you see, smell, hear and feel.;
, Note the season and the direction of the wind. Observe the sky and the ground and observe everything around you. Write down your observations in as extensive detail as possible. Make sure to stay relaxed.
 Make yourself a cup of herbal tea and read a book if you'd like.
 Try to meditate outside as much as possible, as this will help you focus your energies to the elements.


In order to meditate, you do not need to chant "om" or use any special tools. Simply sit down on the ground, close your eyes and try to become aware of your surroundings. Focus on your breathing and relax yourself completely. You do not need to push out any thoughts or label any emotions or senses. Simply let thoughts come and go and observe the inner workings of your subconscious mind.
 It can be a flower garden, an herb garden, a vegetable garden or just a few potted plants on your windowsill. Make sure to take care of your plants and expose them to sunlight and water them everyday. Growing a garden will help your mind understand the life within nature and will bring you closer to the earth, as well as helping to improve air quality.
 Recycle, eat organic fruits and vegetables, don't litter and don't waste water. Turn off lights when you're not using them. Don't hurt animals or plants. Consider becoming a vegetarian or vegan.
 To truly connect to nature, you need to go outside and experience it for yourself!

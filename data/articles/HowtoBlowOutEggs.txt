 Eggs usually have one end that's smaller and pointier. Pierce the smaller end first, then the other end (top and bottom). To pierce the initial hole, use a pin or buy an egg-pricker available from specialty suppliers. The holes then need to be made bigger, so you can get the egg contents out. To do this, you can either keep using a pin or similar tool, or for a very effective method, use two large round nails, one 1/12" (2mm) thick and one 1/6" (4mm) thick. Sharpen the ends of each nail using a file or emery board to create four sharp edges. Make the hole you are going to blow through a little larger using the nail. Then make the end hole slightly larger, about twice the size of the first hole, as this is where the egg contents will flow out.

One way to help prevent cracking when drilling the holes in the egg is to place "Scotch"/"cellophane" tape or an adhesive plaster/bandaid on the egg at the piercing point.

You can also pierce the egg with a little drill bit in a hand (not power) drill, small rotary tool such as a "Dremel" or twirled between the fingers. Let it scrape down gently, not punch in and snag and tear the shell with its flutes.

The bit should be a single solid piece of metal or metal-like carbide, not covered with grit which could contaminate the extracted egg.


Feel around the eggshell for any weak spots––sometimes they are slightly gray. If you can't find any, just select a spot near the center of the egg's ends for poking holes in.
Grip the egg firmly in your non-dominant hand (but don't break it!) as you stick the nail in with your dominant hand. Insert the nail slowly and apply even pressure.
To make the shell easier to poke holes in, try rubbing the egg on fine grain sandpaper to thin the shell. This makes it easier to penetrate the shell using a heavy pin or even a paperclip. The paperclip is great to break the yolk inside, which then makes it easier to blowout.;
, Pierce the yolk and break up the membranes that keep it whole. Gently push the instrument in and out of the hole repeatedly.

, The traditional method uses a small straw (like those thin straws you can find in any coffee shop) and air from your mouth, but you can also use a syringe to push air into the hole. If you don't want to use your mouth, choose a tool from the following:

An ear bulb syringe
An injection syringe (without a sharp needle attached)
A glue syringe
An "egg blower" (for example, Blas-fix).
A small air compressor, as for tire inflation or airbrushing. Attach the blunt, tapered low-pressure inflation nozzle and slowly bring it close to one hole. The egg should be disrupted and expelled without the need to break it up inside first.

Check for lubricating oil or dirt contamination in the air by directing the stream at some clean paper.
The egg may crack or even explode.
High pressure compressed air streams can be dangerous. Do not use a full-size compressor or pressurized tank, place the nozzle against the body or near the face, or allow a child to use the compressor.
 Hold the egg right above this bowl when you're blowing. If you use clean materials, you can save these partially beaten egg yolks and whites for other dishes in the future.

, Blow air through the straw and into the egg, letting the insides flow out from the larger hole. Or you can put your mouth to one of the holes and blow. Do this until the egg is empty.

, Push air or water through the hole to get the egg insides out. If you use water, you may not be able to save the eggs for a future recipe. Repeat until all the egg contents are out.

, Then take your straw or syringe to blow out the water and any remaining egg yolk/white. Shake gently and repeat until the egg is completely clean.

You'll want to do this over a bowl––if you're saving the eggs for later use, set up a separate wide bowl for catching the water, or just do it over the sink.
 Optionally, put all eggshells in the microwave on high for 15-30 seconds or bake them in 300ºF/150ºC oven for 10 minutes. This may help to make them stronger.

Alternatively, you can let them drain (larger hole facing downwards) for 2-3 days.
 They're now ready for decorating and placing on display.

 Think about the times you feel most energized and engaged, and try to pinpoint what you like about those situations. The activities that make you feel most like yourself probably make use of your strengths. Make a list of the ones you come up with.For instance, if you feel most alive when you work on a project with other people, communication and teamwork might be a couple of your strengths.
 Which activities do you love writing down in your planner? If you find yourself looking forward to particular events, activities, or challenges, it’s a good bet that they involve your strengths.For example, if you look forward to going back to school every year, learning is probably one of your strengths.
 Look back over the last few years and think about your achievements, big and small. Identify the ones that make you feel best about yourself and your abilities. Then think about whether those achievements have anything in common.For instance, if you’re proud of winning a dance competition and acing a big test, one of your strengths might be staying cool in high-pressure situations.
Consider keeping a running log of your achievements.
 Your “work personality” can give you valuable information about your strengths. Ask yourself which of your skills and abilities serve you best as you complete your everyday responsibilities, and think about your go-to strategy when you need to solve a problem.For example, if you get your projects done by working quickly and efficiently on your own, your strengths might include being self-directed and motivated.
 Writing in a journal regularly is a good way to track your behavior and feelings, which can give you insight into your strengths. Make a habit of writing daily or weekly, and look for patterns in your thoughts and actions.This can be a good counterbalance to your anxious thoughts and behaviors.

 There are two different kinds of DNA tests: a “buccal swab” and a blood test. Both tests are extremely accurate.


With a “buccal swab” test, a cotton swab is rubbed on the inside cheeks of the mouth in order to collect DNA material.With a blood test, blood is drawn from the man and then tested.
Buccal swab tests, which are the most common, yield results in 5-10 days., Currently, there is no mandatory federal oversight of DNA testing facilities.You will need to choose a facility based upon its voluntary accreditation as well as its promised service.


Find out if the lab is accredited. Instead of relying on the lab’s statement that it is accredited, contact the accrediting agencies themselves. For example, go to the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and search for accredited labs. They have a list of accredited blood banks here.
The accuracy of DNA tests increase with the number of genetic sites on the DNA tested. Your lab should guarantee that it will continue testing until it either (1) can exclude you as the father or (2) can guarantee with more than 99.99% accuracy that you are the father., The costs can vary, depending on whether the lab is accredited or not. Quoted prices run from $395 for a standard testto over $500.Some state child welfare agencies make DNA tests available and may even pay for some of the testing fees. You should contact your state welfare agency and ask if this is an option.

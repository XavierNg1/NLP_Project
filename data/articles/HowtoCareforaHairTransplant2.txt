 Wait two weeks before wading in chlorinated water. You can, however, wade in the ocean beginning 10 days after your surgery. Wait at least one month before engaging in real swimming in either a pool or in the ocean.Saunas and steam rooms should also be avoided for about one month.
 The first three months following the procedure are a crucial time for scalp healing, and sunburn could damage the surgeryâ€™s results.


Sit under a sun umbrella if visiting the beach or pool.
If going outdoors, use a clean cotton cap, scarf, or bandanna to keep the transplanted area protected from the elements.
 Sports like baseball, football, and soccer run a high risk of injuries to the head, and should therefore be avoided for at least six months following the operation. Your doctor may also advise avoiding sexual activity for at least 10 days after surgery.Even without direct contact, the increased blood pressure to your head during intense physical activity could cause transplants or incisions to bleed. Avoid strenuous physical activity for at least three weeks.Exercises like situps, squats, and bench presses could strain your neck and lead to scarring or post-surgical complications.
A few days after your surgery, you can engage in light physical activity like walking around the block, lifting very light weights, and climbing stairs.

 Get a jet pack from your nearest army depot. If you can't find a jet pack just strap two rockets on your back. Just be careful not to burn your feet or your cape.;
, Since it would require years of training to reach even a fraction of what is considered to be superhuman strength you could get a pressurized gas tank. Just open it and unleash! (Side note: Lifting buses will be harder but still plausible)

, Purchase a portal gun and Portal 2. Learn how to use the aforementioned gun by playing the aforementioned game.
 Remember that rocket (a missile is even better) from step 1? Just ride it like a surfer board. Just don't ask me how to stop.
 Grab an inflatable costume. When you want to shape shift just enter the costume and blow it up.
 The pressurized gas tank from step 2 could easily be mistaken for telekinesis. Therefore just use it to that end.
 Any superconductor will do the trick. Just make sure you always carry plenty of batteries. Otherwise use conventional super sized magnet.
 That gas tank again! See? It's so useful you might actually want to carry two on you at any given moment.
 Stare your foe until he sleeps or throw a sleeping pill in his drink. If neither is feasible just hurl a rock at his head. Works every time!

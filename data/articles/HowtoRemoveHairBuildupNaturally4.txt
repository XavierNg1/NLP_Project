 The acidic nature of the lemon or lime juice will help dissolve any build-up in your hair. Keep in mind, however, that lemon juice and lime juice can lighten your hair, especially if you spend a lot of time in the sun.Here is what you will need:1 tablespoon of lemon juice or lime juice
3 cups (675 milliliters) of water
A pitcher or large bottle to hold the rinse

, Fill a large bottle or pitcher with 3 cups (675 milliliters) of water. Add 1 tablespoon or lemon juice or lime juice. Stir everything with a spoon to combine.
 Use your favorite shampoo and rinse everything out.
 Tilt your head back, close your eyes tightly, and pour the rinse over your hair. Be sure that it runs back from your hairline, down your hair, and towards the ends. Let the rinse sit for a few minutes. Be sure not to get the rinse into your eyes, or it will sting.
 After a few minutes, tilt your head back, and rinse your hair using plain water.
 Once you have gotten all of the lemon/lime rinse out, apply some conditioner to your hair. You are doing this because the lemon/lime juice can cause your hair to become dry; using conditioner will prevent this from happening. Be sure to rinse the conditioner from your hairâ€”unless you are using leave-in conditioner.

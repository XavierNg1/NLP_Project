 In the films Kristen Stewart (who plays Bella) has long dark brown hair. If dark brown is not your natural hair colour, consider you could try to dye your hair so you look more like Bella, but it is optional.
 The easiest way to achieve Bella's signature "loose waves" hairstyle is by straightening completely dry hair with a straightening iron (if it's not already straight), and then taking sections of your hair and using a curling iron to achieve these loose waves. Remember to put a heat protectant spray or cream in your hair before using electrical styling products - this protects your hair from the damage that the heat from the styling products gives off.
 If you cannot afford any electrical hair styling items, you can do achieve the "loose waves" look naturally. Wash your hair, then towel-dry it. When it's only a little damp, put it in a French braid/french plaits. If you don't know how to do this, take large sections of your hair and braid them normally. Leave it in for a few hours and when take it out of the plait/braid, you will have beautiful wavy locks. They also sell twilight hair brushes to get her exact curls/waves. It's a big round brush, get one! They are very cheap. You can find them in Walmart, etc.
 Bella's hair is polished; there are no fly-aways on her head. After styling your hair, apply a bit of de-frizz-er to your hair to keep fly-aways in place, and then spray a little bit of hairspray in your hair to hold the waves in place.

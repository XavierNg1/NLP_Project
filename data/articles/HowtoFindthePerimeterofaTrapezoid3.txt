 To do this, draw the height from both top vertices.

If you cannot form two right triangles because one side of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the base, just note that this side will have the same measurement as the height, and divide the trapezoid into one rectangle and one right triangle.
 Since these are opposite sides of a rectangle, they will be the same length.For example, if you have a trapezoid with a height of 6 cm, you should draw a line from each top vertex extending down to the bottom base. Label each line 6 cm. 


, (This is the bottom side of the rectangle.) This length will be equal to the length of the top base, because opposite sides of a rectangle are of equal length.For example, if the top base of the trapezoid is 6 cm, then the middle section of the bottom base is also 6 cm.
 The ratio is sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}, where θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the measure of the interior angle, opposite{\displaystyle {\text{opposite}}} is the height of the triangle, and hypotenuse{\displaystyle {\text{hypotenuse}}} is the length of the hypotenuse.

Using this ratio will allow you to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is also the trapezoid's first side length.

The hypotenuse is the side across from the 90 degree angle of a right triangle.
 Make sure you use the height of the triangle as the length of the opposite side in the formula. You will solve for H.

For example, if the given interior angle is 35 degrees, and the height of the triangle is 6 cm, your formula will look like this:sin⁡(35)=6H{\displaystyle \sin(35)={\frac {6}{H}}}


, Do this by using the SIN button on a scientific calculator. Plug this value into the ratio.

For example, by using a calculator you will find that the sine of a 35 degree angle is .5738 (rounded). So your formula will now be:.5738=6H{\displaystyle .5738={\frac {6}{H}}}


, Or, you can simply divide the height of the triangle by the angle sine.

For example:.5738=6H{\displaystyle .5738={\frac {6}{H}}}.5738H=6{\displaystyle .5738H=6}.5738H.5738=6.5738{\displaystyle {\frac {.5738H}{.5738}}={\frac {6}{.5738}}}H=10.4566{\displaystyle H=10.4566}So, the length of the hypotenuse, and the first missing side of the trapezoid, is about 10.4566 cm.
 Set up the sine ratio (sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}) for the second given interior angle. This will give you the length of the hypotenuse, which is also the first side of the trapezoid.

For example, if the given interior angle is 45 degrees, you would calculate:sin⁡(45)=6H{\displaystyle \sin(45)={\frac {6}{H}}}.7071=6H{\displaystyle .7071={\frac {6}{H}}}.7071H=6{\displaystyle .7071H=6}.7071H.7071=6.7071{\displaystyle {\frac {.7071H}{.7071}}={\frac {6}{.7071}}}H=8.4854{\displaystyle H=8.4854}So, the length of the hypotenuse, and the second missing side of the trapezoid, is about 8.4854 cm.
 The Pythagorean Theorem formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where the length of the hypotenuse is c{\displaystyle c}, and the height of the triangle is a{\displaystyle a}.
 Make sure you plug in the hypotenuse length for c{\displaystyle c} and the height for a{\displaystyle a}.

For example, if the first right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10.4566, and a height of 6, your formula will be:62+b2=10.45662{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10.4566^{2}} 


, This will give you the length of base of the first right triangle, and the first missing section of the trapezoid’s bottom base.

For example:62+b2=10.45662{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10.4566^{2}}36+b2=109.3405{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=109.3405}b2=109.3405−36{\displaystyle b^{2}=109.3405-36}b2=73.3405{\displaystyle b^{2}=73.3405}b2=73.3405{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {73.3405}}}b=8.5639{\displaystyle b=8.5639}So, the base of the triangle, and the first missing section of the bottom base of the trapezoid, is about 8.5639 cm.
 Use the Pythagorean Theorem formula (a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}) to do this. Plug in the length of the hypotenuse for c{\displaystyle c}, and the height for a{\displaystyle a}. Solving for b{\displaystyle b} will give you the length of the second missing section of the trapezoid’s bottom base.

For example, if the second right triangle has a hypotenuse of 8.4854, and a height of 6, you would calculate:62+b2=8.48542{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=8.4854^{2}}36+b2=72{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=72}b2=72−36{\displaystyle b^{2}=72-36}b2=36{\displaystyle b^{2}=36}b2=36{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {36}}}b=6{\displaystyle b=6}So, the base of the second triangle, and the second missing section of the bottom base of the trapezoid, is 6 cm.
 The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all sides: P=T+B+L+R{\displaystyle P=T+B+L+R}. For the bottom base, you will add the bottom side of the rectangle, plus the bases of the two triangles.

For example, 6+(8.5639+6+6)+10.4566+8.4854=45.5059{\displaystyle 6+(8.5639+6+6)+10.4566+8.4854=45.5059}So, the approximate perimeter of your trapezoid is 45.5059 cm.

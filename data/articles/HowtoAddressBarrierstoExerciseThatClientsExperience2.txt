 If he feels like he isn't progressing or shows a drop in motivation, show him the records so he can see how much progress he's already made. Ways of keeping track include:


Taking periodic body circumference measurements
Calculating body mass index (BMI) periodically
Using skin-fold calipers or other methods to measure body fat percentage
Weekly, bi-weekly or monthly weigh-ins
Comparing elements of performance, like weight lifted, repetitions done, or duration and intensity of cardiovascular exercise.
Tracking clothing size

,, Ask questions and draw him out until you find what's really at the root of his lack of motivation. If he can address that issue, the motivation may come back naturally.

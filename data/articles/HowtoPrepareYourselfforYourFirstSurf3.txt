Let the water come to you, splash over your toes, and invite you in. Enter with respect.
Start paddling out. The nose of the board should float about an inch above the water, more if you arch your back. This helps you find the *sweet* spot with minimum drag and maximum projection with each paddle.

If the nose of your board is higher (more drag), shift up a little. If it's lower (nosediving), shift down.


Feel the balance.



Paddle like your life depends on it, on every wave you try for, never forget that! even if you get good!

, That is the moment to do what you did on land, jump up and centre your feet. LOOK UP! now comes the hardest part.
 Let the wave do the work, surrender to the power, float, adapt, adjust, keep doing what feels right, give thanks for being able to share that band of energy during its fulcrum moments. Enjoy.
 Take a deep breath and spread over on the surface if you can, horizontal octopus style, but RELAX with the fall, less pain = more waves. Then paddle like mad to get back out and try again.

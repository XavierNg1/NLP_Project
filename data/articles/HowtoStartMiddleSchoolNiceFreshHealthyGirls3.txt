 If you like sports, hang out with sporty kids or girls. But here is an easy way to make friends:


Find someone you think seems nice.
Try to smile at him/her.
If they smile back find a seat near them.
If they don't say "Hey, move it! I'm saving this seat for like Jenny. So like beat it." start a conversation: "Hey, do you like (insert-subject-or-thing-here)?" "Hi. I like your hair." and there's always "Hey. I'm (name) what's your name?"

, But don't be bothered about dating someone. If you have a best friend who's a guy, people might think your dating. This bothers me. Some kids are immature, so don't be bothered by it. Ignore them. But Middle-school dating sometimes does not last long and it's usually something like this:


Hand-holding or hugging
Taking to each other
Going to the movies with adult supervision
Texting each other
Skyping or IMing

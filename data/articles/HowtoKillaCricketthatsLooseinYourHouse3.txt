 Cats and dogs are great for taking care of any unwanted insects that might sneak into your home. They are much better at finding insects than humans, so if there is a cricket hiding in your home, let your pet do the hard work.Keep in mind that keeping a pet is a big commitment. You shouldn’t get a cat or dog for the sole purpose of killing crickets.
 If you have lots of damp areas in your home, identify them, and try to reduce them if possible. Crickets love moisture, so fixing any problems that may lead to excess moisture will be important.Crickets are also attracted to bright lights, so replace any outdoor lights (e.g. porch lights) with yellow bulbs or sodium vapor bulbs that will be less appealing.
Look for any points of entry as well. For example, maybe there is a window that doesn’t seal shut. Check your door frames to make sure that there are no spots that a cricket could get through.
 If you live in an area where insects are a common problem, you can probably find a pest control company that will come and spray your home with an insecticide a few times a year. If you are struggling with a cricket infestation, this may be the easiest way to deal with the problem.


Make sure that any pest control company you hire is licensed in your state.
If you have pets, be sure to let the company know, and ask them if their products are safe for humans, children, and pets.

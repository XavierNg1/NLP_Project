 You can actually use as many braids as you want. The fewer braids you use, the larger the curls will be. So decide how many braids to use based on how large you want your curls to be.;
, To braid hair, you just divide the part you want to braid into three sections and bring the far left piece across the middle section, then repeat with the left piece. You continue doing this (alternating between the left and right pieces) until you have no more hair left. Tie off the end with an elastic band.
 When you wake up, take the elastics out of all the braids.
 Set your style with some hair spray.

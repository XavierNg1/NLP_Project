 Do not, under any circumstance, spray water directly onto the screen of the laptop.This significantly increases your odds of getting water into the machine, thereby making a short more likely. Only use water if you apply it with a soft cloth.


Do not drench the cloth in water. A soaked cloth is more likely to drip excess water into the machine, which could cause serious damage to your computer. If you accidentally use too much water, wring the cloth out well until it is only slightly moist.
 The only cleaners safe for your screen are the light water and vinegar mixture or a special storebought cleaner meant for LCD screens. Do not use the following:


Window cleaner
All-purpose cleaner
Dish soap, or soap of any kind

, If you press too hard you can permanently damage your laptop. Use a gentle circular rubbing motion when you clean your screen. Avoid using a brush or anything but a very soft cloth to clean your screen.

 Hummingbird nectar should be changed every three to five days to prevent potentially fatal fermentation and mold. Clean the feeder with hot water and a bottle brush, then dry it thoroughly before refilling it.Never feed hummingbirds honey, which ferments easily and readily grows mold that can kill hummingbirds.
 Try to clean your feeders at least once a week during busy feeding periods, to keep them free of contaminants that can harm birds and spread disease. During slow times of the year, cleaning them once every two to three weeks should be enough. Dispose of any uneaten seed, then scrub the feeder with hot water and a bottle brush. Dry your feeders thoroughly before refilling them.If you need to clean your feeders more thoroughly, rinse clean surfaces with a dilute bleach solution of one part bleach to nine parts water.
Avoid using soap or detergent, which can be toxic to birds.
 If you live in an urban or suburban area, your local birds should be okay while you are on vacation – they can easily find food in a neighboring feeder if yours run out of seed. However, if you live in a very rural or isolated location, try to arrange for a friend or neighbor to refill your feeders while you are out of town during winter months., If you see a bird collide with a window, carefully place it in a shoebox or similar dark container with a lid. Leave the box in a warm, quiet location where pets and other predators can't reach it. Check the box frequently, and release the bird once it appears awake and alert.


Do not try to give it food and water, and resist handling it as much as possible.
If you find an injured bird, you can take it to a vet or wildlife agency – but bear in mind that it's illegal in many areas to handle a migratory bird without a permit.

 These electric mixers are essentially motorized whisks.They enable you to achieve the proper consistency for your eggs in a fraction of the time of hand whisking.


Handheld electric mixers are less expensive than stand mixers, and they are easier to store.
Stand mixers offer the advantage of keeping your hands free to do other jobs in the kitchen while your eggs are being beaten. Use the whisk attachment with your stand mixer.
 If you immediately start to whisk them at high speed, they will not reach their full volume.Add a pinch of cream of tartar at the foamy stage to help stabilize the whites.
 Your egg whites should reach their full volume within a few minutes.


Since handheld mixers are not as powerful as stand mixers, you may have to use the high speed to achieve the consistency required by your recipe.
If using a stand mixer, which is quite powerful, do not go above the medium-high speed. Your mixture will have more stable, smaller bubbles if you donâ€™t use the highest speed on your stand mixer, It is easy to step away from a stand mixer, but doing so risks over-whipping your egg whites.


Over-whipped whites look dry and curdled or grainy and clumpy.The structure of the whites will break down, and liquid will then weep out of the mixture.
You can try to salvage overbeaten egg whites by beating in another egg white. This may help the mixture recover its structure. Otherwise, throw everything out and start again.

 You want this picture to light up and glow so think about ways the sun might hit the dandelion to make it really sparkle.


Use a small pair of scissors to remove any hanging canvass in the event you have hanging pieces.
 Use duct tape to secure the strand to the canvas.


Secure the light plug toward the bottom of the painting with duct tape. Make sure it’s positioned closest to the nearest outlet.
 Since you are hanging three consecutive canvasses you’ll want to make sure they are all level and spaced evenly. Use a level and a ruler to mark hanging positions.


Nail picture hangers to the wall and hang the canvasses. Make adjustments as necessary as sometimes you may see gaps or the paintings may not appear to be level.
Add a white extension cord if necessary to plug in your light strand. Consider obtaining a cord cover from the local hardware store to hide the hanging extension cord.

 To make an overworld banner you will need to acquire the following:


1 Blue Banner
5 Lime Green Dye
1 Brick Block
1 Lapis Lazuli
1 Enchanted Golden Apple
14 Ink Sacks;
, Dye 6 pieces of wool blue with Lapis Lazuli dye, then place them in the top two rows of the crafting table with a stick underneath.
 Now place 4 lime green dye above, below and to each side of the banner. The result should be a lime green diamond in the center.
 Now place the last lime green dye below it, with the bricks in the bottom right slot. This will add a lime green field masoned pattern behind your banner.
 You can make this by placing the apple in the very middle and placing 8 gold blocks all around it.
 Then place one Lapis Lazuli right below it and your Enchanted Golden Apple in the bottom right slot. This should make a blue Mojang Symbol right in the middle of your banner.
 Place 3 ink sacks over it. This will color the top of your banner black.
 Now place 3 more ink sacks across the bottom row. The result should be of the banner as before with a black stripe on the bottom.
 The result should look like a Minecraft world floating in space!

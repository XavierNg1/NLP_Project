 You don't have to dance right in front of the guy the whole time -- that can get boring, and you may actually want to see your dance partner once in a while. So, you can move over to the left, continuing your circular motion and bent knees motion, while the guy moves to the right, so you can look up and see him. You can switch places and move to the right while he moves to the left, and keep moving back and forth.
 Turn around to face the guy instead of turning your back to him, and place your arms around his neck. This is called front grinding -- it's more risky and more sexy. Let him put his hands on your hips as you continue to move your waist in a circular motion. Move your hands away from his neck, and up and down his chest. Then, turn back around again.


You can even place your fingers in the guy's belt loops for a few seconds.
 When your back is to the guy, you can move your hands all the way down to the floor or near it, as you raise your butt more and more in the air. This is a more intimate move that is sure to make the guy go crazy -- as long as you have the confidence to pull it off.
 Don't be intimidated if a slower song comes on at the club. You can still grind more slowly to the music, using the same moves you used to grind to fast-paced music, just at a lower speed. The slow grind is even sexier if you can pull it off. Don't let the guy see that you've been thrown off -- just continue to move to the music without skipping a beat.

 Running noses are common during the winter months due to the accumulation of condensation and mucus in the nostrils.
 Since gloves and mittens are worn to keep the hands warm, they may be used as a place to wipe the nose in the same manner as bare fingers and hands. Soft materials used in winter gloves, such as leather and cotton can create a soft cushion for the nose that is being wiped.


The fabric of the glove acts as a surrogate for the wearer's skin, which without the glove would be catching and absorbing all of the snot. By allowing for a glove or mitten to catch it's wearer's snot, the wearer thus will avoid his or her hands feeling or being wet with snot. The glove acts as a convenient rag for a running nose.
In winter sports and other areas where wiping one's nose with hands or fingers would be acceptable, it is common to openly use the back of the glove for nose-wiping without embarrassment. Many gloves manufactured for winter and sporting uses often possess built-in nose wipes, pads on the thumb or index finger, specially designed for the nose to be wiped on it.
 These may be purchased and placed over the backs of the gloves. Household latex, plastic, rubber, or gloves any type may also be used as a place to wipe the nose in the same manner as bare fingers and hands. Unlike leather or cotton gloves, a latex, plastic, or rubber glove will not absorb the wearer's snot. The surfaces of these gloves may remain slippery to until the snot dries on them.

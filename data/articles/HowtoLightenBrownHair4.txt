 Add Â½ cup of vinegar to 3 cups of water in a medium sized bowl. Use a spoon to mix these ingredients together.


Consider using apple cider vinegar.The apple cider vinegar smell tends to be less offensive than white vinegar.
 Pour the water and vinegar into a spray bottle. Use clips to section off your hair, and evenly spray the water and vinegar mixture onto your hair sections one by one. Let this mixture sit on your hair for 15 minutes.


You could also dip your hair into the bowl of water and vinegar, but this may unevenly distribute the mixture to your hair.
 Rinse your hair with warm water to remove the vinegar mixture from your hair.

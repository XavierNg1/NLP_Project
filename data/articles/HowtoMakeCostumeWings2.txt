 Take four metal clothes hangers and stretch and bend them to make the outlines of wings. The top two wing sections will be thinner and bigger on top while the bottom two will be shorter but wider.Posterboard is a good substitute material and can be cut into wing shapes, covered with felt, and decorated later.
 Black adhesive felt or tape sticks to the metal. Take pieces one at a time and wrap them closely around the exposed parts of the hangers. This also softens any metal edges sticking out so they don’t puncture decoration material later., Take one or two trash bags per wing. Pull them as tight as you can over the wings. If the material bunches up at the end or hangs loosely, you can trim the open end until they cover more securely. Tape the bags together around the front side of the hangers., If the wings are for a child, they can enjoy decorating too. Using scissors, cut shapes out of colored felt and then glue them onto the backs of the wings. Vary your shapes and lay them next to each other to create patterns like those on a monarch butterfly., Finish decorating by adding spots to the black edges of the wings. This hides the trash bags and adds variety. One way to do this is to add gold and white office stickers of varying sizes, but you can also use an alternative such as paint., Two strips of Velcro are enough to secure the wings. The sticky sides of the Velcro attach to the inner side of the wings and to the back of your clothes. To put the wings on, push the Velcro sides together and you’re done.Arm or thumb loops can be sewn onto felt-covered cardboard. Wrap the material around the wearer’s shoulder or thumb to measure the material needed. Hold the material in loops on the wings, then use pins or a sewing needle to bind them together and to the wings.

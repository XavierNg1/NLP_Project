 While your mouse is in the cage, spend time talking to it, feeding it, and giving it fresh water. These things will give the mouse positive associations with your presence. This is important because you’re so big that you can easily be seen as a threat.Get down to the same level as your mouse’s cage. That way, the mouse won’t always see you as a giant towering over it.
 Mice love treats. Feeding the mouse treats from your hand will give it more positive associations with you. However, you want to be careful not to get bitten, and not to encourage biting in the future.Put a treat in the palm of your hand and lower your hand into the cage slowly.
The treat can be a piece of fruit or a rodent treat from the pet store.
Wait for the mouse to approach you. Let it take the treat. This will teach the mouse to consistently approach you and that your hand is safe.
 Once the mouse is used to your hand coming into the cage, and it doesn’t see you as a threat, pick it up. You can just gently scoop the mouse into your hand. If this is difficult, you can grab the mouse gently from the base of his tail and then quickly put him into your other hand.If you’re going to use the tail to pick up your mouse, do so by the very base, and only do so for a moment. It can be quite painful for a mouse to be held or dangled by its tail.
 While you hold the mouse, speak to it gently, and try to make sure the experience is pleasant and not stressful. Do this everyday, spending more and more time with your mouse until it’s very comfortable with you.Always try to end the holding session on a positive note. For example, if the mouse urinates on you, or bites you, and you immediately put it back in its cage, it will learn that those behaviors will get it to go home.
Instead, aim to put the mouse back after a desired behavior, such as approaching food in your hand, or remaining still for a long moment.

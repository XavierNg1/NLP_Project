 This will make it much easier to work with. Plus, you will be less likely to make an error with your scissors if you can see what you’re doing.
 Sometimes, elastics are sewn into the seam of clothing. If this is the case, you won’t be able to pull the elastic out of them if you cut the somewhere other than the seam. Find the seam by holding on one side of the seam and stretching the other side. If you feel the elastic shift, you are free to cut wherever you’d like. If you feel it snag at the seam, make sure to cut here.
 To remove the elastic band from your clothing, make a slit (around ½”). If the elastic is sewn into the seam, you’ll have to cut the seam the size of the elastic., Use scissors to go through your slit and cut the elastic. Cut through the entire elastic without cutting any more holes in your clothes., Slowly pull the elastic out, being careful not to catch a lose string and bunching your fabric. Once the elastic is out, your clothes are ready to wear.


You can sew the slit closed if you want to, but it’s not a necessary step before you wear your clothes.

 The battery is epoxied into place, but needs to be removed to expose the screws.


Insert your tool between the metal case and the battery
Wiggle the tool lightly as you push it further in between the battery and the back case.
Once the adhesive that holds the battery gives out, it can be removed from the rear panel.

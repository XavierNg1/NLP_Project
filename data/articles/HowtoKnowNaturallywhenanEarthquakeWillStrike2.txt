 Though there is no way to pinpoint the exact arrival of an earthquake, scientists can examine sediment samples to get an idea of when major earthquakes occurred in the past. By measuring the amount of time between events, they can come up with a rough idea of when a major quake might hit.Cycles can stretch for hundreds of years--it may be 600 years (or more or less) between major earthquakes along a fault--but there's no way to truly know if or when the next big quake will occur.If the nearest fault line still has 250+ years in its cycle before another big earthquake, allow that to give you some solace. But do remember that there are no hard and fast rules for predicting earthquakes, so you should have an emergency kit prepared just in case., Right now Japan is the only country with a functioning early alarm system for earthquakes (other countries, including the US, are working on developing their own systems). Even with systems in place, they can only provide tens of seconds of advance warning before an earthquake.There are, however, services that will send you text messages alerting you of natural disaster occurrences or warnings in your area, including earthquakes.These alert messages can provide you with instructions in an emergency, including evacuation routes and available emergency shelters.Your city may have a warning system in place, such a sirens followed by a warning or instructions. Make sure you know if your town or city has such a warning system., Not sure if that rumbling you felt was a big truck outside, or construction, or even just a weird dream? You can verify earthquakes online with tracking websites, which will show you where and when any earthquakes were recorded and the magnitude of each quake.

 Steer clear of anything that's not your business. This will ensure that you won't get caught up in others' emotional turmoil. That's extremely detrimental to maintaining an aloof demeanor. State boldly, if you have to, that you won't get caught up in xyz. People may be surprised -- even angry at times -- but they will respect your unwillingness to take sides in a conflict you care nothing about.;
, Don't let anything ruffle your feathers. Always be prepared for anything that comes your way. This tranquility will permeate your mannerisms and translate "cool" to the general public. It signals to others that you have a certain detachment which allows you to weave in and out of life's tangled webs without losing your vital cool.
 Who cares about what everyone supposedly heard or what rumors are going around or what people saw with their own eyes? If you want to be aloof, you must handle pain with as much dignity and grace as possible. If you're going to fall apart, do it in the privacy of your own home. Don't have a breakdown in public.

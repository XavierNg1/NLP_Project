 The power is from the hips, just like it is in throwing a ball.
 Ensure your legs are in the correct positions, shoulder width apart.


Have someone test your stance by giving you push or two, to make sure you keep your balance.
Ensure your blocking hand is in front, and your punching hand is at nesting against your hip.
 Start the rotation with your hips.


Your back leg is also adding to the force of the rotation.
Come around quickly, leaving your fist palm facing up nested against your hip.
Do not rise up, keep your head at the same height.
 Bring your fist around so that it faces down right before you connect.


Hit on the center line of your target. Reverse punch using left hand or right hand should impact at the same place, in the center of the target.
As you connect, lock your body for a moment as you tense up to make maximum force.
Exhale or Kiai as you connect.

 The ideal palette for a minimalist tablescape contains just two colors: black and white. These are visually anchored by a third element, wood. Wood provides texture and difference where white and black objects provide uniformity. Select objects – plates, centerpiece objects, chairs, and runners – that are either black, white, or wooden.Green – the common color of plants that comprise minimalist centerpieces – is another common element in minimalist tablescapes.
Instead of using a bright red tablecloth, don’t use any at all. Or, if you really want to include a tablecloth, use a wispy white one.;
, Monochromatic – “one-color” – elements are free of busy patterns and designs that are incompatible with minimalist design principles. Instead of plates with an American flag on them, for instance, opt for entirely white ceramic. This will give your plates a clean look and allow diners to focus on their food.


Instead of napkins with a fanciful illustration on them, get plain white or grey napkins. (But avoid black napkins – they’re a bit grim.)

, Minimalist tablescapes are free of the messiness that accompanies random collections of plates and bowls, mismatched tableware, and glasses of different colors and sizes. When setting a minimalist table, pretend you’re at a nice restaurant. Everyone dining at a minimalist table should have the same flatware, the same plates, and the same chairs and cups.
 Plasticware, paper plates, and plastic cups have no place in a minimalist tablescape. Instead, spring for a more permanent dining set that corresponds to minimalist principles. With a more durable dining set, you’ll be able to create minimalist tablescapes far into the future.

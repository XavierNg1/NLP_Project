 If you’re still looking for somewhere to stay, don’t limit yourself the most popular areas. The fact of the matter is, it’ll cost more to live in the neighborhoods everyone wants to live in. That said, there are many people in every big city getting by on small budgets, and you’ll likely find a neighborhood where people are making it happen by paying less in rent. The classic example is looking a bit further out.For instance, simply by moving across the Hudson from New York City will save your hundreds of dollars per month, while only minimally prolonging your commute into the city.
In addition to looking for spots online, spend time in the neighborhoods you might like to live. Not only will this help you find the ideal area, you may even wind up spotting a “for rent” sign in person.;
, If you’re working with a small budget, you’ll be living with roommates in one capacity or another. In fact, the more the merrier, since all shared expenses can be split multiple ways. Aside from the rent, you’ll be paying less for internet, water, electricity, etc.The best place to start your search is online. Websites like Craigslist are used all over, and can help you find a room in a house or multi-room apartment, or fellow housing-hunters you can rent a place with. Many cities also have housing websites specific to their area.
 The less time and money you need to spend commuting, the happier you'll be. Even if your job is in an area of town you don't want to live in, living in a nearby neighborhood or close to a public transit option that can get you there will save you in both the financial and day-to-day sanity departments.

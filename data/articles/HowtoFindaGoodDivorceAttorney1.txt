 Before beginning your divorce attorney search you should first consider whether a divorce attorney is actually necessary.If you and your spouse can resolve the situation amicably, and have no marital property, it is possible to file for divorce pro se, ie. without the assistance of an attorney. In fact, most divorces don't require court proceedings, especially if there are no children involved and the divorce will not be contested.;
, A mediator can work with you and your spouse to come up with a division of assets agreement that is agreeable to both parties. After the assets have been divided, you and your spouse can file for divorce on your own., You and your spouse can reduce both the fear and perception of the need to “lawyer-up” by mutually agreeing not to take any steps that will materially affect either of your financial situations. Even if you later decide to retain a lawyer, the divorce process will be much easier if you try to cooperate with your spouse.
 While many attorneys provide general divorce services, others specialize in divorces involving children, high-net worth individuals, and some lawyers even choose to represent only husbands or only wives in divorce proceedings.


Consider attorneys who are well-versed in finance and property laws if you and your spouse have shared bank and/or investment accounts, own property and/or have other joint assets.
Seek out an attorney experienced at handling marital contracts if you and your spouse entered into a prenuptial agreement before marriage.
Consider hiring a trial attorney if your decision to divorce is not amicable. Messy divorces, especially when children and substantial assets are involved may have to go to trial, especially if you and your spouse are not on the best of terms.

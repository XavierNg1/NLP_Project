 You can create a shortcut from most browsers, though Microsoft Edge doesn't allow for shortcuts.;
, If your browser opens in full-screen mode, restore the browser window down by clicking the box icon in the top-right corner of the window (Windows) or the green circle in the top-left corner (Mac) before continuing.


You should be able to see some of your desktop above, below, or to the side of your browser's window.
 This will take you to Google's search page.
 In most browsers, you can click once on "https://www.google.com/" in the address bar at the top of the browser or you can highlight it manually by clicking on one side of the URL and dragging across to the other side until the whole website's address is highlighted.


You don't need to highlight the URL first if you are using Internet Explorer or Safari.
 Click and hold on the highlighted URL, then drag it like a file to your desktop and release the mouse button. This will place a file on your desktop that will open Google.com in your web browser when double-clicked.


If you're using Internet Explorer or Safari, you can also click and drag the Google icon that's on the left-hand side of the URL bar instead.
On a Mac, you can place the shortcut on your Dock by dragging it onto the Dock, waiting for a space to appear, and then releasing it.

 Creating social time for your child is important. Schedule times when your toddler can play with others. When your child is being properly supervised by someone else, you can use the free time to work more effectively.


Use a local daycare center once or twice a week. Many offer drop-in care for an hour or daily rate.
Start a group with other parents in which you take turns watching the kids in order to give each person a turn to take a break.
 You can opt either to leave the house or stay at home while the babysitter is there. This allows your child to receive the fully focused attention and care that they need while you get work finished.Scan the newspaper for local babysitters, place a wanted ad in your newspaper, or look for babysitters online. You can also ask a neighbor or friend whether their teenage kids would be interested in making some extra cash babysitting for you.
 Schedule a time to meet any prospective babysitters, and introduce them to your toddler. Ask them about their previous babysitting experiences to learn if they are a good fit for your family. Tell the babysitter about your expectations for them, and make your house rules clear.

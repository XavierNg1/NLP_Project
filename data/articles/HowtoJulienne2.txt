 The stem and tail pieces arenâ€™t needed for juliennes, so cut them off and throw them away. You can also peel off the outer skin layers of the onion so that you have just the flesh left.









Onions tend to be a little firmer than many other vegetables, so make sure your knife is sharp before you start. A dull knife will make the process much harder.
Make sure the top and bottom are chopped off in a nice smooth cut.
 Since onions are generally about the size that you want julienne sticks to be lengthwise, there is no need to cut an onion into a rectangle or into chucks. Simply cut it in half from top to bottom.
 With the onion laying flat side down, slice at an angle so that pieces stay at a uniform thickness. As you near the halfway point, your knife should be at 90 degrees. Flip the onion on its side and continue cutting.








Perform the same process with the second half of the onion.

Protect your sleeping area with a mosquito net treated with insecticide.If you sleep with any part of your body pressed against the net, you may still be at risk of being bitten through the net., Use a product that contains DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 to protect yourself against bug bites. You might also try products that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol. Reapply the spray according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Make sure your bug repellent contains sufficient insecticide to kill mosquitos.If you’re using sunscreen and bug repellent, apply the sunscreen first and then the bug repellent over it., Cover up your body to prevent mosquitos from having access to your skin. Wear long pants and shirts with long sleeves., Uncovered water catchments, cisterns and buckets are breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. Cover these up, especially if you have four or more catchments in a 10-meter radius of your dwelling., Chikungunya is spread by getting bitten by an infected mosquito, “the vector” of the species Aedes, which has caused clustered outbreaks in areas surrounding the Indian Ocean. Outbreaks continue to be a risk until the public health issue of the mosquito problem is better controlled.

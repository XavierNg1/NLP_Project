 Paint is another common way that pets can get lead poisoning. If your house has lead-based paint, your pet can get lead poisoning through licking or eating paint. The pet may also chew on woodwork or parts of the house that contain lead from old paint.You should fix any peeling paint so your pet cannot eat it. Repaint your house if your paint is old and could possible contain lead.
 Lead poisoning is pretty rare in pets, but remodeling your house can increase the chances significantly. This is due to any old paint or lead in the walls or floors. For example, if you sand a wall with lead-based paint, then you can release toxic lead particles into the air.Plumbing and other building materials, such as caulk and putty, can also cause lead poisoning.When you remodel your house, watch your pets at all times when they are in the rooms you are remodeling to make sure they are not ingesting anything. If possible, keep them out of the parts of the house you are remodeling.
Make sure to sweep up any lead dust or wash it away with soap and water.
Pets can get lead particles of lead paint on their paws and lick it off, which could lead to poisoning.
 If you have bare areas of soil in your yard, you may consider keeping your pets away from them. Bare soil often contains lead. If you take your pet for a walk, keep them away from lots where buildings stood or where renovations have occurred.Lead can get into the soil from building projects, renovations, exterior paint deterioration, or gasoline leaks from old vehicles when lead was still in gasoline.

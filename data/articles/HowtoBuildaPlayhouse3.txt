 For this project, you can choose to use a table that is of use in your house, or to procure a table especially for this project. You will also need several yards of fabric (enough to cover all sides of the table), scissors, and decorations (optional).
 In order to get an accurate cover for your table, you must have a list of all the measurements. Take a measurement of the length, width, and height. Make sure to write these down to keep track of them.
 You will be making the playhouse out of five pieces of fabric. You need one to fit the top of the table (length x width), two to fit the long sides (length x height), and two to fit the short sides (width x height).









When youâ€™ve gotten all the measurements done, cut the pieces of fabric out.
At this point, cut out rectangular sections to act as windows and doors in the playhouse. These can be as numerous as you desire, placed wherever you want.
 Lay the pieces of fabric out in their correct shape/order on the floor, to make sure you are sewing them correctly. They should make a large cross-like shape. Then, use a sewing machine to stitch the fabric together along the seams.
 If you want your playhouse look a little bit more exciting than just some fabric over a table, use sharpies, embroidery floss, or other pieces of fabric to give the fabric the appearance of a house. Draw on gingerbread trim, flower boxes under the windows, and a wood-grain texture on the walls.
 When you have done all the decorating you desire, throw the fabric tent over the table to complete your playhouse. Feel free to fill the inside with small pieces of furniture or toys, and enjoy!

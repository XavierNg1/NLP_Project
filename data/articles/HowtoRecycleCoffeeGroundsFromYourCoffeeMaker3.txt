 If you do not have a compost pile and do not need much extra fertilizer for your plants, a third option is available for recycling coffee grounds. Begin by collecting the grounds from your coffee maker into a small container just as you would for the other 2 methods.
 Because coffee grounds work themselves into the soil so quickly, and because plants consume their available nutrients so readily, the grounds can actually be poured directly onto the ground outside.


This method of recycling coffee grounds is only appropriate if you own a piece of outdoor land. You should avoid dumping coffee grounds onto land that you do not own.
When doing this, avoid dumping the grounds so that they bury existing plant growth. Instead, consider pouring the grounds around the bases of trees, which are typically self-mulched and devoid of competing plant life already.

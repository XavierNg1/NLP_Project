 The fresher the sorbet is, the better it will taste. You should eat it within a week of making it, but it will be best the day that you make it., While some people may want to eat an entire quart of sorbet right out of the carton with a spoon, if you’re serving guests, you’ll likely want to make your presentation nice. You can scoop the ice cream out with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.
 If you want to get fancy, garnish your sorbet. You can place a whole piece of fruit on top, garnish with a sprig of mint or another herb, or drizzle with a colorful syrup or reduction.
 You can store your sorbet for up to a week. It is best if stored in the back of your freezer, behind other food items and away from the door to regulate the temperature more effectively.,

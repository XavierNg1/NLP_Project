 Having a bag full of dust will cause your vacuum to lose suction.
 Tip your vacuum cleaner over and using scissors or your hands, carefully pull away fluff, hair and other debris.
 Check inside the pipes for any thing which may cause a blockage.
 Disassemble your vacuum about once per month and clean it with a wet cloth. Your vacuum will work a whole lot better, and that in turn will make your entire house considerably cleaner.·        


Clean your attachments with wet paper towels too.

 Don't confuse with baker's chocolate, which is unsweetened. Do not use chocolate chips, baking chocolate or store bought chocolate bars because they are the wrong thickness/fluidity (technical word is "viscosity") for molding.






;
, Clear plastic is the best choice for beginners. Molds are generally inexpensive and come in a variety of shapes.
 This step is extremely important to yield a visually appealing final product with the proper texture and mouth feel. Melt your chocolate over a double boiler. To temper chocolate:








, For milk and white, heat to 113 °F (45 °C) and cool to 82 °F (28 °C).
 Make sure you get an even coating on all sides of the mold and in all the nooks and crannies.
, Place it back in the freezer. Repeat this process until you have a solid shell of chocolate (this is where the clear plastic mold will come in handy; check the underside of the mold to look for any thinner spots or holes). Depending on the size of the mold, you will probably need about seven layers.
 Using a spoon, fill the mold(s) to the brim with chocolate. Replace in the freezer and leave for several hours (or overnight) for security. When you take them out, turn your mold gently over a counter or cutting board. The chocolates should come out without too much trouble, but if you find them getting stuck, tap the mold firmly against the counter or flex the mold a little, and that should free them.

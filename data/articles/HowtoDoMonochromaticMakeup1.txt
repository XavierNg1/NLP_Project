 Colors that work great for the monochromatic look are red, pink, bronze, brown, nude and orange. However, if you are feeling extra adventurous, you can also choose purple, grey, blue and even green as your base color.For example, if you have a warm skin tone, pick burnt rust or peach as your base color.
If you have a cool skin tone, then choose burgundy, purple or magenta as your base color.
If you have a neutral skin tone, then you are in luck because you can choose from a variety of colors like bronze, peachy pink, and blue, to name a few.;
, Once you have decided on a base color, use varying shades of the base color for your makeup application. If pink is your base color, for example, then use a medium shade of pink on your lids, a lighter shade on your cheeks, and a deep shade of pink on your lips.If purple is your base color, then choose from lavender, mauve, and violet.
If brown is your base color, then experiment with dark brown, gold, and bronze.
 You can also opt for the traditional monochromatic look by using the same color and shade for your eyes, cheeks and lids. It is perfectly fine to apply watermelon pink, for example, to your eyes, cheeks and lips when you are trying to achieve the monochromatic look.You could also apply lavender to your eyes, cheeks and lips.
Alternatively, try applying magenta to your eyes, cheeks and lips to achieve the monochromatic look.

 Using long phrases during training can confuse your dog companion and cause delays in the training process. Keep all commands or cue words consistent, which means making sure all family members use the same commands.
 For example, at meal times get the poodle to "Sit" before putting her food down. If the dog is tired or her concentration is poor, then end the session and try again next time - you are more likely to teach her bad habits if you persist when she's not in the mood., Position the dog in front of you, so you are looking at each other. Put a treat in your hand and then put your hand in front of the dog, slightly above its head. Most dogs will naturally sit to get a better view of the treat being held above their head.


Once the dog sits, immediately praise it and give it the treat.
 Important commands to teach are stay and recall (getting the dog to come back on demand). When the dog obeys these commands this gives you a great deal of control over her behavior. For example, if she rushes to greet guests, by commanding her to "Sit" you can stop her jumping up at an anxious child.
 As she learns, make sure to expand the places you take her to for training, so she learns to obey under all circumstances, rather than just in the yard.
 It is a great way to get your dog used to obeying when there are other dogs around. In addition, the dog trainer can help you use the correct techniques and spot if you are inadvertently not acting correctly.

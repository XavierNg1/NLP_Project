 Try to make sure the post is away from areas the squirrels could access it from above, like long tree branches or fence edges. Give a clearance of about 8-10 feet from these things.The baffle will go on the bottom half of the post, to keep squirrels from accessing the feeders from the ground. So, making sure they don’t have access from the top is important if you want the baffle to work.
Bowl-shaped baffles can go on top of the feeder pole to keep out squirrels, but these baffles don’t do so well keeping out other critters, like raccoons. If raccoons aren’t a problem where you live, then a bowl-shaped baffle will probably work fine.;
, You can purchase pre-made baffles from hardware or yard supply stores, and even some of the big box department stores. You can also buy them online.


Make sure you buy the type of baffle you want—a cone or dome-shaped baffle to go over top of the feeder, or a cylindrical baffle to attach below the feeder on the post.
 With stovepipe, a stovepipe cap, metal screws, and a hose clamp, you can make your own cylindrical baffle for your feeder pole. Simply drill a hole big enough for the feeder pole in the stovepipe end cap, screw the end cap into the stovepipe to secure it, slide the stovepipe onto the pole and clip the hose clamp below it. Let the stovepipe rest on the clamp.You’ll need a drill to make your own baffle, so if you don’t have any power tools, your best option is to buy a pre-made baffle.

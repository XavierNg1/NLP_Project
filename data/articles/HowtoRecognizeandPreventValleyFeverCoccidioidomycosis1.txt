 Mild infections of Valley Fever often go unrecognized because they manifest themselves much like other common and seasonal illnesses. However, if you have been in an endemic area, you should pay attention to any early symptoms in order to avoid contracting a more serious form of the disease.


The earliest symptoms of Valley Fever include fever, headaches, a persistent cough, chest pain and shortness of breath, chills, night sweats, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and red bumpy rashes, especially on the upper body or legs.;
, If your Valley Fever goes untreated, the symptoms can become more severe, and the infection can cause chronic pneumonia. If you have been experiencing a constant fever, persistent chest pains and coughing, and weight loss, you should go to the doctor immediately.Another telling symptom of a developing infection is coughing up mucus tinged with blood, which may indicate that you have nodules in your lungs.
 In its most dangerous and advanced stages, Valley Fever can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and nervous system. At this point, you should already be in contact with your doctor, who can help you navigate these more severe symptoms.In its most serious “disseminated” form, Valley Fever will lead to skin sores, lesions in the skull and spine, bone and joint infections, and meningitis--an infection that affects the fluid and membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord.

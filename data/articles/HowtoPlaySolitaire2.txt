 If there are any aces, place them above the seven piles. If there are no aces, rearrange the cards you have, moving only the face up cards. When you place a card on top (slightly lower so that you can still see both cards), it must be a different color than the card you are placing it on top of and have a value of one less. Thus, if you have a six of hearts, you can either place a five of spades or a five of clubs on top.








Keep placing the cards on top of each other until you cannot move anymore.
Each pile should be alternating in color and move in descending order.
 The card on top of each of the seven piles should be face up. If you move a card, remember to turn the card underneath it over.
 If you have an ace above your cards, (eventually you should have all four aces there), you may move cards of the place cards of the corresponding suit on top of the pile in ascending (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) order.
 Flip over the top three cards, and see if the top one can be placed anywhere. Much of the time, there will an ace in there! If you put down the top card, see if you can put down the next. If you put down the second card, see if you can put down the last card. Then, if you put down the last card, put down another three cards from the reserve deck. If you cannot make a move with any of these cards, put them in a separate waste stack (taking care not to disturb the order). Repeat until your reserve deck has run out.










Once your reserve deck runs out, use the waste stack. However, make sure that you do not shuffle it!

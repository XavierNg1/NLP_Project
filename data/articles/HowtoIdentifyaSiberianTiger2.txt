 If you have encountered a tiger in the wild, then you can use your location to help determine whether the cat is Siberian tiger. Most tigers prefer warm weather climates. Siberian tigers, however live in the cold. This rule, however, does not apply to tigers in captivity. Zoos will import animals from all of the world, even when the local climate is very different from the animals natural habitat., One of the defining features of the Siberian subspecies is its habitat. Siberian tigers live principally in Eastern Russia. Some do, however, venture into North Korea and northern regions of China. By contrast, the second largest tiger, the Bengal tiger, lives in Indian and South East Asia., Today, Siberian tigers predominately live in remote mountainous areas. They typically prefer birch forests. In contrast, the Bengal tiger, which is of a similar size, lives in wet, tropical climates., Unlike some other large cats, tigers are solitary. The only exception is for mating. Male and female Siberian tigers will spend a few days together when they mate. The female will then bear the cubs for approximately 103 days. After birth, the mother will care for the bus for about 18 months.


There is no set time of year that Siberian tigers mate. A female, however, will generally try to mate when she is around four years old.On average, a mother Siberian tiger will birth a litter of 6 cubs. They will venture off on their own when they are old enough. Daughters will usually find territory near their mother, whereas sons will venture off further.

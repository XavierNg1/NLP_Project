, With some computers, you can easily just hold in the button on the computer, and when it boots up, you'll be given the option to run in a mode other than "Start Windows Normally".


Some websites have mentioned that people should continuously press F8, after the initial brand-screen of the computer boots up. This is another way to access this menu.
Being that you have your wired/wireless card connection unplugged, selecting "Safe Mode with Networking" is completely useless, and not necessary!

, You'll need to clean out the stored files in the cache, history, temporary files, and even cookies, along with blocking pop-up windows and even disabling some add-ons that might have been seen in the browser window that is being displayed.
 If not, most Windows operating systems can be freely updated with a firewall, by turning on the Windows Firewall. If outbound protection (which may be the case in this issue) is required, there are some programs out there (that run free of charge, and that can be downloaded and installed free-of-charge) that will protect your computer outbound too. One such program is called "PC Tools Firewall Plus" (one such place is through the CNet website).
 The first full scan may take a long bit of time, but, over time, this time may decrease a bit. A free and consistently updated program that works wonders in this process is Microsoft Security Essentials, but one of the many purchasable products works too, (if you'd rather not use any Microsoft products).
,,,, Some things may only be fixed, after you contact an IT specialist (at your business) or a local computer-fixing company (for a home-user).
 But if it starts acting up again, just disable and leave it disabled, until you've seen someone in reference to the problem.

 To retrieve a restricted number, you can pay for a service, such as "Call Unblock" or "Trapcall" that reveals the caller's number. This will only work for smartphones., If you use an app such as Facebook on your phone, you may be able to identify your caller among your suggested friends. The Facebook app spies on your calls and makes friend suggestions based on people who call you. Check through your suggested friends and see if there are any surprising faces., If the restricted number left you a voicemail or a text message, search their words online. If the number is not restricted, search the number online too. Scammers may leave the same message on many phones, and those who have been scammed often post warnings online.

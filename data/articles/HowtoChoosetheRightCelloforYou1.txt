, If you have a private teacher, see if they can come or have a student who is moving up a size, and see if you can buy theirs. They will usually know which cellos sound better.
 Talk about your price range and ask about the different types of cellos (high arched, low arched, two piece back, one piece back...).
 Even if your teacher says to choose a certain cello, but you prefer another cello, choose your cello. You should know that you will be using this cello for quite a long time. You wouldn't want to regret your decision. Remember not to be hasty, there are always other cellos in other great workshops.
 The cello may be great but the accompanying bow might not be. Ask one of the specialists and your teacher which one to get. Just like with the purchase of your cello, don't be hasty. Pick one you feel comfortable with, that feels balanced. Many people recommend getting a wooden bow, not a fiber glass one. Having two bows can also be convenient.
 If you buy a cello, the strings provided might not be the best fit. Ask a specialist and your teacher for their opinion. If no help is available, stick with the best brands, Obligato, Larsen and Jargar, or dominant for the less advanced. It is very important to have the cello well set-up to its advantage. A cello with great potential could sound poor with the wrong accessories. Do not buy Red Label strings, they are about $10 a string, but they are cheaply made and sound bad. Other types may be $40-$100 per string, but they are higher quality, last longer, and sound much better. Titanium string are more than $100 per string, but are excellent, and are extremely high quality. Make the investment if you can afford it and know that you are going to keep playing.
, If you are using a cello that is smaller than a full sized, hard cases will be hard to come by. Also, good rosin is also important.

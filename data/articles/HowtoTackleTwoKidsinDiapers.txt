 Even though the children may be going off in opposite directions, it's easy enough to deal with things one at a time in an orderly fashion to ensure things don't get overlooked, or so that you don't feel overwhelmed.;
, Don't risk an injury by keeping both children in the diaper-changing area at the same time.
 Don't allow the other to awaken unless you need to be at a certain place at a certain time which may be closing in on you sooner than you think. Time spent in any one location away from home may or may not be convenient and needed, but some things must take precedence over other activities (doctors appointments take precedence over bringing children to daycare or schooling and having to deal with diapers can be put off for a few extra minutes).
 While toddlers might have learned to control some of their actions and have had a little more time to realize that their wiggling needs to stop during changing times, infants and babies (and especially newborns) need special care.
 Make your presence known, but keep wandering eyes off of issues beyond others' controls from reacting from both child's diapers.
 They should be able to make life easy for you so you can do other things after the diaper change is complete so life can roll forward as normal.
 Unless the child is allergic to the gel used in the diaper, disposable diapers can become a mother's friend when the mother is forced to care for two kids in diapers at the same time.
 Don't exert too much energy thinking about the day training starts on the children, and don't let the training get the best of you. Let one child show the other how much "fun" training can be.
 After completing a change on the one child, check and change the other child's diaper.

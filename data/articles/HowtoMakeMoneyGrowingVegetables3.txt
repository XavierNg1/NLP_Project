 If you have a large scale production farm you can sell your produce wholesale to a cooperative or grocery store. This is a great option for farms that are located far from the consumer market. For example, your farm may be located in a very rural area with little tourist or drive by traffic. Developing a wholesale sales approach with a grocery store or cooperative will allow you to focus primarily on running the farm and will leave the individual sales to a third party.This is an excellent option if you are not comfortable communicating and networking with customers.
 Network with chefs and local restaurants and see if they are interested in purchasing fresh produce for their business. Many restaurant owners are interested in saving money on food transportation costs. By working closely with small farmers in the area, they can save money and make sure that they are serving fresh and local food.Allow the chef or restaurant owner to taste and try your vegetables so that they know they will be getting a quality product.
Invite them to tour the farm so that they can see how the vegetables are grown and understand what types of chemicals, if any, are used in the growing process.
Ask the chef what type of produce they would be interested in purchasing and see if you can accommodate their requests.
 Many local shops and markets will sell homemade foods made with local products and ingredients. Check your state cottage food laws to see what the regulations are regarding selling your own jams, jellies, and baked goods.

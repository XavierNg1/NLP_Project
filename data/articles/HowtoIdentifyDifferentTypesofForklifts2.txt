 Being the most iconic, recognized, and popular type of forklift, a standard counterbalance forklift is a forklift where the driver sits facing the forks, and the counterweight is everything behind the front wheels of the forklift., These forklifts can be powered by anything, from batteries, petrol (gasoline), diesel, LPG/propane gas bottles, and other forms of fuel, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

For example, internal combustion forklifts (petrol, LPG, diesel, etc) are generally faster and have greater lifting capacities than electric/battery-powered forklifts. However, for health and safety reasons, combustion forklifts cannot be used in confined spaces (e.g. shipping containers, small warehouses, etc) due to the exhaust gasses produced when in operation.
 They can be either 4-wheeled or 3-wheeled; two wheels at the front and one at the back allows for greater maneuverability, at the expense of stability. This is why 4-wheeled forklifts are usually more common, as they generally still have more than enough maneuverability for most applications in small spaces.

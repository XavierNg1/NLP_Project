 Broken bones in dogs are most commonly associated with a trauma or accident, such as being hit by a car or falling from a height. The dog will be lame and not able to walk evenly on all four legs. He may hold the fractured legs up and limp heavily when he puts it on the ground. Your dog may whine or whimper while trying to move or walk.If your dog has broken his spine, he may be paralyzed.Some breaks are easy to spot because you see the end of the bone sticking through the skin. Other types are more subtle, such as a slight bow in the leg or even just a limp.
However, this does not mean he has definitely fractured a bone since a sprain, cut, migrated grass seed, or infection could also produce these signs.
 If you suspect that your dog has a broken bone, the first thing you should do is take measures to limit his activity. Get your dog to rest in one place. You can put the dog in his crate or encourage him to rest on his bed.If you believe your dog has broken his back, move him by putting a piece of wooden board or cardboard beneath him.
Do not take your dog out for a walk or encourage any other physical activity since putting weight on a broken bone can further separate the bone ends and worsen the fracture.
 Another way you may be able to tell if your dog has a broken bone is to compare one leg with the other. Carefully check to see if both legs look the same or if one leg is bent oddly or shorter than the opposite side.Also look for swelling joints or joints at odd angles.
If in doubt about whether your dog has a broken bone, confine the dog to his crate and call your vet for advice.

 Go to the Pillow Room to find a nice person to bond and make friends with. It's recommended that you ignore the roleplayers and family makers at this stage because all they're interested in is gathering as many people to do their bidding as they can possibly find. Instead, you're after players who genuinely want to connect, chat and have fun times together whenever you connect online.


Don't expect friendship making to happen in a hurry. It will take time to build up many buddies on Animal Jam. Give yourself time to fill up that buddy list.;
, To make a friend, be a friend. Show others that you're approachable, ready to chat and happy to buddy up. Say nice things to others you meet, compliment them and be supportive.


Be yourself. This will help you to attract like-minded friends.
 If you can't find anyone interesting to begin with, try to launch a party in your awesome den. If at least seven people come, you have 99 percent chance of getting a new friend from one of those seven people!


Work hard on how to make your den as interesting as can be. This may encourage people to like it and want to come again!

, Many jammers go to parties, as there's a big chance of getting buddies at them. Be pleasant and friendly.
 Ask players you know of from your school, church/mosque/synagogue, after-school club, etc., and other people you know in the real world to buddy you. If they like Animal Jam as much as you do, you can add them as a friend from the real world!

,, Maybe your buddy's buddy might want to come into your den and you can bond with he/she and make friends with yet another great buddy!

, There is no need to be rare or cool to be a good friend. Just be yourself because being kind is the way to make and keep a friend. Maybe one day you can be the most popular jammer on Animal Jam but that really isn't the point, is it?

, If they're online, be sure to play with them.

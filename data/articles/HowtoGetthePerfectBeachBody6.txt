Do not weigh yourself everyday. This will drive you crazy. Everybody's weight fluctuates naturally day-to-day, which can mostly be attributed to water weight.
Remember that muscle weighs more than fat. If you are exercising a lot, you are probably gaining some muscle. Thus, your measurements are more important than the number on the scale.

 Comb your hair very gently and avoid combing it frequently. Start combing at the ends and untangle those first and work your way up towards the scalp; never place your comb at the scalp and pull it through tangled hair, this will rip out your hair and cause it to be very thin.
 Drink plenty of water every day to keep your hair moisture rich from the inside. Your hair will bounce and move more easily and will not break easily or often. If you notice your hair bouncing and moving less its important to drink more water.
 Nighttime can be damaging to your hair if you sleep on any type of fabric. Traditionally it has been said to sleep on a satin scarf or pillowcase. This is the only material which will prevent your hair from drying out at night.
 Never use greases on relaxed hair. Tradition has always taught African American women to smother their hair with all types of grease in the name of beauty. The use of hair greases has lead to irreparable damage, breakage and blockage of pores. It is impossible to sustain healthy hair and scalp if you use hair greases. Your scalp naturally produces its own oils which should be enough to keep your hair healthy. If you prefer greases, just keep an eye on your hair. If your hair becomes dry, greasy, stiff or brittle it is most likely related to the use of hair greases. Although natural oils are good for the hair such as olive, coconut, jojoba and etc. They give the hair good shine and helps to rebuild damaged hair as a natural conditioner.

 Dogs typically give birth after 60 days. You will know when your dog is ready as she will begin to make a nest in her whelping box with blankets and toys. Take the dog’s temperature every few hours. The temperature will drop to below 100 °F (38 °C) roughly twenty-four hours before the delivery. When your dog’s cervix dilates, she is ready to give birth.Once you notice nesting behavior, you may want to line the whelping box with newspaper. Once the birth is over, you can toss out the newspaper and replace it with blankets., In most cases, you will not need to do anything to help your dog give birth. Do watch the birth carefully in case something does go wrong. In some cases, you may be able to step in and solve the problem.


Puppies are born inside membrane sacs. The mother removes these by licking them. If your dog does not remove the sac, you should try opening it yourself within a few minutes of its birth. Break the membrane around the puppy’s head with your hands, and peel it back. Rub away any fluids or mucus around the puppy’s mouth and nose.
If the mother still won’t lick the puppy, rub the puppy gently in a towel to help it breathe.
Count the puppies and the placentas. There should be one placenta for every puppy. If there isn’t, it may be stuck in your dog. Call your vet.If the mother does not chew off the umbilical cord, you can tie it off and cut it yourself, either using scissors or tearing it with your hands., Keep your vet’s number on hand should there be any problem with the dog’s delivery. You may even want to have the number of an emergency vet if yours is unavailable. You should call the vet if:


Your dog has contractions for over 30 minutes without whelping a puppy
The dog does not give birth within 24 hours of her temperature dropping
The dog’s pregnancy lasts longer than seventy days

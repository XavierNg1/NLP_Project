 They have three chambers, one for water (A), one for grounds (B) and one for the finished product (C).

The bottom chamber is for the water. It usually has a pressure valve as well.
The middle chamber is for your finely ground coffee. Pack it in lightly.
The top chamber is the collection point for the brewed espresso / coffee.
 Throw the product away. This step is only to clean the machine and test the function of the pressure valve. Repeat this three times to ensure that all the parts are clean., It should be filled to half an inch or 1 centimeter (0.39 in) below the valve.
Add medium-fine grounds to the basket. Do NOT tamp! Make sure that there are no grounds at the edges of the funnel and the bottom chamber.
Place the filled basket in place and screw the top on snugly.
Place the moka pot onto the heat source, and adjust the temperature to the maximum level, such that the flame, if (using a stove), does not extend beyond the edge of the pot. The steam valve should not point toward you. Turn off the heat source when espresso,(black coffee),stops, and allow cream to come out. If you do not turn off the heat source, the coffee, especially if dark-roast, will be burned by the steam in the bottom chamber.
 Do not let children touch the pot when it is still hot. Allow fifteen minutes for pot to cool, or run it under cold water, before cleaning., Do not use a dishwasher; instead wash it out by hand without soap.

Steam not getting through the grinds—either the grinds are too fine, or the grinds are too tightly packed.;

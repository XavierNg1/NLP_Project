 Free Online Screenshot is a handy screenshot tool for you to produce Skype screenshots efficiently. This tool is located in the home page of screenshot.net and does not require any registration, license fees, installation or other hassles.
 Visit the site, then hit the “Take Screenshot” button on it and you will get to the interface of this tool after allowing a Java Applet.
 Click the “Quick Screenshot Mode” on the interface to commence screen capture and your mouse cursor will turn into cross-hairs. Hover it on the dialog box of Skype (or video call window), hit your mouse as soon as you could see a frame appears around the borders, and then the screenshot is done.
 Upon your confirmation of the screenshot, you will find two bars with rich options appearing on the sides of it. These options are provided for you to edit, add comments to, save and share your screenshot. Forward to the horizontal bar and you are able to enhance the graph with lines, shapes, color, etc. Moreover, you can annotate it by using texts, highlights, blurs and more. All of these changes will take effect for the screenshot immediately.
 Right after you are done with the above steps, you can simply hit the “Disc” icon on vertical bar to save the screenshot to an indicated directory. With that image in your local drive, you can easily drag it to a dialog box to share with others.
 If you’re willing to post that screenshot to your social accounts, the publisher also provides free space for storing the images (all of your files will be under protection). In order to do so, you may click on the “Social Share” icon on vertical bar, select a social symbol from the list and then sign in your account to post it.

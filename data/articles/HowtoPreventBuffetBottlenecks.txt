 It is not a good idea to set up the table so that one side is blocked or pushed up against a wall or window. The more that guests can flow around the whole table, the better.;
, at both ends of the table. This will encourage guests to start from either end rather than all congregating at one end. It will also encourage people to continue their conversations in pairs as they obtain their meal choices.
 Again, this alleviates the need for everyone standing at the same spot waiting for sauce, pickles or salt and pepper.
 Some foods, like salads and baskets of bread rolls, can be easily divided so that you put equal portions at either end of the table. This will also alleviate the need for slowing down the flow at one end.
 As guests work their way from either side, they will meet in the central part of the table to obtain the substantial part of the meal. Provide two sets of tongs, large spoons etc., placed on resting plates either side of the main course dishes. At this point, guests can use their own etiquette to wait patiently for one another.

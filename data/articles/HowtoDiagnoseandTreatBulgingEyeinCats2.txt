 If the eye is dislodged and eye socket damaged, the vet will need to perform surgery to put the eye back into place. Alternatively, if the eye is not salvageable, they will remove it.The vet will also place stitches and stents at the surgical site. These will be removed in one to three weeks, depending on the scope of the injury.
The vet may advise dental extractions to release an infection and let it drain out into your cat’s mouth, rather than pushing the eye forward.
 Treating a bulging eye due to a bacterial infection involves a regimen of antibiotic or corticosteroid eye drops, or a combination of the two. Be sure to apply eye drops and any other medications according to the vet’s instructions.In cases of injury, the vet will also prescribe anti-inflammatories and antibiotics, either in the form of eye drops or pills. Be sure to administer these as directed.

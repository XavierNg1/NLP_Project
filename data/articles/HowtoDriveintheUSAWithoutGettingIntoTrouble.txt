 Do not assume that other drivers will act the same. People often drive while using cell phones, read maps, eat, drink or groom themselves while driving and are often not aware of other vehicles. Learn defensive driving techniques. Abrupt lane changes are not uncommon in areas popular with tourists and visitors.;
, In rural areas avoid driving on the highway at night, as you might run in to animals (fairly common), cars with no lights (somewhat common), drunks behind the wheel (common on weekends) or people just walking around on the side of the road (uncommon). Drunks in traffic is a problem, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. There is also a strange habit of young people sitting on the curb with legs sprawled onto the road - be aware as they will play chicken and will not move for you. The law might not side with you if you run over idiotic teenager's legs.
 Flashing your high beams at a slower driver in front of you is illegal in most states and will only irritate the other driver. A left turn signal from the car in front of you doesn't necessarily mean you can pass. Be extra careful when you want to turn left and make sure nobody tries to pass you.
 In many downtown metropolitan zones, do not turn left onto a street in the middle of a block, the only way out of a parking lot in such a place is to turn right and go around the block.
 Also in many downtown metropolitan areas, be careful of one-way roads. Look to see what direction the parked cars are facing before you turn.
 Not respecting lanes is a good way to get into an accident and provoke the ire of the police and other drivers. This doesn't mean they will stay in one lane, however. Often (especially in metropolitan areas) they will abruptly change lanes, but straddling lanes is taboo.

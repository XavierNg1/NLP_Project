 The objective may be to improve relationships between group members by highlighting the strengths of each participant.
 Start with icebreaker activities that allow teenagers to get to know one another. For example, ask all participants to write down a personal strength on a piece of paper and toss the paper into the middle of the table. The positive qualities of each person can then be written on the board for everyone to see.
 This allows each participant to focus on the strengths of others and themselves.

 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.
 Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.
 If you are in a location with high humidity, you may need to raise the temperature to 125 °F (52 °C).
 Leave space around each sprig, and place the tray in the dehydrator. This will ensure that air in the dehydrator will circulate around the parsley evenly.
 Monitor the parsley periodically, and remove it when it is dry. If the leaves crumble and the stems break instead of bend, then the parsley is dry.


It can take anywhere from one to four hours to fully dehydrate the parsley, depending on your machine.
 Keep it in a cool, dry place.

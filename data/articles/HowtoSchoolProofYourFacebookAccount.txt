 It may be fun to swear and badmouth others on Facebook, but if you are adding a teacher, you need to get rid of this behaviour right away. You want to appear as a mature, young adult, to impress your teacher and make him/her see that you aren't rude or abusive.;
, Remove any bad wall posts, comments, and statuses. These include hate clubs, anything with swearing, or text suggesting you are a bad student. You should not be doing such things anyway, because it may upset or offend other people that you've added on Facebook. If you have, now is the time to fix it.
 Clear out anything that is derogatory. You don't have to use proper punctuation or spelling, but it's wise to make your posts legible. Even though you may be a fan of several pages, look at the names of them all and "unlike" any bad ones - these include anti-studying/anti-school pages, hate clubs, or anything that may suggest a rude, mean nature.
 From now on, if your friends post bad content on your wall, send them a private inbox message and ask them not to. It may be wise to warn them in advance that you now have a teacher on your account, so that they will know not to post anything inappropriate.

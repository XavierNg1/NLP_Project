 Before you can use Square to accept payments, you'll need to add items to sell. Go to https://squareup.com/dashboard/.
 Click ITEMS. Click Create an Item.
 In the Item field, type an item name. In the Regular field, type an item price. Click Save.


All of the other fields are optional, but let you add things like Categories, Descriptions, and Inventory amounts.

 If you want your host’s dog to stop bothering you, then you will need to ignore the dog. An effective way to ignore a dog is to refrain from making eye contact. Do not look at the dog at all. It might be tempting to look at the dog, especially if it is in your face, but be vigilant.Look above the dog, or turn your head to the side.
 When the dog comes near you, refrain from petting the dog, as well. Cross your arms so the dog cannot lick, sniff, or mouth your hands. If you are sitting down, use your legs to create distance between you and the dog.For example, close your knees so the dog cannot get too close to you.
 Try to remember that any kind of contact, including talking to the dog, can be regarded as attention by the dog. Even if you are telling the dog “No” or “Stop”, the dog can still interpret this as attention. If you give the dog attention, it will be more likely to come back for more.If the dog jumps up on the couch while you are sitting down, immediately get up and move to another area to sit.

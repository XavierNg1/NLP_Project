 Create a study plan by outlining your study goals, and how much time you will spend studying and reviewing each week. It is important that you write your study plan down so that you can stick to it.Identify and write down your study goal. For example, “I want to be prepared for my pop quizzes.” In a planner or on a calendar, set aside how many hours per week you think you will need to be prepared for your pop quiz. Then, find times throughout the week where you can fit in your study hours. For example, one hour after dinner, one hour each Saturday, or one hour before or after work.
 While reading your chapter assignments, take detailed notes. Take notes on information your teacher presented in class. Write out the definitions of new words you encounter. Take notes on concepts and ideas you do not fully understand so you can ask them in class the next day.


When taking notes, follow the chapter order. This will make your notes logical and easier to study., When taking notes, make flash cards of important information so you can review this information easily. Make your flash cards by writing down key concepts and ideas one side, and the answers or explanations on the other side. Try to review your flash cards at least three times a week, or before you sleep.
 To test your knowledge, do the practice tests at the end of each chapter. Spend extra time studying the information that you got wrong. Include the information you missed in your flash cards so you won’t get it wrong on the pop quiz.


If your book doesn’t have practice tests at the end of each chapter, you can make your own practice tests. Make your own practice tests by creating questions based off of your notes. Make these questions open-ended questions where you have to write out the answers. By writing out the answers, you will remember the information better.
Have a friend create a practice test for you. This is a great way to make preparing for pop quizzes fun and effective.

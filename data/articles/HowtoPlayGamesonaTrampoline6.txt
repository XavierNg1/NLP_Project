 Choose any soft large ball like a volleyball or a basketball.
 Once standing, have someone throw the ball in the air and yell out: "Cherry Bomb!"

, If you are hit, you lose a 1 out of 5 lives. If the ball falls off the trampoline, everyone loses a life.
 Swap around the ball thrower and keep playing until everyone is tired.

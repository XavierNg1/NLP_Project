 In this mode, the tengwa is read first, followed by the tehta underneath it, then the tehta on top. Therefore, vowels are placed on the letter before them. Using these rules, the tengwa above would be read as tye.
 These are two vowels pronounced as one sound. In all other vowel combinations, each vowel must be pronounced individually.
 If you have an r followed by a vowel, use the left tengwa. If you have an r followed by a consonant or at the end of a word, use the right tengwa.
 The table above gives the tengwar values for this mode.
 Learn them well:


The first tengwa is only used for an s that developed from a th. E.g. Sauron was originally spelt Thauron, so it uses the first tengwa. Otherwise, use the second tengwa.
The third tengwa is only used in Classical Quenya, where it has the value nw.
The fourth tengwa is only used initially (at the start of a word). In Classical Quenya, it has the value ngw.
The fifth tengwa is only used initially, as the carrier for a y-tehta.
The sixth tengwa can be used for a v that developed from a w. E.g. Vilya (Elrond's ring of power) was originally Wilya (meaning air), so it is spelt with this tengwa.
The seventh tengwa is used in front of an unvoiced, initial r or l

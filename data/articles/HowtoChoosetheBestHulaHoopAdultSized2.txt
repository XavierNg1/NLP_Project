 Hula hoops that are larger and heavier are great for beginners because the added weight gives the hoop more momentum as it moves around you making it easier to keep the hoop up. Heavier hoops are also suggested if you are learning a new skill or trick.
 If you are under 5 foot 4 inches (10.2Â cm) and relatively slim you will want to find a lighter hoop with a smaller tubing diameter. A smaller tubing diameter will make it easier for you to grip the hoop with your hands. A lighter hoop will also be easier to maneuver for a person with a small frame. , A hula hoop without grips can be slippery and difficult to keep up even for someone who is experienced. Purchasing a hula hoop with grips will allow you to have fuller contact with the hoop. Grips should be placed along the inner ring of the hoop to be the most effective. You can also wrap grips around the hoop to allow for fuller contact. Types of grips include: Sandpaper: use 100 grit or 80 grit sandpaper around the inner tubing, and add grooves into the hoop, which gives more texture for your hands, clothes, and body to connect with.
Griptape: is twisted around the hoop and comes in a variety of colors.
Hoop wax: is translucent and rubbed onto the hoop in the desired area. It is very sticky.

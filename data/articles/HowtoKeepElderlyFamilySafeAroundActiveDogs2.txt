 The easiest way to keep elderly people safe around active dogs is to keep them separated. This may mean putting the dog in its crate, out in the yard, or in a separate room that is closed off while an elderly person is visiting.Placing an active dog in an isolated location may require that you train it not to bark or cry as well. In some cases an active dog that is isolated from the group my be very upset about that isolation.
 If you cannot put the dog in a totally separate room, you can at least force it to keep physical distance from the elderly person. Place baby gates or obstacles in the way that keep the dog in a separate space from the elderly person.This solution works best for dogs that cannot jump and that will not use their brute strength to knock down an obstacle.
Also, using a baby gate does not keep your dog from barking or whining incessantly. In order to stop this, you will need to train it not to.
 If the dog needs to be in the same room as the elderly person, then you will need to keep a firm hold on it. This is most easily done by keeping a leash on it and holding that leash tightly.If you have a harness on the dog this can also be used to hold onto the dog and make sure it does not knock over or otherwise injure the elderly person you are around.

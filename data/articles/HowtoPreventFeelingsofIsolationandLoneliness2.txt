 There will be times that you can’t be around other people for some reason or another. Perhaps you are sick and don’t want to get others sick or maybe you are spending a weekday at home while everyone else is at school or at work. You can handle these times and prevent feeling isolated or lonely if you use the time as an opportunity to get to know yourself better.Make a list of all the things you want to do in life. You might surprise yourself by some of the things you want to experience. For example, you may think about it and realize you want to learn fencing.
Spend some time meditating. This is a great way to reduce stress, improve your focus and concentration, and allow you to explore your thoughts and emotions.
 Instead of allowing feelings of isolation and loneliness to overcome you, you can enjoy your time alone by using it to explore and develop some of your hobbies and interests. When you are doing things you enjoy and find interesting, you may be less likely to feel that you aren’t connected to others.


Make a list of hobbies or activities that you have been wanting to try. Include group activities, but also include solo activities like gardening, writing poetry, painting, or blogging.
 Social networking and other uses of technology can help you prevent feeling isolated and lonely, but logging in all the time can also prevent you from forming true connections with people.Use technology as a way to connect with people and to keep in touch when you can’t see each other in person, but don’t let it become a substitute for face-to-face contact.


For example, joining online groups and forums is a good way to meet other people. Be careful, though, with the information that you share over the internet with people that you don’t know in person.
Instead of emailing or texting your friend, give them a call, do a video conference, or better yet, make plans to spend time together.

 Position the front of the headband so that it either rests on the top of your forehead or an inch or two back on top of your hair. Move the back portion of the headband wherever you want your tuck to be. A popular position is the nape of the neck., It must be both tight enough to stay in place all day and loose enough for hair to be tucked into. Your headband should not slide around at all on your head. You should be able to slide two to three fingers comfortably underneath the headband. Don't wear a headband that feels like it's pinching your head.
 Begin from the front and work in sections. Take a strand of hair into your hand and roll it inward and underneath the headband.


If your hairdo is looking too flat, add some volume. Take a styling comb and gently insert it under the hair at your crown and/or tucked into the headband. Carefully lift the comb to pull the hair out slightly. Re-tuck any strands that you may have accidently loosened out of the headband completely.

 Be sure to remove excess dirt and debris from the bottom of your combat boots by purchasing a doormat designed for cleaning the underside of boots and shoes. Different models of this kind of mat are available with bristles, rubber spikes, or grooves. Look for one at local hardware stores, department stores, or online.


For instance, the JobSite Boot Scrubber Brush Mat, available online for approximately $17, is a door mat with a wood and plastic base and solid bristles to remove mud and dirt from boots and shoes.;
, After removing your boots for the day, wipe them down with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust and dirt. A micro-fibre cleaning cloth is the best bet for this daily maintenance. Focus on the surface of the boots as well as the seams., If stubborn dirt remains after you wipe down your boots, use a toothbrush to continue cleaning. Place boots on top of paper towels, or on an easy to clean surface. Use small, circular motions to loosen caked on grime.

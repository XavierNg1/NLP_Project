 If you’re playing with a child, it’s easier to have them choose a number between 1 and 10.Example 1: 8.
Example 2: 43.



Example 1: 8 x 2 = 16 + 10 = 26.
Example 2: 43 x 2 = 86 + 10 = 96.



Example 1: 26 / 2 = 14.
Example 2: 96 / 2 = 48.
 Unless incorrect math has been performed, the answer will always be “5.”Example 1: 14 – 9 = 5.
Example 2: 48 – 43 = 5.
Respond with, "Is your secret number 5?"

, Begin by asking someone to think about the last 2 digits of the year they were born.It should be someone you don’t know since the trick depends on you not knowing their birthday. Have them add that number to the age they’ll be at the end of the year. They can write it down on a piece of paper if that helps them do the math more easily. Make sure that they don’t let you see it.


Example 1: Born in 1981. So 81 + 35 (age) = 116.
Example 2: Born in 1999. So 99 + 17 (age) = 116.
 The only exceptions are for people born in or after the year 2000. If you know or suspect that the person was born in or after the year 2000, the answer will always be “16” rather than “116.”


Example: The birth year is 2003, so the last 2 digits of the year are 03.
If the person adds the age they’ll be at the end of the year to that number, it will always be 16. In this case, a person born in 2003 is 13 years old.
03 + 13 = 16.
Note that the invariable answer depends on the current year. In the year 2017, the answer will always be 117 (17 if born in or after 2000). In 2018 the answer will always be 118 (or 18), and so on.

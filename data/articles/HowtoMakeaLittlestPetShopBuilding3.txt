Cut a large square for the base.






Cut a short rectangle that has the same length as the base and glue or tape it on the side. This will be the headboard.






Cut a rectangle with a width of about 2 inches/5cm and the same length of the headboard.This will go on top of the headboard, and if you like, make this wider, to be just above the end of the base. Get a piece of cardboard that reaches down to the end of the base and glue or tape it on to make a canopy.






Get some very short pieces of cardboard. Put them in the front and sides except for directly under the area on top of the headboard. For that part, get 2 little rectangles that reach from the area on top of the headboard to the base. You're done!






To really customize it, get an old tee or a shirt and cut out bedspread and pillows. To make pillows fluffy, get a rectangle of fabric, size of choice and get some cotton balls and arrange however you want. Now, fold it in half and staple or sew closed.
 Stores sell lots of housewares, so this makes doll house items ideal.


Mix up playsets. You can mix up any miniature toys you own to create store stock.
 These can be made from all sorts of things, for example:


Go to a carpet or curtain store and ask for sample offcuts. Tell them what it's for and they'll often be willing to help.
Cut up old, unwanted clothes. Ask your parents for the rag bag.
Crochet or knit small rugs. Or use your patchwork skills to make a carpet or rug.
Cut up pictures of flooring materials and glue in place.

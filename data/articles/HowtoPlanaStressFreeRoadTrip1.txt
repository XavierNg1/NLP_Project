 This is an important part of organising a trip. You should have a well oriented plan for your trip. Note down places you want to visit.


It's better to make a list of 4 to 5 places for a distance below 500 miles.
If you are planning for a distance between 500 miles and 1000 miles then you should list out around 15 places.
If the trip is for a distance above 1000 miles, you should add a destination for every 100 miles.;
, You should prepare a detailed budget for your trip. Estimate the cost of needs individually. Don’t be so lavish and try to get your stuffs at a very low cost by considering a minimum quality.


Always carry money more than your need. Try to keep half of your money in some online wallets or in your ATM.
 Also, check online regarding those destination and their tourist attractions.


Check availability of hotels and refreshments.
 Carry more than one copy of route maps of places you are planning to visit.

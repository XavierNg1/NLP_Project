 If vegetable sources are your primary calcium source, you may have to eat considerably more than the listed 1000 mg total to get adequate amounts of calcium for your body to use. One of the reasons for this is because the body has difficulty absorbing their nutrients, so youâ€™ll need to eat more of the vegetables to ensure that you would be absorbing enough into your system.
 Some 1 oz. servings of fortified cereals provide a full daily recommended amount of calcium, while others may only offer a small portion. Most people will get enough calcium from a single serving of cereal with 1 cup of fortified soy milk and a lunch or dinner that contains a single vegetable or protein source of calcium.

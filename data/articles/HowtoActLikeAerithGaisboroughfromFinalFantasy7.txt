 To have compassion is the basis for all kindness to others. Try to understand the way other people feel and treat them accordingly. Be polite and discreet to those you do not like, and avoid these people in general.;
, Try your best to cheer people up, but donâ€™t ever become a doormat, Aerith's character was certainly very independent.
 Aerith was described as having a bright smile that comforted the other characters

, Aerith basically was living near the slums, she had to be smart and take care of herself. Avoid alley ways at night, stay in public, crowded places and know your way around the area.
 Once of her main associations was nature, hence her bright green eyes

, When you are passionate about something, stand up for what you believe in, and when you set your mind on something or make a decision close to your heart, stick with it just like Aerith did!

, Talk to people, make friends with everyone. Aerith was beloved by all her fellow characters and was always very kind to them. In the Game she was described having spent time with Tifa though they were separated.
 Always seek more knowledge. Aerith, despite her cheerful appearance, harboured the truth of Sephiroth in her mind, and always had an idea as to how the other characters were feeling. Stay humble in your search for wisdom as well!

, Take a shower or bath every night, use a light, sweet, floral perfume and wear simple, clean, pretty clothes. If you are cosplaying take time to look for the best fabrics, materials etc. Practise her hair and makeup ready for the day of the cosplay.

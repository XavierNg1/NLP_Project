 You can build a bookshelf to fit a particular space in your home or make one that's a standard size so that it can work in a variety of locations.









Measure the space where the bookshelf will sit. Decide how tall you want the finished shelf unit to be and how wide. Bookshelves are traditionally 12" or 16" deep; of course, you can customize to suit your needs.
Decide if your bookshelf will have an open or a closed back. If you keep the back open, your books may lean on or touch the wall behind the bookshelf.
Decide it you'll use it to house paperback, hardback or coffee table-sized books. For maximum versatility, this project uses adjustable shelving so any size book will fit.
Standard bookshelves come in two-, three-, four- and five-shelf varieties, but you can make as many shelves as you want for your project.;
, The wood you use will greatly impact the finished look of your piece as well as its cost and durability. Since solid wood could cost thousands of dollars, you'll likely want to use plywood with a hardwood veneer.Choose a 3/4" plywood for the body and shelves of the bookshelf, and a 1/4" piece of plywood for the back.









A plywood sheet is 4' wide, but keep in mind that a saw blade takes off 1/8". Calculate how many 8' long boards you can get from one sheet and use that to figure out how many sheets you will need. For this project, you'll need just one sheet.
Wood veneers:Birch: best choice if you plan to paint your bookcaseMaple: good base for a variety of stainsMahogany, Teak, Walnut, Cherry: These specialty woods may require a special order. Use a clear finish so the beauty of the wood shines through.

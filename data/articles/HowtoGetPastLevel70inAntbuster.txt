Click on the "Antbuster" picture to go to the game.

The reason you are doing this is because this is the original version of the game. This version will let you upgrade farther than any other version. (All cannons are more expensive than any other version but it's worth it to be able to upgrade farther).;
, You now have ten seconds to start placing cannons. If you mess up, then click on the clock, then click on end match.
, At the bottom, some buttons should pop up. Immediately upgrade these to Heavy Cannon 1 (Click the first button). Then upgrade them to Impact Cannon 1 (Click the second button).
 Every time you get a new Quick Cannon 4, the speed and damage will increase by one.
 Place these parallel to the Impact Cannons.
,, Wait awhile, until you have enough to upgrade those two Quick Cannons 2 into Quick Cannons 3. It's definitely worth the price.
 Click on the two Impact Cannons and upgrade the to Ice Cannons.
,, Upgrade the Quick Cannons into Quick Cannons 4.
 Let's upgrade those ice cannons into Ice Cannons 2 so they will have better range and will freeze the ants faster.
 By the time you get that third Ice Cannon 2, you should be at level 70, more or less.
 The rest will all be Quick Cannons 4. So add another Quick Cannon 4 above the first two Ice Cannons. Now you should at least be at level 80.
 In this example, six ants were killed almost simultaneously. That means that six ants spawned almost simultaneously. All of them got past the cannons, picked up a slice of cake (regaining all lost health), and went through their hole. People have gotten to level 100 before with this strategy.

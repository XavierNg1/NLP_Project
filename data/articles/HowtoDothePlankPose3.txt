 When you let your rear dip, you compromise the stability of your lower back, and can end up really hurting yourself. To correct this, you need to engage your core, pulling your bellybutton toward your spine.Keeping you head down will also help you keep your back in alignment.


Consider asking a friend to lay a broomstick or yardstick on your back. Having an objective reference may help you keep your pose straight. The top of the stick should touch your head, and the bottom of the stick should rest between your buttocks. The stick should rest between your shoulder blades., This is the opposite problem of collapsing your lower back — you are lifting your butt too high, which does not engage your core. Again, the solution is keeping your core tight. Pull your bellybutton in toward your spine, keeping your back in a flat, straight line.If your plank looks like the downward dog yoga pose, you need to drop your butt until your back is straight., The positioning of your head and neck may seem like a minor detail while you're struggling to keep your core engaged, but you risk injury and strain to your neck if you let your head droop. Instead of allowing it to hang, focus on a spot on the matt or floor that is between your hands but about a foot out in front of you., You may find yourself holding your breath as you struggle to hold the plank position. But forgetting to breathe while exercising can cause dizziness and nausea.Be intentional about your breathing as you hold the pose.
 Your form and focus are more important than the length of your planking session. When you can no longer hold your form, it’s time to stop.If you are compromising your form, you are no longer receiving the full benefit of the exercise, and you may end up injuring yourself.

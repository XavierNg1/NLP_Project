 To keep the carrots from sticking to the slow cooker, you must grease it. Use a nonstick cooking spray to coat the interior before adding the ingredients.Be sure to use a slow cooker that holds at least 4 quarts (3.8 l).
You can use a slow cooker liner instead of greasing the slow cooker if you prefer.
 When the slow cooker is greased, add 2 pounds (900 g) of ready-to-eat baby carrots and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter. Toss the two together so the carrots are completely coated., Once the carrots and butter are mixed, cover the slow cooker. Allow the carrots to cook on high heat for 3 to 4 hours, or until they are tender.Halfway through cooking, it’s a good idea to stir the carrots to ensure that they’re heating evenly.
 While the carrots are cooking, add ½ cup (100 g) of firmly packed brown sugar, 1 ½ teaspoons (3 g) of ground cinnamon, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground ginger, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to a small bowl. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully mixed and set aside for the moment., When the carrots are almost finished cooking, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over them in the slow cooker. Stir the mixture well to ensure that the carrots are fully coated.You should add the cinnamon sugar mixture to the carrots just before you’re ready to serve them.
 Once the carrots have been tossed with the cinnamon sugar mixture, use a spoon to place them in a serving dish or bowl. Spoon any sauce that may be remaining in the slow over over them and serve the carrots while still warm.

 Choose a set day of the week to pick up trash. This can include trash in containers at home and junk you may have in your car.
 Schedule a reminder on your smartphone, or another device, to take out the trash. Set your schedule based on trash pickup times.
 You can find trash bags at the grocery store and most retail establishments.


Trash cans are standard in size, especially those used in the kitchen. Many trash cans are measured in gallons.
There are odor absorbing and scented trash bags available in stores.
 Cleaning the trash can every few months can help to reduce odor and insects. Use warm soapy water for general cleaning. You can also use a mild disinfectant to sterilize the trash can to reduce odor.

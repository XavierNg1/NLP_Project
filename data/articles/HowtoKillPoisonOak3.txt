 Use plastic sheeting to cover poison oak plants that are in a contained area. This works best if you first cut the plant down to a few inches above the ground. The dead roots must be removed and discarded properly, or they'll come back.
 Heat up your tea kettle until the water has come to a rolling boil. Take it outside and pour it near the roots of the poison oak plant. The boiling water should kill the plant - but again, you'll need to get rid of the roots. This method is better for small plants. Large shrubs probably won't be affected.


If you use this method, be very careful not to breathe in any steam that rises from the boiled plant.
 Goats love to eat poison oak - they aren't affected by the oils - and since they're always hungry, they can clear out an are riddled with the stuff in no time at all. This is a great natural way to get rid of poison oak plants. Check around to see if there's a goat farm in your area. It's becoming increasingly popular for goat owners to hire out their goats for natural landscape management.


If you go this route, you'll need to get the roots in order to make sure the plants grow back. However, you could instead hire goats every spring to keep them maintained.
Interestingly, goats that eat poison oak produce milk that's free of the toxic oils., This method might be worth a try, especially for smaller plants. Fill a spray bottle with undiluted white vinegar and spray the leaves and stems of the poison oak plants in your area. In a few days, the plants should die. Remove the roots if you don't want them to grow back.
 Since poison oak tends to thrive in "disturbed" areas with bare soil, you can prevent it from invading by planting other plants to take up that open space.

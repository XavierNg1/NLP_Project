 Violets need to be grown in a semi-shaded position but are fairly tolerant provided they do not dry out. They need to be protected from the hot afternoon sun in hot climates but if you live in a cool climate, you can grow them in full sun.;
, Soil pH should be around 6.0 - 7.5; add lime to lessen acidic soils. The soil should be well-drained. Enrich it with well-decayed compost and/or manure. If you have clay soils, add plenty of grit, decayed vegetable refuse and manure; light and gravelly soils should be improved through the addition of a liberal amount of cow manure and loam or clay mixed in. If grown in the open, the violets prefer a moderately heavy rich soil.
 If you already have some violet plants growing, or know someone who has established violets, use these for propagation. Simply break off a small section that has roots, pot it up for a few weeks until established and then plant out. Spring or autumn is perhaps the best time to do this, but you will probably find that it works well just about any time. This should be done every 2 years once you have an established violet garden, to achieve best growing results. If you have seeds, note that seed is best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. The seed requires a period of cold stratification and the germination of stored seed can be erratic. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer.
 Plant either in rows or in a more creative pattern that suits your garden space.
 Violets need a moist soil and should not be allowed to dry out.
, The flowers are usually produced in abundance in late winter and early spring.

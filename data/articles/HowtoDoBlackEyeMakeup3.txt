 Apply black eyeshadow to the outer corner of your eye, sweeping it up in an arc just above the crease line and down across your lash line.
 Add a vibrant color of shadow like purple or blue to the eyelid, with a darker shade closer to your black shadow and a lighter shade closer to the inside corner. Then blend the lighter shade, darker shade, and black together with a soft brush to create an even gradient just like a normal smokey eye.
 Use a pencil, gel, or liquid black eyeliner to draw an even line across your top lash line, from inside corner to outside corner, staying as close to the lash line as possible. You can line the bottom lash line in the same way if you like.
 Use a light or white eyeshadow or highlighter in the inner corner of your eyes to complete the gradient. You can also use the same or a lighter shade of the color you have on your inner lid for the corner., Apply mascara by sweeping the brush from roots to tip, repeating several times.

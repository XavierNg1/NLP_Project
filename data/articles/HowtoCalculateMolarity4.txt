 Identify the values provided to you in the problem: mass in grams and volume in milliliters.




Mass = 5.2 g NaCl
Volume = 800 ml water



, Do this by adding together the molar mass of sodium, Na, and the molar mass of chlorine, Cl.


The molar mass of Na = 22.99 g
The molar mass of Cl = 35.45 g
The molar mass of NaCl = 22.99 + 35.45 = 58.44 g

, In this instance, the molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g, so the conversion factor is 1 mol / 58.44 g.


Moles NaCl = 5.2 g NaCl * (1 mol / 58.44 g) = 0.08898 mol = 0.09 mol

, Since there are 1000 milliliters per liter, you will need to divide the number of milliliters in this problem by 1000 in order to find the number of liters.


You could also look at it as multiplying 800 ml by a conversion factor of 1 L / 1000 ml.
To hasten the process, you could simply move the decimal point three places to the left instead of multiplying or dividing anything.
Volume = 800 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 800 ml / 1000 ml = 0.8 L

, In order to find the molarity, you need to divide 0.09 mol, the number of moles of the solute NaCl, by 0.8 L, the volume of the solution in liters.


molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.09 mol / 0.8 L = 0.1125 mol/L

, Round your answer off to two or three decimal places and abbreviate molarity with “M.”


Answer: 0.11 M NaCl

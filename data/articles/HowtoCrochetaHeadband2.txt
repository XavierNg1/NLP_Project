 Start by making a slipknot and then make a chain of six or more stitches for your foundation.Six stitches might work well if you are using a bulky or super bulky yarn. If you are using a medium worsted weight yarn, then 10 stitches might be a good width. Experiment to find the ideal width for your headband., Skip over the first stitch next to your hook and single crochet into the second stitch. Single crochet to the end of the chain. This will complete your first row. You can work your rows in a stitch other than single crochet if desired. Single crochet is a good practice stitch if this is your first headband. Some other stitches you can try include:

Popcorn stitch
Shell stitch
Box stitch

, When you reach the end of your first row, you will need to turn your work over to work the second row. Chain one stitch. This will be your turning chain. A turning chain provides some slack to prevent the stitches from bunching up or puckering., You will need to keep crocheting your rows in the stitch of your choice until the headband is long enough to fit snugly around your head.Check now and then when the headband starts to get close to this length.

Cut the free end of the yarn and tie it to secure it when you are finished. You can leave the tail a few inches long and then weave in the end, or trim off the excess.
 When your headband is the length that you want it to be, you can attach the ends or fasten them. You can either use a darning needle and some extra yarn to sew the ends together or you can hold them together with a safety pin or broach.

Another option is to leave a longer tail and use this to attach the ends. Thread the yarn through a darning needle or large eye tapestry needle and sew the ends together. Then, tie the end to the seam to secure it and trim off the excess.

 If you are needing to gain additional weight to support your baby's growth, it is key that the foods you select are nutrient-rich.It is easy to gain weight by eating more junk food or empty calories, but the purpose here is to provide the nutrients needed to sustain your baby's growth, and to optimize your baby's ability to thrive. As previously mentioned, a balance of 20% protein, 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates is recommended, focusing on nutrient-rich foods whenever possible.
Sodas and juices should be avoided, as they are a major source of empty calories in the form of sugar. Most fluids consumed during pregnancy should be water.
 It is common for women who are trying to gain weight to have five or six small meals every day when pregnant. For many people struggling to gain adequate weight during pregnancy, this approach can make it more manageable and easier to get those extra (nutrient-rich) calories in.


When choosing meals, be sure to include more carbohydrates to help with weight gain. These include foods such as pastas, rice, potatoes, breads, cereals, and other grain products.
In addition to carbohydrates, which help with weight gain, also be sure to eat balanced meals with sources of protein (meats, nuts, eggs, fish, etc) and a variety of vegetables and fruits.
 This preserves the nutrient value of your food, while enhancing the calorie count of what you consume.
 Again, this will enhance your calorie consumption without requiring you to "eat more," per se.

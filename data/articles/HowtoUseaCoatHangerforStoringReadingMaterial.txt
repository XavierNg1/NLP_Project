 Wooden coat hangers of substance are ideal, as are very strong plastic molded ones. Avoid skinny wire ones as they will likely bend out of shape and may damage the reading material.


Think of the decoration as well. Where you intend hanging the coat hanger will determine the suitability of the hanger choice––the more obvious the hanging location, the more elegant the hanger should look.;
, For example, you might read the paper or magazines in the kitchen, so finding a suitable hanging spot there will make sense, such as off a drawer knob or a cupboard handle near the kitchen table. It should be strong enough to hold the reading material.


The bedroom is another place where this might work well, such as

, Simply slide the magazine or newspaper onto the hanger so that it hangs down each side evenly. Check that it is balanced properly before leaving it in place.
 It will be easy to find the day's newspaper or most recent magazines for continued reading.


Replace reading materials frequently to keep up-to-date.

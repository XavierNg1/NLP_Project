 You can make a few cuts into each jujube with a paring knife. You can also simply prick them a few times with a fork., Do not bring the water to a boil, as this can destroy the ginger's beneficial properties. Instead, be patient and allow the water to come to a simmer over low heat., Use a slotted spoon to remove the ginger root, cinnamon, pear slices, and jujubes. You can discard them or reuse them in a recipe. Carefully pour the tea into clean bottles, pitchers, or jars--whatever is easier for you to pour from.

To best preserve the flavor of the tea, use glass or ceramic containers.
 Store any leftovers in the fridge for up to 10 days. You can reheat it later on or enjoy it cold.

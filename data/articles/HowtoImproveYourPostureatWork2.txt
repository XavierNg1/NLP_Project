 Your feet should be planted firmly on the ground at a hip's width apart. Your butt should be at the back edge of the cushion.


If you are short, you may want to invest in a small foot rest on which you can place your feet to create the 90 degree angle.
 Ideally, all office chairs should have a small curve that fits into the curve on your lower back. If your chair does not include lumbar support, buy a lumbar support cushion to place behind your lower back.
 Find an exercise ball that allows you to keep the 90 degree angle in your legs and reach your keyboard. 2 or 3 times per day, replace your chair with the ball and sit up straight.


One of the main elements of good posture is core strength. Exercise balls create an instability that forces your abs and back muscles to work. However, you can overuse a ball very easily, causing muscle fatigue. Start out small with merely 10 minutes of use and work your way up to more minutes and periods on the ball every week. Return to sitting in your normal chair after no more than 20 minutes.
 The top third of your computer screen should be at the same level as your eyes, although most people have it much lower. Prop it up on books or reams of paper and make sure it is between 18 and 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) from your face.
 Your hands should rest on the keyboard or desk, so if you find yourself holding them up, buy a wrist rest to place in front of your keyboard.
 Probably the most overlooked element of office ergonomics and posture, is the necessity of moving around regularly to avoid the shortening of muscle fibers and increase in muscle tension. Walk around the office for a few minutes after 30 minutes of sitting to avoid bad posture.


Download a timer application, such as TimeMe Timer Stopwatch. Some computer timers can be set to sound an alarm after 30 minutes, while others may momentarily shut down your computer or monitor. Reset the timer each time you return to ensure you get up and walk around regularly.

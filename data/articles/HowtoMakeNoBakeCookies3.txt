 Coconut oil is usually solid, so you will need to melt it. If the coconut oil is already clear and liquid, you can skip this step.
 Turn the head up to medium, and stir in the ingredients. You can also use brown sugar instead of coconut sugar. If you do not like the taste of almond milk, try soy milk, coconut milk, or lactose-free milk instead.
 You want to end up with a thick, consistency. If the batter is too soft, add some more oat or almond flour. If it is too dry, add in some more coconut oil or milk. Keep in mind, however, that the cookies will harden once you put them into the fridge, so try not to add too much flour.
 You can also use chocolate chunks. Make sure to get the dairy-free or vegan variety. Stir the chocolate chips into the batter until they are evenly distributed.
 This will help cut back on the sweetness.
 If you do not have parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead. Since you will be spreading the batter over this, it might be a good idea to tape the paper to the baking sheet. This will keep the paper in place and prevent it from moving about.
 You want it to be about 7 by 8 inches (17.78 by 20.32 centimeters) and Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Flatten the edges by pressing them in with a spatula.
 This will take at least 30 minutes. If you are in a hurry, you can put the tray into the freezer for about 15 minutes.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the dough.

 Before trying to clean the spill, you'll need to soak up as much grease as possible. Do this by blotting the spill with disposable rags or paper towels.









If you're on a porous surface, avoid pushing down too much. You don't want the surface to absorb the grease before you soak it up.
Make sure to have a trash bag nearby so you can dispose of the rags or paper towels without causing a bigger mess., After you’ve collected as much excess grease as you can, you’ll need to sprinkle absorbent powder on the grease. The powder will soak up the grease, thus making it easier for you to clean the spot. Pick your powder appropriately (based on fabric or material) and use as much as you need. Some powders you can use include:









Corn starch
Oatmeal
Kitty litter
Powdered detergent
Peat moss, After your absorbent powder has soaked up any remaining grease, it’ll be time to brush or sweep it up. While this won’t be the quickest thing to do, it’s the best way to clean your grease up.









If you’re working with a spill on some sort of fabric, you’ll likely want to use a brush.
If your grease spill is on your kitchen floor, drive way, or another hard surface, use a broom.
If you want, use a shop vacuum to suck up the greasy-powder mixture.
Sweep or brush up all the powder into a dust collector.

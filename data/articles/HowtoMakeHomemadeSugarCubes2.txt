 This method works best if you choose silicon ice cube trays with cute shapes, such as hearts, stars, animals or something quirkier than the same old cube. Silicon trays are the best because you'll be able to remove the sugar cubes much more easily, with less likelihood of damaging them., You can make more than 1/2 a cup's worth but this is a good amount for a beginner to play with.
 Continue adding water a teaspoonful at a time until you have mixed together a paste of sugar and water. Don't make it too gooey or wet, or the sugar will dissolve.


At this stage you can mix in a few drops of food coloring to make colored cubes.
Consider adding a few drops of vanilla, almond, or lemon extract to make flavored sugar.
 Fill the molds about halfway only.
 Press down into the molds with the back of a spoon to make an even surface and to pack the sugar down so that it sticks together.
 Set the tray aside in a dry spot to let the water evaporate. If it's humid in your kitchen, the cubes might not set.
 Remove each piece of sugar by carefully pushing from the base of the ice cube tray and tapping gently into the palm of your hand. Store in an airtight container or use straight away.

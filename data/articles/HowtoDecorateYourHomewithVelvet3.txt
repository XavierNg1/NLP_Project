 One place to add velvet is around the base of your bed. You could add a bed skirt for a more traditional look. Alternatively, cover a box springs or base in velvet for a more contemporary, clean look. Either way, the velvet will add a touch of sophistication.As an added bonus, you may not need a frame if you cover your box springs in velvet. The velvet will give it a clean, finished look.
 A headboard is a great place to use velvet. It's a soft fabric that creates a comfortable, yet luxurious look. Plus, it makes a statement in your bedroom without covering the whole room in velvet, which can be a little overwhelming., You can also add velvet accents on top of your bed. A velvet throw at the foot of the bed can add a pop of color. Alternatively, you can use a few velvet throw pillows to accent your bed or a chair in the room. Both add just enough velvet to the room without drawing too much attention to the fabric.

 The EEOC has a contact page with several different phone numbers and email addresses you can use, depending on why you want to get in touch with the EEOC.If you can't decide what category your inquiry would fall under, you can call the main toll-free number at 1-800-669-4000 or email info@eeoc.gov.
Some requests don't require direct contact. For example, if you are an employer looking for an EEOC poster or other EEOC publications, there are links on the website you can use to print posters to hang in your office., The EEOC does not accept discrimination charges this way, but you can use the national toll-free numbers and email addresses to get more information or to discuss the process.


If you call the toll-free number and want to file a charge, the operator will take down your information and forward it to the appropriate EEOC field office to assist you further., If you don't want to call a toll-free number, you can also find your local field office on the EEOC's map. Pull up the office information and call the local number instead of the national toll-free number.

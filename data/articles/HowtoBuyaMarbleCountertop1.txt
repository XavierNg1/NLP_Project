Choose marble because it is waterproof and heatproof. It is a long-lasting stone that provides an elegant look in any room.
Be aware that marble is a porous material that can scratch and stain easily. Small scratches can be polished out of the stone, but larger chips cannot be repaired. Marble countertops can be sealed to protect the stone's surface, but hard water deposits can stain even sealed marble surfaces. Sealed marble may need to resealed periodically to protect the stone.;

Avoid marble countertops in the kitchen. Because marble is made of carbonate materials, it is reactive with acids like those found in coffee, fruit juice, soda, salad dressing and alcohol. If the marble comes in contact with acid, etching will occur, which is a process that breaks down the polish and leaves a dull, lightly colored spot in the stone. Although sealing the marble will protect the surface from stains, it will not prevent etching. Marble also is easily scratched, which can make it a challenging work surface.
Choose marble slabs as decorative features in a kitchen. If you use your kitchen as an entertaining area and would like to incorporate marble into the dï¿½cor, consider a marble slab instead of entire marble countertop. Marble is an ideal surface for bakers, especially for those who work with pie and bread dough. A small marble baking surface can add an elegant element to your kitchen while providing a functional application.
Consider marble countertops in the bathroom. Because most people typically don't use serrated knives or salad dressings in the bathroom, marble countertops are a more practical choice for a bathroom than a kitchen. In addition to the countertops, marble can be used for vanities, tile flooring, and bathtub and shower surrounds.
 Marble comes in a range of tones, including white, neutral, gold, orange, green, red, brown, gray and black. The veining or natural design in the stone complements most design elements. Professional interior designers typically recommend choosing a color shade for your marble countertops that is similar to the walls and floors.


Understand the color and veining variations in marble. Because marble is a natural substance, expect color variations and veining irregularities throughout the stone. A sample stone viewed at a marble contractor will represent the product, but will not be identical to the actual countertop you purchase.
 Measure the length of the countertop needed for your space. If you are including a sink in your countertop, include the measurement of where the sink will mount into the counter. The contractor will cut the stone to fit the sink into the marble countertop.


Determine how thick the marble countertops should be. Marble countertops are typically available in slabs that are 2 cm (.79 inches) to 3 cm (1.18 inches) thick. Marble counters that are 3 cm are more expensive, but are stronger. Marble counters that are 2 cm typically require wood supports.
 Most contractors offer a range of styles for the finished edges of the marble countertops. Standard choices typically include eased, bevel, bullnose, half-bullnose, triple pencil and ogee. You also may request custom-designed edges to match architectural features in your bathroom or kitchen.
 Several factors affect the cost of your marble countertop, including size, edging design, installation of sinks and faucets, and removal of the existing countertop. Marble is one of the most expensive materials available for countertops, so expect to pay between $50 and $150 per square foot.
 Because marble is a porous material that stains and scratches easily, most contractors will seal marble countertops. Sealant products can break down after time, so it is recommended to reseal marble countertops annually to protect the stone.

The majority of smoked salmon is cold smoked. After being cured, the salmon goes into the smokehouse, which is kept at between 70 and 90 degrees F (21 and 32 degrees C). The fish is hung over slow burning wood coals, which help to flavor the fish as it smokes. The low temperature doesn't cook the fish, but it does take up to 3 weeks to fully cold smoke fish. Cold smoked salmon is more perishable than hot smoked fish.


Hot smoked salmon is prepared much the way cold smoked salmon is, but the difference is that the heat at which it is smoked is higher. The heat can range from 120 F to 180 F (50 C to 80 C), but it requires less time in the smoker. Hot smoked fish is typically smoked for less than 12 hours. Hot smoked salmon is drier than cold smoked salmon, and often has a smokier flavor.

 Flyers are paper advertisement that can be handed out to people, posted in mail boxes, or pinned up around the street. You can start by choosing the colour of the paper. Try choosing a simple and light colour but yet something that stands out. Be aware that this step is optional; you can stay with the original white paper if you feel like it’s better for you.
 The title on the flyer should state that you’re selling quail. You can also add the breed, age and sex of your quail on the title such as ‘Silver Button Quail for Sale’.


Consider keeping the title a dark/bold colour that stands out from the rest of the writing so people know the whole point of the flyer. The title should also be bigger than the rest of the information on the flyer.
 This is optional but it may attract more buyers than if you don’t add a picture. The picture should be of your quail but keep it small so you can fit a description on the page.
 The description should include your quails breed, age, sex and feather colour. If you feel like it, add any extra information in the description such as whether the quail are tame, their behaviours and if they lay good eggs.
 Make sure the price is reasonable, and if so state that it is negotiable. You can also sell your quail in pairs if you want to. Males should be cheaper than females because not many people are interested in males.
 You should include a phone number or email address on the flyer so that the viewers can ask you any questions or tell you that they are interested in the offer.

Once the page displays, there are many areas of the page, as well as several text fields to find your item.
 Towards the top of the page should be two text boxes. Fill in the business name in the top-left box and the location of the EXACT place. (i.e. If your business is located in Philadelphia, and the corporate location is in East Oshkosh, WI, type in Philadelphia, PA", or you may type in the exact zip code of this business. Try not to review corporate locations as locations in other cities. It's a one-to-one deal!


On the page that is displayed, you'll find your search suggestions for the business.






If the business you want is not displayed, you'll have to do a little more work.
 It should be just slightly to the right of the business' address.

 Since your partner may not have as much authority over the visual aspects of the wedding, let them take the lead on scents and tastes. Allow your partner to select the flowers for the wedding based on scents they enjoy. Work with a florist who is sensitive to your partner's disability., Give your partner the opportunity to express their opinions when it comes to the wedding menu. Select foods and dessert items that your partner enjoys. Work with a caterer and dessert-maker who offers ample test-testing opportunities., Gather together your partner's friends or siblings with whom they'd like to buy their clothes for the day. These important members of the wedding party should know your partner's tastes before going shopping.Make sure that the people they have chosen are used to working around the impairment. Remind them to describe things in detail.
Your partner can touch and feel the fabric and try things on but may want people to tell them about colors or fit.
Remember, they might not have a clear image of what they look like but they'll know if they feel beautiful.
 If your partner has partial sight or lost their sight they will probably have opinions on color schemes they particularly like. Involve them in such choices if they wish. If they were born without sight, let them choose scents and textures they have enjoyed and combine this with your own preferences.

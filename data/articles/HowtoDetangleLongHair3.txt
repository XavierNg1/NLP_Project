 Be sure to brush your long locks before going to bed each and every night, as well as every morning. This may sound like a pain but the benefits far outweigh the sacrifice. Just make it a part of your daily/nightly ritual and you're all set.Use a good brush. Ones that have wide teeth are the best. They don't necessarily have to be pricey either.
Keep in mind that certain hair types like Afro-textured natural hair, should only be detangled once a week or so, instead of daily.
 Chemically laced products wreck havoc on hair and are just bad all around. Chemicals usually dry out hair which eventually causes tangling. Using them occasionally is one thing but if you use them often you are asking for trouble.


Using a leave-in conditioner will usually do the trick of counteracting chemical damage. This helps coat the open cuticle and makes it “slippery,” so your hair will glide through itself instead of getting caught and tangled.
 Sleeping with your hair up in a bun, for example, will help contain your tresses when you're tossing and turning all night. Use a non-elastic hair tie to prevent breakage as well.


You can get creative here. Try a loose braid, pig-tails or a simple ponytail.

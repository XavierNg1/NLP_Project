 Consider using a kettle, saucepan, microwave, or electric hot pot, depending on which of these resources are available to you.


A kettle is an ideal option, but saucepans work in a very similar way. Fill the kettle or saucepan with enough water for your batch of coffee. Place it on the stove and heat, over medium to high heat, until the water begins to simmer or boil.
Microwave water by placing it in a microwave-safe dish. Insert a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil to prevent the water from super-heating and microwave in short intervals, no greater than 2 minutes each, until the water is hot enough.
You can heat water in an electric hot pot by simply adding enough water to the device, plugging it in, and setting the dial to medium or high heat.
 Add 1 Tbsp (15 mL) of coffee grounds to your press per 4 oz (125 mL) of water.









A coffee aficionado would insist on using freshly ground coffee, but you could also use pre-ground coffee.
 Pour the water directly over the grounds in your press, making sure that all the grounds are saturated.









Change where the water falls to ensure the grounds are evenly saturated.
As you pour, you should notice a small "bloom" forming at the surface of the coffee slurry.
Use a chopstick to stir the slurry and bring out the bloom further.
 Place the filter assembly on the top of the press and let the coffee steep for a few minutes.









For a small press pot, 2 to 3 minutes should be enough time.
A larger press pot may need to steep for a full 4 minutes.
 Grasp the plunger stick on the top of the plunger assembly and press down.









Press the plunger down evenly and in a steady manner. If the plunger becomes crooked, the grounds could escape into the upper portion of the press.
 Pour the directly from the press pot and into your coffee cups.









Hold the lid to prevent it from sliding around or popping off as you pour.

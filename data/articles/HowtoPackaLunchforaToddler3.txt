 If you purchase packaged food, make sure that you open it and put it in a separate container. Many packaged foods may be difficult for your child to open.


If you give your child a juice carton, make sure that it has a straw.
 When packing your child’s meal, keep in mind that your child may struggle with large pieces of food. Because of this you should cut larger pieces of food up into child-sized bites.


For example, consider cutting your child’s sandwich in half to make the sandwich more manageable.
 Your child may find if difficult to peel an orange or tangerine. If you pack a food that your child needs to peel or prepare, do the preparation before sending your child to school.


For example, if you want to give your child an orange, peel the orange and put it in a container that your child can open easily.
 In order to make sure that your child does not waste any food, make sure to pack child-sized portions. After the first couple of times packing your child’s lunch, ask them if they have too little or too much food.


Make adjustments and then check back in in a couple of days.
 If your child uses spoons and forks, make sure to pack one in the lunchbox if you pack food that cannot be eaten with your child’s hand.


Consider packing plastic forks and spoons that are less likely to matter if they get lost or forgotten at school.

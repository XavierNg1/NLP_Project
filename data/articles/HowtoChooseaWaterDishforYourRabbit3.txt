 The amount of water your rabbit drinks depends on his size, diet, and climate. A medium sized rabbit will drink 50-300ml of water per day. If your rabbit eats a lot of fresh foods and grass, they will not drink as much water because they are getting a lot of water through their diet. Your rabbit will also drink more water in hot weather.Give your rabbit the same quality of water that you would drink.
 If your rabbit is not drinking enough water, add a small amount of Pedialyte or unsweetened apple or carrot juice to the water. Do not give your rabbit any sugary drinks or Gatorade. If you add Pedialyte to the water, you will need to change the water more than once a day to prevent bacteria from developing.There is not a standard amount of flavor to add to the water. You may want to test the mixture yourself in a separate cup to see if you can taste a slight difference.
Talk to your veterinarian before you add anything to your rabbit’s water. These additions could have a negative effect on your rabbit’s digestive system.
 If your rabbit has only been drinking out of either a bowl or bottle, give your rabbit another option. Your rabbit may be intrigued by this new source of water. It is also good to have a backup source of water in case a bowl gets knocked over or a water bottle is clogged or leaks too much.


Check the water bottle tube each day to make sure that it is working properly.

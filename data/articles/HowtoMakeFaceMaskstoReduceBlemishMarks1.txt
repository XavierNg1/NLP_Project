 If you have oily skin you can add lemon into the mixture and this will help draw out any excess oils, for those of you with dry skin you can use honey which is a natural moisturiser and If you have combination skin you can try adding both lemon and honey to create a neutral balance.;
, First squeeze the lemon and put the juice to one side. Start by adding in the dry ingredients which is 2 tablespoons of gram flour and a quarter teaspoon of turmeric. Now add in the wet ingredients starting with a tablespoon of milk and either a teaspoon of the freshly squeezed lemon juice or a teaspoon of honey (Remember you can add both if you have combination skin but add just half a teaspoon of each). Mix all the ingredients together until it forms a paste, if it is too runny add some more gram flour and if it is too dry add some more milk.

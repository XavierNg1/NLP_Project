 Some oils may discolor or bleach fabrics. Ensure that you aren't going to make a bigger stain by applying a small amount of oil in a hidden location and inspect for any discoloration. Oil reduces the stickiness of gum which will allow it to release from the carpet fibers. Try one of these oils to get the gum off your carpets:

Eucalyptus OilOlive Oil
Peanut Butter
NOTE: You will need to thoroughly clean the oils out of the carpets after the gum is removed.
 Do not pour the oil directly on the gum; it is much easier to control where you are applying the oil when it is placed on a cleaning cloth first. Saturate the gum wad with oil by repeatedly applying oil with the cleaning cloth.
 Gently lift the gum off the carpet by scraping a knife over the gum in the same direction each time. Wipe the gum off the knife blade after each pass to avoid re-applying the gum to the carpet. Rubbing back and forth may damage the carpet fibers and cause more damage to your flooring.
 Once the gum has been removed there may be some residual oils left from the cleaning process. Mix a teaspoon of a grease fighting dish soap with a quart of water and scrub the carpet with a cloth dipped in the soapy solution.

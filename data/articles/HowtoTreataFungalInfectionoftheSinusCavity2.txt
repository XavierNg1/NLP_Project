 Unlike aspergillosis and the fungus ball it forms, mucormycosis can be treated with an aggressive antifungal therapy that involves taking medication. The drugs that are given to treat mucormycosis attempt to destroy the fungus by creating pores inside their cell membranes, and through these pores, the passage of water and other molecules disrupt fungal cellular processes, and eventually, lead to cell death., This medication is the first-line therapy for fighting mucormycosis fungi. It is generally prescribed at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg per kg of body weight, each day.It is important to note that Amphotericin is thought to be the only drug active against this fungus, meaning that the standard antifungal agents (voriconazole, fluconazole, and other azole derivatives) will not help in resolving this infection.However, because this medication is hard for your kidneys to process, it is often prescribed with a liposomal formulation.


This liposomal formulation is a vesicle made of fat that the amphotericin B is packed into, so that the toxic effect on your body is diminished.
 While most doctors believe that amphotericin B is the only medication to treat this fungus, some recent studies have shown that posaconazole may be effective against some species in the murcomycosis family. This drug also targets the cell membrane, but goes beyond this and targets a specific enzyme in the fungi.


The dose for this medication is generally 800 mg per day, spread out over the course of the day., This surgery focuses on the removal of dead tissue, as well as the repairing of the structures that were affected by the infection. The surgery works with the antifungal medications; by removing tissue affected by the fungus, it reduces the workload of the medication.
 If you have a lowered immune system, you may be put on an immune system-boosting regimen in order to increase your immune response and thereby fight the infection.Talk to your doctor about what might be right for you, depending on the condition affecting your immune system.

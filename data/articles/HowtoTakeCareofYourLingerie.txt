 For sanitary reasons and to rid the new garments of potential chemical residue, it is a good idea to wash new lingerie. So, be kind to your skin, just wash them before wearing.;
, Depending on where you live, the brands and types may vary, but pick the one that is easy to dissolve. Mix the detergent with water before putting in the lingerie. Make sure that they are evenly mixed or you might end up having blotches in your bra or G-strings.
 Yes, this is a basic rule but we still do this when we are lazy, lumping them together in a tub and then tears roll down when the pure white lace becomes antique rust colour.
 This helps prevent rust spots forming on delicate lingerie.
 Pay attention the areas that trap sweat. Make sure you wash them thoroughly or it might give you some nasty rashes the next time you wear it.
 Just press them gently. Put the cup of the bra in the centre of one palm and use your fist from the other hand to press against the cup, this will drain out the water without squashing the cups.
 Detergent weakens the fibers of the material and leaving them on just speeds up the erosion. In time to come, you will notice that your favourite sexy lace bra is not as snug as before. Yes, the bra has expanded, not your breasts!

, If not, clip on the straps and the middle portion of the bra, unless you want an imprint of the clothes peg on the padded portion, never snap a peg on the cups portion.
, If you crush them or fold them, you are likely to destroy the shape of the bra. If you are not careful, not only will the bra not enhance your cleavage, you might end up looking like you have extra nipples.

 Folding usually occurs after you have already mixed the mixtures separately in their own containers. While this means more work and dishes, it also means a better end result, so it's worth doing what the recipe asks!;
, The thinness of either implement is important for making it easier to fold correctly.
 Never do this the other way around, so as to avoid the risk of overwhelming the delicate mixture, and potentially bursting air bubbles, or causing other overwhelming reactions.
 Cut down through the center of the two mixtures and bring the heavy mixture back up to the top. Baking 911 explains this as the: "down-across-up-and-over motion", which explains it well.Turn the bowl as you are doing this, to ensure that the folding is evenly distributed. Do not stir!

, See "Tips" for avoiding over- or under-folding.

 You can use divining rods to test the amount of positive and negative energy in an area or a room, known as the “Chi” of the room. You may decide to test the energy levels in your home, your office, or even your garden. Do this by entering the room holding the rods. Then, close your eyes and try to visualize the “Chi” energy in the room. Try to picture an energy path that flows throughout the entire room or area. Don't worry if you are not able to do this, as the rods will help you determine the energy flow or path.The divining rods can help you trace this flow of “Chi”. You can then make adjustments to the set up of the room or space so the “Chi” can flow more freely. This could then make the space feel more positive and uplifting. A room with good energy will have an even amount of “Chi” flowing throughout the room.
 You can do this verbally or internally. You may say, “Can you show me the energy path in this room?” or “Show me how the energy flows in this space.” This will allow you to communicate your intent to the rods., Follow any pulls or tugs on the rod, moving in a path. You should try to walk in every area of the room to determine how it fits within the energy flow of the room. The rods may help to guide you to where the “Chi” is flowing well in the room and where it is not flowing at all.If you notice you are walking in circles as you are lead by the rods, you may then to reposition the rods in your hands and repeat your intention to them again. Ideally, the rods should create a path through the room, touching each area of the room. Any areas that are skipped may need to be adjusted by moving furniture or items in the area to improve the flow of energy.

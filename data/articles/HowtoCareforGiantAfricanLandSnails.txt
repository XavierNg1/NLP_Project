 Ensure that it has a secure lid. One snail needs a tank about 40 centimeter (15.7 in) by 25 centimeter (9.8 in) by 25 centimeter (9.8 in) / 16" x 10" x 10".;
, Placing the heat mat is optional though.


Place a thermostat sensor over the heat source.
 Use plain topsoil from a garden centre rather than compost which can contain added fertilizers harmful to snails, and avoid coir or bark which can hold mould. Do not use topsoil you have collected yourself as this can be contaminated with pesticides and fertilizers, as well as a range of bacteria and pathogens.
 This can be checked with a hygrometer.
 It is best to pick them off the floor rather than when they are stuck tightly to the glass.
Snails don't mind being handled but make sure your hands are clean and damp, as sweat or chemicals are easily absorbed by your snail, and can be harmful.
 All vegetables should be washed to remove all traces of chemicals. Remove any food that hasn't been eaten within a day.


Snails need calcium. Provide a cuttlefish bone for an easy source of calcium for the snail.
They will need a shallow bowl of fresh water, but can drown if it is deeper than a few millimeters.
 Wash the tank only with warm water as detergents may be harmful.
 Your snail should have few health problems if kept in the right conditions. It is critical that it is not exposed to any chemicals around the home. If the environment is too hot, cold or dry, your snail will hide and become inactive, and a membrane may form over the aperture of the shell. A healthy snail has a clean, unbroken shell, and no unusual lumps or patches on its body.

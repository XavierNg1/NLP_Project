Astrologers believe that all things happen for a reason and that order (as numerologically represented by numbers), instead of chaos or randomness, exists in this universe, and noticing select numbers repeatedly holds meaning.
To others, it's either a complex subconscious fixation (similar to when you have certain song lyrics that keep running through your mind), a super-conscious fixation (as in your higher-self or God-self), or due to anxiety and stress (or impending "insanity").
 This too could be considered an unconscious attachment.
 An analyst would also have to comb through your comprehensive charts to find the commonalities.

 Although it is best to teach your child as early as possible, your child should not be too young. Most children learn between the ages of three and five., There are many different kinds of knots. Some may be easier or more difficult for your child. The number of steps, the complexity of the knot and your child's dexterity all will contribute to this decision. If one doesn't work, try a new technique.The Standard shoelace knot uses one loop to lock a second loop in place.Make an 'X' with the two laces.
Pull the right lace through the middle of the 'X' and pull your laces tight.
Then, make a loop with one of the laces.
Wrap the second lace about the loop and pull the second lace through the space created until tight.


The Two Loops knot looks like the Standard when finished, but it uses two loops at the same time and ties them together.Make an 'X' with the two laces.
Pull the right lace through the middle of the 'X' and pull your laces tight.
Then, make two 'bunny ears' with the laces.
Tie the two bunny ears together.
For an extra tight knot, tie the bunny ears together another time


The Ian knot is very fast, but a little more difficult to do.With this knot, two loops are made and pulled through each other.
 Children are natural learners. Just make sure to let them know they're doing a good job. This will help ensure they do not get frustrated while learning and give up.


Offer help when they need it.
Be consistent.

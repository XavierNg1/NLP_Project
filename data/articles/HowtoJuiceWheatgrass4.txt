 Prepare as much chopped wheatgrass as you want to use. You'll need to feed it into your juicer.
 Every juicer is different, so you'll have to set it up according to the instructions in your manual. Manual wheatgrass juicers can look a bit like meat grinders, and tend to include a handle that you grind, along with a pestle-type implement to push the grass down. Manual wheatgrass juicers can sometimes only be really used for wheatgrass, so if you splurge on a juicer, you may want to get an electric juicer so you can use it for juicing other vegetables as well. Electric juicers blend the grass more easily, but they require a bit more cleanup.If you get an electric juicer, make sure you get a masticating one. A centrifugal juicer will not juice wheatgrass at all.
 Now, just feed the wheatgrass into the juicer. For most juicers, you'll have to fill them a little bit at a time, so you don't cram the juicer and make it difficult to juice the wheatgrass. The juicer will then have a place for the juice to be collected, as well as a place for the pulp to go.
 You should be all done juicing your wheatgrass. Though a juicer for wheatgrass or a juicer in general can get a bit pricy, if you're really committed to juicing wheatgrass regularly, it can make a real difference in your life. After you pour it into a glass and enjoy a portion of delicious wheatgrass juice, all you have to do is clean up your juicer and you're all done.

 This is very important because even with snow on the ground, it is better to be naked in front of a fire then with wet clothes on. Wet cotton is the worst of the fabrics (especially sweaters and sweat pants), and will sap all warmth out very quickly.
 If you want to, you can just hold them but be sure not to let the soles of your shoes or any other part of clothing catch fire or melt.

 Nitrogen is essential to the growth of plants. You can mix ammonia in the soil to be metabolized by bacteria present in the soil. The resulting compounds are nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3). These compounds can be readily used by the plants for growth.To learn more about the amount of ammonia in your soil, extract the nitrogen compounds from the soil in a lab test. Put your sample in an oven (~850 degrees Celsius) and add plenty of oxygen. The oxygen at this temperature, nitrogen compounds will combust, resulting in gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx). The gasses can be collected for analysis, and the amount of nitrogen in your soil sample can be determined by how many NOx gases are present.;
, Ammonia has many uses, and some of the more specific reactions are named. The synthesis of nitric acid is referred to as the Ostwald process, and involves combining ammonia with excess oxygen under conditions that yield nitrogen dioxide. The NO2 is then bubbled through water, which absorbs the gas and converts it to nitric acid. The Solvay process bubbles carbon dioxide through a solution of saltwater and ammonia to make sodium carbonate (soda ash). The list goes on, and these specific reactions got their own names because they met a certain need using the ammonia compound., During the fermentation of wine, ammonia exists in the form of the ammonium ion (NH4+). This compound is utilized by yeast for to produce amino acids and other cellular materials. Without the nitrogen, the yeast would not be able to reproduce and convert the sugar in the grapes to ethanol.

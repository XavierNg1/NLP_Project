 Fresh ginger is the most potent form and it is easy to find in grocery stores. Look for a piece of ginger root that has smooth skin and a gingery odor. The root should feel firm, not mushy or floppy.


You can store an unpeeled piece of ginger in your refrigerator for up to four weeks. Just keep it wrapped in paper towels or place it in a brown paper bag.

Store peeled pieces of ginger in a plastic bag or container in your refrigerator. Peeled ginger will keep for a few days in the refrigerator.
 Dried ginger powder is also a good way to include more ginger in your diet. You can add the powder to muffins, cookies, cakes and other dishes. If possible, choose a powdered ginger that is organic.


Powdered ginger will keep in your pantry or spice rack until it reaches its expiration date. Check the package to determine when you need to replace your powdered ginger.
 When choosing an herbal supplement, it is important to be cautious. Supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so manufacturers may include misleading claims on their products or even misrepresent the contents of the bottle. One good way to increase the chances that you are getting a quality product is to call the manufacturer and ask some questions, such as:How do I know that this product is safe? What is your quality control system?
What research have you done to determine if the product is effective?
Have any of your consumers experienced adverse effects after using this product? If so, what were they?

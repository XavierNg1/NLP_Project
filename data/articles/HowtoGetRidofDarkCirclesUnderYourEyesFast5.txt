 Laser therapy targets fat deposits under the eyes, breaking them up and smoothing out the skin. The skin will also lose some of its discoloration. This therapy is normally applied by a dermatologist.
 Chemical peels are administered by a dermatologist and involves applying chemical agents to the skin to treat skin conditions. A chemical peel exfoliates the top-most layer of skin and reveals the next, healthier layer of skin. Light chemical peels, such as glycolic or AHA peels, are recommended, since the skin under the eyes is very thin and sensitive.
 This treatment uses high energy light waves to target the skin underneath the eyes. This will disrupt the fat deposits under the eyes, smoothing out the skin.


While effective, this treatment is also very costly and time-consuming. You may need to schedule several sessions in order to achieve the look you want.
 Surgery should be a last resort and certainly is not a quick fix. Performed by a plastic surgeon, this surgery involves removing fat deposits under the eyes. This will result in smoother skin and substantially reduced discoloration.


Swelling and bruising can occur in this surgery, lasting for up to a week.

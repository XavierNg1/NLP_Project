 The Rays' inaugural season was 1998, and they play at Tropicana Field which is nicknamed "The Trop". Current Rays players include Evan Longoria, Alex Cobb, Kevin Kiermaier, Chris Archer, Corey Dickerson, and Matt Moore. Kevin Cash is the current manager, Rocco Baldelli is the first base coach, and Charlie Montoyo is the third base coach. The announcers are DeWayne Staats, Joe Magrane and Todd Kalas. They were originally referred to as the Devil Rays, and they changed to their current name after the 2007 season.;
, The Rays are a perfect example of a club that wins a lot of games without spending a lot of money, and this is certainly something to be proud of as a Rays fan!

, The Rays are capable of many things, including seemingly impossible comeback victories. Remember that this team won the American League pennant in 2008 after not being on anybody's radar before the season.
 Small market status does mean that the Rays' star players will likely be on the move once they hit free agency (this was the case with Carl Crawford and BJ Upton).

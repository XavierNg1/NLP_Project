 A school science lab is just like any other classroom and you must follow all of the rules of conduct that you would in your classroom. Respect your teacher and listen when they are talking. Raise your hand to speak or ask questions.Listen to all instructions before beginning any experiments.
 There are many pieces of expensive and breakable equipment in a science lab. Microscopes, spectrometers, and glassware can be knocked off the edge of a workbench if you are running around. While it may be an accident, that equipment is expensive to replace once it is broken.Be aware of your surroundings and walk at all times when in the lab.
 When you are in the laboratory, you are there to focus on one or two specific experiments detailed by your teacher. This is not the time or the place to go off on your own and start mixing chemicals to see what happens. Follow the instructions for the lab of the day and only do those experiments.Performing your own experiments without supervision can be dangerous and lead to injury.
 When working with dangerous materials, injury or accident could easily occur if directions are not followed. Your teacher knows the proper way to handle everything and expects you to learn these procedures by listening to them.Learn the rules specific to your lab. In school labs, you will be forbidden from eating, drinking, or chewing gum while experiments are underway.
 At no time should anyone in the lab engage in roughhousing, pushing, running, jumping, or other risky behaviors. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid knocking things off lab benches.Never throw anything in the lab.

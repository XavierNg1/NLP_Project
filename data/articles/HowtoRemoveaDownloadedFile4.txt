 iOS devices don't give you access to any single Downloads location on your device. Instead, files are deleted through the apps that open the. This means that if you want to delete a PDF, you can delete it through iBooks or Adobe Reader. If you want to delete a song, you can do so through the Music app.
 The process will actually vary depending on the app you are using, but generally you can swipe the file to bring up the Delete button.
 Once you've tapped all of the files you want to delete, tap the Delete button.

 iOS devices have a much different file system than most other devices, and this can make it very difficult to find and remove specific files. You'll need to use an app that can open the type of file that you want to delete in order to access and delete the file.


The only way to get around this is to jailbreak your iOS device. This doesn't come without risks, and will not work for all devices, but once you're jailbroken you can install file manager apps that allow you to manipulate files much like you would on Android.

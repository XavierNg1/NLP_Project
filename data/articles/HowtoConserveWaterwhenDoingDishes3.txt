 Keeping your dishwasher in good repair will save you water by cleaning more effectively. Check regularly for clogs, broken spinners, and other problems. If your dishwasher needs replacing, consider buying an energy-efficient model to save even more water., Many newer dishwashers don’t require pre-rinsing at all, so if you have one, you can skip rinsing completely. If you do have to rinse dishes before running the dishwasher, use the washer’s pre-rinse cycle instead of rinsing them in the sink--it uses less water., Don’t run a load of dinner plates on the pots and pans setting--it wastes water! Use the lowest setting on your dishwasher that will still get your dishes clean, and save high settings for big messes., If your dinner didn’t use up enough dishes to fill the dishwasher, wait until after breakfast to run it. Running partially-filled dishwasher loads wastes water. If you need a specific dish but the dishwasher isn’t full yet, wash it individually by hand in a bowl of warm soapy water instead of running the entire dishwasher.

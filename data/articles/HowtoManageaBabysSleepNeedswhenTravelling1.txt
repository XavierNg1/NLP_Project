 If your baby is like most babies and tends to be lulled to sleep with motion, then they will doze on and off during any journey. Of course, if you have travelled during the day, this excessive sleep can affect their ability to settle down and sleep at night, once you have reached your destination. Settling can be further affected by the fact that the sleeping environment will be different to home.


There are two possible solutions to this challenge:

Travel during the night.
Put your baby to bed much later than usual, and only do so when you see signs of tiredness.

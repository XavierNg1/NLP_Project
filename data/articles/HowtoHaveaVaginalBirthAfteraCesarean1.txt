Speak to potential caregivers about your birthing ideas.
Discuss what hospital privileges your caregiver has and with which hospitals.
Take all of the time you need to get to know potential caregivers. Ask questions and voice concerns.
When you do choose the doctor who is right for you, be certain that she has access to all of your medical records and knowledge of your complete medical history.;
, There are birthing centers across the country that specialize in assisting with VBAC deliveries.


Contact the American Association of Birth Centers to find out if there is a VBAC birth center in which you might want to consider delivering. If you locate one of these centers near you, call and schedule an appointment to tour the facility.



Reach out to friends, family and members of the community and inquire about any known obstetricians or midwives in the area who specialize in VBAC. Speak with neighbors, church members, parents of your other children, etc. Look for local childbirth educators, midwifery and doulas that may all be able to recommend familiar VBAC friendly providers.
Find out which hospitals in your area are VBAC friendly. Electing to have a vaginal birth after a cesarean does not guarantee you will actually be able to do so. Emergencies arise, and you need to be prepared to handle any emergencies that may come up during the birthing process. Hospitals equipped with readily available emergency obstetric services and neonatal nurseries meet requirements for VBACS.
 There are a number of popular websites available that provide helpful information about VBAC, such as http://www.mymidwife.org/ and http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home.html.

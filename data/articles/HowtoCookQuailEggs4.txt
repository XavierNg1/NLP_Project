 Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of water into a small saucepan. Add the tea bags, honey, and whole cloves to the water, then bring everything to a boil over medium-high heat.You can vary the type of tea and the types of spices used according to your own tastes, but stick with deep or bright colored teas to create more pronounced marbling.
 While the tea boils, gently roll the hard boiled quail eggs over a hard surface, cracking the shells without peeling them off.


Alternatively, you could also crack the shells by tapping them with the back of a spoon.
The cracks must be deep enough to reach through the membrane and to the white of the inner egg, but the shells themselves should remain intact.
 Turn off the heat but leave the the saucepan on the stove. Use a slotted spoon to gently lower the eggs into the hot tea.


Cover the saucepan and allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
 Transfer the covered saucepan to the refrigerator and chill the eggs for at least 2 hours, if not overnight.Longer steep time will usually result in more pronounced marbling. Notable marbling should occur after 2 hours, but the effect will be more pronounced after 8 hours.
 Drain the tea, dry the quail eggs, and peel away the shells using your fingers. Serve the marbled eggs cool or at room temperature.


The tea itself should add flavor to the eggs, but if desired, you could still serving the eggs with a sprinkling of Kosher salt, soy salt, or another type of dipping salt.

 What you need to do is make a folder and rename it something like Secondary Hard Drive (Secondary HDD), then put all of the files from the desktop in it.;
, There are programs that emulate Mac's Finder Bar at the top of the screen. Well known and trusted programs include 'Finderbar' (a program made for emulating this sort of thing) and 'Stardock Objectbar' (but for this you need to download themes and skins and you can also use Objectbar as a Windows Vista/7 Gadget Sidebar.) http://www.download.cnet.com/ObjectBar/3000-2072_4-10069555.html?part=dl-80664

, Install Stardock Objectdock. This is not like many other Stardock programs where there are nag dialogs every startup and every hour, it will leave you alone so you can enjoy the ability to use the Mac style dock to the max. Another program would be RKLauncher. http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/

, Get a decent Leopard wallpaper.
 Make sure you've got the cursor pack! Go here: http://www.46palermo.com/mac-os-x-mouse-cursors-for-windows-xp-vista-quick-installer

, Make sure you've got the sounds pack! Go here: http://cyazian.deviantart.com/art/Mac-OS-X-Sound-Scheme-90849175/ but don't use the Jaguar sounds.
 Install Expose for Windows. It will allow you to swiftly put all windows in a grid or scatter. You can click on the window you want. http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/

, Install ShockCaption V1.5 - a program that allows you to snap the window to taskbar size, then back to window size. Go to: http://www.docs.kr/entry/Download-Shock-Caption-en to download it.
 Install only limited programs in FlyAKiteOSX. Download FLYAKITEOSX and when installing only choose specific options such as 'Install the Icon Pack' and 'BootScreen' and 'Logon Screen'. Don't install the whole thing because it will massively slow down the computer. I should know, because my computer has 8GB RAM. http://flyakiteosx.en.softonic.com/

, Download TrueTransparency and install a Leopard skin. Don't worry if the buttons are switched around i.e. red, green yellow, because you can switch around values like "Red X=0, Yellow X=22, Green X=40". You can swap the values around so Green is X=22 and Yellow X=40. This will affect the commands as well, because the buttons will do the same things. I recommend this skin: http://asilaydyingdl.deviantart.com/art/iUnlimited-4-TrueTransparency-119863254 - Download TrueTransparency from here: http://www.crystalxp.net/dl/en.gal.5139.html or if that doesn't work: http://www.crystalxp.net/galerie/en.id.5139-truetransparency-lefreut-explorer-tools.htm

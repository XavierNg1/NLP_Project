 You can choose a new or a used amp, and sometimes it would be cheaper to by used gear, but remember that some used amps will have some kind of problem that you might find when you get it home that you will have to correct or live with.;
, A watt is a watt, with tube and solid state they're all the same. Just take notice that tubes will get hotter than you can hold them and will break often when playing, but solid state are almost the exact opposite but will get warm, and sometimes used amps have a very bad smell to them when they get hot inside.
 Combos have the head and speaker both in one, while it's opposite for headers and cabinets. It's easier to carry and practice with combos, and some will have every effects pedal you can imagine, but at a gig you'll have to mic it up to hear the full sound. Headers and cabinets are separate so you can switch any heads or cabinets to hear a different sound or even plug in two cabinets in one head.
 For the best quality and sound, choose between 10" to 12" speakers, they sound best because they vibrate and retract respectively when playing, and horns and subwoofers add for true bass and volume, so if you do see these on amps they can mean the amp is expensive.
 There really aren't any set rules to finding your perfect amp, but a few are "don'ts":


Don't play bass or bass notes on your or the store's guitar amps.
Don't use instrument cables to connect a head to a cab and vice versa.
Never plug in your guitar into a live amp that is on and connected to PA mixers and everything else.
Don't neglect to keep spare parts and spare amplifiers just in case.

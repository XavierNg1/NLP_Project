 Keep adding updates on the most mundane things, such as, “I just woke up,” “I’m tired,” “This oatmeal tastes like garbage,” “My dog is barking right now.” Assume that people want to know every second of your life—don’t hold back. If you’re on the toilet, bring your computer along and share it with the world. After all, nothing brings Facebook Friends closer than sharing bowel movements and eating habits.;
, Telling the world what you just listened to on Spotify is no different than driving around with your car radio cranked up and your windows down -- advertising how Awesome your 'taste' in music is will not impress people.
, Constantly mention things such as, “Stacey is the greatest gf in the world,” or “You rock my socks, Jake!”, or "JC and I are soooooooo in love!" This will make all your single friends annoyed that they aren’t in a relationship and they'll soon feel like you’re rubbing it in their face. Try to be cheesy and unrealistic when it comes to saying why you love your significant other so much.


If you don’t have a real partner, write down how much you love your worldly gadgets, such as, “OMG! I LOVE MY NEW IPHONE/IPAD/ITHINGY!” Rub it in everyone’s face that they don’t have the spare funds to get their own widget or "latest gadget." Act like a big shot and prepare to show off.
 Exclaim your desire or demand for coffee every morning, or proclaim "TGIF" every Friday, because your Friends will be thankful for the reminder that it's Friday.
, Try doing the 'duckface' or taking pictures of random objects.

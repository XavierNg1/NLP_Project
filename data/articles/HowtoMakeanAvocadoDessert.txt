 To easily scoop out the meat of the avocado, slice across the avocado until your knife hits the pit. Grab both halves and twist in opposite directions. Take one half of the avocado, set aside. To take out the pit, tap it with the sharp blade of your knife so the blade gets stuck into the pit. Then twist the lower half.


If you are planning to delay the preparation, keep the pit on the avocado and put the other half back to prevent oxidation.;
, Add lemon juice to prevent further oxidation. If you prefer, you can slice the avocado into smaller pieces, or you can mash it with a fork.
 Toss or mix until the avocados are thoroughly coated with the milk.


You can add an extra helping of the milk if you'd like.
 Do not freeze. If you do freeze it, you can reconstitute it by placing the bowl in a hot water bath.
 Scoop the dessert into a bowl with an extra drizzle of milk and garnish with the ice chips. Enjoy!

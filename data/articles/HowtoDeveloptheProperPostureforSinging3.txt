 Relax your knees and legs. Bend your knees slightly to help remind you not to lock your knees. Locking your knees can interfere with circulation, causing you to become dizzy or lightheaded., You will want to stand with your feet apart but not too far apart. Aim to keep your feet under your shoulders. You can also put one foot slightly in front of the other foot in order to keep your balance., With one foot slightly in front of the other foot, shift your weight so that you are putting more weight on the balls of your feet. Shifting your weight to your heels will naturally cause you to lock your knees. Don’t lean too far forward as you will lose your balance., Then, try singing again in a slouched posture. You should notice that you are able to project your voice much better when your body is in a good singing posture. Don’t worry if it feels foreign or uncomfortable. You will get used to this new posture with time.

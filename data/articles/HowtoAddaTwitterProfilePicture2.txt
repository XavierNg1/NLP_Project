 You cannot simply navigate to Twitter.com on your phone and expect it to work. The mobile site does not have nearly the same number of features as the app does, and one of these features is the ability to add a profile picture.
 Though it goes without saying, you can only add a profile picture while you're logged in.
 The bottom of the app has five tabs to take you to different parts of Twitter. To change your profile picture, click the "Me" button to go to your profile.


If this doesn't work immediately, double-tap the Me icon to bring it up.
 This is usually near the top, often right next to your profile picture.
 In the edit profile mode, your default profile picture (the egg) is covered with a gray camera icon. Click this to change your picture.
 Both options will let you lightly edit, crop, and adjust the picture before it becomes your profile picture, so it doesn't have to be perfect immediately.


Profile pictures must be 2MB or smaller. This isn't usually a problem for a small photo, but you can learn how to shrink your photos if this is an issue.
 The actual profile box will appear, at it's largest, as a 400 x 400 pixel square. Once you're picture is uploaded, use Twitter's cropping and photo editing tools to get a good, square shot as your profile picture.


Profiles with clear, face-forward pictures are the best at attracting followers.

 Select a layer (must have more than 0 percent opacity, preferably should be 100 percent opaque). All of the underlying layers must be transparent.
 Pick the Eraser tool from the tool bar.
 Choose the size and shape of the eraser using the Options bar that appears when you have the Eraser tool selected.
 Essentially, you will be deleting the areas that you "draw" in, exposing the transparent layers underneath.

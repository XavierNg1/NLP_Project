 Using a lease means that you are making payments to essentially rent a car for a certain time period. You do not own the car at the end of the lease. The lender may give you the option of buying the car at a specific price.Assume that you lease a $20,000 car for 4 years.
The lease payment will be based on an amount less than the car’s total value. Say, for example, that the payments total $15,000. Since the lease payment total is less than the total value of the car, your monthly payments are smaller.
At the end of the lease, the car will have some remaining market value. You may have the option to buy the car. If you don’t buy it, the lender may sell the car to someone else.
 If you move to an area with a good bus, train or subway system, you may decide not to use a car. You can use the money you would normally spend on a car for some other purpose.Make a judgment about your access to public transportation. Think about how long it takes to get to your subway system, for example. Consider how much longer it will take you to travel.
If you do own a car in a city, you should consider the costs you’ll incur to park your vehicle. That cost can be expensive in a big city.
A growing number of cities are expanding bike paths. You may be able to use a bike for some of your travel.
 If the appraised value of your home is more than your home loan balance, you have home equity. You may be able to take out a home equity loan and use the loan proceeds to buy a car.Assume that your house is valued at $200,000. Your home loan balance is $160,000.
Contact your home lender to get a quote for a home equity loan. Assume that you can borrow at a 6% rate for 5 years.
You decide to borrow $20,000 at the 6% interest rate to buy a car. You make payments on your home equity loan.

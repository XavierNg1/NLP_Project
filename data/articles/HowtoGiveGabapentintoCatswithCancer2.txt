 Hold your cat against you, facing away from you (wrapped in a towel to restrict its movement, if necessary). With one hand, steady your cat’s head and tilt it upwards. Make sure that your cat stays leaned up against you. , Using your other hand, grasp a Gabapentin pill between your thumb and forefinger. Use your middle finger to open your cat’s mouth as gently as possible and insert the pill. Slide the pill down your cat’s tongue, as far backwards as you can go., Remove your finger and close your cat’s mouth gently. Hold your cat’s mouth closed until it swallows. If this does not occur after a few seconds, gently rub your cat’s throat under its chin to encourage swallowing., If you want to avoid putting your fingers in your cat’s mouth, ask your veterinarian if they can provide you with a pill-giver. This syringe-like device uses a soft nozzle to plunge the pill toward the back of your cat’s mouth, and can be used in the same way you would administer liquid medication with a syringe. After inserting a pill with the pill-giver, gently close your cat’s mouth and encourage it to swallow the pill., Purchase cat treats that are either hollow or soft enough to be molded around a pill. Start by giving your cat one plain treat, then immediately feed it a treat with a pill hidden inside of it. Have a third treat ready at the same time so that your cat consumes the second treat quickly to get to the third., If your cat resists swallowing full size pills, ask your veterinarian if cutting them into smaller pieces is an option. Use a pill cutter to evenly divide the Gabapentin pills into smaller pill fragments, which can be hidden in treats more easily. Very small pill fragments can also be hidden in a small amount of canned food.

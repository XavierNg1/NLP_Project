 Protecting your photo gear from rain is an issue.


Simply wrapping your camera in a plastic bag or even a common shower cap will enable you to view the displays through the plastic and operate the usual buttons while offering basic protection.
Uncover just the front of the lens when the time comes to take the picture. Alternatively, invest in a rain sleeve for a more tailored fit.
 The rice or silica gel will absorb moisture from the air.
 Do not use coloured umbrellas as this may affect the colour of your pictures.
 A towel is invaluable for drying up after a rain shower.

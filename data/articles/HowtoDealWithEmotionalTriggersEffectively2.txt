 Old habits are hard to break, and emotional triggers can fall into that category. To avoid and change a trigger, you'll need to replace some old habits and activities with new ones.You'll also need to avoid those circumstances that have proven to be triggers.For instance, if you know someone who gets belligerent when he drinks and pushes a multitude of your triggers, stay away from that person when they're consuming alcohol
If not having enough money to pay your bills creates a trigger, then look at what you can cut from your budget.
Avoid alcohol and drug use. When you're under the influence of either substance and encounter a trigger, you won't have as much control over your emotions and your outbursts.
 Sometimes a time-out can help you calm down before re-engaging with a situation. You can use this time to think about the emotions you're experiencing and how to address them in a more positive way. For instance, if you get angry with someone, and you donâ€™t want to say or do something that would hurt him, you can take a time-out. You can then think about how you should respond to that person or if you should respond to that person at all., Staying away from things that trigger you works in the short run, but it might not work in the long run. For instance, if you find all crowds emotionally triggering, you may respond by avoiding crowds. When this happens, your social life may become quite restricted. To overcome this, experiment with trying little bits of the triggering experience at a time, and then increase your exposure in a gradual and manageable way. Continue until you have successfully managed your emotions to the point that the experience is no longer a trigger.

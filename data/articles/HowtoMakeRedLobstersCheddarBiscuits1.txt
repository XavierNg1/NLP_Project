, Use a large fork or a pastry cutter to combine 2 ½ cups of Bisquick® baking mix and 4 tbsp. of cold butter. Mix the ingredients for just 30 second or so -- you should avoid mixing them too thoroughly. Leave small chunks of butter in the mix.
 Add 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese, ¾ cup of cold whole milk, and ¼ tsp. of garlic to the mixture. Mix the ingredients by hand until they're combined, for about 1 minute or so. Again, avoid over-mixing them.
 Place ¼-cup portions of the dough on an ungreased cookie sheet. You can use a large spoon or an ice cream scoop.
 Bake the biscuits until their tops begin to turn light brown. Then, remove them from the oven.
 You can do this while the biscuits are cooking. Melt 2 tbsp. of butter in a small bowl and stir in ½ tsp. of garlic powder and ¼ tsp. of dried parsley flakes.
 Use a brush to spread the garlic butter over the tops of the biscuits until you've used it all. Let the biscuits cool for at least 5 minutes.
 Enjoy these biscuits while they're hot.

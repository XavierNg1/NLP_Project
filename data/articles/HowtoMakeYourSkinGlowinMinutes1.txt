 Exfoliation removes dead skin cells, impurities and excess oil while preparing your skin for cleansing and toning.


After scrubbing, use a cleanser on your skin. Gently massage your skin in circular motions for a few minutes to promote blood circulation, to remove makeup and to eliminate excess oil, or sebum.
Many cleansers contain exfoliating beads or other ingredients that allow you to accomplish both tasks at once. Just avoid cleansers that have drying ingredients like deodorants, colors or fragrances. Also, skip cleansers that have "antibacterial" on the label.;
, Rub the toner over your face until no excess dirt remains.
 Massage the cream into your skin for hydration and a dewy look.


Use a moisturizer with at least SPF 15 to prevent premature aging from sun exposure.
Look for moisturizer containing humectants like glycerin, propylene glycol or urea. Humectants attract water when you apply them to your skin and improve its hydration.
Choose moisturizers with alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs). AHAs improve dead skin cell turnover, which results in decreased dryness, acne, wrinkles and age spots.
Switch moisturizers according to the season. In the summer, use a lighter product. In the winter, choose something thicker and heavier.
 If you use 1 brand of cleanser, choose your toning and moisturizing products from the same brand. Taking a unified approach is often better for your skin, because mixed brands don't always interact well with one another.

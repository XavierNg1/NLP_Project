 Use a ruler to help you keep the line straight, and draw the line from top-to-bottom.


It does not matter if your paper is vertical or horizontal; it is your preference based on how much room you would like to have for writing from side-to-side.
 Use your ruler to measure about ½-1 inch from the top so that you leave room to write headings at the top of each column.
 The T-chart is used for comparing and contrasting things, so you will write the two things you are comparing in each heading. Examples of things to compare include:


Computers
Smartphones
Stories
People
Cities
Countries

, Use bullet points or numbers to organize your list. Keep the details in the correct column.


There is no column or space to write what the two things have in common, like in the Venn diagram above. You will simply list how the two things differ from one another.
For example, you might list how the United States is different from Australia. Under the “United States” heading, you would list information such as population size, number of states, the Constitution, and other pertinent information. Then, under the “Australia” heading, you would list the corresponding information about Australia.

 Note the time and date the blocked call was received, and any other details you have about the call. If you end up needing assistance from either your telephone service provider or from law enforcement, both will be more willing to help if you can a establish a pattern and offer detailed records.


Keeping a record of what is said during blocked phone calls is also important. Heavy breathing and hangups should be noted, along with any background noises.
 This can be a 3-digit number if you are using a cell phone or a 1-800 number for general customer service.


Your telephone service provider will help advise you and may even help you trace the call. In most cases however you will have to engage local law enforcement to determine the number.
Consider using a smartphone app designed to search, identify, and block many different kinds of callers. Truecaller is one such option available on all major platforms like iOS, Android, and Windowswhile Facebook's Hello is another., If the situation is serious enough and the telephone provider cannot provide a full solution to the issue, inform and work with local law enforcement to identify the caller and to remedy the situation

, Once law enforcement is involved they may request your help in identifying the offending caller. Cooperating with law enforcement fully is your best bet to solve the issue safely and effectively.


Sometimes for a call trace to occur, you will be required to keep the blocked caller on the line for an extended period. During the call law enforcement should be on another line to help identify the individual making the call.
 Consult your law enforcement contact and if still unsure consider seeking your own legal counsel. While pressing charges can be costly, it is sometimes the only way to end ongoing harassment.

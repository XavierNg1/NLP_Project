 The puppies should open their eyes at about two weeks of age. However this, of course, depends on the breed of your dog and puppies, some puppies eyes can open as late as three weeks from birth. Obviously the larger the litter the smaller the pups will be, and in some litters you will get a runt. In nature the runt would be left to die but luckily humans can hand feed puppies using bottles of formula milk for puppies.
 When the mother starts to stand up to feed the puppies you will know it is time to wean them off milk and onto solid foods that they can digest easily. Start by mushing up solid food into puppy milk and progress from there until the pups can eat solid food all by themselves.
 One of the worst parts of having puppies is unfortunately, having to let them go. Puppies are ready to leave their mother at a very young age, 8-9 weeks. Finding homes for all the puppies is a tough job and an art in itself and can be made even worse if the puppies are crossbreeds as lots of people prefer pedigrees to crossbreeds.


One of the hardest parts is letting them go yourself. Puppies can often form an emotional bond with humans, especially in first time breeders and families, although some breeders have no difficulty giving away puppies. You may want to keep them all but they deserve homes with loving families who will care for them. In the end the puppies will have gone and your bitch will be able to rest, without having any pups to look after!

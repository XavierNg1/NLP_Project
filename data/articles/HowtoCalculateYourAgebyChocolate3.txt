 Up to this point, you’ve probably been able to calculate your age by chocolate in your head or using a pencil.


At this point, though, the calculations are about to get a lot more complex! You should grab a calculator from the drawer.You can also find many calculators online, and most smart phones and laptops also have them built in if you don’t have a calculator online.
Again, in an orderly fashion, write your answers on a piece of paper, likely vertically.
 Whatever number you ended up with after you added 5 should now be multiplied by 50.To use our core example, in which you started out with 7, you would take 19 X 50. The answer is 950.
To use our second example, in which you started out with 3, you would take 11 X 50. The answer is 550.
The tricky part about figuring out your age by chocolate is to keep track of it all. If you get distracted by someone or something, you might lose your place and have to start over.
 For example, let's say you're doing the equation in 2016 (any year would work, though).


To figure out the number you should use, take the current year minus 250 if you've already had your birthday in 2016. So, if you are doing the equation in 2016, take 2016-250=1,766.
Let's say you are trying the calculation in 2017. You would take 2017-250=1,767 if you have already had your birthday in 2017.
Add the number you get to your running total. To continue with our example of 7, presuming you are doing the calculation in 2016, you would add 950+1766=2716.
 If you haven't had your birthday, you need to take another point off the total.


For example, if you haven't yet had your birthday in 2016, and that's the year you're performing the equation in, you would use the number 1,765.
If performing the equation in 2017, you should also subtract another point if you haven't had your birthday yet. So you would use 1,766. The same is true of any year.
Add the number you get to your running total.

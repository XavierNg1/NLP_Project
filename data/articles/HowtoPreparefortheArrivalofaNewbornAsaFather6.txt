 A room with a skylight or at least a large window is ideal for your newborn’s room. A well-lit space will allow your newborn to get used to the night/day cycle, thereby minimizing the length of time it takes your baby to sleep according to a regular schedule., If you walk around the house with your shoes on, start taking them off at the front door. Swap out synthetic candles containing benzene for beeswax candles. Introduce some house plants to your home. Air the house out by opening the windows for about 24 hours (weather permitting).To give your newborn really clean air, buy an air filter for your baby’s room.
 There are many ways to set up your newborn’s room. For instance, you and your partner might put the crib and other furniture together, paint the room, and/or hang a mobile., Preparing for a newborn’s arrival often means that you don’t have time to clean the house. After the newborn arrives, you and your partner often don’t have energy to clean. If you can afford it, hire someone to clean your house during the month or so prior to the baby’s arrival and for the first three months after their arrival.

 If you plan on driving your newborn home from the hospital, you’ll need to strap them into a car seat. Only buy government approved car seats that have high safety ratings., If your partner plans on breastfeeding, buy some cotton nursing bras. If you decide to feed your baby formula, buy some baby bottles. Additionally, buy a cleaning brush if your baby bottles do not come packaged with one.Your baby should not use a dummy until they’re at least six months old, but you could choose to buy one at this point if you so desire., The obvious necessities for your baby’s room are the crib, blankets, and pillows. However, you might also want a changing station -- a large piece of furniture designed for changing your baby’s diaper -- and a small dresser for baby clothes. Nontoxic, baby-safe toys and/or a hanging mobile are also good purchases in advance of your newborn’s arrival., Your baby will need shirts, pants, and socks ready for them before they are born. If possible, buy baby clothes at second-hand stores, since your newborn will grow fast and not get much use out of their clothing.Whether you buy new or used baby clothes, wash them before use.
 Stock up on diapers before your baby arrives. If you plan on using a diaper delivery service, ensure that the first delivery arrives before your newborn’s due date.

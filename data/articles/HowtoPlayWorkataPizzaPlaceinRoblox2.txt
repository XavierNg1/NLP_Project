 When the Cashier makes a successful order, the order will automatically appear at the board. It will show either a Mountain Dew soda can, a cheese pizza, a sausage pizza, or a pepperoni pizza.
 The Mountain Dew soda cans are located near the door. You can collect it by hovering your mouse over it, holding the left trigger button, then dragging it over to the conveyor.


Do not put the Mountain Dew in the oven! To make a pizza, collect the dough near the oven. Just as with conveying the Mountain Dew, drag it over.

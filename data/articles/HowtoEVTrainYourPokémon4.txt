 Each Pokémon can only have 510 EV points. Only 252 of those points can be in any one stat. You may want to reset your EVs, say, if you accidentally used your Pokémon in a battle or if you decided to EV train a Pokémon after you had had it for a little while and it had seen a few battles. However, you will want to avoid items which might lower your EVs if you do not want them lowered.
 If you are playing Black or White, you can use Berries to lower your EVs. They are pretty much the opposite of vitamins in that they reduce a given EV number by 10. However, in Black and White, the Berries can only be found and grown in the Dream World., Join Avenue will have a number of items available for sale which can lower your EVs. Your best bet for items which lower EVs will come from the Beauty Salon, as these will very effectively lower EVs.

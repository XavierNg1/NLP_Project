 If you notice signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet right away and have your dog examined. There are ways to prevent the hip dysplasia from getting worse, as well as supplements and medications that your dog to take to keep him from feeling pain caused by the dysplasia.


Talk to your vet about giving your dog supplements before giving him medication. Some natural supplements can help your dog regain bone strength. These supplements include omega-3, antioxidants, and joint supplements.
Your vet may prescribe a medication for your dog. Make sure to know when and how often your dog should get this treatment.
 Studies have proven that obese dogs are more likely to develop hip dysplasia. Ask your vet for a recommended feeding guide that you can follow. Most dog foods have a recommended feeding amount, and following it is sufficient. Your dog can become obese when:


The recommended daily feed allowance is exceeded.
When your dog consumes high energy snacks but doesn’t get enough exercise.
 Gentle exercises means that the exercise does not make the hip dysplasia worse. In particular, swimming is a gentle exercise that can keep your dog fit and pain-free. Break your dog’s exercise up into short exercises each day.For example, going on two short 10-minutes walks, and then letting your dog swimming for 10 or 20 minutes, is better than taking your dog for a long 30 minute walk.
 There are several different surgical procedures available to correct your dog’s hip dysplasia. However, the surgery recommended for your dog will depend on his age, weight, and size. Some examples of different surgeries are:


Triple Pelvic Osteotomy, which is used on young puppies.
Total Hip Replacement is recommended for dogs with degenerative arthritis or chronic hip dysplasia.

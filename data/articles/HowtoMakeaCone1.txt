 Lay flat a sheet of paper, or poster board for sturdier projects. Put the sharp point of a drawing compass on the edge of the paper, then use the pencil to draw a semicircle. The cone width will be twice as long as the distance between the two compass points.


If you don't have a compass, use another method, like tracing a cup.
Set the compass distance to 9 or 10 inches (23–25 centimeters) for a medium sized hat.To end up with a cone opening with width w, make a semicircle with diameter w x 3.14 (or w x π).;
, Use a pair of scissors or a utility knife to cut out the half-circle shape from the paper.
 Lift the two corners of the semicircle and bring them together. Pull them past each other slightly so the paper overlaps, making an enclosed cone shape.
 Run a glue stick or line of white glue along the edge where the paper overlaps, then press it together. You might need to hold it for a minute or two while the glue takes hold. You can use tape instead, covering the overlap on the inside and outside of the cone.

 Visit docs.google.com/spreadsheets and sign in with your Google or Gmail account. Your Gmail account gives you free access to Google Sheets.;
, Upon logging in, you will be brought to the main directory. If you already have existing spreadsheets, you can see and access them from here.
 Click the large red circle with a plus sign on the lower right corner. A new window or tab will be opened with the web-based spreadsheet.
 “Untitled spreadsheet” appears on the top left corner. This is the current name of the spreadsheet. Click on it, and a small window will appear. Type in the name of the spreadsheet here, and click the “OK” button. You will see the name immediately change.
 You can work on Google Sheets much like how you would work on Microsoft Excel. There’s a header menu and a toolbar with functions very similar to those of Microsoft Excel.


There’s no need to save with Google Sheets as everything you do is automatically saved at regular intervals.
 If you’re done with your current document, you can just simply close the window or tab. Everything is saved automatically. You can access your document from Google Sheets or Google Drive.

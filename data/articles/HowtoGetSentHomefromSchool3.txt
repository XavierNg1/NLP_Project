 Though some schools may differ, generally, where infectious illnesses are concerned, a student will be sent home if he is infectious rather than risk infecting other students. Pink eye is ideal for these purposes, as it is highly contagious and easy to fake., These should be kept in your locker and applied at some point during the day, like when you take a bathroom break or in between classes. To fake pink eye, you'll need:


Red lipstick OR

Hair gel, If you are using red lipstick, you'll only need a small amount; too much will be spotted immediately as a fake, so you may want to apply your pink eye product in the bathroom. Rub the lipstick along the lids of a single eye. If you are using hair gel, again, take only a very small amount and rub it along the lids of your eye., If you claim, out of the blue, that you have pink eye, your teacher or the school nurse might doubt you. Instead, have a person on which you can blame your condition, like a cousin you visited over the weekend, or a younger sibling who is still in pre-school.

 For a charcoal grill, heap the coals to the side so you have a hot area and a warm area. For a gas grill, set the temperature to medium heat: 325° F (160° C).


Lightly brush the grill grate with vegetable oil.
 With a small brush or paper towel, lightly apply mayonnaise onto both sides of the salmon. You may use olive oil, if you prefer.
 Place the salmon on the warm part of the grill. The mayonnaise keeps the fish from sticking, and will burn off. Before you flip it, coat the visible side of the salmon with more mayonnaise so it will not stick.
, Place the salmon on the hottest part of the grill to get grill marks on it—it only takes a minute or so on each side.

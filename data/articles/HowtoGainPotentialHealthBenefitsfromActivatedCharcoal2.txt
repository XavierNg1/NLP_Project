 One way some people use activated charcoal is when they brush your teeth. Just wet and put toothpaste on your brush as usual. Sprinkle or dip the brush into activated charcoal, then brush your teeth normally. Don't worry, you won't taste anything, although it will turn your mouth temporarily black.Some people say using charcoal on your teeth gets them whiter and cleaner. However, you don't want to use it on your teeth too much, as it is abrasive and could harm your teeth over time.
Talk to your dentist before starting this treatment, as they know your specific needs.
 Some facial masks use activated charcoal as an ingredient. You'll use the mask like any other you would use. You rub it on your face and leave it for the amount of time it requires you to, then wash it off. Make sure to follow the directions on the package carefully.When you use activated charcoal on your face, you may have to scrub a bit to get it off.
 Another application some people use activated charcoal for is bug bites. Make a paste out of activated charcoal and coconut oil, and apply it to the bite. Make sure to cover with a bandage, as it will stain clothing, furniture, and carpet.You can try something similar with acne, except mix the charcoal with aloe vera instead of coconut oil. Apply it to the acne. Let it dry, then rinse it off.

 If you already have cotton prints in green shades, you can just use them. If not, then head out to your local fabric purveyor and pick up a few fat quarters of green cotton print for this project.
 You will need around 10 to 14 strips per tree, in graduated lengths.







Cut the strips into graduated lengths ranging from around 8 inches (20cm) long up to around 12 inches (30.5cm) long.
, Use a simple over-hand knot. You may also add a dab of glue if you wish, but this is not generally necessary.

Tie the next longest strip below the first.
 After each tie, gently slide the fabric strips together., You can trim them shorter if you like.

Leave around an inch of stick at the bottom to serve as the "base" of your tree trunk.
 The end with the shorter cloth strips will be the top of the tree. You can either hot glue a ribbon loop for hanging, or drill a small hole for hanging at that end.

Add a decorative element at the top if wished. A star, an angel, etc., are all good choices.

 This can be a TV, DVD player, or other auxiliary devices. Point the remote towards that device.
 The Mode button is one of multiple buttons at the top of the remote. Hold the appropriate Mode button for the device you want to program.


For example, if you are programming a TV, press and hold the TV button and Enter for one second, and then release.
If you are programming a DVD player, press and hold the DVD button and Enter for one second, and then release.
If you are programming an auxiliary device, press and hold the AUX and Enter buttons for one second, and then release.
 All of the Mode buttons should flash twice when you release. This indicates that you are in Programming Mode.
 Pause briefly between each button press. Repeat until the device you are programming turns off. Press the Power button to turn the device back on.
 Once you power the device back on, make sure that the Volume and Mute functions work properly. If the buttons are not working, resume pressing the SCAN\FF button until they function.
 The Mode that you are programming will display a single long flash to confirm that the programming was saved.

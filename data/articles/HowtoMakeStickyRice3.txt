 Some ideas include:









Place a serving size into an equivalent sized serving bowl.
Wrap in a banana leaf for an authentic serving approach.
Mold the sticky rice in a bowl or other shape, then upend it on the serving plate.
Place in one large serving platter and have guests serve themselves with clean fingers (provide water bowls on the table to clean fingers after, as they'll be sticky too).

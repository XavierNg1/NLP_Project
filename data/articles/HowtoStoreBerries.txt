 Farm-fresh berries make an excellent choice because you can be assured of their freshness, especially if you've picked them yourself or the farmer has reassured you when they were picked. In the shop, be on the look out for:


Berries being the color they should be; avoid any with odd spots, colors, or shades.

Berries that are intact and in good shape. If you see signs of bruising or staining on the container, this may indicate bruising and squashing.
Check for signs of mold. This is common in berries that have traveled a long way and have not sold immediately.;
, Berries are highly perishable food products. Our ancestors would eat them from the bush or within hours of collecting them, so we expect a great deal of berries by trying to keep them for longer! Try to consume them within 3 days; some berries may last up to a week but it's best to avoid storing softer berries for this long as it's likely they'll grow mildew sooner.
 These soft berries will keep best in a sealed container in the refrigerator. For more details on each type of berry, read:

 You can use Apache, nginx, etc. Verify that you can reach the server within your network by using another device to access it. For example, if you set up a server on a machine with IP address 192.168.1.101, using port 82, go to http://192.168.1.101:82 in the web browser of another device on your network.;
, For example, if you set up a server on a machine with IP address 192.168.1.101, using port 82, you'd forward port 82 to IP address 192.168.1.101.
, For example, if your external IP address is 123.45.67.890 and you are using port 82, go to http://123.45.67.890:82 in the web browser of a device not on my network.
 One option is https://github.com/yukinoraru/heroku-http-reverse-proxy deployed on Heroku. Be sure to change the configuration to point to your IP address and port! For example, if your external IP address was 123.45.67.890 and you are using port 82, you would replace "YOUR SITE" in config.ru with "http://123.45.67.890:82"

, Now you should be able to access your internal webserver on port 80 by accessing the URL of the reverse proxy server.

 The pump is what will propel your water into the air, thus making it an essential part of any fountain. Purchase either an electric or solar powered pump. When determining which pump to buy, consider how many gallons of water each pump can move; the larger your fountain, the more power it will require.


Tubes or pipes are usually supplied with the pump but you may need to purchase these separately, especially if those supplied with the pump aren’t long enough for your requirements.
 The fountain you buy will depend on your personal preferences and the size of the area that you plan to put your fountain in. Fountains can come in all different sizes, shapes and material.


Frost-proof ceramic vessels are a popular choice for garden fountains.
You can also choose to dig a pond, or add a large ceramic basin that has a stream of water that shoots up from the middle.
 Don’t use freshly-poured tap water for fish or aquatic plants. Either use rainwater or leave some tap water to stand for 48 hours so the chemical level falls. You might also want to have some aquatic plants on standby for when your water feature is installed.

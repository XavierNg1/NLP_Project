 One's decision to live by ninjutsu discipline is not and should not be public knowledge. Your first responsibility is to learn and practice ninjutsu in secrecy, and privately.
 A ninja must be able to function as a spy, which means that you cannot reveal your status as an aspiring ninja, or else no one will trust you. Do not dress like the stereotypical ninja. The black outfits that most people associate with ninja are a construct of Kabuki theater (although this has not been proven), in which prop handlers were disguised as ninja characters (who always wore black to minimize their presence while moving props on stage).When you do wear ninja clothes, the idea is to never let anyone see you in them.

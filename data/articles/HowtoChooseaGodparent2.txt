 Consider choosing a godparent from within your family, like a sibling or cousin. There could be a stronger bond between your child and the godparent if the two are from the same family. Also, the child will potentially see the godparent more regularly at family functions.
 It's important to choose a godparent that will get to see and interact with your child on a regular basis, because this will allow the godparent to provide leadership and guidance to your child. It will also help create a stronger relationship between the godparent and the child., The godparent you choose should be someone with a relatively stable life and strong sense of personal responsibility that can be counted on to attend important functions like baptisms and graduations and to interact with the child often.

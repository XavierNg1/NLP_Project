 Make yourself happy by doing them!.


You could try an activity or hobby that will develop a current talent or learn or new skill.
For example, painting, gardening, swimming, yoga, or poetry are all enjoyable things you can do by yourself.
Take an online course on something that has always interested you or start learning a foreign language. Your progress will make you proud of yourself.
Start a blog or video channel about something you know a lot about.
 You can also meet new people that might turn out to be great friends or even a future love. Don’t just do things by yourself, make the most of being single by getting out and being social.Attend events your family and friends invite you to like recitals or games. You can support your loved ones and possibly meet some new people.
Volunteer for organizations or causes you support. You will feel good about helping your community and meet people that have interests similar to yours.
Organize small (or large) activities for friends and family like dinner parties or game nights. Tell your guests to bring a guest.
 It just means that it’s okay to flirt with and spend time with someone that interests you. This will give you the chance to figure out what will make you happy in a future love.It will also give the opportunity for some fun, if not some epic stories to tell your friends.


If you don’t feel ready to date just yet, then try flirting a little. Smile at the cute salesclerk at the grocery store. Compliment the good-looking tech setting up your new electronic device.
Remember that dating someone doesn’t mean you are in a relationship with them. Spend time with them to get to know them before you decide if you want to be in a relationship.

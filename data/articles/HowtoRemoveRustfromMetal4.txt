 Create a paste of 7 parts lime-free glycerine, 1 part sodium citrate (available from drug stores), 6 parts lukewarm water, and enough powdered calcium carbonate (chalk) to create a thick paste.








Spread the paste over the rust-stained area and leave it to harden. When it does, use a metal tool to scrape it off.
If the stain has not been fully removed, use the same method and apply the paste again.
Go over it as much as you can to get it off.

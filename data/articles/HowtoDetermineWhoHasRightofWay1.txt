 This extends to anyone crossing the road in some states, such as Maine. Many times crosswalks will be announced ahead of time with a sign. If there are no pedestrians waiting to cross the crosswalk you can continue on without stopping. Keep an eye out for pedestrians.;
, If the pedestrian has a seeing eye dog then their vision is impaired. It is up to you to yield the right of way to this pedestrian regardless of if they are in the crosswalk or not.
 These cans can indicate that the pedestrian is deaf, blind, or both. If you see someone waiting at an intersection with a white cane, stop your car and take note of if they plan to proceed. Always yield to these people for safety reasons. , Bicyclists are supposed to be treated as another vehicle, but must be passed at a safe distance. Yield to bicyclists when turning left - let them pass before you make the turn. A good bicyclist will follow the traffic rules.

If she plays with her hair, she is likely trying to get or keep your attention.
If she dangles a shoe off her foot, it is a sign that she is comfortable with you.
If she locks eyes with you for several consecutive seconds, it likely means that she wants the interaction to go further.
 Ask her what she likes to do in her spare time, and if she has any regular hobbies. Hobbies can tell you a lot about a person’s creativity, social life, talents, and passions. To really get to know her, ask to join her for a class, excursion, or event to experience her favorite hobby firsthand.For instance, ask if you can join her for a bike ride or yoga class.
 A person’s favorite music is closely linked to their personality, so knowing what she listens to may give you more insight into who she is. Ask her who her favorite bands or artists are, or look for any preferences she might have listed on her social media accounts. Use a digital streaming service to preview or download songs or albums that she likes and listen to them, on your own, or with her., Understanding someone's relationship with their loved ones can provide a great deal of insight into who they are. Inquire about her family and friends indirectly by asking who the most influential people in her life are. How she answers the question (i.e. who she mentions and how she talks about them) will tell you a great deal about her life.

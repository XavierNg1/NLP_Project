 If your home contains a lot of houseplants close to your windows, move them several feet away from the windows. Birds may spot them through the windows and view them as refuges. They may then fly into the window in an attempt to perch on the plants., Try to keep your curtains and blinds closed throughout the day, as this will help to deter birds from flying into the windows. Closed curtains or blinds will help to indicate that the windows are there.If you have vertical blinds in your home, you should try to keep them halfway closed or completely closed during the day.
 Keep your house dark at night by turning off any lights in rooms you are not using. This will prevent birds from being drawn to the lights in your home and flying into the windows.

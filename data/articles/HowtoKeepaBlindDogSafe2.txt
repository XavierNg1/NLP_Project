 Your blind dog will need to be safe when it is outside. Textured walkways can alert your dog to dangerous areas. For example, if you have a tree with long branches or bushes with thorns, create a pebbled walkway in these areas. Other materials to use for textured pathways include mulch and sand.If you have steps from your front or back doors, place floor mats at the bottom and top of the stairs for your dog. Putting non-slip strips on the stairs would also be a good idea.
 A pool or fishing pond are major safety hazards for a blind dog. The dog could fall into the water and not know how to get back out. If you have a pool or fishing pond, put a fence around that area.If you are unable to make the fence yourself, consider hiring a company that can install the fence for you.
 Branches at your dog’s eye level could injure your dog’s eyes or scratch its skin. Identify and trim back any branches that could injure your dog., Although your blind dog can learn to navigate its environment pretty well, walking your dog on a leash or harness is essential to keeping it safe when it’s outside.If you use a leash, use a short leash to prevent your dog from tripping over it.A harness will put less pressure on your dog’s neck., When your dog is blind, it will not be able to pick up on another dog’s body language.This could be dangerous if the other dog becomes aggressive (showing teeth, lunging).When you walk your dog, put an ‘I’m blind’ bandana around its neck so other dog owners will know your dog is blind.

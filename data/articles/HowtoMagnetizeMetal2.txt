 To magnetize a metal using a hammer, you will need a compass, a hammer, and a piece of metal with some iron. These items can easily be purchased at a local hardware store.


A metal alloy that doesn’t have iron in it is less likely to be magnetic. Pure gold, silver, copper, etc. cannot be magnetized with this method.
 A compass works because of the magnetic poles of the Earth. There is a small magnetized needle in the compass that always faces north due to the poles. Place your compass flat on the table and let the needle swing until it stops moving. The direction the needle points towards is north., The piece of metal needs to be facing north so that the iron atoms will align along the magnetic pole of the Earth.Secure the piece of metal to the tabletop using tape or a clamp such as a vice.
 With the metal securely in place, strike the bottom end (end facing south) of the piece with the hammer.Striking the metal allows the iron atoms to move around and align themselves in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field.


Hit the end multiple times to increase the magnetism of the metal.
 Place the piece of metal on top of some paperclips and see if they stick. If the paperclips stick, the metal has been magnetized. If the paperclips don’t stick, try striking the end of the metal a few more times.


If you find this method doesn’t work, the amount of iron in the piece of metal might be too small. Try it with another piece of metal that you know has more iron in it.

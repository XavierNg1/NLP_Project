 If she's in your English/History/Chemistry class, strike up a conversation with her! For example, "What do you think you got on the test?" Talk about something pertaining to that class you share together! Or just give her a friendly "hello", there's nothing wrong with exchanging opinions or making a friendly comment!;
, Eventually it will lead somewhere, like stated before, all relationships have to start somewhere. Become friends with her, friendship is the perfect way to start a dating relationship! Like the old saying goes, "best friends make the best boyfriends." Just make sure you don't camp out in the friend zone.
 "I like you hair today!" or if make a comment on what she's wearing- "you look pretty in the color blue!" It'll let you know that you're paying attention. Plus, girls appreciate when guys notice little things like that.
 Once you've established a friendship with her, get the opportunity to advance towards a dating relationship by talking to her outside of school. Don't know how to get her phone number? Make up an excuse! A perfect example would be, "Tomorrow I have a big exam in Chemistry! Can you text me and remind me to study?" or something like that.
 Be honest! Tell her flat-out that you like her. Don't play games, and if you're honest then you'll get a better feel of where you stand with her. Plus, if she doesn't like you and you tell her that you like her- remember! You won't be wasting your time on someone who doesn't feel the same way. Don't know how to tell her? Simple! Say, "Listen, (insert name), I have something to say.. in case if you didn't know, I like you. And if you like me too, I hope we can be more than friends. If not, it's fine. I just had to let you know." You can change this part if you'd like, but this is just a rough sketch so you can make up your own clever lines! Good luck!

 Programming and system analysis are creative processes, not an industrial one. Geeks must constantly come up with solutions to new problems and rarely ever solve the same problem twice. Therefore they need leeway and flexibility. Strict dress codes and too much red tape kill all innovation. They also need creative workspace surroundings to avoid “death by cubicle”.
 This means that phones may ring to voicemail during times of intense work, when interruption would destroy the flow. If it's urgent, make the effort to turn up in person.
 Many managers like structured meetings because they have been trained to check off things––agenda, check; time limits, check; following agenda without deviation, check; and filling the time allotted for the meeting, check. Organic meetings allow for meandering, they don't have specific time requirements and they can go over the time, include random debate and actually be fun. This is how creativity thrives and you may get some of your best solutions during organic meetings. Let go your inner perfectionist and let geeks run a few of the meetings.

 Ask your children to tell you they are going on the Internet. Make this a big issue of trust between you and them, so that they know they must live up to your expectations.;
, This can list the sites that you permit your kids to visit.
 It's your job to monitor the amount of time your children are on the Internet, or to purchase a program that can log out after set times.
 If the home page or even the address makes you uncomfortable, it is probably not appropriate. Check it out yourself, review it and rate it according to your beliefs about what your kids should or should not interact with. Block it if needed.
 They will usually summarize a lot of the features of the site. This can help you to understand the purpose of the site and its suitability for your kids.
 Chat rooms and blogs are usually very risky even if they are designated for kids. Predatory persons can target unwary and gullible children who take them at face value. It can be easier to simply ban it. Moreover, chatting can become a very bad addiction that is hard to control in tweens and early teens, especially when they become rebellious towards you.
 Keep the computer in an open area where everyone can monitor its use. Check the history of what has been viewed and review anything suspicious.
 Incentives can include full pocket money, a visit somewhere, a new pair of jeans, etc. for sticking with the rules. For breaking or side-stepping the rules, reduce the pocket money, cancel the outings, and ban them from using the Internet for periods of time.
 Don't accuse your kids gung-ho. Sites get visited easily enough by accident through the mere click of a URL link. If they say they just clicked on it once, take this at face value but monitor future visits; if it happens again, then you'll see a pattern develop and can block the visiting or talk to them about it further.

, If the water is all absorbed (unlikely) add extra.
 This is VITAL for a chilled sago dessert! If you did not rinse it earlier - rinse it now.
 The coconut milk should be almost twice the volume of the sago. The ratio of liquid to sago should be 2:1 or similar to that when cooking rice. You can add a little water if you need to.
 Stir every 3 -4 minutes. If the sago has absorbed all the coconut milk but is not yet completely transparent, add more (or water, but you do not want to add very much water since the creaminess of this dessert comes from the coconut). Extra liquid can be drained off, but too little will result in a gluey (but still delicious!) dessert. The picture shows how your sago will look when done - transparent with a small white core. If you are unsure, taste the sago!









Microwaving your sago is not only quicker - it means you CANNOT burn your dessert. Nothing is more annoying then burning your sago after 30 mins of simmering on the stove!

, You should still have a liquid when the sago pearls are done.
 Palm sugar is the traditional sort, but any sugar or even artificial sweetener will work. You will need less then you think, since the creaminess of the coconut milk will add some sweetness. For this reason this recipe can make a really delicious honest low fat / calorie dessert.

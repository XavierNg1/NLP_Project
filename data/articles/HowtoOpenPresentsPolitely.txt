 There is no rush to open your gifts, and it seems like you just want what's inside of them if you rush through them.


Decide which present you'd like to open first, and open the wrapping paper slowly. This will build up suspense, and seem as if it really is a great present once you finally see it.
If it's in a bag, pull the tissue paper out slowly and place it beside of you. Don't rip it out and throw it behind you. Again, rushing through the bag to get your present seems as if you are rushing to get the present inside.;
, Reading the card first seems appreciative towards the person who gave you the present.


If the card is homemade, compliment the person on their artwork, saying how much you love the designs.
 Explain how the gift was "Just what you wanted" or "Perfect".


Try to be specific. It sounds as if you really like the gift if you explain why the present is good. It sounds more thankful to express yourself.
 Expressing thanks tells them that the gift is good.


If appropriate, you may want to offer the giver of the gift a hug or a kiss.

 Bring your oven up to 350F/180C.
 You can use one large sheet for all of the filets or you may decide to use separate pieces of foil or parchment for each of the filets. Either way, the foil or parchment should be about twice the size of the filet(s) it will be covering.
 Place a small pad of butter on top of each fish, then top with desired spices. Spices may include pepper, lemon juice, parsley, bay leaf, dill, or chili powder. Most smoked haddock is salty, so salt is usually not suggested.
 After folding the covering over the fish, roll the edges together to encase the haddock. The fish should be sealed inside the packet.


If desired, you could place vegetables inside the packet for additional flavor, but be aware that many hard vegetables take longer to bake than the fish will, so they may not be suitable for eating unless cooked fully prior to adding them into the fish packet., Foil may be placed directly on the oven racks, or you may put the foil on top of a baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the oven. Parchment is usually less sturdy and may need to be placed on top of a baking sheet prior to placing in the oven.


If you have made one large packet of all of the fish filets, you may want to place the packet on a baking sheet to make it easier to handle without dropping.
 Leave the fish parcels in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is done. When the fish is cooked through, it will have become completely opaque, and the meat should flake apart easily. If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer.


Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fish filet for doneness. The tapered ends of smaller filets will be done more quickly than others.
 Serve your fish with at least 2 vegetables or one vegetable and one starch to create a balanced, healthy meal. For a distinctly British twist, serve with several slices of black pudding.

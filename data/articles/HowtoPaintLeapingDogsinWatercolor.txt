  In pencil, sketch a dog's elongated body in the center of the paper.  Have the legs extended front and rear stretched out and almost touching the short edges of the paper.  Have his tail curled slightly behind him for balance, and his ears extended in air as if he were flying.;
,  Draw around this paper template of a dog you created.  Move the template and draw the dog again, tilted slightly and perhaps overlapping.  Flip the template over and draw a dog or two going the opposite way. Repeat until you have at least three entire dogs and the front and rear ends of dogs coming and going at the edges of your paper.,,  Use a smaller brush to pull from the main shape to wet the smaller ears, tail and legs.  Paint the dogs various colors. Let this dry slightly and add different colored spots or other variations in the fur., Paint until all the whole and partial dogs are done and have a base layer of paint.,  This is the time to intensify any of the colors that might have dried duller than you wanted or to change a color by painting over the first one.,  Mix a puddle of richly pigmented, but not opaque blue and add it to the wet background.  Variations are welcome and create interest.  Can't you almost hear the dogs yelping for joy?

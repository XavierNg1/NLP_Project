 You will need sticky label pads, a marker, and a large piece of cardboard. Make sure that the cardboard is at least seven times the height of the sticky notes and six times its width.
 Start by aligning the bottom corner of the cardboard with the bottom corner of one sticky pad. Work your way across adding sticky pads until there are seven in the row, one for each day of the week. Then begin adding note pads vertically along the edge until the column is six pads tall., Trim off any excess cardboard from the sides.


Try alternating colored sticky notes for the different weeks or days of the week. Breaking up lines and columns makes them easier to read.
 Write the name of the month in large letters the top. Mark the dates on each sticky note pad. Fill in details for any important plans or holidays.

 The lights in the right column still represent 20, 21, 22, and 23 respectively, but the left column continues the pattern. Starting from the bottom, the first light represents 24 (16) and the second 25 (32). There is no need to continue past 25 because 59 (the highest number needed) can be written as 111011 (25 + 24 + 23 + 21 + 20 = 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 59).Remember: the clock uses lights instead of digits; on is 1 and off is 0.
 Using the watch as an example, the last two lights, on the top row, are lit (2 + 1 = 3), so it is 3 o'clock. Note that the LEDs on the watch are arranged in rows. The lights may be arranged in columns or rows, but reading it is the same. Remember on is 1 and off is 0. The hours on the watch can be written in binary as 0011 which is 3 in decimal.
 Again looking at the watch, we have 011001, on the bottom row, which corresponds to 24 + 23 + 20 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25 minutes.
 The watch in the picture does not display seconds.

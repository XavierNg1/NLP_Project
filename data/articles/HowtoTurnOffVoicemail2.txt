 If you're ever in doubt, calling your service provider's hotline will put you in touch with a representative who will be able to help you out with your situation firsthand. The hotline information will be available on the website of your service provider. If you're not sure who your service provider is, check your phone's homepage or your billing information. Service hotlines are free of charge, and should be referred to whenever you're grappling with a phone hassle.


Some providers, like Three UK, have special hotlines reserved for people wanting to modify or remove their voicemail. In the case of Three UK, you can call 333 to get started with the process.Set some time aside for this if you decide to call. Depending on the time of day, traffic can be high and you may be waiting a while to get in touch with someone.
 Be clear and specific with your intentions. Once the representative comes on the line, let him know that you wish to have your voicemail disabled without any other changes to your plan. Specifying that you have no desire to change anything else will help streamline the process. On the other end, the representative will access your phone info and make the desired changes. He will let you know once the change has gone through.
 After you get off the phone and the service representative has informed you that the voicemail has been turned off, it's still a good idea to make sure yourself. Whether calling your phone from another number or getting someone else to call for you, give your phone a test run. Don't answer the incoming call with your phone. If the calling number is not prompted to leave a message, the process has worked. If not, you need to call the service provider again and tell them the problem hasn't been solved.

 Click the down arrow in the top-left corner of your Facebook page, sitting right next to the Privacy Shortcut icon, and a drop-down list will appear. Click on “Settings” from the list, and you should be directed to your Facebook account settings.
 There’s a short list of available options found on the left-hand side of your account settings page. Scroll down the bottom section and you’ll find “Apps.” Click this entry and you should be directed to your account’s App Settings page.
 Type in “Zoosk” in the text bar found on the right-hand section of the page and a search result list will show. Click “Zoosk” at the top of the search result list and a dialog box will appear on the screen showing different options for the Zoosk application.
 Down at the bottom of the dialog box, you’ll find the “Remove App” option. Click this entry and then click “Remove” on the confirmation message that will show up on the screen to completely remove Zoosk from your Facebook account. Every connection that your Facebook has with the app will be removed, unsubscribing you from the Zoosk app.

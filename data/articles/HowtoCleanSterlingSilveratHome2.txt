 Place one cup (240 mL) of water in a saucepan. Bring the water to a boil on the stovetop., To clean sterling silver with baking soda, you will need a bowl or dish that can withstand boiling water, like a glass baking dish or bowl. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil large enough to line the inside of the dish or bowl. Place the foil inside the dish, making sure the bottom and sides are securely covered with foil., Once you have lined the dish or bowl with foil, place the sterling silver directly on the foil. The silver must be in contact with the aluminum foil for the chemical reaction that removes the tarnish to occur., Once the water is boiling, remove the saucepan from the heat. Add one tablespoon of baking soda to the boiling water. It is normal for the solution to bubble and forth., Pour the solution on top of the sterling silver. Make sure the sterling silver is completely submerged in the baking soda solution., You will need to let the sterling silver soak for several minutes to remove the tarnish. Pieces that are severely tarnished may need to soak for as long as 10 minutes., Once you have soaked the silver long enough to remove the tarnish, remove the silver from the baking soda solution. Rinse the jewelry with cool, clean water. If possible, use filtered water., Once you have rinsed the silver, dry it with a cloth made of nonabrasive fabric like microfiber or flannel. Make sure you dry the silver completely with the cloth.

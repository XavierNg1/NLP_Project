Stars, moons and the sun for a party
A Christmas tree, Santa face or reindeer for a Christmas theme
Fruit or cornucopia for harvest festivals
Flags, national icons for patriotic events
Animals, toys or cartoon characters for a kid's party or the kids' end of the table
Birthday symbols for a birthday party
Numbers for anniversaries and special birthdays, etc.;

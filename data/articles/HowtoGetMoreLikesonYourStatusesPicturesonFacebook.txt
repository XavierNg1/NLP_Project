 Make use of that Find Friends button and add everyone you know. Make sure you don't accidentally add someone you don't know! Try to aim for at least 200+ friends. Don't worry if you can't!;
, By messaging your friends often about interesting things, they will start to like you even more and you and your friend might even learn new things from each other that you both never knew before!

, By doing this they will most likely Like your statuses and pictures back.
 Your friends will think you're a Facebook spammer and they will most likely get sick of all your statuses and might even block you. Beware! Aim for a maximum of 1 new status a day.
 Only post pictures if you really think it's necessary. Unnecessary pictures will get you less likes and people will just get bored of you.
 A camwhore is someone who is always taking pictures of themselves in different effects/filters and poses. Most people hate camwhores. So don't be one!

, Instead of "Going to the beach. Anyone coming with me?" make it "Hitting the beach! Who's gonna join the party with me? We can raid together!" because it's sounds more interesting and it'll get more Likes.
 It's annoying when people post LMSs so often! A LMS is a Like My Status. Such as "Like my status for a rate out of 10". Only do it once in a while.
 Make your profile picture stand out from your friends(but not too much!) because it can attract people.

 Right-click on your desktop or whatever location you’d like your folder to be. Select New, then click Compressed (zipped )Folder. This will make a new .zip file that you can add files to as if it were a folder.
 Copy and paste or click and drag your files into the new .zip file. You can move as many files and folders over as you’d like.
 Open the .zip file. Click File, then select Add a Password. Enter a password of your choosing, then enter again to confirm it. You will now need this password every time you access the .zip file.


Other users will still be able to see the contents of the file, but they will not be able to access them without the password.
 Once the .zip file is created, you will have two copies of your folder: the original and the .zip file. Delete or move your original so that it cannot be accessed.

 Time is of the essence; Texas has a statute of limitations on the amount of time you have to file for damages once you learn you have asbestos cancer.;
,, There are hundreds of industries that employ the use of asbestos; your claim may be very different from a claim by someone who suffered exposure under different circumstances.
 All asbestos cancer cases are complex, and you need a lawyer that not only knows the intricacies of asbestos cancer lawsuits and settlements, but a lawyer who is also experience with Texas laws that pertain to asbestos cancer.
 It’s important to find a competent lawyer, but you shouldn’t hire the first attorney you talk to. Make some calls, get some free consultations (first visits are usually free of charge) and make an informed decision. While it is true you shouldn’t delay too long in filing a claim, a few weeks of investigation on your part could save you money and stress. Remember, your claim could take many months to settle, so having a good relationship with an attorney you trust is important.
 Even if the law firm you hire has obtained handsome settlements for other clients, it doesn’t mean you will receive the same amount of monetary damages. Keep your expectations realistic.

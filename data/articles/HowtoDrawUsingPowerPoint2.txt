 These steps will also work with free alternatives like Google Slides or Openoffice Impress, although the menu options and locations will vary slightly.
 This is located in the upper left and is selected by default when working with a new document.


All drawing tools will appear on the right in a section of the toolbar labeled “Drawing”. The location is similar on Mac, but the section is unlabeled.
 On Windows, a list of shape and line tools appear on the left side of “Drawing” section of the toolbar. On Mac, both tool types can be viewed by clicking “Shapes” on the right side of the tab (the section is unlabeled).


Click the down arrow to expand the list and see more shape/line options.
To perform free-hand drawing, select the “Scribble” line option from the list of tools.
 A line or shape will be drawn depending on the selected tool starting from where you click and ending where you release.
 This option is located on the right section of the toolbar. Options from the menu include different color shadings and transparency settings for the selected line or shape.
 This is also in the right section and will open a list of placement settings. Options like “Bring to front” or “Move to back” allow you to manipulate how drawn objects overlap.
 Three buttons, Fill, Outline, and Effects are listed on the right side of the other drawing tools:


“Shape Fill” opens a list of color palettes to color in drawn shapes.
“Shape Outline” opens a list of color palettes to color only the outline of drawn shapes.
“Shape Effects” opens a list of graphical or lighting presets for shapes, such as “Embossed”, “Glow”, or “Shadow”. You can apply more than one of these to a shape at a time if you wish.
These effects do not do anything to drawn lines.

Common foods, like milk, applesauce, yogurt, oatmeal, and canned fruit are often unnecessarily loaded with added sugars. The good news, however, is that most supermarkets offer sugar free or organic varieties of such products. Look for these when you're shopping.
Avoid fruit juice, even if it's labeled "no added sugar." While it's been marketed as a healthy alternative to soda, fruit juice contains as much sugar as most soft drinks. The lack of fiber in fruit juice allows the blood sugar to spike up and fall back down very quickly. The sugars in fruit juices are absorbed so fast by the body our systems can't tell the difference between a glass of OJ and a can of coke. It's better to swap out juice for an actual piece of fruit., The glycemic index ranks how fast foods cause blood sugar to rise. Foods on the higher end of the spectrum cause a sudden spike of sugar in the bloodstream, which your body responds to by releasing insulin. This causes a rise in blood sugar. When this cycle happens quickly, food cravings are more frequent and harder to ignore. This leads to hunger throughout the day, which makes it harder to resist sugary temptations. Low glycemic foods keep us full longer. Starchy vegetables, like potatoes, and white breads, pastas, and rices have a high glycemic index. Try swapping them out for legumes, like black and kidney beans, whole wheat products, fruits, and leafy greens., These foods slow down the release of insulin that results in blood sugar spikes, and generally keep us feeling full longer. They're also easy to add to most meals.


Eggs, almonds, turkey breasts, cheeses, and avocados can make great additions to morning and mid-afternoon meals. A slice of avocado over your morning toast, for example, or a handful of almonds in a bowl of oatmeal can add calories and substance to your diet and fill you up fast.

 In English, nearly all words that begin with vowels will be preceded by the article "An."For example: an apple, an elbow, an Indian.
 Some words may be spelled beginning with consonants but be pronounced with initial vowel sounds. Words that begin in h are the most common causes of confusion, but there are some other letters that can pose a challenge, too.


Use "An" before a silent h: an hour, an honorable peace, an honest error.
Use "An" before words that are spelled with consonants but pronounced with vowel sounds: an MBA.
 For example, British and American pronunciation of certain words varies dramatically, particularly words beginning in h such as "herb." In American pronunciation, the h is silent, so correct usage would be "an herb." But in British pronunciation, the h is pronounced, so correct usage would be a herb.
 There is substantial debate over whether the correct usage is "a historic event" or "an historic event."Nearly all style handbooks and usage guides prefer "a historic event," citing the consonant sound explanation given in this article.However, you may see "an historic" crop up from time to time, particularly amongst British writers.


Some American writers will also use "an" with longish words (three or more syllables) beginning with H, where the first syllable isn't accented: "a hypothesis," "an habitual offender."

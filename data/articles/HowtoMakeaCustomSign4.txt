 You can get a fancy, pre-cut one in smaller sizes from your local craft stores, or you can get something larger or generally more basic from your local hardware store. Solid wood boards or MDF are preferable, though plywood will work okay. Sand and prep the surface, but do not paint or stain it.
 Using the methods discussed in the first section, prepare you text and trace it onto the surface.
 Use a handheld router to cut the text. You can either cut the letters themselves, or you can cut out the space around them. If cutting the letters themselves, you can get the two-layer, beveled look by cutting a thin line deeply first and then makes a second pass with a thicker but shallower bit.


Experiment to find the right bit and depth on scrap wood first.
Alternatively, you can rent some time at the local Maker Space and use a CNC router, which can make much more elaborate shapes very quickly and accurately.
 Sand the resulting product until it looks nice and clean.
 You can spray paint the sign and then hand paint the letters, or do any other number of finishing styles. Use sandpaper on the painted product to get an aged look.
 Attach hangers, a string, or even nail on some soda pop tabs to use as hooks. Hang your sign with the aid of a level. Enjoy!

 If you have a bunk-bed, it’s super easy to build an instant fort in your room. Get a few sheets or blankets and tuck them under the mattress on the top bunk. Drape the sheets down to the floor on all sides.
 This type of fort is very easy to build, but it is a lot smaller than some other types of forts.


Get two large pieces of furniture, such as a couch and a table, and put them side by side about 2-3 feet apart.
Stretch a sheet or blanket across the gap between the furniture to create the roof.
Secure the roof by placing something heavy on top of it on each side to weigh it down. Heavy books work very well for this.
Put some pillows or cushions on the floor of the tunnel to make a cozy floor. Now you have a fort!

, You can also use a small umbrella, but it won’t have as much room in the fort. If you have several umbrellas, place them in a circular formation. Then, stretch sheets over the top. Voila, instant fort!

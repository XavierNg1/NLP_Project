 One of the best things you can do for your lips, in fact for your skin in general, is to make sure to drink a lot of water. Water not only hydrates your body, it nourishes your skin and promotes new cell growth. In fact, dry lips can be a sign that your body is not getting the amount of water it needs.
 Although it might be counterintuitive, wetting your lips by licking them with saliva actually causes drying.
 If you tend to bite your lips when nervous or without realizing it, try using chewing gum to satisfy an oral fixation. Biting your lips causes cracking and can create open sores that may need to be treated with antibiotics.
 Foods that contain vitamins B and C are especially good for your skin. Consider taking a supplement if your diet lacks these vitamins. Omega-3 fatty acids are also extremely good for your skin and can be found in foods like fish, avocado, and almonds. You can also take a daily Omega-3 supplement.

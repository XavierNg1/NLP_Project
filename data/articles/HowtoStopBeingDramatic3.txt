Take a walk around the block. Make your walk just long enough to ignore what caused you drama.
Go have a coffee break. Sit back and relax. Be in the moment and enjoy the situation instead of dwelling on a dramatic situation.
Read something. Change your focus by immersing yourself in another story or another world. You’ll forget about the drama while imagining characters and scenarios in the book.
 Breathing deeply will calm you down and allow you to speak calmly and clearly. Inhale deeply for a few seconds, then hold the breath for a beat, and exhale for longer than you breathed in.

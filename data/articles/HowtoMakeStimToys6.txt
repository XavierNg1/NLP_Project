 You will need different plastic bottles (preferably thick soda bottles), as well as a variety of buttons, beads, dry rice, popcorn kernels, and dry beans. If desired, you can also gather mini accessories such as small plastic toys, small seashells, and/or glitter.
 Place something different in each bottle (e.g. one bottle with rice, another bottle with beads, etc.). Fill the bottles halfway or nearly to the top. Add any accessories, if desired.
 Glue the bottle caps shut if you don't plan on opening the bottles again.
 To stim with your toy, shake the bottles and listen to the noise each bottle makes.

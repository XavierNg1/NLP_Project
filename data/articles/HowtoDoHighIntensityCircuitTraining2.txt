 If you're new to high-intensity exercise, you’ll need to exercise for several weeks so that your muscles can develop and your body can begin to transport oxygen to the muscles more efficiently. Once you’ve achieved this, you’ll be able to exercise more comfortably over longer periods of time. At this point, HICT can be used to add variety and fun to your routine.
 But it’s important not to get sloppy during your HICT exercises. Never sacrifice proper form to achieve greater speed. Doing so will increase your risk of injury.


Use exercises you have already mastered. For instance, if you really struggle with regular lunges, don't put them on the HICT slate. Choose exercises that you normally find easy. It is the rapid cycling through a variety of exercises that should be the challenge, not the performance of any one of the exercises in the sequence.
 HICT is not appropriate for everyone, and you should talk with your doctor before you begin. If you have an injury or an advanced illness, HICT may not be right for you. Certain medications may affect your physical performance or the level of intensity you are able to achieve. Remember to exercise in a way that works for you and is safe.
 An easy way to warm up the legs is to simply walk for five minutes or so. Move the neck by looking up and down five times. Work your arms by waving them clockwise in concentric circles five times, then waving them counterclockwise five times.


After your exercise is completed, do a cooldown. Keep moving around to allow your heart rate to lower gradually and prevent blood from pooling.
 They can explain how each machine or station in the gym works, and will help you get the most out of your workout routine. Most importantly, fitness trainers can help you correct your form and look for other ways to improve your safety during HICT.


Personal trainers are available at almost every gym.
You will probably need to pay a small fee to receive lessons and assistance from a trainer.

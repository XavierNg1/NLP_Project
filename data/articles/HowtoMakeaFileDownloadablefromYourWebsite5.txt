 If you used the GoDaddy site builder, log into the GoDaddy website and open your website in the editor.
 You can turn any object on your site into a link, as well as any text from your text boxes. If you want to create a download button, click the "Button" option from the left menu to insert one.
 If you have an object selected, click the Settings button to open the menu. If you have text selected, click the "Link" button in the text formatting tools, which looks like a chainlink.
 This will allow you to select the file you want to upload to your website.
 Files are limited to 30 MB in size. You cannot upload HTML, PHP, EXE, DLL and several other potentially dangerous types of files.
 You'll see a checkmark next to the file in the window when it has finished uploading.
 Clicking "Save" will apply the file to the object or text link you created.
 This will make your new link live, and your visitors will be able to download the linked file.

 This directory contains a number of start/stop scripts for various services on your computer system.
 This tool configures system services in connection with system runlevels. In other words, it will help you turn services on/off using the scripts in /etc/init.d.


If you're running the Ubuntu operating system, you can use the settings from here: System -> Preferences > Startup Applications.

 With the arm you just deflected with, give him a hook to the cheek. Your arm should already be in a position where it will seem more like a haymaker. Then you can back away and wait for him to attack again, or you can go in and continue pummeling him.
 If he kicks, grab his leg and knock him off balance. If he punches or grabs you, hold his hand to your body. He will become distracted with losing his hand and will be open to punching or kicking.
 From there you can punch his stomach or face.
 Wait until the kick hits, and then charge him, tackling him. He should fall down rather easily. From there, you can beat on him from above.
 Put your hands on his shoulders, push down, and knee him on the nose while he's going down. This move is crippling, and if you do several in a row, he will probably be done. If you can't knee him in the nose then just fall on top of his body and pin him down. This will stop his body from moving unless he is strong enough to pull back from your fall.

 Many managers need to rise to a challenge in order to feel satisfied and grow professionally. Then, evaluate whether you think it is a reasonable challenge and it promotes growth in the right areas.
 Some low to mid-level management positions help their managers to get an MBA or other training. If the company embraces education and training, there will be hidden professional benefits.
 If a company tries to promote from within, you may be able to increase your professional responsibilities and salary in the future.
 A job offer at a company that has been shrinking will not be as positive as 1 in a growing sector. This will also be an indication of the kind of budget your department will receive for projects.

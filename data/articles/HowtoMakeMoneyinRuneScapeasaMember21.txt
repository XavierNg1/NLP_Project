The Stronghold of Security can be found in the center of the Gunnar's Ground, west of Varrock.
,, After awhile, you'll notice that they are dropping tons of herbs, runes, ores and very rarely they drop uncut sapphires and diamonds which are worth quite a bit. Pick up all fire runes, all nature runes and only the ranarrs, kwuarm, and other high leveled herbs (if you have the herblore level to do so, you can pick up the lower level herbs to clean them for the exp then drop them). After you have over 2000 fires runes and 75 nature runes, you should have a full inventory of herbs.



You can make around about 380k per trip if you pick up only the noted ores, natures, fires and higher leveled herbs.
Using the Ring of Wealth will not help with the drops, but will help you get access to the rare drop table

Select cell range C6:D1445 and do Charts on the Ribbon (or Chart Wizard), All/Other, Scattered - Smoothed Line Scatter. Copy or Cut and Paste the chart which landed atop the data or to the side and paste in the Chart worksheet, where it should be pulled open to an approximate square at the lower left by hovering the cursor until it changes to the double-headed arrow and then grabbing the chart frame and pulling down and right. Select Chart Layout and get rid of Axes, Grid lines, and the Legend. Click in the Chart Area outside the Plot Area near the outer border and choose no line and no Fill. Do the same for the Plot Area. To do all the 4 spheres, select the cell range C6:D5765. In that case, the chart area will need to be a tall squeezed rectangle until the spheres appear round. You can Copy Picture atop the data to get an image like the one at the top of this article and use Grabber application if Copy Picture refuses to pick up the underlying data's image. Copy and Paste both data and a picture of your charts to the Saves worksheet.
Try setting a,b and c_ to 100, .5 and .5 respectively and make sure the line weight is set to 1.

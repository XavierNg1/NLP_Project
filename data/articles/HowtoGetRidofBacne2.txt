 Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash is a particularly good product with this. Concentrate on the areas with pimples and wait a minute or so before rinsing to get rid of all the oil. Let the medicine sink in and do its work.
 Your skin is an organ in your body. Not figuratively, but literally. And like other organs in your body, it needs water and other nutrients in order to look and feel its best. Use lotion on your back whenever you've washed it (daily).


Alternatively, use a non-medicated lotion, but be sure that it is guaranteed to be non-comedogenic. This is necessary because salicylic acid dries out your skin.
 Since you are already using salicylic acid to wash and moisturize, use a different medicine for spot treatment, such as 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Do not use 5% or 10% benzoyl peroxide if you have extremely sensitive skin because this will increase irritation. If you're sensitive to benzoyl peroxide, a 10% sulfur solution may work for you instead.
 Put a retinol cream on your back at night. This exfoliates your skin and prevents breakouts in tough places.
 Alpha Hydroxy Acids are essentially exfoliants, sloughing off dead skin that tends to clog pores and cause acne. Beta Hydroxy Acids fight the acne bacteria from the inside out. If you can, try to find a body scrub with AHAs and wash with that scrub three times per week. After showering and moisturizing, wipe your back with BHA-medicated pads., It's entirely possible that this is a condition which requires prescription acne pills or topical creams. Don't be afraid to see a dermatologist to make sure.

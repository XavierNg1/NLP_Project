 Dyeing hair is a messy business, so a few precautions in advance will save you a lot of cleanup time later.


Apply a layer of Vaseline around your hairline, ears, and around your neckline to avoid colouring your skin.
Wear an old button up shirt so you wonâ€™t have to pull anything over your head.
Wrap your shoulders with an old towel.
Wear latex gloves.
 Misting the tips of your hair with water will help the colour go on more evenly from root to tip.
 Part your hair in the middle, and then from ear to ear. Clip up each section, and colour one section at a time. This will help you avoid missing any spots.
 Work the colour in from the root to the tip, massaging it into your hair with gloved hands. Work as quickly as you can, but work carefully.
 Follow the instructions, leaving the dye in as long as necessary.
 Using cold water, rinse your hair until the water runs clear. If your colour kit includes conditioner, you can apply that, but do not wash your hair for at least two days. This gives your cuticles a chance to close, holding your colour in.

 Maybe an old fleece coat that has outlived its usefulness, or some leftover material. Whatever you have.
 You are taking the place of the second pillow with this one.
 It will need to be about twice the size of the pillow. You will want some looseness for your pet to crawl into.
 Be careful when you leave openings. You will need to have one opening for your pet to go in, and a different type of opening on the side. This is where you will put in the pillow, with its pillowcase (extra protection).
 Maybe, if possible, you might try to get the interest of another animal. Jealousy works great with pets.

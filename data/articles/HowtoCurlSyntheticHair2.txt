 Squirt a little cream-based moisturizer onto the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together and run the moisturizer through your synthetic hair. The moisturizer will help the synthetic hair hold the curl.

You can also use an olive oil in place of the cream moisturizer.
 Determine how large you'd like your curls and lay out several sizes of perm rods. Divide your hair into a small section and roll it up and onto a perm rod. Cap the end so the hair stays tightly wound on the rod. Do this until you've rolled all of your hair onto perm rods.









Try to vary the sizes of the perm rods to get different sizes of curls. For a more natural look, keep the curls near your neck and the back of your head larger and looser. Use smaller perm rods for the curls near your face so they're smaller and tighter.
 Fill a mug 2








If your water cools, rewarm it and continue dipping the perm rods.
Always use caution when handling hot water. If the mug is too hot to handle, wait till it's comfortable to pick up with your bare hands.
 Keep the hair in the perm rods and let them cool and dry completely. They may dry quickly or take a full day to dry, depending on how much hair you wrapped on each curling rod. If you want to sleep with the perm rods in so your curls set overnight, just wear a protective cap.


If you're short on time, you could blow dry the hair. Just ensure that the blow dryer is on the lowest setting.
 Once the hair has dried completely around the perm rods, gently remove them. The curls will probably be tight and springy when pulled. If you'd like them to stay tight and close to your head, just leave them alone. If you'd like the curls to look softer or fluffier, run your fingers through your hair.









You can also separate curls into smaller ones. This can make them look softer and add volume to your hair.

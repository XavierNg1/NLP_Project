 Position the new dishwasher on its back.
 Connect the drain hose with a compression clamp.
 Wrap the water line connection with Teflon tape and attach the 90-degree brass fitting that is used to connect the water line, also known as a dishwasher 90.
 Screw the front legs of the new dishwasher in so that you can easily slide the unit into place. Meanwhile, have an assistant pull the drain hose through under the sink as you go.
 Connect the water line underneath the dishwasher to the dishwasher 90.
 Pass the electric cable through the sleeve on the dishwasher and tighten the sleeve so that the cable can not be pulled out.
 Now make all the electrical wired connections â€“ ground wire to the green screw, white wire to white wire, and black wire to black wire. Use wire nuts to secure the connection.
 Connect the new drain hose at its previous position.

 If you are working on a fresh stain, you should try to absorb as much ink as possible. Before blotting the stain, place a white cloth or rag underneath the stained portion of the garment. This will prevent the stain from spreading to the back of the garment while you attempt to remove it.








Use a white cloth to ensure that the color of the cloth doesn’t lift and further stain the garment you’re working on.;
, Take another white cloth and blot at the stain. Use gentle dabbing motions instead of rubbing the stain, as rubbing can ingrain the stain further into the fibers of the garment. Keep dabbing until no more ink is being lifted from the stain.
 Flip the garment over and place the clean cloth underneath the stained portion. Repeat the process of dabbing the stain on the other side of the garment, stopping when you don’t see any more ink being lifted.

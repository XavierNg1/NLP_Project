 It's okay if they don't, but check just in case.;
, Most boarding schools provide beds and desks, but it is good to check just in case you need to get furniture. If you do need to bring furniture, it is wise and cheaper if you're going by plane to just buy once you arrive. Carrying furniture via airplane can be expensive and hauling furniture in a crowded car can be a hassle, so check before panicking.
 Think about what you want to bring: your favorite stuffed animal, something from home, posters, clothes, etc.
 Check to make sure you have everything on the list. Don't forget anything, especially clothes!

, Try to keep your load somewhat small. Try to keep it below 5 large bags if possible.
 If you have a roommate, be sure to get along with them and share your ideas while decorating your room. You can sit down at a desk with a notebook and discuss each others ideas, and at the end you will find a design you both like for your room.

 You don't need to kiss anyone that you don't want to kiss. Don't be afraid to just say "no!" Be kind and respectful, but make sure not to let anyone take advantage of you. Advocate for yourself. Only kiss people that you truly want to kiss., You don't need to violently reject a person who just wants to kiss you. Try to put yourself in his/her shoes. Imagine the amount of courage that it takes to ask a person for a kiss! Look for a way to respectfully and tactfully decline.


Try saying, "I'm sorry, but I'm not romantically interested in you."
Say, "I love our friendship, but I'm not ready to take it to the next level."
Say, "Thank you, but no thank you," or "I'm flattered, but I'm not interested."

, If you are out with your boyfriend or girlfriend and he/she makes a move to kiss you, don't pull away and scare them. Just shake your head. If you pull away, they may feel rejected. It may also be effective to just casually look the other direction or divert your attention from your partner for a few seconds.


Smile after you say no so they don't feel rejected. If you don't smile, then they will probably assume that you don't like them. If you do like them, but you don't want to kiss them, then you need to explain why.

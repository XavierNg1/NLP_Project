 To start, you should toast your gluten-free bread, which you should cut into small cubes. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (about 162 degrees Celsius) and separate the cubes of bread between two large baking sheets.Toast the bread in the oven for about 30 minutes.
When done, the bread will be golden brown.
When they're done, transfer the bread to a large bowl and set aside.;
, You should heat your olive oil over medium heat. When it's done heating, it should simmer slightly., Cook your sausage in a large pot. Heat the sausage, stirring frequently, until there are no pink parts remaining. This should take around three minutes. When the sausage is done, remove it from the oil with a slotted spoon and then set it aside., Start with the celery, cooking it until it just begins to soften. This should take around two minutes. Then, add the the onion and cook for an additional two minutes and then add the garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper.Stir the herbs and vegetables until they give off a strong smell.
Use a spoon to remove the vegetables and herbs and place them in the bowl with the breadcrumbs.
 Add the sausage pieces to the mixing bowl that contains the breadcrumbs, vegetables, and herbs. Mix everything together until you have a uniform mixture., Start by adding one cup of broth to the bread. Stir for about a minute, until the bread absorbs the broth.Once the broth is absorbed, add a second cup. Again, stir for about a minute or until the broth is absorbed.
If the bread crumbs still seem a little dry, you can add a third cup of broth. The bread crumbs should be a little moist, but not spongy.
 Place your stuffing in a greased 9 by 13 inch pan. Put the pan into the oven, which should still be set at 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and cover it with tinfoil. Cook your stuffing covered for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, remove the foil. Cook the stuffing again until the top becomes golden brown. This should take about 5 more minutes.

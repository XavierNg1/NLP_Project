 If you own your home, or if you landlord allows you to paint, try painting some cabinets. This is a fairly simple change, so it does not take a lot of effort, but it can really add a lot of color to your home. An otherwise dull kitchen can really be brightened up with, say, pastel cabinets.If you feel painting the outsides of the cabinets would be too much, you can just paint the insides. You can also simply paint around the edges of the cabinets or the handles.
 Try hiring someone to replace a dull stainless steel or plastic sink with a colorful one. A bright red sink, for example, can brighten up a kitchen that has mostly neutral colors.This can be pricey, however. If you're on a budget, there are many other cheaper ways to brighten up your kitchen.
 If you're able to paint the walls of your kitchen, do not hesitate to go for a bold color. As kitchens are generally smaller rooms, a bolder color will not be overwhelming. Instead of choosing a neutral shade to paint your kitchen, paint it in a bright color you love. You can, for example, paint the walls of your kitchen in a vibrant yellow shade., If you don't want to paint, you can also opt for wallpaper. You can choose a colorful wallpaper pattern to add some color to your kitchen. Wallpaper can be great if you want a particular pattern, such as stripes.If you're renting, you can always purchase temporary wall paper at a department store. This is easily installed with adhesives.

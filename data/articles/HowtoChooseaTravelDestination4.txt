 If you’ve narrowed your list to a couple of choices instead of one stand-out, compare the two. Apply the same criteria that you used to eliminate other choices. Find out if one seems more sensible, doable, and enjoyable than the other.
 If your final choices still seem equally appealing after a second comparison, forget the checklist. Take a step back, clear your head, and give yourself some time. Wait to see which destination you find yourself dreaming about more. Listen to your heart and go with that.
 If your group is equally torn between two destinations, work toward an agreement. Ask for everyone’s reasons for their preferred choice. Based on these, try to find a solution by considering things like:


The likelihood of being able to travel as a group again in the future so you can visit both.
Whether individuals in the group will have a chance to go to their top pick on their own in the future.
Timely considerations, like the season, special events, and once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.
Whether a previous option that has already been nixed for this or that reason should be reconsidered if everyone can agree to it.

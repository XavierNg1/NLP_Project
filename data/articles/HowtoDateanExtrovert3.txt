 There will be times when your extrovert makes plans without you or you need to take some "me" time or simply don’t want to participate in what they are doing. Having your own interests will make it easier for you to date an extrovert because you won’t be dependent on them for all your entertainment.Spend time doing things you enjoy like drawing, writing poetry, swimming, or gaming.
If you’re not sure what you enjoy, then make a list of things you’ve been wanting to try.
Pick two or three activities off of the list and give them a shot. For example, you might want to try rock climbing or meditation.
 Extroverts are friendly, chatty people. Just because they are super social doesn’t mean they have eyes for anyone else.Instead of being jealous and thinking that your date is flirting, accept that your extrovert is a social person and be secure in yourself.


Trust that your extrovert is into you and only you because of all your great qualities.
Tell yourself, “He’s dating me because of my great personality, good looks, and the way I make him smile.”
Remember that meeting new people and socializing are two of the big traits of extroverts. It doesn’t mean your extrovert is flirting.
You might say to yourself, “She’s talking to that guy, but she’s here with me. I don’t need to be jealous.”

, It can be easy to get caught up in an extrovert’s world —spending time with their friends, going places they want to go. While you are dating your extrovert, make sure that you are still keeping in touch with your family and friends.


Schedule time to spend with your family and friends. For example, take an afternoon or evening for a family meal every once and awhile.
Invite your friends along sometimes when you and your extrovert go out.
Do things with just you and your friends. For example, plan a girl’s night out without your extrovert.

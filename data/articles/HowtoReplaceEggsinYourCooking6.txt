 Look for egg replacers, not substitutes, as these can sometimes still contain egg. Make sure you check the label, just to be sure. They can replace eggs in baking cookies in muffins or in dishes like scrambles.Follow the directions on the box for each product. Generally, you mix the egg replacer with water and add it to your recipe.Vegan egg yolks must be mixed with a blender--hand mixing is not vigorous enough to get the desired consistency., Puree the tofu to make sure there are no lumps or chunks in your dish, and make sure you use silken or soft tofu--firm tofu won't blend very well.Make sure the tofu is plain and neither baked nor seasoned.Use 1/4 cup tofu per egg.Tofu will not fluff like eggs, but the texture is otherwise very similar to eggs.
 If you are making vegan scrambled eggs and still want that golden color, turmeric will do the job.It can also add a peppery, tart flavor to your dish.Use just a pinch of turmeric in your recipe to turn your tofu or other egg substitute yellow.

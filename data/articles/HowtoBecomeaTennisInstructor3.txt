 No one is going to know you are a tennis instructor unless you tell them. Every time you meet someone new, introduce yourself as a coach and give them your card. Also, tell everyone you know that you coach all the time, even if you don't. You never know, maybe even an ex or your boss has a passion for tennis you never knew about.

Open Twitter and Facebook accounts to promote your tennis business. Share updates about upcoming events, classes and tennis how-to tips. Find fellow tennis enthusiasts and follow them. Ask friends nicely (and sparingly) to help spread the word through their networks.
Make your own website. Have the details of availability, lesson types, costs, etc. all laid out for easy reading. It doesn't have to be complicated (in fact, the simpler the better), and there are plenty of free website making tools available.
Offer discounted lessons to begin building your client base. Have a scheme in place whereby existing clients get discounted lessons for referring new clients. This can all be displayed on your website and marketing materials––don't be too pushy face-to-face, clients will learn quickly enough that there are savings to be made by reading your site and materials.

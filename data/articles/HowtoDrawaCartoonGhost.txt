 Attached a few curved lines to it, as shown for the body/tail of the ghost. Add faint guidelines for the features.
 Be creative! Your ghost could be silly or scary or anything else, depending on how you want it to look., If you want your ghost to have appendages, include them here. You could also give it clothing or a group of people to be creeping up on--again, be creative!, Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. Add in more details if you want and erase any unnecessary guidelines., Use traces of light color for the most effective look, and add in shadows/highlighting to deepen the perspective of your drawing.

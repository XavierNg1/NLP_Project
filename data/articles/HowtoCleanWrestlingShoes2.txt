 Shoemakers often recommend that you not put basketball or tennis shoes in a washing machine (or especially a clothes dryer), although most shoes will probably survive the process just fine. Because of their ruggedness and quick-dry construction, though, you’ll usually find a recommendation that wrestling shoes can be put in the wash.Check the tag on the shoes, or call or visit the website of the shoe company.
 Unless otherwise recommended by the shoemaker, start with the least aggressive wash settings. Add a few old towels to limit the shoes’ banging against the wash drum, or put them in a pillowcase. Add a normal or perhaps slightly lesser amount of detergent.Take out any removable insoles and shoestrings before starting the wash. You can wash them along with the shoes.
 If you have the time, it’s easier on the shoes to skip the clothes dryer. Place some newspaper inside the shoes and stick them in an airy, sunny spot if possible.Remember, most wrestling shoes are made to dry quickly, so they may be completely dry within several hours, if not certainly overnight.
 If your shoes are well-worn, filthy, and nearing the end of their useful lives, you don’t have much to lose by adjusting the washing machine to the warm or hot water settings. Set it to a regular wash cycle, but keep it on a low spin setting. Use towels or a pillowcase to reduce clanging and possible impact damage.If you’re in a rush or aren’t overly worried about the minor risk to your shoes, go ahead and put them in the dryer as well. But don’t get too daring — put the dryer on its low heat setting. And throw the old towels from the wash in as well.

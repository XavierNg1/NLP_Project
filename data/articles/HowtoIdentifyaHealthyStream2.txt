 A healthy stream can support a diverse range of organisms. The more diverse a stream is, the healthier it is. Streams that only have a few species living in them may be indicative that the conditions in the stream are less than ideal.Start by surveying the species seen in and around the stream. 

 Use these observations to look up organisms and the conditions necessary for them to thrive. 


, Plants growing near the bank of the stream provide important shade that shelters the fish and helps regulate the temperature of the water. Leaves falling into the stream also provide food for invertebrates. Vegetation is essential for filtering runoff before it enters the stream.A healthy stream will have native trees, shrubs, and wetland vegetation growing on its banks. 

 Grass, weeds, and short tussock plants do not provide the shelter and filtration that tall plants do and can lead to an unhealthy stream. 


, Macroinvertebrates such as snails, worms, mollusks, leeches, crustaceans, and insects are essential to the health of a stream. Not only do they serve as food for larger animals, but they also serves as the “janitors” of a stream. They recycle decomposing nutrients and help support the ecosystem of the stream.Macroinvertebrates are very sensitive to changes in the environment such as oxygen levels, pH changes, and pollution. 


, The presence, absence, or dominance of a particular species can be compared to an index of health and used to assess the health of the stream. Use the observations of the flora and fauna around the stream to determine the health of the stream.

 The absence of plants and animals around the stream bed will indicate that the stream is unhealthy as it cannot support this type of life. 

 The dominance of aquatic worms, leeches, pouch snails, and midge larva (pollution tolerant) and the absence of mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies (pollution sensitive) also indicate an unhealthy stream.

 The blowout hairstyle, also known as a temple fade or taper fade, first became popular in the 1990s, but has recently become famous thanks to Paul-D from Jersey Shore.The blowout hairstyle consist of short sideburns and longer sides with a large amount of hair on the crown, which is usually gelled upwards. As the result, this hairstyle may cause the wearer to look like they've been electrocuted! , To achieve a blowout haircut, you will need the proper equipment. This includes a hair clipper with at least 5 hair guards, a t-liner outliner, a pair of hair shears, hair combs and some hair gel.
 Using the t-liner, create the first guideline on the back of the neck and the beginning of the sideburns. The length of the hair in this guideline varies according to personal preference, but it will usually be somewhere between 0 levels and 1 levels.
 Next grab your number four guard with the clippers closed and create a second guideline which extends about 2.5 inches (6.4Â cm) above the original guideline. This will help you to see how much room you have to work with.
 Using a number 3 clipper guard, start blending the first and second guidelines together, using an outward motion.
 To avoid having your blowout look like a mushroom cut, use a clipper over comb technique to cut the hair next to the guidelines. This helps to soften the blowout by creating a taper effect.
 Once you have finished tapering the back of the neck and the sideburns, use the hair shears to cut the hair on top of the head and above the ears to the desired length. It can be as long or short as you wish.
 Once you have finished with the shears and are happy with your blowout haircut, use some hair gel to spike the hair on top of your head to give it a neater, more polished look.

 Pour your 300 grams (1 1/2 cups) of granulated sugar, 283 grams (2 1/2 cups) of white rice flour, 57 grams (1/2 cup) of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves to a large mixing bowl and stir it together with a whisk. Continue mixing everything together for around 5-7 minutes, or until all of the ingredients have been incorporated thoroughly., Blend the wet ingredients together in a food processor or by hand in a separate bowl. Continue to mix the ingredients together until the mixtures resemble a milkshake. Once the batter is well-mixed, add it to your dry mixture and whisk the ingredients together until the dry and wet ingredients have been incorporated with one another., Mix in your zucchini and the rest of your optional ingredients and fold the batter until they are evenly distributed throughout the batter. Before adding the zucchini to your bread batter, make sure that it is dry.Dry your zucchini by patting them down with a paper towel and leaving them at room temperature for 10 minutes to dry.
 Pour the mixture evenly into two separate 9" x 5" loaf pans. Smooth the top of each of your loaves of bread with a spatula for a clean looking baked bread., Bake both of your loaves in a preheated oven. Turn each of the loaves halfway through cooking so that the bread cooks evenly throughout. To achieve the same baking, make sure that each of the bread pans are on the same oven rack.If you are making muffins rather than a loaf of bread, cooking times should be reduced to 20-25 minutes.
 Once your bread is golden brown on the surface and you can poke it with a toothpick, it's ready to come out of the oven. Take it out and allow it to cook on an oven rack for 5-10 minutes before transferring it to a plate and allowing it to cool further.

Your bread can also be wrapped and frozen for up to three months.

 If you are unable to dispose of the remains or care more about your pet’s spirit than the actual physical remains, you may want to find someone else to deal with the remains. Your vet may offer to handle the remains if the dog dies in the office.If your pet does not die in the office, they may dispose of the remains for a fee.
 Your local humane society may take the remains of dead pets. They may come to pick up the remains, or you may have to carry them at the office. This is often offered free of charge.Some humane societies have “drop off” bins for your pet, but many people find these bins to be too impersonal and choose to take them during house so they can hand them off to a person.
 If your pet has died, you may not have anywhere to bury them, and you may not wish to have them cremated. If this is the case, contact animal control or your local government to ask if someone, like the sanitation department, can pick up the remains.Never toss your dog’s remains on the side of the road, in a dumpster, or in the woods. Always find a way to dispose of them properly. If you are unsure how, contact your local government for help.

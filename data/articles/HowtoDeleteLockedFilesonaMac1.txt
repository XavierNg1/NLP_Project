 Secure Empty Trash is a security measure designed by Apple to make sure sensitive files have their indexing removed from the hard drive and the space they occupied overwritten. Due to the way solid state hard drives store data, this method is less reliable on solid state drives, and thus is being phased out by Apple.


The Secure Empty Trash option has been removed in OSX 10.11+.;
, Drag the locked file into the trash.
 Open the trash in the finder and select “File > Secure Empty Trash”. You can also access this with “Ctrl + click > Secure Empty Trash”. The file should delete without error.

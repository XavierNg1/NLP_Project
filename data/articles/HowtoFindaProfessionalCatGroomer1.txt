 One of the most efficient ways to find a good cat groomer is to ask your vet for a recommendation. Your vet likely knows your cat well and is aware of its temperament as well as its grooming needs. They may be able to recommend a groomer that will be a good fit for your cat.For example, you may ask your vet, “You know my cat well. Can you refer me to a good groomer for my cat?” or “Do you know of a reputable cat groomer in the area?”;
, You can also approach friends and family who own cats and use a groomer for a recommendation. If you notice a friend’s cat is looking well groomed and clean, ask them where they got their cat groomed. If you know a family member often gets their cat groomed on a regular basis, ask them for more information on their groomer.For example, you may say to a friend, “Your cat looks great and so well groomed. Where do you get them groomed? Can you recommend a good groomer?”

, Another option is to see if representatives at your local pet store can recommend a good cat groomer in the area. Usually good cat groomers will have a reputation and are known in the community. Sometimes pet stores are actually located close in the same building or right next door from a pet groomer.For example, you may ask a representative at the pet store, “I’m looking for a good cat groomer in the area, do you have any recommendations?”

 Clasp your hands together, and drop your chin to your chest. Reach your arms straight forward. As you do so, you should be pulling the shoulders forward. Hold the pose for a few breaths before releasing.
 Look diagonally down to the bottom of your shirt. Hold your gaze for 20 seconds and then pull your head back into a straight position. This will stretch your your levator scapulae muscles between your neck and back.
 Look straight forward. Tilt your neck so that your ear is dropping towards your shoulder. While you do this, your chin should not drop. Make sure your shoulder does not lift or raise. Hold this pose for between ten and thirty seconds.
 This exercise will contract the muscles rather than stretch them, but it can provide relief if your upper back is stiff, tight, or sore. Rest your shoulder blades and then slowly pull them back towards each other. Your chest will thrust forward as your back muscles are contracted. Go back to starting position, then repeat the squeeze.

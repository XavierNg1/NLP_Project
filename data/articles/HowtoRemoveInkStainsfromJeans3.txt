 Make sure the water is cool and not hot. Heat will set the stain making it much more difficult to remove.
 Place the portion of the jeans that contains the stain in the vinegar solution. The jeans will absorb the water and vinegar and may wick the liquid onto other surfaces. You may want to place a towel under the vinegar and water solution and under the jeans., Mix 3 parts of baking soda with 1 part water. The paste will be thick.
 Apply the paste gently and rub it into the stain using a circular motion. Allow the baking soda paste to sit on the stain.
 Rinse the toothbrush in a clean vinegar solution while cleaning the jeans.
 If the stain remains try spot treating with commercial stain treatment and launder the jeans in a washing machine.

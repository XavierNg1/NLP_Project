 You have to change the settings on Word before you can create your booklet. You can turn a document you've already written into a booklet, but it is best to create the booklet layout first and then put the content in.Find the Page layout tab. It should be located in the icon in the corner of Page Setup.
 This is in Page Setup under Margins. You'll go to the drop down tab, which will be on Normal and you'll change it to Book fold.
 While you don't have to do this, it's a good idea to change the Gutter setting from 0 to 1 so that words donâ€™t end up jumbled into the binding.
 You can get an idea of what the booklet is going to look like formatting-wise. From there you simply have to add the content (or make sure that content looks how you want it to look if you already had content).


You can change anything that doesn't look right and you can add anything that your booklet needs (like page numbers).
 You will need to print on both sides of the paper, otherwise your booklet is going to end up with a lot of blank pages, which you don't necessarily want. You can have your printer do this automatically, or manually (which means you'll need to stand there and feed paper to the printer).


If you are manually feeding the paper to the printer make sure that you orient the pages properly. You do not want to end up with upside down pages in your booklet.
 Make sure that you put together the booklet with the corresponding pages. This is why it's a good thing to have page numbers. When you fold, it's a good idea to start by folding each page individually and then putting them together.


You can staple along the fold once you've folded the pages.
 The above method is the most basic way of creating a booklet in Word, but you can find lots of cool design templates on the internet or through Word if you want something a little more creative or enticing.

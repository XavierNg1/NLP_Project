 Pour the milk into a saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat the milk on medium-high to high heat. Once the milk reaches a boil, allow it to boil for a full 1 to 2 minutes.


Note that high-fat dairy products, like cream, can be boiled with little to no problem. As a result, you may find that low-fat milk takes very little time to boil and curdle while whole milk will take longer.
Milk will not begin to curdle until it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). To maximize and speed up the curdling effect, let the temperature climb even higher. You can monitor the temperature using a clip-on instant food thermometer.
Stir the milk occasionally but not frequently. Stirring will spread the heat throughout the liquid, but it will also cause the milk to take longer to reach a boil.
Leave the saucepan uncovered.
 Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the milk stand at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Do not stir the milk as it stands.


If you would like the milk to curdle more, you can let it stand for a longer period of time or return it to the heat and continue boiling it until larger curds form.
 If you need to separate the solid curds from the liquid whey, you can pour the curdled milk into a cheesecloth. Wrap the cheesecloth up and let the liquid drain out into a sink or large mixing bowl.


Understand that using heat only without using acid will produce softer, less-formed curds. This method is best used if you need grainy or soured milk rather than actual curds.
If you do not need to strain the curdled milk, you can skip this step and use it as is.

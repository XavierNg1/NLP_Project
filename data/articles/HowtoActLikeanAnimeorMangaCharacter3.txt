 Your character's behavior might be considered the norm in his or her world. Parts of it may not be in this one. Even in conventions, there are some behaviors that are frowned upon. This includes things like hitting, groping, swearing excessively, and so forth. If you think it may get you in trouble, don't do it.


If you character is very mean, consider downplaying that aspect of their personality. This way, you won't offend or hurt other people.
This doesn't mean that you can't act like your desired character at all. Mimic the good and exclude the bad.
 While acting like an anime character may seem cool and fun, there are times when you need to take things more seriously. If you are around people who may not be familiar with the anime, or the fact that you are pretending, it is best to be yourself.


For example: fans of "Fullmetal Alchemist" might find it amusing if you rage about your lack of height like Edward Elric. Your doctor certainly will not.
 If you are cosplaying at a convention, some people may react to your acting and play along, especially if they are also cosplaying. Not every cosplayer will, however. If you mimic your character and they don't respond, leave them be. Not everyone will want to "role play."


Watch their body language for cues. If they seem uncomfortable or agitated, such as shuffling, looking around, or making excuses, leave them be.
 Don't become the character and forget who you are deep down inside. Remember, your friends chose you for who you are, and not the anime or manga character you are portraying.


At the same time, consider using some of your character's aspects to better yourself. For example, if your character is a great listener, try focusing on that aspect of your character outside of acting.

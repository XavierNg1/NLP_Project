 When you are singing it is important that you take deep breaths and breathe from your diaphragm or abdomen. This will ensure that you are not keeping too much air in your throat and placing strain on your voice. In order to ensure that you are breathing with your diaphragm, try the following exercise.Stand up straight and place your hands around the sides of your waist (between your pelvic bone and lowest rib). Then, take a deep breath in and try and make your fingers expand.
Alternatively, you can lie on your back on the ground and inhale. Try and make your stomach, not your chest rise when you inhale.
This will help you learn what it feels like to breath from your diaphragm.;
, When you are singing, you want to try and inhale through both your nose and mouth. If you only inhale through your nose, you will struggle to intake enough air. Similarly, if you only breath through your mouth, you will put strain on your vocal cords by drying them out. This can actually impact the quality of the sound you produce.Practice breathing in through both your mouth and nose while you sing.
 Another important aspect of singing and breathing is slowly exhaling. This will allow your tone to remain even while you sing. In order to practice controlled breathing, take a deep abdominal breath and then release your breath and make an “ssss” sound. Continue to exhale for approximately ten seconds.Continue to practice this technique and work on creating a consistent “ssss” sound throughout the entire exhalation.

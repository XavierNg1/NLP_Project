 In this method, you'll use a coffee can lid to make a circular frame for fabric that will act as the filter. Many different sizes can work, but in general, wide, stiff lids of six inches across work well.



Stiffer plastic lids are best. Flexible, floppy lids are not ideal.
 Use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut out the entire center portion of the lid. When you're done, you should have a stiff plastic hoop. Through the cut-out center part of the lid away.


For the stiffest plastic lids, you may need to use a drill, awl, or saw to get started. Be very careful when using these tools. A heavy pair of work gloves and proper eye protection are musts.
 Now that you have a stiff hoop of plastic, all you need to do is make the filter with a tight layer of porous fabric. Pantyhose or tights work very well. Simply slide a stocking over the hoop, pull it tight, gather the slack at the bottom, and secure it with rubber bands or tape.


You can also use embroidery material or screen door mesh like in the section above, but this is a little harder. You can use clamps, binder clips, or tape along the back of the rim to keep these materials reasonably tight.
 Your pop filter is now ready to use. Use tape or clamps to position it in front of the mic just like you would for the methods above.

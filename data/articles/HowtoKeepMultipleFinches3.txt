 Mixed-sex pairs of finches sometimes breed. Unless you are actively looking to keep breeding pairs, the best way to prevent this is to keep your finches divided by their sex. Have one cage with a pair or group of female finches, and a separate cage for your male finches.Same-sex finch pairs can form strong bonds, so try to keep your finches in groups that you will be able to maintain throughout their lifetime. Don’t plan on moving them into or out of a bonded pair.
Alternatively, you can consider keeping just one sex at a time.
 Cages of just male and just female finches should never be kept in the same room, as hearing finches of the opposite sex could spark territorial fighting within the cage. Even mixed-sex pairs may come to fight, though, if they find finches in another cage more appealing. That’s why it is best to keep different cages of finches well-separated.You may try placing the cages in separate rooms, or on opposite ends of large rooms such as a living room.
Try to avoid multiple unit cages, as while the finches will be physically separated, they can still see and hear each other, which can cause fighting within a pair or group.
 Finches in the same cage will largely be on the same schedule. You may need to work a little harder to keep finches in different cages on similar schedules. Make a routine, and make sure you do it for all your finches cages at as close to the same time as possible.If, for example, you decide that one cage will get fly time at 1pm, make sure you have time immediately after for your other cage to fly, as well. Otherwise, your finches may get noisy and rowdy.

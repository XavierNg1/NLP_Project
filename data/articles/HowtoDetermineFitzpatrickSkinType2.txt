 Though the Fitzpatrick quiz is helpful, it’s still subjective and does not take the place of professional medical advice.Make an appointment with your healthcare provider and ask for help determining your Fitzpatrick Skin Type. They may be better able to figure it out than you are.
 If your regular doctor isn’t certain how to determine your Fitzpatrick skin type, ask for a referral to a dermatologist. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in the skin. They may be the best choice to advise you about skin care and diagnose and treat any problems.
 See your doctor right away if you notice any new growths on your skin or changes to your skin. Skin cancer can be deadly, and changes to a mole are often the first sign of melanoma. See your doctor if you have a mole that starts itching, bleeding, crusting, growing, or changing in other ways.Examine your skin monthly, and report it to your doctor if you notice any of these changes:Asymmetry: moles should be relatively symmetrical – the same all the way around, not irregularly shaped

Border: normal moles are usually round with a defined border; a blotchy, irregular border could be a sign of trouble

Color: uneven, blotchy color may be a sign of a problem

Diameter: measure your mole –see your doctor for anything larger than ¼ inch (6mm)

Evolving: any change in size, shape, elevation, or anything else should prompt a visit to the doctor

 First cut the Velveeta in to tiny squares and set aside. Have the can of (Rotel) tomatoes opened, drained and ready to be used. Have the amount of Jalapeno peppers that are desired set aside. If someone should choose to use black olives have them set aside, also. Be sure to have a medium size pot ready and set on top of the stove burner. See tips below on side dish ideas.;
, Then add in the blocks of Velveeta. Be sure to stir the cheese product, constantly, until melted.
 Be sure to continue to stir.
 Over very low heat, and with a lid on allow sauce to simmer, for at least (5-10) minutes. This will allow the flavor to develop, after adding the Jalapeno peppers.
 The sauce needs to be creamy and not real solid. So it is best not to allow the sauce to cool down much, if any at all.

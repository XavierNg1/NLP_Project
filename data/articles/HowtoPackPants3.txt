 If you’re concerned about damaging pants, or you need to show up to your destination and wear them without time to iron them, use a suit bag that will allow you to pack them vertically without folding them in half. This is the best way to keep your pants wrinkle-free.


Affix the pants to a pants hanger that won't damage the fabric. Some pants hangers require folding the pants in half at the knee and draping them over the top of the hanger.
Store them neatly in your suit bag, making sure they’re completely straight so they'll remain wrinkle-free.
 If you end up with a few pairs of rolled pants, pack these casual items below items that need to stay wrinkle-free. Tuck them in toward the bottom of the suitcase since it doesn't matter as much if they get a little crushed.
 This way they won’t get crushed and wrinkled as you travel. Lay them over the top of the other items you've packed when your suitcase is mostly full. Don’t pack shoes or other heavy items on top of your folded pants., This extra layer of protection will keep them from shifting in transit. It's a good way to keep freshly-ironed pants from picking up a lot of little creases while they're in the suitcase.

What still needs to be done and what should take priority? If you use a to-do list daily, tweak it during your lunch hour. Mark off items you've completed and push items around as necessary.

Branching out and meeting other people at the office can be advantageous to your career later on., Sometimes, small errands can be quickly taken care of during your lunch hour. If there are talks you can only complete during the afternoon hours, take a few minutes during your lunch hour to do them.

Remember that it's important to take breaks and unwind as well.

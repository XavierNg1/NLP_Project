 Line with parchment paper or a silicone sheet.
 Sift the icing/confectioners sugar and cocoa into the bowl. Add the smooth peanut butter. Mix all ingredients together well.
 Place into the double boiler to melt over gentle heat. Add a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture. Stir occasionally until melted. Remove the melted mixture from the heat.
 Whisk or beat together thoroughly, until well combined and smooth. A handheld electric beater will make this process easier. Once it appears creamy, it's ready for pouring.
 Use a spatula or spoon to push it right out to the corners of the pan or dish. Smooth over with the back of the spoon or spatula.
 The fudge will firm up.


Don't let the towel touch the fudge; it should only rest on the pan/dish edges.
 Run a butter knife around the edges of the fudge. Tip the whole piece of fudge onto a cutting board and peel off the paper or silicone mat, if needed.
 Place back in the fridge for another 2 hours to harden completely. It is now ready to serve or give as a gift.


This fudge must be kept stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container.

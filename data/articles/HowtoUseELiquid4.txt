 For people trying to quit smoking, choose a nicotine level lighter than the amount of nicotine in the cigarettes you typically smoke.Below is a general idea of the e-liquid you should choose based on your usual cigarette:


If you smoke ultra-light cigarettes, pick an e-liquid that has 8 mg of nicotine in it. If you smoked light cigarettes, choose an e-liquid that has 11 mg of nicotine. For smokers who smoked regular cigarettes, choose an e-liquid that has 16 mg. This is often the most commonly chosen nicotine level for e-liquids. For full-flavored cigarette smokers, pick an e-liquid that has 24 mg of nicotine in it. If you smoke unfiltered cigarettes, pick an e-liquid with 36 mg of nicotine.,
Work your way down until you get to the zero nicotine e-liquid. Be prepared for small symptoms of withdrawal as you slowly decrease your nicotine levels.
 Inhale as many drags from the e-cigarette as necessary to have your needs fulfilled. The nicotine in the e-liquid will act as a healthier substitute for traditional cigarettes.

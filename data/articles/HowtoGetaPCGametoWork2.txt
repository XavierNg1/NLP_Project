 This website offers a lightweight tool to scan your computer’s hardware and compare it to the system requirements of a selected game.
 If the game does not appear in the dropdown menu check your spelling first. If your spelling is correct, it's possible that the system requirements for that specific game are not in the database.


If your game's requirements are not in the database, consult the manufacturer's website for the requirements and compare them to your own system's specifications.
 This button appears below the search bar and will prompt you to pick a method for scanning your hardware.
 You will be redirected to a page to download the desktop app and instructions on its use.


Alternately you can select to view the system requirements of the game without downloading the desktop app, but the site will not be able to scan and compare your computer’s hardware this way.
 After the app scans your computer it will automatically close and your hardware will be displayed on the website.


The app does not need to be installed to your hard drive - it is a self-contained program.
 The site will highlight which pieces of your hardware meet the system requirements and which fall short. If your hardware meets all of the minimum requirements, then you should be able to run the game (albeit at low quality settings).


If you system does not meet the minimum requirements to run the game, you will need to purchase and install more powerful hardware for your computer in order to run the game properly.
This page will also offer suggestions for possible driver updates or hardware upgrades.
Your hardware will be compared with both the minimum and recommended system requirements.
 If your hardware meets the minimum or recommended requirements but you are still encountering problems, then the computing power of your hardware is not the cause of the problem. You might try updating the driver software for your graphics card.

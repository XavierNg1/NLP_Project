 A-lines, shifts and sheaths receive a modern interpretation with the introduction of a bright new color. Combining classics and neons is an accessible way to try out this new color trend.
 Doing so can create too much contrast and appear dated. On the other hand, black with ultraviolet or neon blue embellishments? Yes, please.
 An overcoat is a great, simple way to make an entrance (and exit) and paired with black tights, heels, and a simple bun or ponytail, can be even more exciting and chic than the sheath you’ve got on underneath.
 Whether you opt for solid neon orange platforms or black kitten heels with electric blue accents, make sure the shoes enhance your outfit.


Use brightly colored shoes to set-off a classic black-and-white outfit.
Don’t feel forced to match your shoes and accessories. If your shoes and purse are the exact shade, it may appear dated. Instead, opt for complementary colors like bright green shoes with an orange clutch or an electric aqua belt with a bright yellow satchel.

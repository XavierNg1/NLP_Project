 This process can easily damage root systems and make the roots susceptible to fungi and diseases.


If possible, ensure that the trench is at least 8 feet (2.4Â m) away from the tree trunk.
Once the trench is dug, cleanly cut affected roots with shears.
Fill in the trench as soon as possible to avoid extra stress on the tree.

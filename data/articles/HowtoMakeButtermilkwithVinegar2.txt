 Add the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 2 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder, 1/4 cup of sugar, and 2 cups of flour to a sifter. If you don't have a sifter, you can use a fine mesh strainer. Sift the ingredients into a bowl.To sift with a strainer, lightly shake the strainer, or tap the edge to make the ingredients fall through the holes.
 Add 1/2 a stick of butter to microwave bowl. Heat it in the microwave until it is melted.
 Add the 2 eggs, the 2 cups of buttermilk, and the melted butter to the bowl. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix the ingredients., Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Fold the batter together gently.Lumps are fine for this batter. If you over mix the batter, your pancakes will be dense.
 In a skillet over medium heat, add a pat of butter. Let it melt., Add 1/3 cup of the batter to the skillet. Add a small smattering of fruit on top of the pancake.You can use blueberries, strawberries, or raspberries, to name a few, in either fresh or frozen varieties. However, if you use larger fruits, such as strawberries, you should chop them smaller before adding them to the pancake. You can also try small chunks of bananas or chocolate chips.
 Each pancake should cook for a couple of minutes on each side. Look for small bubbles in the top of the batter. Those should start to pop before you flip the pancake., Keep adding 1/3 a cup of batter for each pancake, cooking them until the batter is gone. Add more butter as needed to the skillet. You can hold the pancakes in a warm oven until you are ready to serve them.

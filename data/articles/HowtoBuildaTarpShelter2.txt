 The ridge-line will support the top section of your tarp shelter. This line is created by stringing a length of cord between two trees. This gives your tarp an elevated point of support and will form the shape of the a-frame tarp shelter. Place the ridge-line using these steps:








Tie one section of the rope to a tree. Place it as high up the tree trunk as you would like the roof of your tarp shelter to be.
Bring the other end over to the adjacent tree and tie it at the same level.
Make sure the cord is as tight as it can be to ensure a strong ridge-line.
 Once your ridge-line has been created, you can lay the tarp over top of it. For an a-frame tarp shelter, place the tarp over the ridge-line in the center of the tarp. This will leave equal halves of the tarp hanging down from the ridge-line.




Make sure the tarp is equally hanging from both sides of the ridge-line to avoid problems.
 After you've placed the tarp over the ridge-line, you can fasten it to the ground. Take one of the bottom sections of tarp and pull it outwards, away from the center of the tent. Once you've gotten it to a place that you like, secure it to the ground by taking these steps:








Place a tent stake into the ground, near to the point the tarps corner while it is stretched out.
Tie a length of cord between the tent stake and the corner of the tarp.
Make sure this cord is tight and holds the tarp securely to the ground.
Do the same thing for each of the other three corners of your a-frame tarp shelter.

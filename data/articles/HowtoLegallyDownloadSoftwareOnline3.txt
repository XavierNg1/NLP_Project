 Most major products (usually excluding games) are available on a trial basis. These are typically 30- or 60-day trials, where you can use most or all of the programs features. After the trial period is over, you will be asked to purchase the product before you continue using it.


Most developers will provide a trial version directly from their websites. You may need to register with the company in order to download the trial.
 Once youâ€™ve started using the trial software, determine if the software suits your needs and if it is worth your money. Check around for freeware or open source alternatives; professional software can get very expensive.

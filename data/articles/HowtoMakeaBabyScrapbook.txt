Your theme often depends on which pictures you would like to use in the book. Some commonly used baby themes include the birth and hospital stay, the first year, holidays, special vacations and outings.
Some baby scrapbooks do not have specific themes apart from being a scrapbook about a baby. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but you may find that you have so many baby pictures that scrapbooking is easier when you focus on one specific theme per book.;

Select a book and choose paper in colors and designs that relate to your theme. You should also pick out stickers, photograph holders, colored pens, stencils, stamps, craft scissors and any other accessories or supplies you would like to use as you create your scrapbook.



Many parents include items such as footprint and handprint copies, birth certificate copies, cards, gift tags, hospital bracelets, ultrasound scans, hospital cafeteria menus, newspaper clippings, baptismal certificate copies and plane ticket receipts.

Examples include making paper frames, adding stickers and cutting the edges with decorative crafting scissors.



Alternate the locations and angles of the material to keep your book visually interesting. Many scrapbookers like to include items in chronological order to tell the story of specific events in a baby's life.
 You may choose to write small notes to the baby using colorful pens.

 Keeping a journal can be a great component of your weight loss program. It can provide you with the ability to track a variety of factors that may be able to keep you on track long-term.


Studies show that people who track their food are more likely to stick to their diets and maintain their weight loss long-term.So no matter what diet you end up following, track your food for the best chance of success.
You can also track your progress as well. Keep a weekly log of your weight and total weight loss.
Also consider making notes about what's working and what's not working about your diet. When the time comes to reevaluate your diet plan, review your notes and make any necessary changes.
 Whether you follow a commercial diet or your own plan, it's important to reevaluate your progress regularly. This will help you determine if your plan is appropriately working for you.


Consider your weight loss. Weigh yourself weekly and then tally up how much you've lost over the entire month. If you're doing well, you may choose to continue with your current plan. If you haven't lost much weight, you might need to take a look at your food diary or calorie levels and adjust as needed.
Also consider how easy your plan has been to follow. Have you been physically satisfied with your meals? Are you feeling hungry throughout the day? Are you having a lot of cravings? Make changes to your dietary intake as needed.
 Find a support group while you're trying to lose weight and when you're trying to maintain your weight loss and healthy lifestyle. Having a support group may help you keep your weight off long-term.


Many studies show that those people who relied on a support group of either friends, family members or other dieters, were more successful and were able to keep their weight off long-term.Talk to your friends, family members or coworkers about your new diet. Ask if they'd be willing to join you.
You can also find support groups online or find ones that meet in person.

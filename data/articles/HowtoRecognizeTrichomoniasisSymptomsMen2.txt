It is a highly contagious STD., Certain behaviors put you at increased risk for trichomoniasis. You may be at increased risk if any of the following are true for you:


You've had multiple sexual partners.
You have a history of having other sexually transmitted infections.
You have had unprotected sex with a partner whose STD status you do not know., If you've previously had an outbreak of trichomoniasis, even if it was successfully treated, you're at increased risk of developing the disease again. Review any medical documents you've saved and look over your test results to see if you've ever tested positive for trichomoniasis.

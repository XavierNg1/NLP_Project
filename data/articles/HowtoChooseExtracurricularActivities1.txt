 Before you start considering specific activities, take a step back. Think about what excites you. Find your passion or passions. Use those to decide on activities that will keep you interested for a long time.Ask yourself:How do I spend my free time? Reading? Writing? Playing sports or musical instruments? Dreaming about visiting France?
What section of the bookstore or library do I always end up in? Sports? Science? Travel?
What makes me feel satisfied and accomplished? Helping others? Organizing events? Being an important part of a team?;
, Now that you have a better idea of what you like to do in general, pinpoint those that you excel at. Ask yourself what skills they showcase. Then find activities that require the same ones. Guarantee that you will enjoy yourself by choosing an activity that lets you shine. These may include:Mental skills (such as continued learning and applied knowledge), which are used in things like math, science, and chess.
Physical fitness and motor skills (like balance, coordination, and stamina). These are needed for activities like sports and dance.
Social skills (such as communication, leadership, and teamwork). These can be found in team sports as well as other group projects, like the school paper or yearbook.
 In addition to your strengths, identify what you would like to improve about yourself. Use activities as a way to round yourself out. Seek out new challenges, without the added stress of having to earn good grades at them.You can use activities to develop general skills that you may lack. For example, if you feel like your social skills could use improvement, look for activities that involve team projects and strong communication, like theater or team sports.
You can also apply your current skillset toward building new talents. For instance, if you have a history of playing aggressive sports that have taught you to be assertive, consider other activities that demand the same self-confidence, like the debate club.

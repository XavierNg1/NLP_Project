 You probably don't need to do a drastic pruning unless you have a Southern Indian azalea that has gotten quite large. If your bush has started to obscure windows and take up room you'd like to use for other plantings, you can trim it back drastically without causing long-term harm. Decide how much you want to trim back your azalea, and have a shape in mind when you start making cuts.
 You can safely cut it back this much without worrying that the shrub will die. Use loppers or a hand saw if necessary to cut back the individual branches. Aim for a rounded shape on top.
 Use slow release fertilizer labeled 12-6-6 to keep the plant healthy while it restores itself. Keep it watered until the following spring. You won't have to wait an extra season to see more flowers; your drastically pruned azalea should produce plenty of leaves and flowers in the spring.

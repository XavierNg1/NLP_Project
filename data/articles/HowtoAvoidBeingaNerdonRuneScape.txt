 Don't give away contact information, as this is against the rules, don't call people by their real names, don't ask to be called by your name, and certainly don't lie about yourself. You will not get respect if you lie.;
, Do not ask for a boyfriend/girlfriend, as this is against the rules, do not get engaged/married, do not pretend to have a car, and don't compare RuneScape to real life. RuneScape is only a game. Believe any more than that, and you will be called a nerd for it.
 Do not beg for money or items, do not follow other players around and annoy them, and do not over-complicate anything about RuneScape.
 Do not play it to raise your levels. Do not play it for the quest rewards. Do not play it for virtual cash. Play it because it is fun, and remember that you have a life outside RuneScape.
 Do not speak in l33t. Do not trash talk other players.
 Don't let the words of others get you down. Remember that you are playing a game, and playing it well.

 In order to be considered for a position as reserve police officer in the state of Arizona, you must meet the same minimum qualifications required of a full-time police officer candidate. Arizona POST rules do not differentiate between the two.


Be a citizen of the United States.
Be at least 21 years old.
Possess a valid Arizona driver's license by the starting date.
Have a high school diploma or GED.
Never used or sold illegal drugs.
No felony convictions., Apply as a reserve officer to the agency you want to work for full-time. Many Arizona police agencies rely on reserve officers to enhance police presence in the community without going over their budgets. It can be a great way to get your foot in the door, as many Arizona law enforcement agencies hire from their reserve officer pool first when they are needing to fill full-time officer positions., Many reserve police officers already have established careers such as that of a doctor, pilot, or lawyer, and serve as as a way to give back to the community. This can be a fulfilling and valuable service you provide to the public while maintaining your higher-paid job., If you are still in college, at least 21 years old, and working toward a degree, you may want to consider applying to become a reserve police officer. Joining an agency as a reserve officer will provide you with years of experience, and may help give you an advantage over the competition when you have graduated and are looking to transition to a full-time position as a police officer.

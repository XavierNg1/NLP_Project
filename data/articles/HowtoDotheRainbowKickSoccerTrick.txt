  One foot is going to be in the front.  Some people prefer their dominant foot in front while others prefer their non-dominant foot.  The best thing to do is experiment with both and see which one works better for you.;
,  Most people find this way easier at first and like to try it moving when they get better.  Put one foot (whichever one you prefer) in front of the ball so that the ball is at your heel.
  It is often best on your back foot to use the inside, but closer to your heel than your toe.  

,  With your back leg you should try to roll the ball up your front leg. 

,  Your lean is important here.  It should create the forward momentum needed to bring the ball over your head.  If you are not leaning forward the ball will go up or behind you. 

,  Some people do find it easier this way, especially after they get it once.  Make sure you get your feet set before you start doing the move.  You need the ball securely between your feet.

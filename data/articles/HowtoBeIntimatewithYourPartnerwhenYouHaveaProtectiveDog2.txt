 Another tactic is to try to get your dog used to your partner being around and close to you. To do this, start with some basic physical touching in front of your dog, such as hugging and holding hands. As you do this, give your dog a treat. Continue hugging and holding hands, moving closer together, while you give your dog another treat.Giving your dog treats while you are physical with your partner will show them that this interaction is a good thing and not a cause for concern. It will also let your dog know that you approve of the touching and are not in any danger.
 If your dog becomes anxious or upset when you are touching your partner, have their favorite toy close by. Have a short play session with your dog using the toy and involve your partner. This will let your dog know that your partner is friendly and fun to be around, rather than a threat.You should both play with your dog for a few minutes, throwing the toy around. Then, throw the toy in a separate room and give your dog a treat. Your dog may be tired out and willing to leave you two alone after the play session is over.
 Once your dog seems comfortable with you hugging your partner and holding hands, you should try kissing in front of your dog. Kiss your partner and then throw your dog a treat if they stay calm and quiet. You can also give your dog a Kong toy stuffed with treats so they are occupied with the Kong while you and your partner kiss or get intimate.Over time, your dog may be so involved in their treat that they do not pay attention to what you and your partner are doing. You may also both be able to go into a separate room together, leaving your dog to enjoy their treat alone.

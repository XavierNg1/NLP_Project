 Being too excited can lead to poor card choice and swift defeat. Try not to get upset or flustered if you don’t win a round. Just shift your focus to the next round and don’t make any hasty choices.
 As you read the answers aloud, try to see who reacts when that answer is read. Although some players may just be appreciating a clever card choice, you may be able to detect whose card is whose. If that person is your main competition in the game, no matter how much you like the card, don’t choose it., Although some cards like mud or string or crayons could be somewhat valuable depending on who you play with, they will not be effective very often. Play these cards when you can’t make a funny combination with any of your cards., You might have a few cards in your hand that you know will be really funny when combined with the right green card. Try to hang onto a couple of these cards until the right combination comes along.
 Sometimes the judge will be torn between a couple of cards and you may need to convince the judge to choose your card. But it is important to be subtle so that the judge does not know that it is your card. Simply laughing out loud as the card is read may do the trick, or you might say something like, “That’s hilarious!”, to convince the judge.Sometimes keeping quiet is the best strategy, especially if you are doing well and don’t want anyone to know that that card is yours.
 If you are doing well, try not to let on that you are close to winning. Otherwise, your opponents may try to stop you from winning by playing their best cards or by not selecting a card that you played. Wait until the game is over to say how many cards you have and reveal that you are the winner.

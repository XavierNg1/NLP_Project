 Sometimes reading about important figures or influential people can make the subject appear unrelatable to the reader. Use your conclusion to briefly mention personal details, stories, or accounts that you mentioned throughout the biography. Bringing these personal details into the conclusion can make the subject more accessible to the reader.Discuss how they loved visiting their grandmother, or mention that their favorite place was a quiet cabin in the mountains.
 While reading a biography, the reader may forget that each person has had their own difficulties and personal struggles to overcome. If a subject has been greatly influenced by a personal tragedy or was fired from several jobs during their lifetime, consider mentioning that in the conclusion.


The late Nelson Mandela led an influential, prominent, and successful life as a South African activist and former president. Although he earned many awards and honors, he admitted that he was not a very good student when he was trying to earn a law degree.A reader may be able to better understand that Nelson Mandela had to work hard during his life.
 If the subjectâ€™s hobbies, passions, or interests played an important role in their life, incorporate that into the conclusion. Perhaps reading particular books inspired them to write their own popular novel, or maybe their love for animals inspired them to work to protect endangered animals.Weave their personal interests into the conclusion by acknowledging how those interests influenced their work or life decisions.

 Perhaps the best way to get your kids to be physically active is to have them sign up for sports at school. These sports will not only keep your kids active, but engaged and social. Allow your child to choose a sport or team to join. Consider:


Team sports. Traditional team sports like softball, football, and volleyball will keep your kids busy and active.
Individual sports. Activities like swimming, tennis, or track and field will keep your kids physically active.
Alternative activities. Even activities like debate club, Model United Nations, or chess club will get your kids to be more physically active than going home and playing video games., While some kids might be perfectly happy playing softball, soccer, or even swimming for their school, others may be more interested in non-school affiliated activities. Consider:


Traditional sports activities like Little League baseball.
Activities like dance, ballet, and more.
 There are a wide variety of non-school related and non-sport organizations that will occupy your kids and keep them active both physically and socially. Consider:


Outdoors-oriented groups like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts. Through organizations like these your kids will engage in activities like hiking, camping, and canoeing.
Religious youth groups. Religious youth groups, whether organized through your church or synagogue, will keep your kids busy with a wide variety of activities â€“ many of them physical in nature.

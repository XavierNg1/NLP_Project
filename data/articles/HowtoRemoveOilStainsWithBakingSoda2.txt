 The cardboard should be right behind the stain. It will prevent the stain from transferring to the back of the garment.
 Do not press hard or rub the stain, or you will risk setting it further into the fabric.
 You want the stain to be completely covered.
 This will give the baking soda enough time to work into the stain and absorb it.
 Use hot water, if you can. If the garment cannot be washed in hot water, try using warm or lukewarm water instead.
 Let it sit there for about 15 minutes. Once the time is up, swish the garment around to dislodge any baking soda, then pull it out.
 If the garment is machine washable, simply wash it with the rest of your laundry. If the garment is not machine washable, then hand wash it in a sink of fresh water and laundry detergent.

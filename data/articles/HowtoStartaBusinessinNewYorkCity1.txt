 New York City Small Business Services (NYCSBS) offers assistance with starting and running a business from step one. One of the first decisions a business owner must make is choosing a legal business form. The advantages and disadvantages of LLCs, C-Corps, or S-Corps are often difficult to differentiate for a new businessperson. Luckily, NYCSBS will arrange for a free consultation with an attorney to help you decide which business form is right for you.All you have to do to get the process started is contact an NYCSBS account manager. Simply fill out the form at http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/nycbiz/html/contact/manager.shtml to begin the process.;
, The NYSBS also offers numerous courses for new and established entrepreneurs for free. The course offerings run the gamut from finance and management to marketing and operations, and taking the courses at a college or even online would quickly turn expensive.You can browse the course offerings at http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/nycbiz/html/summary/courses.shtml.
 Through their library and course offerings, the NYCSBS will even offer assistance in developing a business plan and a startup strategy for businesses that haven’t already done so., One of the biggest hurdles many startups face is getting adequate financing to help grow their businesses. For New York City business owners, overcoming this obstacle is easier than ever, because the account managers at the NYCSBS will not only help select the right loans for your business, they will also walk you through the application process to ensure the best chance for approval.If you are a building or construction contractor, the NYCSBS offers contract loans specifically aimed at helping small firms compete with large firms when bidding on city contracts.
 Although government tax credits, grants, and other incentives can save money in theory, it isn’t always easy to find incentives that apply to you and your business. Fortunately, the NYCSBS will sit down with business owners to identify governmental incentives that apply to you.One great tool is the NYC Business Express incentive estimator. It helps determine which incentives you might be eligible for and how much you can expect to save through the incentive program. You can find it at http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/businessexpress/menuitem.4868771a83a6e10d0e44f4f335d2f9a0/.
If you prefer sitting down for a face-to-face consultation, simply fill out the form at http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/nycbiz/html/contact/manager.shtml.

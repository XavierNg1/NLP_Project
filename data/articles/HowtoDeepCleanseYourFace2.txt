 Castor oil and olive oil can deep cleanse the pores, moisturize them, and prevent breakouts before they occur.


Castor and olive oil should be mixed in a 1:4 ratio. This means, for every one part castor oil there are 4 parts olive oil. For example, if you use 1 teaspoon of castor oil use 4 teaspoons of olive oil. If you use 2 teaspoons of castor oil, use 8 teaspoons of olive oil, and so on.Mix the oils together thoroughly in a bowl., Massage the oils gently into your face. Use gentle, circular motions. It's a good idea to wash your hands first. Make sure your entire face is saturated in oil., In order for the treatment to work, you need to soak your face with hot water three separate times.


Soak a washcloth in hot water. As the washcloth is going directly on your face, the water should be hot to the touch but not boiling. You do not want to burn yourself.Place the wash cloth on your face and leave it in place until it is cool.Repeat this process two more times., Using a clean towel or a disposable paper towel, gently wipe all remaining oil and water from your face. Your skin should be left with a healthy glow and blemishes and scars should be fainter.

 Pry off the lid with a flathead screwdriver.


Turn the paint can upside down for about 20 minutes before opening if it has sat undisturbed for several month. After 20 minutes, right the can and pry off the lid.
 Stir the paint with a paint stirrer or dowel for 5 minutes. For best results, take the can to a home improvement store so they can shake the paint can for you.
, Roll the paint roller against the tray's ridges to remove excess paint. As with the primer, your roller shouldn't drip with paint.
 Roll paint diagonally over the area, covering prepped and primed wall sections.
 Roll out from the center of the touch up area with a fresh, dry paint roller. Lift away from the wall as you reach the edge of the touch up painted section. Feather lightly around the edges of your roller. Work with a flat-edge paint brush to blend the paint with the surrounding wall.
 Allow the initial paint coat to dry before applying a second coat. Use the same methods that you used with the first coat of paint.

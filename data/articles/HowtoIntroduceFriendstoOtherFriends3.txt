 Before you introduce your friends, let them know that you have a friend that they should meet. Try not to spring it on them or trick them into meeting each other. This will more than likely make the situation more awkward. Foreshadow the introduction a little and tell each friend that you have another friend that they should meet.Say something like “Bob, you have to meet my friend Barnaby. I think he likes Wings as much as you do” or “Barnaby, I’m going to introduce you to my friend Bob. You two are the only people I know who watch Wings every day.”

, If you introduce two friends, avoid gossiping with them about the other person. If your goal is to create a budding friendship, talking behind each other’s backs will quickly put an end to that. Instead of having two friends who are pals, you may find that you have no friends., If your friends do not hit it off, you need to move on. You cannot take it personally. It is not your fault that a friendship did not blossom. Sometimes, people, who in theory should get along, simply do not like each other.Do not push it if they do not become friends. No one likes being bullied or forced into a relationship.
 On the flipside, you may find that your friends become closer to each other than with you. This can be painful because you may feel like you are left out or that they betrayed your initial kindness of introducing them. If this happens, try not to take it personally. It has more to do with them and their budding friendship than it does with you. In addition, they may come back around and start hanging out with you again once their friendship cools a little.Avoid being territorial or mean to your friends. This will only ensure that they exclude you.

 Lenders see bank accounts as a sign of financial stability.One of the easiest ways to start establishing credit is to open a checking and/or savings account. Visit a bank branch or go online to get an application.


If you go to a bank branch, a banker will be happy to help you through the process of opening an account.
Many banks' websites allow you to open an account online. They include detailed instructions and information about account options.
 To open a bank account, you'll need to provide the bank with some information about you, as well as anyone else who will be using the account. You will need the following information:


Social Security number
Driver's license or state ID card (number, issuing state, and expiration date)
Employment information (current and previous, if you've worked less than one year at your current job)
Contact information including street address, phone number, and email
If you are opening a joint account with another person, you'll need all this information for them as well.
 If you filled out a paper application, sign it and bring it to the bank branch you got it from. If you filled out an application online, hit "submit."


The bank will probably contact you to verify your identity if you apply online.
 Put some money in your new accounts to start building stability.


If you don't have another bank account, bring cash or a paycheck to your local bank branch.
If you have another account, you can write yourself a check to deposit. You can also make a transfer online using your debit card.

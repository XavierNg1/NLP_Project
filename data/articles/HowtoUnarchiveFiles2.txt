 Under “Latest English WinRAR and RAR beta versions,” select the version for your system type.


To know which type you have (whether 32 bit or 64 bit), click on the Windows orb at the lower left of your desktop taskbar. Hover your mouse over My Computer, then right-click on it.
Click “Properties,” and under the System header, look at System Type and see if it’s 32- or 64-bit.
 Once the installer has downloaded, install it by double-clicking on the EXE (.exe) file in your default Downloads folder.


The installation wizard will guide you through the easy install process. Just keep hitting “Next” if you want default settings.
 WinRAR should launch and display the contents of the archive.
 To extract the files, select all by clicking and dragging the selection box. Then drag-and-drop to a place you want to move the extracted files.

 Take outside. You can let it run around your yard or take it to the park. Look for big patches of clover, which hamsters enjoy eating.


Take care to only go where you know it is safe; no dogs or rowdy people, running kids, etc.
Don't let your hamster eat grass or any plants that you aren't sure about. If the plant is not safe for hamsters or has pest control chemicals it, it may harm your hamster. If you don't know, don't let the hamster eat it.;

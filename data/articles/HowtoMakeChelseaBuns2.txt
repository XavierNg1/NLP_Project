 All you need is water, icing sugar, and an egg white also known as powdered sugar. You can blend these up into a wonderfully light, but delicious, icing in no time. Simply beat the following together with a wooden spoon until completely blended:

2 cups icing sugar
1 egg white (or powdered egg white equivalent)
1/2 teaspoon water., This icing has a slightly more intense flavor, taking on notes of toffee if cooked for long enough. To make it, simply warm 2 tablespoons of milk on low heat, mixing in 2 tablespoons of sugar until dissolved. Spread over warm buns immediately with a kitchen brush or the back of a spoon.If you have demerara sugar, which is extra large and crunchy, sprinkle it over this glaze for a little punch of crunch and sweetness., This is more and more common in English bakeries and takes no more than a bit of zest. You can choose either icing recipe listed above this step, simply grating in 1/2 teaspoon of orange or lemon zest to get a light, but decadent, citrus flavor., If applied early enough, the sugar will likely start to melt slightly, as it is so fine it doesn't need much heat to dissolve. This can lead to a light, simple, and instant glaze without dirtying any other dishes., This sugary, fruity glaze goes incredibly with the bun and dried fruit, especially if added while the buns are still hot. While any jam will work, the slightly tart bite of apricot jam is particularly heavenly.

If the jam is hard to spread, even over the hot buns, add a splash of water and microwave for 10-15 seconds, until smooth and spreadable.

 Even if you’ve downloaded the Dragonborn DLC, if you haven’t reached the “Horn of Jurgen Windcaller” quest, you cannot access the DLC.


The “Horn of Jurgen Windcaller” quest is part of the main story, so continue with the main storyline quests until you reach this on.
 Windhelm is a city northeast of Skyrim. If you’ve reached the “Horn of Jurgen Windcaller” quest, you’ll eventually be assaulted by a group of cultists as you head to this city.
 Using whatever weapons and skills you have, kill your attackers.
 Once you’ve killed your attackers, search their bodies and take the “Cultists’ orders” item.


You have now accessed and started the Dragonborn DLC.

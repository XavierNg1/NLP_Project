 Once you have installed AirStream, visit this website on a PC.


Choose the operating system from which you would like to stream content (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). After you select the OS, you will be taken to another page with instructions on how to download and install the AirStream app on the PC.
Note: If you have already downloaded and installed this program on the computer, please follow the instructions on the page for updating the application already on the PC.
 After the installation has finished on the PC, the app will ask the user to log in with the Username and Password used to register on the mobile app. Once this is complete the window will minimize to the system tray (Windows).


Note: This program must be running on the PC in order for streaming to continue to all connected devices.
 Going back to the Android device, make sure that you have signed into the app, although this will usually happen automatically after the you have registered for the app.


If you see a screen with the option “Retry” at the bottom, go ahead and hit that. The app should connect to any PC on the current network that is running the application.
 After the connection is finished, you should see a window on the left side of the Android device’s screen. This will have 7 different options to choose from.


Clicking on “Server” will take you to a file explorer to select the folder that your music is located in.
 Once you have located a song to add, simply press and hold on the music file, there will be a pop-up menu. From the pop-up menu, you will be able to either copy the music file to the Android device, or create a playlist and add the file to it. A single tap on a music file will play the song.


Creating a playlist is the method used for streaming the music in this application. This method also works with folders that contain music; however, this only works on a single level (for example: Music\Justin\Time.mp3 will not work, but Justin\Time.mp3 will work).

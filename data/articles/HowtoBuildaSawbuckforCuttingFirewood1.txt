 Design the permanent sawbuck to be 6 vertical 2x4's (38 mm x 89 mm) or 2x6s (38 mm x 140mm) of about 4 feet (1.22 meters) long and 4 horizontal 2x6's 5 feet (1.52 meters) long using 3.5 inch (8.89 cm) wood screws or nails. (See "Tips" for information on making a demo/prototype version instead.)









Cutting the top "V" form portion at an angle and with a shorter top would make it lighter and more open. Adding a trough or floor, as a retainer like feature, into the top "V" allows for a lower chance of shorter pieces of firewood unexpectedly falling from the inner part of the sawbuck to the ground.
, Tailor the design as you desire or require.
 Nominal 2X6s or 2X4s of pine (southern yellow or lodgepole or white), or spruce will be fine.









Decide if it is the taller or shorter height that you think you may want, namely, and cut the "X" pieces about 48 inches (1.22 meters) long.
Adjust the height according to what feels right to you.










Take it apart and angle-cut and trim the angle of the "V" as shown in the photo above. Angled cutting of the "V" and making the upper "arms" shorter than the "legs" will make it less top-heavy. The arms help to hold poles and limbs to be cut on the sawbuck.










Feature: the upper "V" part being deep allows you to nestle and cut two or more narrow poles or tree limbs (around 3 to 8 feet (91.44 cm x 44 meters) in length) for cutting with a chainsaw to chop your firewood at a faster rate.
 Make the sawbuck about only 20-24" (50.8 cm x 60.9 cm) high to the center. This will allow the user to put a foot on top of the poles or resulting in the split wood being cut when it is that low (as illustrated).










Caution: A lightweight sawbuck might lead to an injury if it falls over while you are cutting. Don't use a smaller sawbuck for chainsaw work.

 The valor form trains by hits, so for every time you land a hit on something in Valor Form you get one point of Valor Form Experience. To allow you to get an uninterrupted string of hits you should use weak enemies. The Shadows in the World That Never Was are a great and almost endless supply of free hits. Plus, they're almost everywhere in the city, so even if you do run out you'll be able to find some more.;
, Equip as many Combo Plus abilities as you can. This will mean you hit far more times before the combo finisher than you normally would.
 Choose a spot that is adjacent to an area with a save point. While in a form, accessing a save point and leaving the world will restore your Drive Gauge to maximum. While training, keep an eye on your Form Gauge, and when it reaches about 1 bar left, head to the nearest save point. This step is true for all forms, so keep it in mind with the other guides as well.
 When you go into combat, beat your chosen weaklings silly. Do not stop hitting the x button until you need to return to the save point. Fighting Shadows is possibly the easiest thing to do, as it will be very hard for them to hit you. Unleash strings of combos, and very soon you'll be at all seven Form Gauges, and will have the ever handy High-Jump ability.

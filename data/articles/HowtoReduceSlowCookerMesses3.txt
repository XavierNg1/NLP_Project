 If the stoneware insert of your cooker has a lot of burnt food or other hard-to-clean residue, fill the stoneware insert with water after dishing out your meal. Set the heat to low and let the water heat for three or four hours (or even more if needed). Wait for it to loosen the residue for an easier clean-up., If heated water alone wasn’t enough to loosen residue, add a few drops of mild dish detergent and/or three or four tablespoons of baking soda. Heat on low as before and try cleaning it again after a few hours., If any spills have caused major caked-on residue in the cooker’s internal casing, place a small bowl or glass inside and fill it with ammonia. Cover the cooker with its lid and let the ammonia sit overnight so its fumes can loosen the caked-on bits. Then scrub the inside again with a moistened cloth.Be careful not to spill any ammonia when filling the bowl or glass.

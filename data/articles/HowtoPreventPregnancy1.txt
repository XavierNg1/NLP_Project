 Latex condoms are worn on the penis during intercourse. They prevent pregnancy by keeping semen from coming into contact with fertile eggs. Condoms are often given out for free at health clinics, and they're available for over-the-counter purchase for about $1.00 a piece at drug stores and grocery stores.


An added benefit of condoms is that they protect both parties from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well as pregnancy.
Condoms are made from thin latex, so they occasionally tear during intercourse. When this happens, the chances of pregnancy go up.Some people have allergies to latex condoms, and choose condoms made of plastic instead.;
, Also made of latex, female condoms are shaped like a ring with a pouch. The pouch fits inside the vagina, while the ring stays outside the body to hold it in place. They collect semen during intercourse so it never has a chance to enter the woman's body. Female condoms cost about $4.00 a piece and are available at drugstores.


Female condoms reduce the risk of STDs by protecting the vagina from directly getting touched.
Female condoms are slightly less effective than regular condoms, and some people say that they are less comfortable to use., These shallow cups made of silicone are inserted inside the vagina and over the cervix to prevent semen from contacting an egg. They are commonly used in combination with spermicidal jelly, which prevents sperm from moving, in order to increase efficacy.


Since every woman's body is a slightly different shape, diaphragms must be fitted to make sure they're the right size. Talk to your gynecologist or health clinic worker about getting fitting for a diaphragm.
Diaphragms are quite effective, but they don't prevent the transmission of STDs.

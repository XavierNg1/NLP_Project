 Gushing about your girlfriend is a great way to show your family and close friends how happy you are. A little bragging can be especially helpful when you introduce your girlfriend to your inner circle or tell them about her for the first time.For example, try saying, “I can’t wait to introduce you to my new girlfriend. She’s smart, down to earth, and I can’t remember being this happy.”;
, Bragging just for the sake of it can seem boring or unnecessarily boastful. Try to sing your girlfriend’s praises by telling an interesting story that naturally relates to a conversation.For instance, if you and your friends are talking about basketball, you could slip in, “You know, Rachael was an all state forward in high school.”
Try recounting the time she came to your rescue when you were stuck in a crazy situation. If you met in a funny or unique way, tell your friends about it., It’s always nice to hear how proud your partner is of you. Bragging about your girlfriend in front of her can help remind her how special she is.When you and your girlfriend are out to dinner with friends or visiting your parents, try mentioning her recent professional accomplishment or how she’s become such a pro at her new hobby.
 Everyone has friends who fill up their social media feeds with mushy, boastful posts about their partner. Try to keep in mind that your significant other isn’t so significant to everyone on your social network.

Posting pictures of you and your girlfriend on a trip is one thing, but daily oversharing on social media can put too much emphasis on how other people perceive your relationship.

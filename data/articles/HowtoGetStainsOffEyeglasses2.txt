 You can try removing stains on your eyeglasses by getting a cleaning solution made for eyeglasses. Look for cleaning solution for eyeglasses at your local drugstore or online. Your optometrist may also be able to recommend a good eyeglass cleaning solution you can try to remove the stains.Read the label of the cleaning solution to make sure it does not contain bleach, ammonia, vinegar, or any other harsh cleaners. These products can all damage the protective coating on the lenses.
 Once you have purchased cleaning solution, follow the instructions on the package.

Try to get rid of any stains using the cleaning solution.
 After a few seconds of cleaning, rinse the glasses off in warm running water. Make sure you remove as much of the cleaning solution as you can as any remaining solution can cause streaks and stains.Dry the glasses off with a clean, dry cloth. Be careful not to rub the lenses too hard as you do not want to risk scratching them.

 Chances are, you already have a baby-care kit containing necessary supplies such as diapers, snacks, wipes, and toys. To make sure you’re always ready to discreetly and safely dispose of your baby’s diapers, tuck a few sturdy plastic bags into this kit and make sure you renew your supply daily.


Plastic bags with zips are particularly helpful, as they’ll keep waste and moisture contained in the event that you have to travel with the bag for a period of time. You can also find scented bags at many baby supply and general retail stores., While your home diaper disposal routine might not include this step, it’s essential when you’re out of the house. Pop it into one of the bags you’ve brought along and tightly seal it before looking for an appropriate waste basket to put it in.If you’re near a toilet, you can remove and flush any solid waste before doing this in order to minimize bulk and smell.
 While it may seem like all trash is created equal, think again. Another person’s home, a restaurant or office, or out the car window are all unhygienic an inappropriate options. Only get rid of your diaper-containing plastic bag in an outdoor bin or one located in a bathroom. If you’re at a friend’s house, ask where you can dispose of the diaper.If none of these hygienic options are readily available, you’ll have to carry your bag with you until you find one.
 Disposable diapers pollute the environment if you leave them out, so you’ll need to carry your dirty diapers around with you if you’re camping, hiking or on some other outdoor adventure. If you’re too squeamish to handle this dirty job, use a public campground or well-maintained trail which provides regularly serviced dumpsters.

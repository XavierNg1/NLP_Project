 Rapunzel's hair is long and blonde, it is what she is mostly known for. You can dye your hair if you like, but it isn't necessary. Just let your hair grow and take good care of it. Rapunzel's hair is always flawless. It glows when she sings, but putting glitter in your hair can seem fake, so let it shine with health instead!;
, So what you can do is take to sections of your hair in the front and French braid them loosely and put your hair in a big braid at the back of your head. Put flowers in it occasionally.
 Be kind to all people. Rapunzel, like most other Disney princesses, is very gentle and gracious. Due to her living isolated from the world all her life, she is incredibly innocent, almost naive.
 Rapunzel has a strong, beautiful singing voice.


Try joining a choir or taking voice lessons.
 She is always busy! Crafting, cleaning, painting, reading, baking, you name it!

, Try living without them, but don't go too far. You know what they are, after you live in the 21st century!

, Rapunzel wears long, beautiful, flowing dresses. They are quite simple, though, not too frilly. You would never see her in mini-skirts and belly tops. She's a princess!

, Smile! Rapunzel is generally positive. Sure, she can get angry, frustrated, sad, worried etc. but she doesn't go around sulking too much.

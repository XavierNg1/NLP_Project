 The points you are allowed for your age should be calculated and then added to your base points. You will see that the older you are, the lower the points. This is due to the fact that you will typically need fewer calories the older you are. If you are between the ages of 17 and 26, add 4 points. Add 3 points if you are between 27 and 37. Add 2 points if you are between 38 and 47. Add 1 point if you are between 48 and 57 years old, and add 0 points for 58 and older.

, Skitch has one for all operating systems it operates on. For mobile devices however, if your printer can be wirelessly networked, you'll be able to print it from there too.
 You can crop it to a certain area, or you can double-click the entire window from the title bar of the window containing the map or whatever. As long as it can be selected, the map can be printed.
 In Skitch, the standard keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+P will continue to work.
 Click the "two arrows right-pointing icon" from the toolbar in the window that appears and click the "Print" option.

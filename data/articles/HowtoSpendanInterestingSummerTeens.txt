 Summer time is the time to put them in action. Find out what would you like to do and enjoy!;
, Summer is also time to get fit. Why should we be lazy whole day long and do nothing? The early bird catches the worm. Get up early in the morning and start running. It's completely free and relaxing, and + helps you to look much fitter.
 If you've always wanted to enter some language course, this is time to do it. Whether it's French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, it doesn't matter, just learn something new and useful. Besides, if you're ambitious and have time enough, you can also attend some of those free courses online.
 You can still go to pool or lake nearby,swim and have a great time. You can also go hiking with your friends, play volleyball, tennis, basketball etc.
 It's maybe not like Blair Waldorf's, but you can have a good time and fun with your BFFs.
, Summer is the best time to start with salsa classes, and who knows, maybe you'll meet some handsome dancer:)

, During the school year you didn't have much time for it, but now you can plan many interesting activities, and perhaps find out more about your family members. For example, make a cake with your mother, visit your grandparents etc.
 Whatever, preparing your fave meal (you won't depend on others any longer), making jewelry, learning some computer program etc. You may discover some hidden talent!

, It's perfect time to read all those high recommended books you didn't have time, for example The picture of Dorian Gray, Pride and Prejudice, How to kill a Mockingbird etc.
 Provide yourself with some nice clothes-dresses, shorts, shoes, purses etc. Buy a new jewelry or go to hairdresser and change your hairstyle.
 Watch some of those popular summer films.
 Who knows, you may become famous.

 As they go through puberty, they usually will begin to have a stronger body odor. Discuss this with your child in a private atmosphere as soon as you sense the change.


Broaching the subject first will help your child to understand what they are going through. Puberty can include changes in mood, such as depression, and other children can be cruel if your child has a strong odor.
You may need to explain that daily bathing is more important as people grow older because puberty causes body odor. Also, bacteria caused by locker rooms or sports performances requires more attention to showering.
 You can decide whether you want to include an antiperspirant as well. Tell them to use it every morning, usually after they shower, just as you do.
 While this is also a family/personal decision, some daughters may be embarrassed if they have dark hair and their other friends are shaving. Demonstrate how you shave and buy a matching razor, or the razor that they like.
 You will need to demonstrate how to safely handle a razor. You may also need to explain that more facial hair will grow in time.
 Each girl should know what to expect when the time arrives. Have some feminine hygiene products on hand and explain how often they should be changed.
 This may be done in science class or at a separate time. Many schools choose to split the boys and girls apart when they explain puberty and the necessity of keeping up on personal hygiene.

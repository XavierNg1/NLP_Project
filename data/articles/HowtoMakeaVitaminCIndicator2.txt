 You can use your indicator by placing drops of various liquids into the indicator. Indicators turn colorless when exposed to vitamin C. Therefore, you only need a small amount of liquids with a high level of vitamin C to cause the indicator to lose color. You need a larger amount of liquids with a low level of vitamin C to change the indicator's color.If you want to test various liquids, put a bit of the indicator in a few different test tubes. You will be adding drops of different liquids to each test tube. You do not need a lot of indicator to start with, but make sure amount are consistent from test tube to test tube. For example, if you put 5 drops of indicator in the first test tube, you should put 5 drops in all other test tubes.
 Assemble a variety of liquids to test. Use your eye dropper to add 10 drops of each liquid to each test tube of indicator. Then, see how much the color has changed in each tube. Make sure to wash your eye dropper each time you measure out a new liquid. You do not want to accidentally mix liquids, as this will cause inaccurate results., Liquids with a high concentration of vitamin C will have changed the indicator to a light, possibly clear shade. For liquids with a low concentration of vitamin C, the indicator will be darker, retaining a lot of it's purple-blue shade.Some test tubes may be very similar in color. If you're struggling to see which is lighter and which is darker, hold the test tube up against a white background like a white wall or a piece of paper.
 If you only have one test tube, there is another way to compare and contrast vitamin C levels. Using one liquid at a time, record how many drops of each liquid it takes to cause the indicator to change color. The lower the number of drops, the higher the concentration of vitamin C in a substance.

 One surefire way to show you're not just talking to her as a friend is to establish she's available. After striking up a conversation, ask her if she's single. If you want to be bold about it, just put the question out there by saying something like, "So, are you single?"If you don't want to ask outright, try something like, "So, you definitely already have a boyfriend or girlfriend, right?";
, If you establish she's single, make it clear you think she's a catch. After she responds with a "Yes," say something like, "Really? How does someone like you stay single?"You can also say something like, "Wow, it's my lucky day!" if she says she's single.
 Compliments, when dished out boldly enough, are bound to come off as flirty. A good way to start a flirtatious compliment is to start with, "Has anyone ever told you..." and then say something nice about how the girl looks.For example, you can say something like, "Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes?" or "Has anyone ever told you that your smile is intoxicating?"

, If you're asking for someone's phone number, this generally makes it clear you're interested. Do not beat around the bush if you want to flirt obviously. After paying her a few compliments, simply say, "Hey, could I get your number?", Once you have her number, you can use text messages to continue your obvious flirtation. Send her text messages with an obvious flirtatious tone throughout the day. For example, text something like, "Hey, I was just thinking about you, so I thought I'd text." You can also add a suggestive emoji, like a winking face, to make it clear that was meant flirtatiously.When she texts you, respond in a flirty fashion. For example, if she sends you a picture of herself at the beach, say something like, "Wow! That's a hot swimsuit on you."
If she texts saying she's considering buying a red dress, say something like, "You would look hot in red..."

 Inappropriate dialect is the most common way of getting suspended, and using inappropriate words will kick you off for one day. Spelling something similar to a bad word can also ban you, for example, taking a letter out of a bad word will still get you banned, unless if you say "dam" as in a beaver's dam.;
, Mating became so popular in Animal Jam, that AJHQ had to edit the game and make someone stand up automatically if they were sleeping and got jumped on. Doing this will suspend you, along with using mating terms, and many people do not like it either.
 Sharing personal information that is small such as your age and state is not big enough for a suspension (but you still should not unless you are really okay with it, but remember to stay safe!), but important info such as your phone number can get you a suspension. Sharing important info like your phone number to your buddies you know in real life can still suspend you (AJHQ doesn't know you know each other in real!), so if they ask for it because they forgot it or want it, then tell then you can't because it would cause a suspension. Suspensions for personal info last for usually 3 days.
 Rule number 4 of the Animal Jam rules is about not cheatingâ€”don't use generators or third parties. Using them can actually break the game and take away the fun for everyone, and this also includes scamming.
 Posting any mean, offensive, obscene, threatening, racist, harassing, and even fake content can actually make WildWorks (part of the Animal Jam creators) can delete your postings, and even block you from using the site and take away your membership! This goes for usernames too!

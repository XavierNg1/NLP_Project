 This application for a birth certificate copy is available on the website of the state Department of Health's Vital Records division.The link for the form is found near the middle of the page under the heading "To apply for a birth certificate by mail and pay by check or money order."
You can also find Form 49607 at county health departments within Indiana.
This form requests information such as: your name now and at birth; city, county, and hospital of birth; date of birth; and name of both parents (including any adoptive parents).
 A single state or federal government-issued photo ID will suffice.


If you do not have a government photo ID, 2 forms of secondary proof of ID will also work. These include a signed Social Security card, a signed federal 1040 tax form, a signed lease form, a signed voter registration card, and others.
A full list of acceptable forms of ID is available as a .pdf file, which links from the FAQ section of the Vital Records website.You can also call Vital Records at 317-233-2700 to inquire about ID requirements.
While not clearly specified, it is probably wise to photocopy both sides of a photo ID card. Also make sure the copy is clear. Better safe than sorry.
 No other forms of payment are accepted by mail. Make checks out to the Indiana State Department of Health.


For this fee, records for up to five years will be searched (the birth year indicated and the two prior and subsequent years, if necessary), and the resulting certificate will be shipped via standard mail.
There are no refunds if the certificate cannot be found.
 Mail your application, proof of ID, and payment to the following address:


Vital Records, Indiana State Department of Health, P.O. Box 7125, Indianapolis, IN 46206-7125
The average processing time for requests is 5-10 days, not including shipping time.

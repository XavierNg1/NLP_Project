Roasts: Allow cooked roasts to stand 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Beef tenderloin or rib eye roasts are tender roasts. They should be sliced 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. Less tender roasts such as tri-tip should be sliced no thicker than 1/4-inch thick.
Rib Roasts: The knife should run along the "face" of the roast toward the rib bone when carving rib roasts. Run the knife along the bone to release the beef.
Tougher Cuts of Beef: (Brisket, tri-tip roasts and flank steaks should be carved diagonally across the grain. Pot roasts are sliced into medium to thin slices.Use a sharp knife to slice beef.
 Cook beef thoroughly. All meat should be thoroughly cooked. In general, tougher cuts of meat such as the mock tender roast, chuck steak, shank crosscut meat, round steak and flank steak should be cooked using a slow cooking method.


Recommend cooking methods include braising, stews or soups. Cook the meat slow and gently for the best flavor and tenderness. Round steak and flank steak are two exceptions. Both cuts of meat can be cooked quickly if they are marinated and broiled. Serve medium rare but not well done.
 Steaks such as top sirloin or fillet mignon can take high heat and quick cooking. Pan fry, broil or barbecue the steaks for best flavor. Again, do not undercook the meat.
 Ground beef should be cooked to a temperature of 160 °F (71 °C). Ground beef may come from any area of the cow and is handled extensively exposing the meat to potential bacteria. Cook to 160 °F (71 °C) to be safe.

Make sure iCloud is turned off, or you won't be able to perform an iTunes back-up.For Android, you should open the Settings app, select "Personal", select "Backup and Reset", select the "back up my data" option, and press "Backup" underneath., Make sure you've saved your files, photos, and contacts before proceeding! Look for the date of the last back-up in iTunes (iPhone)f or the Google Dashboard (Android ).
 Follow your phone's directions to ensure a safe reset. Select your phone under "Devices" in iTunes, click "Restore" in the summary panel, then click "Restore" on the resulting pop-up.For an Android phone, go to the "Backup and Reset" menu in Settings, tap "Factory data reset", press "Reset phone", enter your personal verification, and then select "Erase everything" when the option comes up., Once the factory reset is complete, restore your settings by setting it up like you would a new phone. In iTunes, you can click the "Devices" tab under the "File" option, and select "Restore from backup"; find the backup you just made and select it as the restore point.For Android, you can sign into their Google account to access their backed-up data.

 Then you have two options:


You may subscribe to a site where you can browse through online recipes, put together a menu, and create a shopping list.
Or if you can't find the time to sit down and put a menu together, you may use a ready made menu. These mostly come in the form of a newsletter, to which you must subscribe.
Examples of both can be found in Sources and Citations.
 There is a very extensive Recipes category. Who knows what you'll find there?

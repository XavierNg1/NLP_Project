 Hemorrhoids that won't go away after you've tried at-home treatments can be removed using a variety of treatment methods. Discuss the following options with your doctor and decide which one is right for your situation:


Rubber band ligation. A band is placed around the hemorrhoid to cut off the supply of blood, causing it to eventually fall off.Injection sclerotherapy. A fluid is injected into the hemorrhoidal tissue, causing it to shrink.
Infrared photocoagulation. A probe is used to irradiate the hemorrhoids that don't respond to other treatments.
 This is the surgical removal of the hemorrhoids and surrounding blood vessels that could lead to recurrence. Recovery time after surgery normally takes just a few days.

 Cut the strips 1.2cm (1/2 inch) in width. The length is up to you but be aware that the longer the strip is, the larger the flower size becomes.

Choose colors that match well.
 Roll up the strips from one end, to create a firm spiral., Glue down the bottom strip, then glue the outside strip. Trim off any excess felt., This gives the flower a more dimensional aspect., Glue one or two to the base of the flower to complete it., The flower is now done. Make as many as needed for your craft project.

 The best way to find one is to use a search engine to look for “convert JPEG to GIF.”

,, You can convert an image from your hard drive or from an online URL, though not all converters have both options.
 For some converters, you have to upload the image before you can choose how to convert it.


In cases like this, the online converter should prompt you to browse your files.
 Some converters automatically come up with this option. If that doesn't happen, you will see either the converted image or a link to it. Click on the link, if necessary, and then right-click on the image itself. Choose “Save image as” to save it to your hard drive.

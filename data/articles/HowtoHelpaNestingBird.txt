 Signs that your pet bird wants to start nesting include:


She starts to put feathers, seeds, grass, and other materials in the corner of her cage. She might also put them into her feeding dish.
The cere, or band above the beak, of a female budgie can darken.
Previously happy birds can suddenly become irritable and bite you, or refuse to move and just sit on the bottom of the cage.
The bird droppings will seem sloppier than usual, and will smell when egg laying time gets near.;
, If you do, there are two options. Find a breeding partner for her in your home environment and let them get on with it. Alternatively, if you don't want to keep another bird but you have a friend who has the same birds, lend your bird for breeding and get her back afterwards.
 Remove her nesting material regularly, along with any eggs she's laid. This will cause her to keep building a new nest. If you really don't want to remove the eggs, be patient. She'll sit on them until it becomes clear to her that they're not hatching, anywhere between 18 to 28 days.
 This may be enough to take her mind off wanting to nest.
 A nesting bird might be persuaded to distract herself from the nesting behaviour if she's placed in a different part of the house and given new toys to play with.


Put her cage in a safe location outside sometimes, so that she can enjoy the sunshine and different views.
 Include calcium in her diet if she's laying a lot of eggs.

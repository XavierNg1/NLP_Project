 So if your combination was 17/5/37, you would write it as 17+5+37. Or, If they are smaller numbers or you're in a higher grade, do something like 17x5x37. If somebody saw it in your binder or notebook, they would think you were doing homework!;
,, Choose somewhere good to keep it safe.
 Let's say your combination is 1/44/7: 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 44 o'clock, seven even weaven to heaven. Strange, but it works.
 Just in case you forget it, write it in Sharpie on the inside of your backpack.
 For the name however, don't put locker # (people might snoop around on your phone and read it)! Instead, make up a name, example Mr L. N. (for Mr.Locker Number) or Mrs. Lockheart (LOCKheart).
 For example:


"Lunch with girls on the 6th of the 11th month at 9 o' clock ".
If the numbers are bigger, use this idea: "On the 28 all 30 girls or guys in the (make up or use a club name you and your friends have) will meet for my cousins 16th birthday party."

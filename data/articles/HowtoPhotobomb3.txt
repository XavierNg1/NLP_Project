 Look for the photo you inserted yourself into on social media afterward, especially if you know the photographer or know that it will be posted somewhere publicly online.


You can even ask the people involved in the photo if you can see or share the photo afterwards if it seems like they will be a good sport about it!
Look online at the website or social media accounts of the venue or official photographer for a public event if you appeared in one of their photos.
Share the photo with your friends. Show off your successful photobomb to friends, family, or others on the internet. Half the fun of photobombing is others seeing and reacting to the funny image after the fact, whether they’re friends of yours, the cameraperson, or the photo subjects.
Always get permission from the photographer to share or redistribute a photo online if it is not yours.
 If you weren’t there to photobomb in person, create your own image with photo editing software later.


In Photoshop, use the “lasso” and “mask” tools to cut out your face from another photo, remove the background, and place it in the new photo.You can accomplish the same effects in other photo editing programs or applications for your computer or phone.Try inserting yourself into someone else’s photo of friends or family, or even add a pet or other friend’s face into your own photos. Make sure the lighting or other qualities of the two photos are similar for the most realistic image.
Always make sure you have permission before you alter someone else’s photo.
 Make your funny photobomb image even more unique and shareable by sharing it with a funny caption or adding words, images, or other effects to the image itself.


Try inviting others to create their own caption for the photo and have a contest to see who can come up with the best one!

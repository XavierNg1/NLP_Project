 Take the edges of the aluminum foil and pull up to lift the entire layer of candy from each pan. Set the foil on a hard, flat surface, such a cutting board.
 Use a sharp knife, lightly oiled if necessary, to cut the candy into cubes. You can make the cubes even or cut the gum candy into fun shapes.


Try using a pizza cutter to make the job go faster.
Use a small cookie cutter to make interesting and festive gummy shapes. You may need to oil it first to keep the candy from sticking.
 Pour sugar into a bowl and roll the cubes through it, one at a time, until they are completely coated. Set the coated cubes on a piece of wax paper to cure. Let them sit for 2 days at room temperature. The finished gum drops will be crunchy with sugar on the outside and smooth and gummy on the inside.

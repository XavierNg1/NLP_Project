 You'll need to be living on a property near the sea, with a river or stream flowing into the sea on the tidal river margins.;
, If you have livestock, it's a good idea to try to fence off the area where you're trying to create a spawning ground, to fend off hoof destruction.
 There are a number of choices possible:


Plant exotic grasses. Just be sure they're not liable to run away and create problems.
Plant flax and sedges that overhang into the water to provide shelter.
Plant pukio (tussock sedge) (Carex secta), wiwi (leafless rush), mikimiki (Coprosma propinqua), and harakeke (flax) (Phormium tenax).
 Do regular sweeps to remove any debris that might have accumulated in the spawning ground area. In addition, minimize or cease any agricultural run-off.

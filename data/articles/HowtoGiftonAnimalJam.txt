, There are two ways to do this:


1. Go to Jamaa township or anywhere on the map besides an adventure.
2. In the top left hand corner, there is a envelope icon. Hover over it, it should say, Jam-a-Grams.
 Or, you could go onto your buddy list, click it, press one of your buddies, then press the envelope.
 Hover over it and it should say, Add A Gift. Press it and click an item to gift. Then send it to whomever you'd like.

 Many commercial metal polishes can be too abrasive for some brass items. As a general rule, look for a polish specifically labeled to work for brass. One labeled for use on the particular brass item you intend to polish is an even better choice.


Use a wadding-type polish when possible.Other types of commercial polish can be too rough since they are formulated to clean automotive metals or stainless steel.
Avoid products that contain tarnish inhibitors since they tend to leave a film on the surface of the brass.
Also avoid products containing ammonia since ammonia can dissolve the copper component of brass.
Common brands include Brasso, Bar Keepers Friend, Never Dull, Cameo, Hagerty and Blitz., Squeeze a dollop of the brass polish onto a soft cloth. A little can go a long way, so you do not need to use much.


Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.
It is recommended that you apply the polish to the cloth instead of applying it directly to the surface of the brass. Applying the polish to the brass can make it more difficult to spread the polish evenly, and as a result, one portion of the brass might get a higher concentration of polish than the rest of the surface.
 Wipe the brass down with the polish-coated cloth, applying even pressure in small, circular motions. Cover the entire surface in this manner.


Follow the label instructions on the polish when applying it, even if they differ from those described here. Most polishes work in the same way, but different formulas can have slightly different requirements, and using a polish improperly can result in damage to your brass.
 For some polishes, you may need to wipe the polish off with a damp cloth before buffing gently with a clean, dry cloth.


Some polishes do not need to be rinsed off. Even for these polishes, though, you should still buff the surface with a dry cloth.

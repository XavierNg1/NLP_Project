 In addition to pursuing your own happiness, you can also seek to bring joy to others. Not only will the world benefit from your helping hands, but you will too.People who act selflessly tend to be happier and more satisfied in the long term than people who act primarily for their own gain., Rather than spending your money solely on yourself, consider spending it on others through gifts or charitable donations. People who spend money on gifts tend to be happier than people who purchase objects for themselves.Moreover, your loved ones will feel grateful and touched that you thought of them when you picked out their perfect present.Charitable donations can increase happiness in others by allowing them to access necessary medical care, poverty relief, or education., If you feel miserable at work and at home, consider changing your career to one that more directly creates a positive impact on others. For example, you might work as a firefighter, teacher, social worker, or nonprofit manager. A helpful job will make you happier as well as those whom you are helping., Volunteers are necessary for the success of nonprofits that help to combat hunger, poverty, illness, and oppression. Indeed, volunteers in the United States alone provide over $160 billion worth of economic value to their chosen organizations., Random acts of kindness have the potential to make someone's day. Perhaps more importantly, they can inspire kindness in others.Kindness can quite literally be contagious.Why not increase the world's joy by:


Smiling at a stranger.
Buying a coffee for the person standing behind you in line.
Helping a stranger bag his or her groceries.
Handing out treats to your coworkers.

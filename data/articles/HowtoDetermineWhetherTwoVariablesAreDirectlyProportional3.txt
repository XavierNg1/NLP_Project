 When two variables are in proportion, the line representing them will be straight.This means that the slope of the line is constant, or follows the equation y=kx{\displaystyle y=kx}.
 The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. When two variables are directly proportional, when graphed their line will cross through the origin. The origin is at the point (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)}, so the y-intercept of the line should be 0{\displaystyle 0}. If it isnâ€™t, the variables are not directly proportional.The y-axis is the vertical axis. 


, Compare the coordinates with each other, and determine whether each coordinate changed by the same factor.That is, determine whether the constant (k{\displaystyle k}) is the same for both the x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} values.

For example, if the first point is (1,3){\displaystyle (1,3)}, and the second point is (2,6){\displaystyle (2,6)}, the x-coordinate changed by a factor of 2, since 1(2)=2{\displaystyle 1(2)=2}. The y-coordinate also changed by a factor of 2, since 3(2)=6{\displaystyle 3(2)=6}. Thus, you can confirm that the line represents two variables that are directly proportional.

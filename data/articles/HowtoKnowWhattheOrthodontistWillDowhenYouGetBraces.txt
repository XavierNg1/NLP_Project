 If the orthodontist has not already done so, he or she will cover a tray with "goo" to put in your mouth. This is just to get an idea of your tooth shape. Once they have finished that, they will pour a little water on what looks like, feels like, and tastes like sand. The orthodontist will dip a toothbrush into the mixture and brush your teeth.;
, The orthodontist will pick up something called a spacer that keeps your mouth open and they will adjust it to fit your mouth. Usually your lips go under a little curved part, revealing the teeth. They will give you something to bite on. This keeps your tongue from getting in the way when they are putting the braces on.
 The orthodontist will blow some air onto your teeth to dry them off. If they do not dry the teeth, they cannot apply a solution to put the brackets and glue on. They will suck all the saliva out of your mouth.
 First the orthodontist will take a small brush that they dip in a little solution. They will rub this on each tooth. The orthodontist will set up the brackets and start to apply them. You must stay very still during this part. Try to calm yourself if you are shaky.
 If someone else is with you, they will ask them to look away to avoid the glare. They will attach what looks like sunglasses over your eyes, and the orthodontist will also put on some safety glasses. The orthodontist will take out a little light and shine it on the brackets to dry the glue.
 Once they have dried the glue, they will attach the wire. This is simple and does not hurt. If necessary, they will clip the end of the wire so it does not rub into the back of your mouth and cause problems.
 Once you have chosen them, the orthodontist will take a tool and stretch them over the brackets. This does not hurt, although you might feel a slight pinch. That's it! You are done! If they offer you a mirror to admire yourself, take it!

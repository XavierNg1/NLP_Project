 In a bowl, mix the milk, yeast and sugar, and allow it to leaven. It will be ready when its size has doubled.;
, In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make an empty space in the middle of the flour and start incorporating the rest of the dough's ingredients one by one, mixing them in with your fingers as you add them.


Mix in the eggs, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.
Pour in the milk while, constantly mixing.
Last, add the yeast mixture and the sugar.
 Make sure that all of the ingredients are well mixed. Now, add the butter, cut into small cubes so that it will be easier to integrate into the dough.


Place the dough on a clean surface and knead it until it becomes smooth. Its consistency should be somewhat "sticky."

, Put the dough in a container and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to rise for two hours and make sure that it is far away from any heat sources.
 The last thing that you should do to get the dough ready for cooking is to remove excess gasses. Take the previously risen dough and apply slight pressure with the palm of your hand until it becomes smaller.


Knead and stretch the dough a bit.
Use your elbow to make a pit in the middle of the dough; then, use your hands to finish making the ring shape.
Place the ring on a baking sheet and flatten it out.
Allow it to rise for at least 20 minutes.
Decorate it with pastry cream.
 Pre-heat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Place the ring in the oven and cook it for approximately 30 minutes.
 When it turns golden brown, remove the ring from the oven and dust it with powdered sugar. Wait for it to cool before serving.

 You may want to practice using them before it's time to style your hair. Looking into a mirror, try winding your hair around a curler and securing it with a hair pin. Some types of rollers slip out of short hair, so you'll want to experiment with securing them.;
, Apply a styling product such as mousse, styling spray or curling cream. Particularly if you're not using heat, hair must begin wet in order to set it with rollers. If you're using hot rollers, you may still want to wet your hair and apply mousse or another styling product before drying it.
 Roll sections measuring about 1 inch each, just enough hair to wind around the middle of the curler.


Some hair may be too short to roll. In that case, you can still add a curl to the tip of your hair by wrapping just the end around part of the roller.
Instead of using rollers, you can also twist strands of wet hair with your fingers. Once those twists dry, they can be unwound, resulting in gorgeous spiral curls.
 You can either blow dry your rolled hair or allow it to air dry. Make sure the hair is completely dry before you remove the rollers.


If you are curling your hair with hot rollers, make sure the rollers are completely cold before removing them.
 Remove rollers in whatever order you like, although most find it easiest to remove rollers beginning from the back of the head and moving forward. Hair is ready to style however you like, whether it's left a curly pixie, pinned back or brushed forward.

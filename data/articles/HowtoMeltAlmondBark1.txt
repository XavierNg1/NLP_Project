 It is easier to melt almond bark when it has been cut into smaller pieces. If your almond bark came in small disks, as it sometimes does, you do not need to chop it up., A double boiler is made up of two components--a large pan filled with water and another, smaller pan that sits on top. Double boilers help to ensure that your chocolate does not burn while you are melting it because you are heating it indirectly through the use of both pans., Place the top pan containing the chocolate on top of the larger pan with the water. Turn the heat to medium to high heat.
 The bark will begin to melt almost instantly. Stir it to keep the bark from burning. When all of the chunks are melted, turn the heat off and remove the top pan from the lower one.

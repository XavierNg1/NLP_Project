 It's a good idea to do this exercise on a mat, which will slightly cushion your hands. Doing it on a hard surface may be hard on your hands and wrists.






;
, Face the mat and stretch out your arms and legs a bit to get ready.
 Touch your forefingers together and your thumbs together. This forms your diamond, also known as a pyramid.
 Keep your back straight and tense your abs and chest. Make sure to keep your fingers in the correct diamond position. Repeat.

 Geranium roots will rot if they sit in water for an extended period of time, so adequate drainage is essential.;
, Many varieties can fill a 10-inch (25.4-cm) pot, but some smaller varieties can thrive in a 6- to 8-inch (15- to 20-cm) pot. These flowers do well when the roots don't have the option of spreading too far, but they must still have adequate room to develop.
 If you plan on moving the plant around, avoid heavier clay pots and stick to plastic.
 Dirty pots may contain bacteria or insect eggs that are too small for the naked eye to see. These hidden dangers could prevent your flowers from reaching their full potential.
 Using cuttings from mother plants or purchasing seedlings at a garden store are the easiest methods of starting a potted geranium, but you can also use seed.
 A cheap soil may retain too much moisture, which will lead to root rot once you plant your geraniums. These flowers thrive best in soil that drains well, especially if it contains traces of organic material.

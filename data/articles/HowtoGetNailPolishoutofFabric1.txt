 The part of the fabric that is stained should be against the paper towels. Use this method whether the nail polish is wet or dry.


This method works effectively on cotton, linen, silk, denim, and most other fabrics.
Proceed with caution if the item in question contains acetate or triacetate since the nail polish remover melts fabrics containing these chemicals.;
, Use a cotton ball or paper towel saturated with acetone (available in drugstores in the nail polish remover section) to blot the backside of the fabric. This action transfers the stain to the paper towel.
 Take the clothing item to the sink and rinse out the stained area, then place it face down on a clean set of paper towels. Repeat the blotting action to finish transferring the stain to the paper towels.









Continue rinsing the fabric and applying more acetone until the paper towels no longer turn the color of the nail polish after blotting; this indicates the stain has been removed.
Check the stained area one final time for traces of nail polish. If you see a little color left, dip a cotton ball in acetone and gently remove it.
 Use a stain remover product on the previously stained area, and then launder the item according to the washing instructions on the tag. The stain should be completely gone and the item ready to wear once it is dry.

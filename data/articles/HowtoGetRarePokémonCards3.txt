 Not every player will want the same cards for their deck. Try finding someone who has a card you need (and they don’t want), and see if you can reach a trade agreement. It doesn't have to be card for card. Sometimes trading a few cards for a single rare card is worth the trade.


Game lobbies and shops are great places to meet other players, which can open up your trading opportunities.
Check online to see what rare cards are available, or for resources that can help you design a deck., Challenge your friends to a friendly game and wager one another’s cards! This adds an element of competition to card trading, and can be a good way of amassing additional cards that you can use for further trading.


Make sure you don’t mind parting with the cards you put on the line. You don’t want to wager cards that are important to any of your decks.
Keep things friendly! Such bets can get heated, even among friends, so make sure you are on good terms and agreeable with the person you are challenging.
 The prizes for winning local tournaments includes a large number of cards. This can range from the latest tin, to a box or two of the latest card set. If you’re a particularly good player, this can be a great way of getting the game to “pay for itself.”National tournaments tend to award actual money, rather than cards.
Take care when entering tournaments. The price of a winning deck can be quite steep, and the skill and dedication required are immense!

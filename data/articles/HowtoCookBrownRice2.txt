 Preheat the oven to a temperature of 375 °F (191 °C).
 Measure out 1 1/2 cups of brown rice. Rinse the rice thoroughly in a sieve or strainer until the water runs clear. Place the rice into an 8-inch square glass baking dish.
 Bring 2 1/2 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of salt to a boil in a kettle or covered saucepan. Once the water boils, pour it over the rice, stir once to combine, and cover the dish tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
 Bake the rice on the middle rack of the oven for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the aluminium foil and fluff the rice with a fork. Serve immediately.

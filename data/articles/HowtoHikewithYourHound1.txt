 Before heading out for a hike with your dog, youâ€™ll want to make sure you have everything you need. Place these items in your backpack, or outfit your dog with a pack of its own.You may want to bring:


Bowl for water. You can purchase collapsible bowls from hiking stores that look like caps and can carry water poured from your drinking bottle.
Leash. Whether or not leashes are required in the area you'll be hiking, it is a good idea to have one with you.
Collar with tags. It is important to have a collar and tags for identification purposes in case your dog gets spooked or wanders off.
Snacks. Some healthy dog chews or dog cookies are an important addition to your dog's hiking gear.
Paw protectors. Some dogs may need paw protection, especially if you will be walking on hot, very cold, or rough terrain. Dog booties can be purchased from dog parlors, hiking stores or pet stores. Check to see if your dog likes them before assuming that they will work on a hike.;
, In addition to outfitting your dog, you are going to want a few items for yourself. These things can help if you get lost, aid in an emergency, and make your hike comfortable and safe.Things to pack include:


Map
Compass
Emergency poncho
Small first aid kit
Water bottle
Snack
Wear hiking boots (or comfortable shoes with a good tread)

, It is important to respect the rules of the place where you are hiking. Some places do not allow dogs at all. Other places require a dog to be on a leash. Breaking these rules can lead to citations and/or fines, so be sure you understand the rules before you head out.Perform an internet search for the trail you plan to hike. You may find a website or message board with info about dogs.
Look for a phone number to a local visitor center. Call and ask about dog and/or leash laws on the trail.
Most National Parks do not allow dogs on trails, but most other federal lands are fair game.

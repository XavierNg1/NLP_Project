Beach bags don't have to be expensive. They sell some inexpensive ones at any local store. It is a good idea to get one with lots of space and a zipper.;
,


If the beach you are going to doesn't have tables and chairs, bring a towel to lay on. The second towel is for your own use. You want a clean fresh towel to get yourself dry.



Sunscreen. Even if you are dark- skinned, you still need sunscreen to protect yourself from harmful rays. Plus you don't want to get sunburned. It hurts.
Bring a floppy hat. It protects your face, neck, shoulders, the back of your neck, and some of your back.
Sunglasses. This protects your eyes.
 It's a good idea to pack two sets of clothes: one for going there and one for going back. A good outfit would be a loose top (easy to put on and take off), basketball shorts, and flip flops. (Don't bring an expensive pair. They might get ruined.) Bring underwear and a bra (If you wear one) and your bathing suit. You can wear your bathing suit under your clothes if you don't want to change at the pool/beach.

 The average baby begins to crawl at eight months, which means that some babies begin crawling even earlier at six or seven months. By starting early, you will have more time to thoroughly check your house and create a safe environment for your baby when it begins to crawl., Getting on all fours is a great way to see potentially dangerous objects and situations that you wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Go through your house on all fours and make a note of all potential dangers and hazards. Then, make a list of all the materials you will need to child proof your house and go shopping., Because playpens are movable, they are a very convenient way to supervise your baby when moving through different areas of your house. Playpens are also great for supervising your baby when you are busy cleaning and cooking, or if you need time to relax or catch up on work.Purchase a playpen online or at a department store like Babies R’ Us, Sears, Target, or Wal-Mart.
If using a second-hand playpen, thoroughly check it for loose parts and damage before using it.

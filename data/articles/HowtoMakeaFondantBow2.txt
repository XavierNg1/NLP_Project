 Take a rolling pin and start in the center, rolling out both ends until it's thin like fabric. If you have a textured rolling pin, even better.

Roll out the fondant till it reaches at least 6" (15 cm) long. Judge the width by how many bows you'd like to make. It may be easiest to roll it out to 12" (30 cm) to have two sets of ribbons.
 If you have a pastry ribbon cutter, great! That will add a pattern to the sides. Otherwise a knife will do. Give the ends a straight edge.

Sprinkle with cornstarch if you have it available to keep it from sticking.
 This is pretty easy to do with a pizza cutter. You may want to cut off a bit more on some pieces -- the top levels will be easier to work with if they're a little smaller.
 Make sure your hands are dry and squeeze each piece into a loop.

Press the two ends together. Round out the loop and make sure the ends are even. You may want to let the loops dry for about an hour or so.
 Put 8 loops in a circle for the base of your bow. Add a glob of icing in the center to anchor the next level.

Put 6 loops on top of the 8, in the windows of the loops. If you need to adjust the size, cut off a bit of the ends, but maintaining the V shape.
Add another bit of frosting to the center. The next level should be 3 pieces. Adjust as necessary. Done!

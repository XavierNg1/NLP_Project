 Indian rice is great on its own, but it's even better when it's incorporated into a complimentary dish. One easy example is curry, a spicy stew-like dish that is usually associated with India. Serve it in its own bowl with the rice on the side or spoon it over the rice and let the rice soak up the juices — it's up to you.

 Another great use for Indian rice is as a starchy side to protein-rich dishes (like meat and dairy) or vegetables. Try laying the main dish over a generous bed of rice so you get a little of each in every bite.


A delicious, nutritious Indian favorite you may want to try this with is tandoori chicken.
A good vegetarian option which uses greens and cheese is Saag Paneer.
 This is an especially great choice if you're eating the rice by itself. The nuts and raisins give the rice flavor and texture it wouldn't have otherwise. Making nut-and-raisin rice is easy — just add about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of each when you start cooking the rice in liquid and stir. Continue cooking the rice as normal.Halved cashews and chopped almond slivers are especially good choices, though other nuts like peanuts can also work well.
 Biryani is a South Asian delicacy that can take a long time to prepare, but is always a treat. While there are many different ways to make biryani, almost all of them use the long-grain basmati rice called for in the recipes above along with meat or vegetables. Even ingredients like hard-boiled eggs are sometimes used.

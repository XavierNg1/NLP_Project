 You'll find a little kid shooting at a balloon (holy cow, it has Majora's Mask on it!) and speak to him. If you're normal Link, he'll just speak to you, but if you're Deku Link, you'll have to get a magic meter from the Great Fairy and pop the balloon. He'll talk to you and then line up his friends for a game of hide and seek.;
, He should be easy enough to catch.
 Walk up the stairs in the little empty area.
 Transform into Deku Link and jump into the flower. Land on the roof of the Stock Pot Inn.
, That's all the Bombers!

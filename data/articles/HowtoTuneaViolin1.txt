 For more advanced violinists, try playing "A" on a piano or keyboard, and compare it to the pitch of the plucked string. Most beginning violinists fare better with a tuner, which is a device that determines the frequency of any open string--or, actually, any note--a musician plays. Tuners are extremely helpful and precise, and you can buy them for a reasonable price at most music stores. If you choose to use a tuner, the tuner will indicate exactly how sharp or flat a string is by picking up the sound as you play that string.

, If the note you are plucking on your violin is a just a little higher than the note on your tuner or piano, then you should use the fine tuner method to tune the violin. However, if the string is way out of tune, you should use the peg method to get the string closer to the desired pitch, and then use the fine tuner method to perfect the tuning.

 The best way to avoid slipping in snow is to avoid walking in it in the first place. Thus, if you don't want to slip in the snow in from of your home, then spend the time to remove it. Shoveling snow can be a hard job that takes a lot of energy but it is worth the work if you can avoid falling, or having someone else fall, in front of your home.


Be sure to prepare well for snow shoveling before you do it. Get a good snow shovel that will help you move snow effectively and get a good stretch in before exerting yourself. Stretching before shoveling snow will help you avoid injury from the hard work., Sometimes after shoveling there is still a frozen layer that can be very slippery. This is especially the case if the remaining snow melts a little and then refreezes into a sheet of ice. In order to avoid slipping on this ice, put down a layer of grit after you shovel. This will assure that when you walk in the area you don't slip.


The grit you lay down can vary. Some people use a small gravel or sand, while others use kitty litter to give the walk traction., If you want your walk to be completely free of ice and snow you can put an ice melting product on it. You can either use salt or a manufacturer ice-melting product. These products are made of chemicals that lower the freezing point of water, in essence melting all snow it comes into contact with.


Ice melting products can usually be found at your local home improvement store.
Be sure to look for any warnings on the packaging of an ice melt product you are considering using. There may be warnings about what surfaces they can be applied to and what to avoid getting the product on.
In addition to melting ice, salt can severely damage, or kill, plants and wildlife. Be sure to use it sparingly if you are concerned about the health of plants and animals near your walk. In fact, some cities have outlawed the use of salt in order to protect wildlife.

 Acknowledge the things your partner does every day that make life easier for you and the two of you together. Never get tired of saying "thank you" or "I appreciate you".


Leave a note for your partner that expresses your appreciation. Consider saying something like, "Thank you for all the work you put into our relationship to make it so great, from doing dishes to being the best kisser on planet Earth".
 Holidays like birthdays and Valentine's Day are great opportunities to express love, but why not express your love on a random day when your lover isn't expecting anything? Find cute ways to surprise your lover and show your love.


Create a scavenger hunt: set up notes throughout a space and have your lover find each love note and a clue for finding the next one.
Pick out a romantic movie and buy some snacks, then go home and surprise your lover with a movie night.
 It's easy to talk about day-to-day things like bills or work, but make time to really converse with your partner. Don't fall into the trap of only talking about problems or money or kids.


Ask about what is important to your partner's life. Ask about your partner's feelings. Take interest in your partner's interests and be supportive.

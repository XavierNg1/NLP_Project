Click on "File" at the top toolbar from within your open Pro Tools session.
Select "New Track" from the list of options provided. In earlier versions of Pro Tools, you may be prompted to point to "Track," then select "New.";
, You will have the option to choose from either "mono" or "stereo." The stereo setting will allow you to add or import audio from output sources that require 2 channels, such as turntables or stereo keyboards; whereas the mono setting is ideal for sources using a single output.


Choose the mono setting if you are going to record an interview, announcement, or other types of ambient sounds, and choose stereo if you plan on importing a music or stereo recording into your track.
 After you have chosen to create a new track, you will be presented with a list of options regarding the type of track you want to make.


Choose "Audio Track" to record or import music or other audio to your track. If you plan to work specifically with MIDI files or auxiliary (AUX) tracks within your recording, you can select either of these options instead of "Audio Track."

Click directly on the "Create" button after you have finished selecting your track preferences to add your new master track to your Pro Tools session.

 If you don’t have WD-40, you can use Goo Gone. Apply some Goo Gone to a rag, and rub it over the sticky gum area. Let the chemicals soak in so that it can loosen and eat away at the gum.


This should be the last resort if the other methods don't work, since it involves introducing chemicals that could potentially rub off on your clothes.
 You can continue to use the rag that you applied the Goo Gone to remove the gum. Rub, wipe and scrub the area until the gum comes off. If necessary, apply a little more WD-40 or Goo Gone and continue to rub if it’s not coming off as easily as you’d like.
 Wet a rag and apply dish detergent to it. Then, wipe down the dryer and make sure to wipe off all traces of WD-40 or Goo Gone completely. Allow the dryer to air out before you use it again.
 To make sure that all traces of the WD-40 and the GooGone have been removed, wet some rags, put them in the dryer and run a cycle. Now, the next time that you dry your clothes, you can be fairly certain that no cleaning chemicals will end up on your clothes.

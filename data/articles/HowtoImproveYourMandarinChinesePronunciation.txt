 There are four main tones: ā, á, ǎ, à. (flat, rising, falling/rising, falling).;
, In pinyin, this is written as ā.
 It starts in the middle of the voice and rises. In pinyin, second tone is written like á.
 The tone starts low, and then rises. It is differentiated from a second tone because it starts lower, dips down just a little, and then rises. The closest approximation in English is probably "huh?" when said in disgust. In pinyin, third tone is written ǎ.
 It is the shortest tone. It sounds like an emphatic "No!" Sometimes fourth tone is described as a "scolding" tone because it is terse and quick.
 Particles and the second syllables in some words lack a tone. The exact tone that these syllables take depends on the tone that came in the previous syllable, but the neutral tone is always short, about half the length of a full syllable. If it was a first tone, the neutral tone is a little lower than the first tone. If it is after a second tone, the neutral tone is near the same pitch as the high end of the second tone. If it is after a third tone, it is after a little higher than the end of the third tone. If it is after a fourth tone, the neutral tone is a little lower than the end of the fourth tone. Neutral tone words are not marked with anything in pinyin.
 (Note that the letters are not pronounced as in English and that the pinyin is very different from English spelling!)

,, A (a) O (uo) E (e) I (i) U (wu) Ü (üe) AI (ai) EI (ei) UI (uei) AO (ao) OU (ou) IU (iu) IE (ie) ÜE (üe) ER (er) AN (an) EN (en) UN (un) ANG (ang) ENG (eng) ING (ying) ONG (ong)

, So, if a word has both A and I in it, such as XIA, the accent goes over the A when written. Exception: When U and I are in the same word, the accent goes over U.

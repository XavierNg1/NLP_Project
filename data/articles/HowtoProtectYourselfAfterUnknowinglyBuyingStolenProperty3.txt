 If someone tells you that the goods are stolen, then you cannot purchase them. If you do, then you could be charged with receipt of stolen property, which is a crime.Also refuse to store goods if you know they are stolen. You can’t store a DVD player you know your cousin stole.
 More likely no one will tell you that the goods are stolen. However, either the goods or the sale might be suspicious. In this situation, you need to avoid buying the goods. Willful blindness won’t protect you.


Don’t buy goods out of the back of a van. A reasonable person wouldn’t expect to purchase a television, jewelry, or a gun from the back of a van in an alleyway. If you do, then you could be charged with receipt of stolen property if the property was, in fact, stolen.Be suspicious of goods sold very cheaply. For example, someone might advertise to sell their new car for a very cheap price. You should be suspicious that a new car is being sold so cheaply.
Check if the goods have a name on them. If so, check that the name matches the seller’s name. When the name doesn’t match, then you should suspect the goods were stolen.
 The law requires that you “knowingly” buy stolen goods with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property.If you did not know that they were stolen, then you did not break the law.


However, you probably have to return the goods to the real owner. After returning the goods, you can bring a lawsuit for restitution against whoever sold you the goods.

 The exact method depends on the vehicle and whether the lock is a door, trunk, or ignition lock. You may need special equipment to remove the lock.
 Take off the end cam and inner spring, then insert a key into the lock tumbler to push the pins away from the cylinder walls. You should then be able to push the tumbler out from the back.


The key does not have to be the one that is normally used with the lock.
 Replacement tumbler pins come in sets. Each pin has a different length and may be labeled with a number. Insert the new pins in place of the old pins, making sure the new pins extend no further than the top of the tumbler.


If you're rekeying more than one car lock, be sure to arrange the new pins in the same order in each lock so you can use the same key with all of them.
 Although replacements, the new pins may be too worn to work. The lock should turn smoothly with the key that will be used to lock and unlock it.
 You may want to test the key one more time to make sure it works.

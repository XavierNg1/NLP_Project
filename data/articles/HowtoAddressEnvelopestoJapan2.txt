 Lay the envelope so its flapless side is facing up. Jot the postal code at about the center. Follow that with the recipient’s address, moving from the largest unit of information to the smallest (country, prefecture, city…). Follow this with the recipient’s name.Because horizontal envelopes carry a Western association, they are generally written according to Western convention: left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
If you’re mailing this letter from outside of Japan, make sure you clearly write “Japan” at the top of the address.
 Same as you would for a normal envelope, you’re going to fill in your return address into in the upper left corner of the flapless side. If you’re sending the letter from outside of Japan, clearly indicate your home country in English at the top of your address.It’s a matter of preference, but some people write the address on the flapless side and the return address on the flap side, similar to how one would for a vertical envelope., Turn a horizontal envelope on its side to make it into a vertical one. Treat this side-flap envelope exactly as you would a normal vertical envelope: recipient address goes on the flapless side, the return address on the flap side.

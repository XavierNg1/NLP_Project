 Crossover steps are a simple way to move around. You simply cross one foot over the other, letting your momentum continue moving you backwards.


For this explanation, all of the examples will be to move ‘’’right.’’’ To move left, simply switch the feet in the directions.
 Crossovers can be done moving forward or backwards, but to practice you should start from a standstill.
 Set your skate down on the ice with your legs crossed at the knee.


You should look a little like a young kid who needs to go the bathroom.
 Uncross your legs by bringing your right foot around the back of the left and setting it down on the ice. You should be back to your original standing position.
 Keep crossing over to move laterally across the ice.


Try a few in reverse if you are comfortable, putting your left leg behind your right before bringing the right foot over the left.
 You can push off the wall, make perfect “S” shapes, or speed along with “C” cuts. Gain some momentum and then relax, gliding backwards.
 As you move backwards, cross your left leg over your body then quickly uncross your legs with your right foot. When done correctly, you should shift horizontally while maintaining backwards momentum.


Think of the motion you make if when you start running to your right. Your left leg takes a step to the right and then your right leg quickly follows.

Practice Drill: Do two "C" cuts, one with each leg, and then one crossover. Do two more cuts, then a crossover the other direction.
’’’Practice Drill:’’’ Skate backwards around the edge of the rink, and use crossovers to change direction in the corners. Skate both clockwise and counter-clockwise to practice both directions.

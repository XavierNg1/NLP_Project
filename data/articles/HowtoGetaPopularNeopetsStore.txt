 It only costs 150 NP at first, but once you have enough money, your shop can be upgraded. Each upgrade costs more every time. Your shop can hold up to 1000 items.;
, You can do this by clicking on the amount of money you have with you (on the top left corner by your user name). Click on the item you want to add, and a new window will pop up. Click on the drop-down and click on Put in my shop. You can go to My Shop to see your items.
 This can be done at your shop's directory. You can type in any number from 1 to 99,999 NP. (see tips for more advice on this part.)

, One way to do this is to go to the message boards and click on Shops. The best ones to click on are the ones that say, "I have x amount to spend. Post shops." Lots of shops will be posted. If you have chosen a cute and familiar catchphrase, then your shop will be clicked on. You can also go to Preferences and change your NeoSignature. Change it to the link of your shop! This will get visitors.
 Don't spend your money on food. The pets can't die. They won't go away. This is a good money-saving tip. Don't buy toys, grooming products, backgrounds, clothes, or food for your pet unless you want to put it in your shop for others who don't know this. Strangely, some people like caring for this blob of colored pixels.

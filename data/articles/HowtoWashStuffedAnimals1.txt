 Mix two cups of warm water with one tablespoon of liquid dish soap or Castile soap (if your child often chews on the stuffed animal).Use a spoon to mix these ingredients together until suds start to form.;
, Use an old, soft bristled toothbrush or a clean rag to collect some of the suds from your cleaning solution. Apply the suds directly onto the soiled areas of the stuffed animal, and gently scrub away at the stains. Continue dipping the toothbrush or rag into the cleaning solution and scrubbing at soiled areas of the toy.


Be careful to keep the stuffed animal as dry as possible. Some fabric materials may have an altered look and texture after being exposed to water.
 Since the stuffed animal stayed relatively dry during cleaning, use a paper towel to gently blot the damp areas of the toy.


Alternatively, you can allow the toy to air dry by laying it flat on a towel, or hanging it up with a clipped hanger.
 This step is optional, but useful for any stuffed animal that has seen better days. Place the stuffed animal in a large zipped bag, or a garbage bag. Add approximately 2-4 tablespoons of either baking soda, cornstarch, or baby powder to the bag, depending on the size of the stuffed animal.Seal the bag, and gently shake it with the powdered ingredient and toy inside. After shaking, let the toy sit for 20 minutes in the bag, and then remove the stuffed animal.Gently brush off any remaining powder over a garbage, or outdoors.


The powder will absorb any foul odors coming from the stuffed animal.
You can also use a handheld vacuum to remove any lingering powder.

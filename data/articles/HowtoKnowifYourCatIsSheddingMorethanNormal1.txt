 You've probably found cat hair that's rubbed off onto your clothes or your furniture. These are usually a few hairs here and there which are no cause for concern. But if you notice large clumps of hair throughout your home, your cat may be shedding more than normal.;
, Most cats groom themselves frequently, so you may not notice clumps of fur being shed. But if your cat is grooming itself more because of excessive shedding, you'll probably find your cat vomiting or coughing up hairballs. Keep track of how often your cat coughs up hairballs, since frequent hairballs may be a sign that your cat is shedding more than normal.Pay attention to your cat's diet. Hairballs may also form when you feed your cat a grain-based diet. You might consider switching your cat's diet to a grain-free one to cut back on the hairballs.
Some veterinarians suggest that passing hairballs is completely normal for cats, especially if they only do it every week or two., Cats are highly sensitive to their environment, which can create allergic reactions. If your cat is allergic to something, you may notice them shedding more, especially during the same season every year. For example, if you notice your cat shedding more over a short period of time when a specific plant blooms, your cat may be allergic to the plant. Your cat may be allergic to:Trees
Grass
Weed pollens
Fabrics such as wool or nylon
Rubber and plastic materials
Fleas or dust

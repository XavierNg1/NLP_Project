 This method should be used with round heads of cabbage, the most common being green cabbage, red (or purple) cabbage, and savoy cabbage.









Note that there are some similarities between this method and the standard method used for cutting long cabbages, but there are a few small difference, as well.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to trim off any portion of the stem that extends below the bottom of the cabbage head.









If you are using a wooden or plastic cutting board, stabilize it by placing a dry dish towel underneath.This prevents the board from slipping around as you cut the cabbage. It is not usually necessary if you have a non-slip cutting mat, though.
 Cut the cabbage in half from top to bottom, slicing it straight through the stem or core end.









Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.
Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally slip and cut yourself while working with the cabbage.
 Turn each half so that it sits cut-side down. Cut each half in half again, cutting through the core once more, essentially dividing the head into quarters.









Since the cut-side is flat, it will be easier to hold the cabbage still with that side facing the surface.
Once you cut the cabbage into quarters, though, the quarters will need to be flipped over so that the cut-sides face up, thereby exposing the core.
 With the cut sides facing up, you should be able to see the core at this time. Make an angled cut on either side of the core to remove it from each quarter.









At this point, you should also peel off any tough or wilted outer leaves.
This is also the point in time at which you should rinse the cabbage under cool, running water.
 From this point on, the cabbage can be shredded, cut into smaller wedges, separated into layers, or used in a variety of other ways for a wide range of hot and cold recipes.

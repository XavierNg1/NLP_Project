 Bleach can be used to clean dirt, stains, and algae from your stone patio. Mix equal parts bleach with water in a bucket or watering can. Cover the stone with it. Let it sit for around 10 minutes, then brush the stains with a broom. Rinse it well with clean water. You should probably rinse multiple times.Use thin, plain bleach for this. Don't use bleach that has added detergents and other chemicals. These thicker formulas with added ingredients don't clean as well and may clump on the stone. Just buy basic bleach.
Bleach can kill plants if the solution touches it.
 Baking soda has an abrasive structure that can help remove stains. You can mix baking soda with vinegar, or two parts bleach with three parts baking soda to make a stain-removing paste. Cover the stain with the paste and then use the brush to scrub the stain.Rinse the paste with clean water.

 Invite a few of your friends over and tell them to bring a box of old books. Then sit around and look through each other's books to find books that might appeal to you as you encourage your friends to take some of your books. Just make sure you don't end up with even more books than you started with.
 During this fun type of gift exchange, all the wrapped books (or "gifts") will be placed in the middle of the room. People will take turns selecting gifts and will compete to swap for more desirable gifts. Make it clear that you'll only be swapping old books. A minimum of six people will make this a fun gifting game.
 There are a variety of websites that allow you to trade your old books for new books that you are excited to read. Visit BookMooch, Green Textbooks Recycling, PaperBackSwap, orTitle Trader. For every book you send to someone else, you get a credit towards getting a new book.
 Swap is a web site that allows you to trade your books for other products that may interest you. This is a great way to build up your CD, movie, or video game collection while getting rid of your old books.

 You can use this tactic if you're really committed to this prank and you happen to know somebody who is already pregnant.


Ask her if she'd be willing to "donate" her urine to help you trick your target.
Use a real pregnancy test. You will need to collect a small sample of her urine and have it with you when you pretend to take the test.
 Many pregnancy tests show the results with either a plus (positive) or minus (negative) symbol in red or blue. Draw a positive symbol onto the test using a colored pen or colored pencil.

 The simplest defense against parking violations is not to park in areas that are heavily patrolled.;
, Watch for time limits, red curbs, and hours and days when parking is restricted, even for street sweeping. Also watch for driveways, fire hydrants, handicapped parking, loading zones, and other things that should not be blocked.
 Set a timer, and do not exceed the posted time limit.
 Then, set a timer in your phone or wristwatch, or carefully note the time before you walk away. Remember to allow enough time to leave and reach your vehicle before the time expires., Many cities have them, and paying for parking is generally cheaper than paying a ticket.
 Should you leave it visible in your car or on your dashboard? Should you take it with you and pay before leaving? If there is an attendant, ask questions before you leave.
 Especially if there is a big event or you anticipate heavy traffic, leave early. There may be more legal parking places available, and you will be less tempted to cheat or chance it.
 Depending on your location, there may be legal street parking available if you don't mind a walk.
 Even a legally parked vehicle may attract enforcement attention if it appears to be abandoned or if the tags are expired.
 This may mean making a U-turn or going around a block, but it may also mean avoiding a ticket.
 This is true even for parallel parking.
 Some can help you find parking; others can warn you if there has been heavy enforcement in an area.

 If you want to peel a tomato as well as seed it, this method can work great. To start, you'll need to gather the following:A pot of boiling water
A bowl of ice water
A metal spoon.
A small knife

, After removing the stock, cut a small cross on the bottom of the tomato. This will allow the skin to peel away in response to hot water., From here, transfer the tomato into the boiling water. Make sure the tomato is fully submerged.


If you have a kettle, it may be easier to place the tomato in an empty bowl, boil water with the kettle, and then pour this boiling water over the tomato.
If you're boiling on the stove, take safety precautions. Use the back burners to avoid accidentally knocking your pot onto yourself, causing injury. Make sure you use a pot that fits safely over the burners. Check for any food residue or grease particles before turning your burners on., How long you leave the tomato in the boiling water varies. Usually, however, around 10 seconds should be enough. When you see the skin near the bottom of the tomato has begun to peel, use your spoon to remove the tomato from the boiling water.Do not neglect to use the spoon here. The tomato will be very hot when removed from the boiling water.
 Use the spoon when transferring the tomato, as it will be very hot. Leave the tomato in the cold water until it's cool to the touch., The skin near where you made the cut should already be flaky and peeling off. Use your fingers to gently peel away the skin from the tomato., Place the tomato on a cutting board. Cut it into quarters. Remember to cut the tomato in half from the stem to the bottom. Then, cut the two halves in half, making sure to cut along the white portions of the tomato., Take a knife or teaspoon. Run this along the edge of the tomato and the small portion that contains the seeds. Keep scraping until all the seeds are gone.

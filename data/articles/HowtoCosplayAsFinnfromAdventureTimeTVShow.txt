 You can't be Finn without the hat! You can either sew one yourself (there are patterns on the internet), or you can buy one off the internet (this is way more expensive).;
, It shouldn't have writing on it if possible! Finn always wears this. If it is really cold where you live, you can wear a pull-over yellow sweater over your blue tee, as Finn does this sometimes when in the Ice Kingdom.
 If you go with jean shorts, they should not be too short! All pants should probably be darker blue then your t-shirt.
 This may look slightly dorky, but it's what Finn wears!

, You can either buy just a plain green one, or you can sew yourself a two-toned replica just like Finn wears. Finn never goes anywhere without his trusty backpack!

,, You can always find a wooden sword and paint it gold, or you can find a foam sword at Walmart, Target, or even a craft store.
 Watch the show for more examples.
 Say stuff like mathematical and beatbox!

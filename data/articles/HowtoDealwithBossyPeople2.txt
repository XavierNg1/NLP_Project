 Take a deep breath and refuse to go along with what the person is suggesting. , This is especially important if you are talking to an authority figure, like a boss or a parent. However, do not apologize for your refusal.


Try saying, “In this case, I don’t agree with you” or “No, I don’t think that’s the best way to do it.”
If you say “No” confidently and respectfully, the person is likely to be taken off-guard and accept your respect you for your opinion.
 Some bossy people enjoy confrontation. If this is the case, and they respond poorly to your refusal try to stay calm.


Say “I understand that you feel strongly about it, but in this case, it sounds like they can’t agree.
 After you have expressed your opinion and responded calmly, refuse to start a fight. They may become uncomfortable with silence and acquiesce or leave.
 Sometimes bossy people have thought things through and have good ideas. If you like their opinions, but feel as they command you rudely, you can take another tack. Respond by saying “I think that’s a good idea, but it is disrespectful when you talk down to me.”
Consider saying “I agree that this is the best way to do things, but I don’t appreciate it when you are rude or commanding with me.”
This is another way to stand up for yourself, without letting them dismiss you as emotional or juvenile.
 A person who is always disrespectful or tries to control everything you do may be a destructive force in your life.


Try a more serious statement, such as “I don’t like the way you treat me.”
At work, say “I think we should work separately on this project. I can’t work well when someone is micromanaging me.”

 If a word problem describes an irregular object and asks you to find its volume, you are probably expected to break it up into sections. The word problem may hint at this by describing the object as, for instance, "a cone on top of a cube," or you may have to figure out from a diagram how to divide it into objects with easier shapes to measure.


Look for places where the irregular object is joined together at an unstated angle (not 90ยบ). Can you "cut it apart" at that angle into two objects that have names, such as cylinders or pyramids? These do not have to be the same object.
 To find the volume of a cube, rectangular prism, or pyramid, you'll need to know its length, width, and height. To find the volume of a cylinder or cone, you'll need to know its radius and height. Read the word problem carefully and write down the measurements of each section, carefully labeling them or drawing a diagram of each section with the measurements written on it.


If the word problem tells you the diameter but not the radius, divide the diameter by two to get the radius.
You may need to do some addition or subtraction to find the measurements you need. For instance, say the problem tells you "a building shaped like a cone on top of a cube has a height of 30 units, but the height of the cube section is only 20 units tall." The height of the cone isn't listed, but logically it must be 30 units - 20 units = 10 units.
 Use the more common volume formulas for regular objects to find the volume of each section. Write down the result of each calculation and label it so you don't forget which section you've already calculated.


If you need a refresher on how to calculate volumes, see these instructions for common shapes.
 Once you've calculated the volume of each section separately, add every result together to get the volume of the entire object. Reread the word problem to make sure you didn't forget anything. If everything checks out, congratulations: you have found the answer.

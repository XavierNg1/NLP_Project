 If you have access to a local coffee roasting company, ask them about popular blends. Be open and honest that you want to start drinking coffee but are new to the experience. Explain what you’ve tried and what you like/dislike and ask for advice.If you don’t have access to a coffee roaster, try striking up a conversation about coffee with either a barista at a coffee shop or someone working in a grocery store.
 There are plenty of different ways to brew coffee. One of the best ways for you to create a batch is by using a french press or a pour over. These types of coffee makers do not let the coffee sit on top of a burner for a long period of time, so they preserve the flavors and don't burn the coffee.Buy a small french press for sampling different brews. These coffee makers will create a little over an eight ounce cup of coffee.
 Now that you understand how you like to drink your coffee, prepare multiple cups of different blends of coffee. Allow them to cool before sampling. Have a neutral food like bread around to cleanse your palate between tasting.


Don’t focus on labels or names while tasting. Try to make your tasting as unbiased as possible., Again, try not to develop a dependence for coffee. View coffee as a specialty drink instead of a necessity for starting your day. Continue developing your taste buds and experiment with different ways to prepare coffee.


Find your own path! Coffee appreciation can be a complex road. Stick to your heart and avoid a trend if you disagree.

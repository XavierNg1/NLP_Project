 If you are on a backpacker's budget, take one of the buses that queue up just outside the terminal. 21A will take you straight down Nathan Rd. to almost beside the Star ferries at the harbour quite cheaply. Sitting on the second floor of the bus also give a great introduction to this beautiful city that you'll never forget. Otherwise select a taxi from the rank outside the terminal.;
, Have a drink/snack in the exclusive Peninsula Hotel. Head up the Nathan Road for some retail therapy. Take lunch in one of the many restaurants. Take a taxi up to the Jade and/or Ladies' Market. Return to Central via the Star Ferry. Take a peek at Hong Kong Park, then use the Peak Tram to ascend to The Peak. Have a snack while you admire the views. Feeling energetic? Walk down to Conduit Road via the footpath labelled Harlech Road. Walk east and use the Hillside Escalator to complete your descent. In the evening, sample the nightlife in the restaurant/bar district adjacent to the lower levels of the Hillside Escalator.
 Sample the market. Have lunch on the seafront. Return to Central for some more retail therapy. Spoil yourself by taking High Tea in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel or have a few drinks in the Captains Bar (same hotel). Evening: try another restaurant.
 On your return to Central, take a tram to Times Square for yet more retail therapy. For your final evening, treat yourself to dinner at Felix on the 28th floor of the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon. Admire the view across the harbour from the bar. A good alternative dinner venue would be The Verandah at Repulse Bay, on the south side of the island.

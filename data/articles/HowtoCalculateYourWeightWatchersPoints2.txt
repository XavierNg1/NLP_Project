 The energy requirement of every person is individual and thus the number of points you may consume can differ among different people. Just answer the following questions and add all the points up.


Sex:

a) Female - 2 POINTS

If you're nursing, that's 12 points.


b) Male - 8 POINTS


Age

17-26 - 4 POINTS
27-37 - 3 POINTS
38-47 - 2 POINTS
48-58 - 1 POINT
Over 58 - 0 POINTS



, How much do you weigh in pounds? You'll have to note the first two digits (or first digit if you're under 100 pounds). To convert to pounds from kilograms, simply multiply your weight by 2.2 (for example, a person weighing 70 kg weighs 154 lbs).


90 - 99 lbs - 9 POINTS
100 - 109 lbs - 10 POINTS
110 - 119 lbs - 11 POINTS
120 - 129 lbs - 12 POINTS
130 - 139 lbs - 13 POINTS
140 - 149 lbs - 14 POINTS
150 - 159 lbs - 15 POINTS
160 - 169 lbs - 16 POINTS
170 - 179 lbs - 17 POINTS
180 - 189 lbs - 18 POINTS

And so on and so forth.
 The taller you are, the more points you get.


a) Between 5'1" and 5'10" - 1 POINT
b) 5 feet 10" or taller - 2 POINTS

, The more physically active you are in general, the more calories you expend on a daily basis. Because of this, it needs to be computed into your daily points allowance. What is your activity level?


a) mainly sitting - 0 POINTS
b) mainly standing, sometimes sitting - 2 POINTS
c) mainly walking, sometimes standing - 4 POINTS
d) physically exhausting - 6 POINTS

, This is how many points you are allowed to eat each day. However, keep in mind that you have 35 flex points that can be used throughout the week, too.


What's more, physical activity counts as negative points. If you've worked out that day, you may get a few bonus points under your belt to reduce the points you acquire with meals.
 Now that you know your daily allowance, it's time to know how many points are in the foods you're eating. The original system is pretty straightforward, at least in comparison to its newer counterpart. Here's the formula:


p=(cal/50) + (fat/12) - (fiber/5)
In simpler terms: the number of points = calories / 50 + fat grams / 12 - fiber / 5

However, only fiber up to 4 is used. So if your dish has 10 grams of fiber...you still use 4. Don't ask. But yes, that is a minus sign; fiber makes your food healthier, so it's fewer points.

 Oxalic acid is a heavy-duty cleaning ingredient that will help you remove even the most serious rust spots. Spray the rusty stainless steel with the cleaning solution and wait about 60 seconds (or for however long the oxalic acid product recommends).Oxalic acid is a common ingredient in cleaning solutions like Krud Kutter and Bar Keepers Friend.
 About 60 seconds after applying the cleaning agent, dampen a sponge. Rub the rusty spot in the direction of the stainless steel grain., When the rust has been cleaned, rinse the area with fresh water (or spray with a squirt bottle). Gently dry the stainless steel using a clean towel., When dealing with rust that just wonâ€™t seem to come off, you might be tempted to use really heavy-duty cleaning products. However, avoid this temptation to avoid damaging your stainless steel. Only use the liquid cleaners, not cleaning solutions that contain grit. Additionally, avoid cleaning solutions that combine oxalic acid with chlorides (chlorine, bromine, fluorine, iodine, and so on).

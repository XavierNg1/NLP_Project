 Mix ¼ teaspoon of clear hand dishwashing detergent with 1 cup of warm water. Use a white towel or paper towel to apply the detergent to the stain. Gently blot the stain and let the detergent sit for 3 to 5 minutes. If the stain is gone, apply water to a clean paper towel or towel and blot the stain.After you rinse leave a ½ inch pad of white paper towels on the stain overnight. Place a weight (e.g. glass or ceramic object, paperweight) on top of the paper towels. The pad will soak up any remaining liquid.
 If the detergent does not work, mix ½ cup hydrogen peroxide with 1 teaspoon of undiluted, unscented household ammonia. Use a white paper towel or towel to apply the mixture to the stain. Place a piece of plastic wrap and a weight (e.g. glass or ceramic object, paperweight) on top of the stain and allow the mixture to sit for 2 or 3 hours.The weight should be color safe and not bleed when it gets wet.
Use the hydrogen peroxide, ammonia mixture within 22 hours of making it.
You may have to apply the mixture multiple times until the stain is gone.
 Once the stain is removed, use a white towel or paper towel to apply cold water. Blot the area and do not rub. Once you have finished blotting, leave a ½ inch pad of white paper towels on the area overnight to soak up any remaining liquid.Neutralize the stained area after using the ammonia mixture by applying undiluted, distilled white vinegar to the area. Only do this after the stain is removed.
If you are cleaning carpet, vacuum the area once it is dry to restore the texture of the carpet.

 Most come with a cleansing pad, some kind of wooden stick with a point and an angled side, a nail file, and the strips.


Make sure you read the instructions carefully, since all brands might have slightly different instructions.

, Make sure you do not have any lotion, oil, grease, or dirt on your nails because this will make it harder for the strips to adhere to your nails. Take the cleansing pad and rub it on each nail. If your set did not come with one, use a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol.
 If there isn't one that fits exactly, smaller is better than bigger.
 Do not touch the sticky part that much because the oils from your fingers will make it less sticky.
 If you don't put it on that well, you can remove it quickly and re-place it. Don't do it too many times though. Do not put it onto the cuticle, but put it close to the cuticle.
 Keep smoothing it until the folds and wrinkles go away. If the strip is still wrinkly, use the wood stick. Don't press too hard with the stick, either, or the strip might rip.
 File the strip at the end of the nail, in a downwards motion.
 Make sure to apply it at the edge of the nail to seal the strip in.
 These strips last about a week if you are careful with them.

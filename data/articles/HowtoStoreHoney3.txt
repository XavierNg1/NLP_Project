 Honey can last for years, and natural honey can theoretically last indefinitely.However, honey may start to crystalize after awhile. You do not need to throw away crystalized honey. You can bring the honey back to its liquid state with boiling water.First, bring a pot of water to a boil. Then, set your jar of honey into the pot. Keep the container tightly sealed.
Turn off the heat on your stove. Leave the honey container alone until it's cool. The honey should have returned to its liquid state.
 Many people store honey in the kitchen. This is the most convenient place to store honey, as it'll be on hand when you need to use it. However, keep it away from warmer parts of your kitchen. Excessive heat can harm honey. Do not store honey near an oven, for example., While honey can be frozen and thawed later, it should never be stored in the fridge. This can cause honey to crystalize faster. If your kitchen is too hot to store honey, choose a cooler place in your home rather than placing honey in the fridge.

 Canned, frozen, or processed fruits and vegetables are more likely to contain gluten. In addition, fresh seasonal produce can often be found affordably in most communities and saves you the hassle and expense of searching for gluten-free candied yams or mixed vegetables.
 Unprocessed protein sources are not only healthier options for meat and seafood, but they preclude the expense of finding gluten-free microwavable meat dishes and largely eliminate the need to read ingredient labels, saving you time.


Many frozen, un-breaded, unflavored fish fillets are also gluten-free. Buying frozen fish or shrimp in bulk can help reduce the cost of buying fresh seafood.

 The doctor will start by using medical tools to examine your child’s ear and identify the object in the ear. They may also ask you or your child to describe any other symptoms they are experiencing, such as pain, irritation, liquid coming from the ear, or difficulty hearing.In some cases, if the object is deeply embedded in the ear, the doctor may have to do an X-ray to identify the object and determine how to remove it.
 Depending on the object in your child’s ear, the doctor may try cleaning the ear canal with water or using a machine with suction to pull out the object. They may also insert medical instruments in the ear to remove the object or use magnets if the object is metal.Once the object has been removed, they may check for any injury to the ear canal.
The doctor may also prescribe antibiotic drops to treat any possible infection in the ear.
 If you notice your child’s hearing has been affected or the ear is not healing properly, follow up with the doctor. They may perform more tests on your child’s to determine if there is internal damage or injury to the ear.

 Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, 1 minced garlic clove, and sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste to a large bowl. Stir the ingredients well to ensure that they’re fully blended.If you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, you can add extra cloves of minced garlic.
To give the skewers a spicy kick, mix a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes into the olive oil mixture.;
, After you’ve mixed the olive oil with the seasonings, add 48 baby mozzarella balls to the bowl. Use tongs or a wooden spoon to toss the mozzarella in the oil so it’s well coated.Baby mozzarella is often sold as bocconcini.
If you can’t find the baby mozzarella, you can use a block of regular mozzarella. Just cut it into bite-size pieces.
 Take a toothpick or wooden skewer, and slide one piece of the mozzarella on it. Next, add a leaf of fresh basil and a ripe cherry tomato.You can create as many layers of each ingredient as you’d like. However, using one of each usually makes the appetizer easier to eat.
 After you’ve arranged the mozzarella, basil leaf, and cherry tomato on the skewer, add one final piece of mozzarella to top the skewer. Set the finished skewer on a plate, and repeat the process with all remaining cheese, tomato, and basil.

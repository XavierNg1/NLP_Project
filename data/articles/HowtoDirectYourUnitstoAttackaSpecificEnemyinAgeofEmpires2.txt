 Left-click the building (e.g., Stable, Barracks, or Siege Workshop) to select it.
 The enemy could be any military unit or building (e.g., a town center or castle) that you want to destroy. A flag in your colony’s colors will flash on the enemy, indicating that the command has been issued.
 Select the military building again.On the building’s command panel, which appears on the bottom left corner of the screen for Age of Empires 3 or on the bottom right corner for Age of Empires 2, click the icons that represent the units you want in order to create them.


Immediately after the units are created, they will move to and attack the enemy building or soldier you targeted.
 As long as resources (food, wood, and/or gold, depending on the type of unit) are not a problem, keep creating units until the target is destroyed.

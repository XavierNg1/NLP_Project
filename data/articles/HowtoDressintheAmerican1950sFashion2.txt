 During this time, suits were becoming more narrow - with slim "cigarette leg" pants and a sack coat shape (like a Brooks Brother's suit). Charcoal grey was a popular color for men's suits.Note: a white shirt was usually worn with this grey suit, along with a plain, narrow tie.
 Before the war, all men wore hats. But moving into the '50s, hats became less and less popular. Why? Because men were driving more and hats were bothersome to wear while in the car.
 For men, there were many situational fashions that were worn at certain times by certain types of people.


Khaki and plaid shirts or button-down collared oxford cloth shirts were seen on students. T-shirts were seldom worn alone because they were considered an undershirt. Hawaiian shirts and box shirts were worn in the summer.
 Slim-legged cigarette pants were a popular men's style during this time period. Jeans were typically used for outdoor wear, but many teenagers wore them more regularly. Bermuda shorts were often worn in the summer.
 In the 1950s, most men wore Oxford shoes (often two-toned), saddle shoes, or chukka boots. Saddle shoes are two toned (usually black and white) leather shoes with a flat heel. They are typically a white shoe with a black decorative "saddle" in the middle section. Chukka boots are ankle-high leather boots that typically only have 2-3 pairs of holes for lacing the shoelace.
 Hair was worn short, in a post-military style. Men started to wear their hair longer at the end of the decade, but it was still groomed to stay off the ears.Some men also went for the longer, greased pompadour. Elvis Presley made this hairstyle famous in the 1950s.

 For example, for a 5 player game, you can make the deck out of only 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces.;
, Choose a person to be the dealer. When you're the dealer, shuffle the deck well and give each player (including yourself) 4 cards each.



All players will simultaneously put one of their unwanted cards face down and pass it to the player on their left. Then they will place the face down card from the player on their right in their hand.
Since there are no turns in this game (during the passing stage), there is a 4-card limit on how many cards you can have on your hand at any time. If you have a face down card on your right waiting to be picked up, and you already have four cards, you will need to put down one of your cards first before you can pick up that card.
You can only discard or pick up one card at a time.
 The others must then put the fingers to their noses also. The last player to touch their nose is declared a "Pig" and leaves the game.


Since there is one less player in the game, you must remove a rank from the deck before starting the next round.
 A new round begins.
 The winner is the last person to remain in the game.

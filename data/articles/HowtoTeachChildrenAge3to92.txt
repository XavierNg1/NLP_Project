 When you’re teaching something new to a child, you need to remember that what they know is at a different level than an adult level. You’ll need to simplify ideas and start with what they already know. Teachers often refer to these methods of simplifying and building on prior knowledge as chunking and scaffolding.


Find out what the child already knows about the new concept and go from there. If you’re teaching new words, use words the child already knows to define the new words. If you use a certain word while explaining and you’re not sure if the child knows it, it’s okay to ask, “Do you know what that means?” If not, use another word to clarify., You will probably need to say the same things in different ways multiple times while teaching children, especially if you’re working with more than one child at a time. All children learn at different rates and in different styles, so you should anticipate repeating yourself and practicing some skills over and over again., Graphic organizers, pictures, and charts are all helpful in providing children with multiple ways of learning new information. Graphic organizers are specific tools often used in classes for young children that help them to break up (chunk) information into smaller parts. They can use them to organize information into a variety of ways, like sequencing or cause and effect for stories, or categorizing for learning new science terms.

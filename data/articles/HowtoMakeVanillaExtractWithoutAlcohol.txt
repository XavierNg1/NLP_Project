 This is the one ingredient you may not be able to pick up at the local grocer, but instead may need to hunt for it online or at a health food. If you purchase online, go through a reputable dealer and be sure you are buying, “food-grade.”;
, Vanilla beans from the local grocer will work, but for about the same money, consider getting a little wild and crazy by hunting down the best special Madagascar vanilla beans or specialty beans. Just the difference in freshness will increase your vanilla’s flavor.
 You will keep and mix your vanilla inside the bottle so make sure it has a cork or lid stopper.
 This will be used to slice the vanilla beans to release their essence.
 This includes cleaning out the glass bottle to remove dust or debris by using warm water and mild dish soap. Allow plenty of dry time before adding ingredients.


Make sure your paring knife is sharp and that you have a clean work surface.
 If the bottle opening is narrow, you could use a plastic funnel for a neat pour.



The safest method is to place the bean on a clean, hard surface. Hold the top of the bean with one hand and then slice the bean using your other hand.
 Carefully move the seeds into a spoon so you can easily transfer them to the bottle. These seeds hold a great deal of the flavor associated with real vanilla so save all you can.
 Swish the bottle if the seeds attach to the sides.
 Allow bottle to sit for at least six weeks before using.

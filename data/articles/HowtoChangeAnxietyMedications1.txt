 Doctors often use antidepressants to treat anxiety disorders. However, it can take antidepressants several weeks to have an effect, and many have unpleasant side effects. Therefore, before you decide to switch medications, wait at least two weeks after beginning any medication. Some medications can take up to six to eight weeks to have any real effects. Keep this in mind when deciding to switch medications.Unpleasant side effects than can result from antidepressants in the first couple weeks of taking the medication are dizziness, nausea, sweaty palms, and diarrhea. See if these side effects subside after two weeks of taking the medication. If they do not, and you find that the side effects are intolerable, think about switching medications.Friends and family members might be able to help you judge if a medication is working or not, particularly in the early days and weeks of taking the medication. Especially if you are bothered by early side effects, your friends or family members might see an improvement in your depression before you do.;
, Before switching medications, make sure you are taking the drug as directed. Sometimes medications do not work because the patient isnâ€™t taking the drug consistently. The unpleasant side effects discussed above can cause some patients to take their medications inconsistently.Some medications are meant to be taken every day while others are meant to be taken now and then. Check the instructions on your medication to determine how frequently you should be taking them. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about how to take your medication.
 Some anxiety medications lose their effects after six months of regular use.

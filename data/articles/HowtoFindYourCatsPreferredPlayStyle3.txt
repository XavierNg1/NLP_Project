 Interactive toys, such as wand toys, can be used to help determine your catâ€™s prey drive and play style. For example, you can move the toy along the ground or through the air mimicking different types of prey. Other types of interactive toys include balls and stuffed animals that can be thrown and then chased by your cat., Cats typically hunt small prey, such as mice, insects, bunnies, and small birds. As a result, the toys they play with should reflect the size of their natural prey.For example, a large toy may be too intimidating and could be seen as a predator rather than prey.
 If your cat ever gives you a toy this likely indicates that they like this toy and want to play. For example, a cat may drop a ball in your lap to signal that they want you to throw the ball. Keep track of the toys that your cat gives to you. These likely reflect your cat's preferred style of play.

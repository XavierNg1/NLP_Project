 Select the flowers. String them up upside down over an empty space such as high up in a closet doorway (provided you don't need to close the door). The spot chosen should be in a dry area of the house (definitely not in your bathroom). If it's warm that is helpful but not too humid. Leave the flowers strung up this way for two to three weeks. This will ensure that they are dried in an upright position and that the bloom isn't falling over.


The knots on the stem will also become looser due to water loss so you may want to check them and carefully tighten them every 5-7 days or so.
Take down when dry. Use in dried floral arrangements, potpourri or for craft projects.
 A flower press is a traditional method of pressing flowers, petals and leaves flat, drying them in the process. This method is only good for when you want flat flowers for artwork or scrapbooking. More information on using a flower press or pressing flowers generally (with a book, etc.) can be found here and here.
 Florists can use modern techniques, such as silica gel, hot air drying, freeze drying and using a molecular sieve. The end results will be very professional, which makes this approach a good one for preserving wedding flowers and other flowers with important memories.

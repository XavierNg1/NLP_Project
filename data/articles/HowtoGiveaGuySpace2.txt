 One of the easiest ways to give your guy some space is to create some healthy space for yourself. Don’t spend all of your time obsessing over the relationship and over what you did or didn’t do. Spend time with those who love you, value you, and don’t need a break from you. Visit your mom more often and hang out with your friends. Don’t say ‘no’ if your friends try to make plans with you., You likely were filling a considerable amount of time each week hanging out with your guy, and now that that may not be occurring as regularly, you might feel lonely. Combat this by creating a schedule for yourself to minimize your downtime. The less time you have that is unoccupied, the less time you will have to ruminate, obsess, or reach out before your guy has gotten enough space.
 Your guy needing space is a great time for you to devote yourself to work. Continue to arrive to work on time each day, complete all of your responsibilities on time, and even consider taking on some additional projects or assignments. See if you can be of service to anyone who needs help., During this time, don’t allow yourself to forget self-care. Continue to eat well, exercise, and care for your hygienic needs. Consider pampering yourself to a spa day, or if money is tight, pamper yourself at home.Consider taking care of your environment, too. Clean up and organize your space to declutter your surroundings.
Keeping your space clutter-free can help you feel better and more focused. Also think about rearranging things like furniture. The novelty itself can be a lift., Perhaps when you were speaking with your guy regularly, you didn’t have much time to explore your own interests that you had prior to the relationship. Take some time to reconnect with those now. Read more, join a book club, catch up on your television shows, go out dancing, or learn to cook a few new dishes. Spend time remembering that life away from your partner can be fun and fulfilling, as well.

 Every stage starts with a double top attack.

The attacks below change, depending on the stage. Fortunately, the changes are not random. See the next step.

The first stage after each challenging stage is always (except stage 4) a Double Side attack stage. Otherwise, they will enter as described below.


Galagas and red aliens enter from the bottom left.
Red aliens enter from the bottom right.
Blue aliens enter from the top left.
Blue aliens enter again from the top right.
 The aliens always enter in five waves. Except for "Stage IV", the entrance options go like this, after every "Challenging Stage":


Double Side attack: The aliens will come in from both sides throughout the entrance phase.
Doubled-UP attack: The aliens come in side-by-side. This is the most difficult set to kill. You have to destroy one layer to get to the other.

You can get away with sloppy play in most stages. Always bring yourself to full attention during the Doubled-UP attack stage.



Single-File attack: Twice as long, but one after another. You should be able to hit almost all of the aliens during the entrance.
 This will give you a small semi-"safe" area.


The direction the blue aliens will rotate will be determined by their side.

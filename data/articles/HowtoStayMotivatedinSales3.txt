 If your company does not provide you with daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal incentives, ask for them. Competition inspires you to get back on the phone and try 1 more call at the end of the day.


If your company is unwilling to make incentives, or you are the only person on the sales staff, challenge someone else in the company to a competition. Place a personal bet, such as a dinner or chores, to add motivation to your day.
 Give yourself consequences and rewards. For example, if you make this season's quota, you will book a vacation, but if you do not, you must walk the flight of stairs to your office 6 times per day for 1 month.


Tell people in your office and at home what your goal is. The more people who know and hold you accountable, the more real your goal will be.
 Make your first task during the day to set and write down the challenge. Always have a daily goal to work toward.
 If your sales feel lacking, enroll in a training seminar to learn a new method. These seminars are highly motivating, with excellent tips from top sales consultants.


If you cannot afford a seminar, buy a DVD or a sales improvement book.
 Starting a mentor relationship can expose you to new ways of thinking and selling. You will have a support network and a problem-solver that can help you motivate your sales to a new level.


You can find a sales mentor on blogs, through professional organizations or businesses like PivotPlanet. Offer a situation that will have a mutual benefit, such as time given to their business or charity, or a payment for meetings.
 Keep a commitment to treating yourself to something nice whenever you make the extra effort.

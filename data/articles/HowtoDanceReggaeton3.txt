 There are reggaeton dance classes where you can learn the moves from experienced instructors who'll teach you how to swing your hips, step your feet and exude the sexuality that makes reggaeton such hot fun.
 Instead of focusing on the stars of the film, pay attention to the background dancers when they cut loose after hours dancing in the bungalows where they bunk. The way they grind their hips, touch each other suggestively and dance very, very close is the style you want to copy when you're dancing reggaeton.

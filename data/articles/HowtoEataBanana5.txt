 If you don't have a grill, you can preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C) instead.
 Be sure that you are slicing the banana inside the curve. Do not slice it all the way open, however; you want the two halves to be connected at the bottom, like a hot dog.
 The chocolate and mini marshmallows will make a small pile on top of the banana. You can layer them, like making s'mores, or you can mix them together first.
 If you are using an oven, bake it for 5 to 6 minutes, and then broil it (uncovered) until the marshmallows are golden brown., This is that final touch that will make the banana more s'more like. If you don't have any graham crackers, you can use any cinnamon-honey flavored crackers or cereal.
 The s'more like flavor makes it an ideal camping trip treat!

 Wearing an old band bra (no under-wiring or padding) or a sports bra will help, but they are often not tight enough to really bind them down. You can bind them down with bandages too, but make you don't use ace bandages, as they can harm your lungs and kill you. So pay attention to what you pick up.;
, It needs to be comfortably and boyishly loose, plus a little more to hide boobs if binding them isn't entirely successful. You can also wear a baggy jacket or raincoat to help hide tell-tale body parts.
 Baggy pajama pants or army pants work fairly well if you don't have any male siblings.
 Trainers, vans, black converses, or other gender generic work fabulously.
 Wash off any existing make-up. Using an eyeliner pencil, shade in girly eyebrows carefully, go for longer eyebrows. A little bit goes a long way, and you need to look like you aren't wearing any make-up. If you have a nude, non-shiny lipstick, use it to hide your femininely more rosy and full lips. Again, use carefully. Facial hair is tricky, because unless you have realistic costume beards, it won't really work. Take your eyeliner and lightly pencil in hair on the upper lip, but only so that the existing hairs look darker, like you've forgotten to shave.
 Mess up your locks a bit and maybe put on a boyish hat and you are all set. Otherwise, you can go for the greasy male ponytail, but that won't be very convincing unless you really try. You can tuck long hair up into baseball caps or wear the jacket hood up to hide it. Remember some boys do have shoulder-length hair. Go for the skater look if you do.
 When you are sitting, spread your legs and try to take up as much space as possible try to copy the mouth movements too.

If that doesn't open the console, some users have reported that the Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + C works instead., This will enable special menus when you Shift-click things in the game.
 You will not see the option if you try to edit your active Sim.
 Select "Edit Sim in Create a Sim" from the menu hat appears.


You cannot edit Pregnant Sims, Imaginary Friends, Ghosts, Vampires, or Mummies., This will likely take a few minutes.
 Be aware that doing this will occasionally cause glitches, as the game was not designed to support this. Not all of your changes will take effect when you finish, and your game may crash when exiting CAS.


Editing a Sim in CAS will reset it to the beginning of its age stage. For example, if you have a Young Adult Sim that's a day away from becoming an Adult, editing her in CAS will revert her to the beginning of her Young Adult stage.

, To split a vanilla pod, simply cut down the middle of the pod with the tip of a sharp knife while keeping the pod flat on a clean, non-slip surface.


Some people prefer to scrape out the middle of the vanilla pod before adding but this is where much of the flavor resides, so it's not recommended.
, You'll note the vodka turning a light shade of golden brown within a half hour of adding the pods and this will darken with infusion over time. Shake every few days to help distribute the vanilla and store in a cool, dark place while it's infusing.


You can leave the pods in for as long as you wish to allow the vanilla to infuse through the vodka but it should be ready to use within the first week of infusing.
 If you wish to remove any sediment from the vanilla pods, pour through a fine sieve or coffee filter into a clean bottle.


If you don't want to throw out the pods, then you can leave them in the vodka but after a fair while they may get a bit tacky and start disintegrating (this is in the range of many months later).
 Serve as is, or use as part of a cocktail. For one example of using vanilla infused vodka, see How to make a vanilla martini. Or, try vanilla vodka poured over ice and topped up with ginger ale for a creamy drink.Vanilla vodka is excellent used in dessert dishes as well as in drinks.

 The following are good tips that make holiday shopping more effective and quick:


Buy things throughout the year, whenever you see something that is ideal for someone. You provide more thoughtful gifts if they are catered to the person, rather than bought frantically the month before. Store your gifts in 1 place in your house and come back to your gift hiding place 6 weeks before Chanukah or Christmas.
Take a few hours off work during mid-week once the holiday sales start. You will miss the rush and have a more calm shopping experience.
Shop in small spurts online. Getting online for hours can be a waste of time. Keep a list in your purse of things you are looking for, and add to it. Wait until you have 2 or 3 things you know you want to search for and do your power shopping. Open 3 browser tabs and compare prices on Amazon, Overtock.com and a Google Shopping page.
Don't be afraid to give gift certificates. Many stores, massage parlors, movie theaters and more provide gift certificates. Think of something that your friends or family will find truly valuable over a product you are unsure they will like.
 Wrap gifts as soon as you bring them home. This will remove the chance that children will find their gifts and it will allow you to get both shopping and wrapping done at a slow and steady pace.
 Schedule your time accordingly, so that you can enjoy the holidays and be ready for any last-minute changes.

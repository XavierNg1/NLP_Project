 Move to a kneeling position by your partnerâ€™s feet.


Use long, flowing strokes to massage their legs: ankle to thigh and back again up again.
 Making sure your hands are well oiled, make small pressure circles with your thumbs under their toes, around their arches, and all around their heels and ankles.


If your partner is ticklish on their feet, it might be best to skip this part of the massage.
 Keep your fingers outside of the main muscle, and your thumbs inside.


Maintain a rhythm with each stroke or knead, and keep your movements slow and soft.
 As you stroke down, press the palms of your hands more firmly, then lift off at the toes.
 When they're comfortable lying on their back, put the pillow under their knees - if they have a back problem, add more pillows as needed. Cover them up again with the towels.
 Use your palms to give long, even strokes all the way from the toes to the tops of their legs and back down again - go very lightly over the knees.
 Then rest your partner's ankle in the palm of one hand and massage their ankle with your other hand: thumb on one side; fingers on the other.
 Go softly over the knees, as these joints are sensitive to pressure, but apply firm pressure on their thigh muscles.


Keeping your rhythm, and with plenty of oil on your hands, pick up the upper thigh muscles and squeeze - as you did with the shoulders.
 Give pressure on the down stroke with your fingertips; on the upstroke with your palms. Fold the towel back down to cover their legs and feet.

 At the end of washing up your dishes, throw the entire pizza box into the washing-up water. Scrunch it until it mashes down to the size of a tennis ball in your hands.;
, Any yummy bits in it will be gratefully consumed by worms and other garden beasties.
 Do yourself a favour and save on boxes and money by substituting a purchased pizza with a homemade one every now and then. You can tailor the topping however you wish and your health will be better for it too.
 Fill the pizza box with dirt and put it in the ground. Then plant seeds. Take an old water bottle, fill it with water, and poke holes in the top. Now you've got plants and a new watering can!

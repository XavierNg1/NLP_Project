 A back brace is of little use if worn without using proper body mechanics. You should learn to squat while lifting, mainly using the force of your legs and thighs to lift the object, rather than your back.


Before lifting, assess the object to see if you should ask for help with lifting. Do not try to lift something that is likely too heavy for you.
Bend at the knees and squat, getting as close to the object as possible. Tighten your stomach muscles and hug the object close to your upper body. Lift with the force of your thigh muscles. Do an opposite motion when you lay the object back down.
 Studies have shown that lower back pain was reduced in patients when wearing a lumbar-supporting brace than patients wearing a brace without this support.There are numerous braces out there designed for both daily routines and lifting. Make sure you purchase one that advertises lumbar support.
 The CDC and The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health performed a study that reports that there is not a significant amount of data that supports or disproves the benefits of a back belt.


The study suggests that these belts are becoming more popular in the workplace, but cautions workers that wear them. There is no scientific findings that support that they are actually beneficial to lifting., Back belts may be covered by the company. Despite the CDCâ€™s findings, studies by the UCLA School of Public Health and the Annals of Internal Medicine have reported that people suffering from back pain have alleviated symptoms and need to use less medication when they wear lumbar back braces during physical labor., Wear your back brace at any point that you may find yourself lifting. It may take a week or two to get used to, so it is a good idea to wear it more often than not at work. You may not notice that it is on after a while and get extra support out of it.

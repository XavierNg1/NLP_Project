 If anyone else has used the remote recently, he or she might be able to give you a lead as to its location. Perhaps this person placed the remote in a spot where you don't normally leave it. Perhaps he or she absentmindedly left the device in a part of the house that you do not often visit. Even if you don't find the remote right away, asking someone else can help you decide where not to look.
 Your teenager might have brought the remote to his or her room and forgotten to bring it back. Your toddler might have hidden the remote as a prank. Your dog might have carried the device off to chew on it! Think about who might have done such a thing, and why.


Check the kid's toy box. You never know when your son or daughter might have taken off with the remote!

, You don't need to find the remote alone! Ask your friends or family members to help you look for the missing device. It might help if you can give them an engaging reason to find the remote. If you find the remote, then you can all watch a movie together, or you can catch the program that's coming on in twenty minutes.

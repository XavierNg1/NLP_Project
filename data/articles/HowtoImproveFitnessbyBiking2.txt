 It is important that the seat, the handle bars and the pedals are all at the right length and levels for your body. You are more likely to lose your balance and hurt yourself if the bike does not fit you properly.
 Biking comes with rules and regulations related to turning and biking on paths. You should learn the proper etiquette before cycling around a town or in the country.

You will have a number of bikes to choose from, including mountain, cruising, road and recumbent bikes. Explain your current level and the ways you plan to use the bike to the people in the shop to make sure you are buying the right model.
 Riding a bike is dangerous if you do not have the proper confidence and balance. Before attempting to ride fast or around curves and hills, you must be comfortable with gear changes and braking.


One of the main fitness benefits of road cycling is that it improves your coordination.
 This is a great way to get into condition with a low-level aerobic workout without noticing it is a workout. Cycling to and from work will also help reduce stress and help you sleep better at night having worked your body harder during the day.
 Cycling 20 to 30 miles (32 to 48Â km) or more can help to build your endurance. These rides often include hills, which work your body in a similar way as sprinting because you must increase your pace to overcome the obstacle.
 Cycling is best when combined with other workouts that involve your upper body. Although biking improves the core, it concentrates the workout on your gluteal, quadriceps, hamstring and calf muscles.
 You should get faster as you cycle more often. Aim to get to your destination just a few minutes faster every week to improve lung capacity and heart health.

 This method is different in that it requires putting the litter box in place from the start, but gradually training the chinchilla to use it instead of the bedding on the ground.


Set the litter box on the very bottom level of her cage, next to the place where she typically urinates.
 Every few hours, come to your chinchillas cage and check whether she has used the bathroom in the bedding on the floor of the cage. If she has, scoop the waste and surrounding bedding and place it into the litter box.Be sure to get all of the wet bedding. It carries a strong smell that will clue her in that you've moved her toilet.
 Chinchilla waste is pretty smelly, and you need to change the litter at least every couple of days to keep her cage smelling fresh.


When you need to change her litter box, be sure to keep back one scoop's worth of urine-saturated bedding. Replace it on the top of the clean litter. This serves as a little signpost to your chinchilla to remind her that this area is the new toilet.
 This could be weeks or months! This method requires a lot of persistence on your part. If you forget to move the litter for a day or more, she will become confused and forget what you wanted her to do.


Gradually, she should figure out that you want her to pee in the box and not on the ground.

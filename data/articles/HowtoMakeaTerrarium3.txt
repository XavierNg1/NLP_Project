 If your terrarium is open, water the plants occasionally. This won't be necessary for airtight terrariums, but plants in open terrariums will need to be watered once a week. Succulents and cacti only need to be watered once a month.
 If you see weeds, mold, or sick plants, remove the affected area immediately. Also, remove wilting parts of the plant, such as old flowers.
 If your terrarium is airtight, air it out. Though this usually isn't necessary, if your plants are wilting or there's condensation on the sides of the terrarium, air it out (for example, by propping the container slightly open by putting a rock underneath the edge).

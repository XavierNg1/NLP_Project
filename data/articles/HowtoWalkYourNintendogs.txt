 This makes them happy and you can get better presents.;
, If you haven't done already it's a good idea to give them food and drink so then they won't try to eat as much food off the street.
 Draw the route on the map that you're going to take. Try to make it use up as much of the puppy's energy as possible, this is displayed on the left of the touch screen.
 Allow your dog to relieve itself a few times but if he/she is doing too often and you want to get on with the walk, when you see you're approaching a blue spot on the map pull the lead up so the puppy will jump over it and not stop., Take your puppy to the gym or park to use up more energy and you can practice for contests or your pup can play with other dogs in the park.
 If you pass some trash on the street, your puppy will try to eat it. Pull the lead until it leaves it.
 Presents can be found in the ? boxes on the map but also lying round in random places, if you pass one pull your puppy back to it and it will pick it up and give it to you.
 There are 2 discount shops in the neighbourhood, they sell the same as the normal shop but at a cheaper price.
 As well as presents, in the ? boxes on the map you can also see other dogs being walked. If you want your puppy to make friends with the other, the best way is to pull it over to the other puppy when the other puppy is lying down and they will not bark at your pup and scare it off.

 As with the Valor form, Shadows are your best option. Head to the World That Never Was to find them in an almost limitless supply. The Wisdom Form trains by defeating Heartless, one Experience point per kill. Weak heartless should be your intended quarry. Also a good place to train is Timeless River. Go back and enter the first window. Use thunder and shoot to clear out the enemies quickly. after your drive gauge gets low exit the window and go back out the door to Disney Castle and your drive gauge will be replenished. Good place to train master as well.
 Use keyblades that replenish increase your MP recovery and have high Magic strength. You'll only be allowed one, so if you have to choose, go with Magic Strength.
 The Wisdom form is all about magic. Using magic in the Wisdom form, although using up Gauge, is a lot more powerful. So that you can use magic more, equip items that lower the time you spend charging your MP, such as the Ultima Weapon. Try Thunder as a spell to use, as it automatically targets enemies, even if they are behind you. It also has a wide area effect in the Combo Finisher.
 Forget about how much MP you've got left, just fire away. The more you use it, the more Experience you'll get, and it doesn't hurt to be quick about it. But be careful you don't waste MP, keep an eye on whether there actually are any Heartless around, or whether you've killed them all.


Another handy tactic that works well is to use Magnet. This will draw in enemies and damage them. Once you've got some enemies circling the magnet, start shooting at them. Or alternatively, use Thunder. Remember to keep an eye on your Form Gauge, and as soon as it runs low go to your save point. Even if it takes a while, remember that Level 7 Wisdom Form comes with Quick Run, an extremely useful maneuver in any situation.

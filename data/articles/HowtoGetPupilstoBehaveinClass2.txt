 It could be for the whole grade (like a school trip to someplace nice; a water park for example, or you can give a prize for the individual student (like chocolate or candy).

Pick from random out of your class. You can use the idea from the 'Ice Lolly Method' to pick out a random student.
 Don't say who, even to the student (hence the name 'secret student') and tell them that if they are on their best behaviour the selected student will win the prize.
 Be sure to not make it obvious, though, or other students will start misbehaving knowing that it's not them. If the prize is for the grade then ask other teachers who teach your students to tell you how the student has been acting.



If the prize is for the selected student only, give them their prize, if it's for the grade, select a target of well behaved secret students and if they reach it they can have their award.
If the student has overall acted badly, don't announce them to the class and tell the students that the 'secret student' misbehaved. Don't say their name to the class, though; it may embarrass them.

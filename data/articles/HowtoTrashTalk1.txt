 If you are only joking around with your friends on the soccer field, meaningless jokes are an effective way to go. Keep it informal and light. On the opposite end of the trash-talk spectrum, if you are engaged in a competitive sporting event against people you don’t know, you may need to focus more on serious boasts and downplay the humor.


For a meaningless joke, tell a friend that they’re like a bundle of firewood, “because they’re always getting burned.”For a more serious boast, say, “Should I give you my autograph now, or later?”;
, Whether you’re competing online or in person, you need to “read the room” and determine if trash talking is an appropriate tactic. If the other players seem to be focused on projecting respect and sportsmanship, your trash talk may be seen as rude.


The same rule applies in online forums—if other participants enjoy trash talk or are already engaging in it, go ahead and join in. If the crowd is more conservative and prefers a quieter atmosphere, you should avoid bothering competitors with your trash talking.
 Some sports, such as boxing and wrestling, are aggressive, in-your-face competitions. These environments encourage trash talk, as it increases the entertainment for spectators and allows the fighters to get under one another’s skin. Other sports, like tennis or baseball, are seen are more “gentlemanly,” and discourage trash talk.Even online, some competitive games are more appropriate forums for trash talking. (Call of Duty and similar games are infamous examples.) Until you’re familiar with the gaming community, avoid stepping in with aggressive trash talk.
Also if you’re playing a light-hearted video game with family, avoid trash talk. For example, if you’re playing Wii Sports with a young nephew or your grandmother, do not trash talk.

 Swimming with an air limit sounds scary, but once you get used to it, you won't even have to think about it.;
, Dive into shallow water with Z, and stay underwater until your Air Meter is almost empty. When you get to the last few seconds, swim to the surface so you'll survive. As long as you didn't panic while you were under and lose track of time, you'll now have a basic idea of how long it takes for you to lose air.
 While on the surface, all you have to do is move around to swim (and push A rapidly to swim faster). Underwater is very different. You won't learn anything by practicing swimming on the surface. You have to try swimming underwater.


Push A rapidly to do the breaststroke, hold A to kick your legs, and steer with your control stick.
You can push Z to dive deeper, even if you're already underwater.
You can also shake the Wii Remote to spin underwater, which gives you a speed boost.
 If you're scared of losing air, practice swimming in shallow water first, then go deep. You can learn slowly. Don't push yourself!

, When you're finally ready to start swimming freely, go for it!

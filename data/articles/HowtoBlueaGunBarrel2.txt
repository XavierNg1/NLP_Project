 Again, steel wool or 600 to 1200-grit sandpaper will work to remove any loose rust, scarring, or pitting from the gun metal.


If you plan to remove the gun’s finish from the factory before bluing, some recommend using a phosphoric acid-based automotive rust remover to do so. Others use white vinegar, which contains acetic acid, for this purpose.
 The 19th-century gunsmiths who used this process likely did not have access to the chemicals used to clean gun metal for hot bluing, but the chemical cleaning improves the effectiveness of the bluing. You can use any of the chemicals described in the cleaning step for hot bluing and then rinse the cleaner off in the manner described in the rinsing step.
 The acid solution actually encourages the metal to rust, but to do so uniformly.


Instead of coating the parts with the acid solution, you can instead place an opened container of the acid solution with the gun parts in a cabinet and seal it for a period of 12 hours. The acid evaporates from its container and condenses around the gun metal. This method is called fume bluing.
Another variation is to coat the gun metal parts with the rust bluing solution and then put them into a fume cabinet (or, in this case, a damp cabinet) for the same 12 hours. Often, a first layer is applied as a primer before coating the parts a second time and then placing them in the damp cabinet., This stops the rusting process by removing the acid solution.
 The surface rust is normally removed with a carding brush or wheel, which features very soft and thin wire bristles.
 In some cases, the metal may develop as deep a coloring as it can, making further bluing treatments unnecessary and ineffective.
 The oil inhibits the formation of rust and protects the metal finish from dirt, sweat, body oil, and wear. Once you’ve applied the oil, let the parts stand overnight before assembling.

 Choose one that your child or you would like to have on the window. Print it out. Of course, if you have a picture already, you can use that instead, provided it's on plain white paper.
 Only use crayons, as pencils, pens or markers will not work to create the stained glass window effect., Put your now colored picture on top of the newspaper, making sure that the backside is facing up., Pour a little cooking oil into a bowl. Dip one end of the sponge into the oil. Gently brush the back of the picture with the oil; it will start to seep through the paper, turning it transparent. You should be able to see the picture on the other side.

Don't miss out any bits of the image or paper––if you do, it will stop the light coming through the missed parts.
 Once it has dried, you can stick it on your window to let the light shine through.

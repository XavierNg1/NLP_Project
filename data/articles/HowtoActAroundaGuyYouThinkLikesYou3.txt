 When having a conversation about something delicate, like your feelings for someone, it's important you have the time and space to talk. Find a time when you're both free and there are no external limits on time. Pick a private area, like a quiet bench in a local park., If you're letting the guy know you like him, be direct. There's no sense in beating around the bush and dropping hints. Get directly to the point by saying something like, "I have feelings for you. Sometimes, I get the sense you also have feelings for me. Am I right about that?", If you're not interested, let the guy down easy. Tell him you appreciate his friendship, but you're not interested in him in a romantic sense. There's no need to be brutal, but you should make it clear a relationship is not happening.Say something that clearly indicates you don't feel the same way. For example, "I'm not interested in you romantically."
If you want to give a reason, that's okay, but be kind about it. For example, if you're not attracted to him, don't say, "I'm not attracted to you." Say something like, "I just see you as friend."

, If you misinterpreted a situation, this can be embarrassing. Whether the feelings were returned or not, it can be awkward if you thought someone had feelings for if they didn't. Make sure you have a plan to respond in this case.


Accept his response gracefully. In either scenario, you can say something like, "Oh, I guess I misread the signs. Thanks for being honest with me."
It's okay to be sad if you were rejected by someone you thought liked you. Take some time to vent to friends and do something nice for yourself, like go see a movie or order take out.

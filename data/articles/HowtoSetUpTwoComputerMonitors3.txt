 This will allow you to use your HDTV as a second display without having to connect it to your computer. Using Apple TV as a second display requires Mountain Lion or later, and your computer must be connected to the same network as the Apple TV.


If you have Mountain Lion, you can only mirror your display. If you have Mavericks, you can use the second display as an extension of your desktop.
See this guide for details on setting up your Apple TV.
 When you are connected to the same network as a properly configured Apple TV, the AirPlay menu will appear in your Mac's menu bar. Click it and select your Apple TV from the devices list.
 Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. Choose "Displays". Click the "Arrangement" tab. Adjust the screen placement so that your mouse cursor flows naturally between monitors.


If you are using Mavericks, you can check the "Mirror Displays" box to duplicate your display.
 Spaces allow you to keep your different windows organized as you multitask. Each open window is assigned to a Space. This allows you to keep your windows organized for specific tasks.


Windows will not span displays by default. You will need to disable this in the Mission Control section of the System Preferences window. Uncheck the "Displays have separate spaces" box.
You can assign apps to specific spaces by right-clicking the icon in your Dock. Select Options and then choose the display you want to assign it to.

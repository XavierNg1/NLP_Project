 It is always important to keep an eye on your chickens after you have vaccinated them. Look for any signs that something might be wrong. If you do notice anything, call a vet right away.For respiratory vaccinations it is normal for the chickens to develop respiratory issues like sneezing for 3 to 5 days after they get vaccinated. If the signs persist for longer than that, call a vet.

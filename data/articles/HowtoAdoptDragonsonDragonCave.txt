 To get to the egg adoption pages, click on either the Dragon Cave logo on the top left corner of the page, or click on the Cave button located next to it. This will take you to a page with a map and various options., Once on the Cave page, you have a choice of many different locations, called Biomes, to choose from. These include Alpine, Coast, Desert, Forest, Jungle, and Volcano. Each Biome usually has three eggs to choose from, all silhouettes with question marks inside them. However, when adoption rates are high, there may be fewer, or even zero, eggs available there.

You can also choose to adopt an abandoned egg by clicking "take one of those instead", located near the middle of the page. This brings you to a page with many eggs to choose from, each with its own picture.
 Once in your Biome of choice, it's time to choose an egg! You can take up to four eggs as a beginner, but this amount increases with the amount of dragons you own. To take an egg, just click on one that you like.

This will either take you to a page with image codes or one of two error messages (described in the Tips section below). Once at the image code page, click on Dragons at the top of the page to view your newly adopted eggs.

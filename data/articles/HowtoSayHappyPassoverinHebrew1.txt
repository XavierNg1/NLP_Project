 In Hebrew, the idea of happiness is expressed with the word "Simcha." To say "happy" as an adjective, we use "sameach," which is derived from the noun.


This word is pronounced "sah-MEY-akh." Use a hard "k" sound with a raspy quality from the back of the throat. Don't use an English "ch" sound.;
, This is the traditional Hebrew name for the holiday.


"Pesach" is pronounced "PAY-sock." It's pronounced almost exactly like these two English words. Again, end the word with a hard, raspy "kh" sound, not a "ch" sound.
 In Hebrew phrases, the words in a sentence aren't always in the same order that they are in English.In this case, the adjective comes after the noun, so "Happy Passover" is actually "Pesach Sameach".


To pronounce the whole phrase, just put the pronunciations above together: "PAY-sock sah-MEY-akh." Congratulate yourself for learning a new Hebrew phrase!

 In pilish, where the number of letters in each word stands for the corresponding number in pi. For example, "May I have a large container of coffee beans" = 314159265 in pilish. In 1996, Mike Keith wrote a short story called "Cadaeic Cadenza" in which some 3800 digits of pi were encoded.Keith also developed a method of using words longer than 10 letters to represent sequences of numbers.
 A piem is a poem that encodes pi in its words, using the pilish method. Typically, they rhyme for the purposes of memorization and have titles of three letters, representing the 3 that begins pi.


A piem: Now I will a rhyme construct, / By letter count, the young instruct. / Cunningly devised endeavors, / Con it and remember ever. / Widths in circle here you see, / Sketched out in strange obscurity.
 Many schoolyard mnemonics have developed over the years to help memorize the first several digits of pi: Cosine, secant, tangent, sine / Three point one four one five nine. This mnemonic relies on using the rhythm and pattern to recall the memorized numbers.


Lots of other memorization songs use the same technique: "If numbers had a heaven / their God would surely be / 3.14159 / 26535."
The ABC tune, aka "Baa-Baa Black Sheep," aka "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star": 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 / 6 5 3 5 8 9 / 7 9 3 2 3 8 4 / 6 2 6 4 3 3 8 / 3 2 7 9 5 0 2 / 8 8 4 1 9 7 1
Try writing your own song or rhyme to help yourself remember.
 Derivatives of the major system are used by some of the best mnemonists in the world. This extraordinarily complex technique involves substituting each digit or group of digits for a corresponding word that is phonetically similar, and eventually building a story or a series of linkages out of those words.

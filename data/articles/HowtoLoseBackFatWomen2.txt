 If it has been a while since you got your bra size measured, or you have gained or lost a significant amount of weight, it may be worth your while to get your bra resized.A band that is too tight will dig in and create unflattering bulges across your back. Your skin may also hurt or ache throughout the day if your bra is not fitted to your body.
Go to an undergarment store or undergarment department store and ask for help. Many stores offer free bra fittings for customers. They'll measure you and give you an idea of an appropriate size.
Also try different types of bras. Some are actually designed to hold in unwanted bulges and are more comfortable to wear throughout the day.
 Tight fitting tops, tops that show more skin or those that are made of sheer fabric may enhance the look of bulges around your back.Choose more flattering clothes to help disguise unwanted bulges on your back.


Unflattering clothing choices can include: tight waistbands, tight bras, jeans that cause muffin top, etc. These can call attention to your back fat.
Try to wear clothes that are flattering and that fit you well. By wearing more flattering clothing, people likely wonâ€™t even notice any back fat that you do have.
You can also wear clothes that will draw attention away from your back. For example, wear a loose top with a bright skirt to guide the eye down, or pair a simple shirt with dangly earrings for the opposite effect.
 You can purchase undergarments or bras that are designed to lift and smooth your entire upper body.These may be especially helpful if you want to decrease your back fat for a special occasion.


Look for shapewear that's designed as a bra and upper body shaper. This will provide you the support you need up top, but smooth out any bumps or bulges on your back and stomach.
These types of undergarments can also help clothes fit better and flow more naturally over your body.

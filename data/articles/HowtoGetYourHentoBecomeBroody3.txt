 Hens generally become broody during the spring or summer (the warmer months). If you wait for the right season, your henâ€™s natural instincts and broodiness should kick in on their own. Approach this endeavor with positivity and patience, and wait until the time is right., Modern day breeds (especially show birds) have had their broody instinct bred out by breeders who tend to use incubators. Because of this, it is important to start with a broody breed of hen, such as cochin, buff orpington, light brahmas, or dark Cornish hens., You will need a rooster in the mix if you want to end up with fertilized eggs and broody hens. The presence of a rooster near your hen is likely to encourage broody behavior., One rooster to every five hens is the ideal ratio for your chickens. If you are able to maintain this ratio of roosters to hens, you are more likely to get fertilized eggs and to encourage broodiness in your hens., Your hen needs somewhere safe and comfortable to both lay and sit on the eggs. Create a dry, clean, relatively dark place where your hen can have some privacy. You can purchase these, or construct them yourself out of wood.You will need one box for every two to four hens.
Twelve cubic inches (12" x 12" x 12") is a good size for each box.
Add some sawdust and/or straw to serve as bedding for your chicken(s).

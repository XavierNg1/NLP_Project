 There are two service courts (as a whole there are four) on each side separated by a center line. The server must serve the shuttle, i.e., the ball, to the court that is diagonal to their court. For example, if you are standing on the left side of the court, from your perspective, you need to serve the ball to the right side of the court (or your opponentâ€™s left court)., Some part of both feet must be touching the ground when you serve. In other words, one foot cannot be touching while the other is lifted. You can keep both feet in contact with the floor by standing on your tiptoes while you serve. However, you cannot drag a foot along the floor., While serving, you must stay inside your respective box. You are not allowed to touch or cross the boundary lines while you are serving. However, you may lean forward or sideways so that your racket is outside of the court lines.The receiver of the shot must also stay inside their respective box.
 When serving the shot, the shuttle must be below your waist at all times. Your waist is defined as the lowest part of your ribcage. Therefore, it is slightly higher than the line of your shorts.Feel for your lowest rib. The shuttle must be below this point when it comes into contact with the racket.
 Once the game begins, do not take more than five seconds to hit the shuttle. If you do, the referee might rule a fault.


While serving, you are not allowed to delay once you start to backswing the racket. In other words, there should be no delay between your backswing and forward swing; it should be one fluid motion.

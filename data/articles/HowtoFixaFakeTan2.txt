 Lemon juice is naturally acidic and it acts like a mild bleach. It works to remove unwanted color from patchy and flaky tans. Make sure you use fresh lemon juice because already squeezed lemonade that you buy at the store may have different chemicals in it that you may not want to apply onto your skin. Simply cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice out into a bowl.


Then, mix one cup of raw sugar with 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.
Dip a cotton ball into your mixture, and wipe the streaky orange areas using circular motions. Your candy corn discoloration should be diluted after several minutes of light massaging.Use a loofa or other scrub brush with the lemon juice and sugar mix for a more aggressive way of completely removing your fake tan.
 Sugar is course and can be rough to scrub against your skin. If yours is too sensitive for the sweet solution, try baking soda instead to strip the fake tan right off. It is nonabrasive and leaves your skin feeling incredibly smooth. However, it may take a little longer to get rid of the streaks.Grab a bowl and mix equal parts baking soda with fresh lemon juice. Mix together until the powder becomes a paste. If your mixture seems more like a liquid, add more baking soda. You want the spread to stay on your skin and not run right off.
After you have developed your desired consistency, spread it on your skin and begin rubbing in soft, circular motions. Focus on the areas of extreme streakiness until the unwanted tan disappears. Don't scrub for more than three minutes.
When you are finished, clean off with water and a wash cloth or jump in the shower.
 Many people attempt to tan their face only to find that it doesnâ€™t spread evenly or forgivingly. If your face is oily, sweaty, or dry, you will end up with dark patches that refuse to blend in, especially over your lip where fine hair grows. When blending in this undoubtedly tricky area, or anywhere on your face, you have to be very gentle because the skin on your face is sensitive and you can easily break capillaries if you scrub too hard.


To lighten above your lip, wet a wash cloth with warm water and gently rub for about 30 seconds using circular motions. The area will lighten up quickly because you are simply cleaning off the tanner that is attached to the fine hair above your lip.
Pull your lips in tight, hiding them while you apply the tanning spray or cream.
Do not apply the fake tan directly around your mouth because it will stick more easily here than in other facial areas. Instead, bring down existing tanner from your cheekbones and lightly rub on thinner amounts.
 If you have streaks in areas where you skin is dry or rough, you need to exfoliate your skin before you apply more fake tan to even out your first job.

Then, wash off your skin with warm water and apply the fake tan again. After you give the tan enough time to develop, you can determine if it is dark enough. If you want a darker look, or if you still see streaks, repeat the procedure.
You may need to repeat this step up to three times in order for it to look the way you want it to.

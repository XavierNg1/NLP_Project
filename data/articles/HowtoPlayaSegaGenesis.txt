 There are many different models of the Genesis. Model 1 is the largest and has more ports than the other two. Model 2 is medium in size and Model 3 is the smallest with limited features and no "add on" support with the Sega 32X and CD units.;
, You can also insert a 32X into Models 1 and 2 but it requires more cords and can add stress to your console if the metal stand piece isn't in the Model 1 Genesis.
 There are many models, but only 3 official Sega controllers.


One is called the "3 button pad" It is rounded on the edges, has curves on the bottom and has 4 face buttons. (A) (B) (C) and (Start) Its also includes a directional Pad for moving in 8 directions on the Games you play.
The other controller is called a "6 button pad" It was designed for use with games that required or recommended the use of more buttons. It includes 1 shoulder button called as some games didn't allow the use of it. Its main feature is that it has 3 more face buttons and a more dynamic Directional Pad, the new buttons are (X) (Y) (Z)

, Model 2 will have a button and model 3 will have a slide switch like the Model 1. You will be greeted by a bios screen telling you its licensed by Sega.

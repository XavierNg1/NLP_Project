 Some states require a transcript of high school work while others don’t. However, if you decide to make a transcript, it needs to adhere to the state guidelines where you are graduating. Your transcript should take the work you have done and place them into the correct courses needed for your state’s requirements.Most states have a set number of required credits in English, math, science, social studies, and certain electives. When you are making out your transcript, you can apply your work to the correct required credit.
For example, in Pennsylvania requires high school graduates to have a certain number of credits to graduate, like four in English, three in math, science, and social studies, and two in arts and humanities.Georgia requires a minimum of 23 credits, with four in English, math, and science, and three in social studies and foreign language.;
, Transcripts are most often used to get into college. However, some jobs or internships require transcripts also. Before you make your transcript, determine why you need the transcript and where you will be sending it. Even figuring out what kind of school you want to go to will help you make a better transcript.For example, a community college, a pre-med program, or a science tech school would require different types of transcripts.
 If you want to go to a specific college or program, contact their admission counselors. Talk to them about the guidelines for homeschoolers and unschoolers since many schools have different rules for them. They may want to see your more unique, individualized education instead of a more traditional transcript.Admissions counselors are there to answer your questions about the application and admissions process for getting into their institution. They will be happy to meet with you in person or over the phone to discuss what you need to apply.

 Get the outer lines, the insides of the curves, and inside the diamond. It won't be perfect at first, so cut away all the loose outer edges. Take note that the back of the rune is supposed to be left flat for stability. Smooth over the Rune once you're done cutting- you can use a little water to seal cracks shut.
 Make sure that the hole is big enough for a chain or string of your choice to fit through. Alternatively, you can purchase a jewelry kit and use the items in it.

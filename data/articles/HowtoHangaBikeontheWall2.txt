Find a stud or a joist if you plan to hang your bike from the ceiling. To do this, you can either get a stud finder or, if your ceiling walls are finished, look for a line of nail heads through the paneling or drywall.






Measure to decide where your mounting hardware will attach to the wall. If you have a helper, have this person hold the bike where you want it to hang so that you can mark where the mounting screws will go.






Pre-drill holes for the mounting screws. Make sure the holes go into the middle of the stud or joist. Use larger screws screws (~2 inch, #10) for a ceiling mounted hook than for a wall mounted hook.






Attach the mounting hardware and try it out. Hang and retrieve the bike several times to make sure it works as you intended.
Note: This step is particularly important for children to try, because you must make sure they are able to hang and retrieve their bikes.

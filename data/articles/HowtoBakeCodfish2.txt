 Rinse and clean the cod like normal, then drizzle with olive oil and lemon, lightly massaging it into the skin. Finely mince 2-3 cloves of garlic and one teaspoon of fresh thyme, sprinkling evenly on all the fish. Then dust with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. Wrap in foil and cook like normal.


For a little spice, add some crushed red pepper.
Garlic powder can be substituted for fresh garlic in a pinch., This wonderful dish is perfect with pasta or couscous. To make it, season the fish to taste with salt and pepper in the foil. Then top each fillet with chopped olives, capers, 2-3 slices of lime, and a pinch of freshly chopped rosemary. Drizzle everything with olive oil, seal the foil pouches, and enjoy. You'll need:


1/4 cup kalamata olives
1/4 cup capers (drained of liquid)
2-3 limes
2-3 teaspoons fresh rosemary., To do this, skip the aluminum foil, placing the fish in a glass baking dish instead. Brush each fillet with olive oil, dip it into the mixture below. Press the fish lightly into the breadcrumbs to coat, then cook in the baking dish for 12-15 minutes until firm.


1 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 cup parsley, chopped
2-3 garlic cloves, finely minced
Zest from one lemon
Salt and pepper, to taste., Put 1/4 cup of flour in a shallow dish and the flour season to taste with salt and pepper, about 1/2 teaspoon of each. Melt three tablespoons of butter and mix with three tablespoons of lemon juice, then dip the cod in this butter mixture. Dip the wet cod in the flour so that both sides of fish are dusted with flour. Cook in a shallow baking dish for 12-15 minutes, drizzling any remaining butter mixture over the top.


You can add some cayenne pepper to the butter mixture for a slightly spicy kick.
Garnish finished fish with chopped parsley and a lemon wedge.

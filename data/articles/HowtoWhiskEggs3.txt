 When beaten, fresher eggs will achieve more loft and greater stability than older eggs., This will help you achieve the ribbon stage more quickly than by using a hand mixer.


If you use a hand mixer, be sure to circulate it through the mixture while beating to achieve the proper loft., Whisk your eggs and sugar together until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. This will ensure that your egg mixture won’t become granular when heated, and the batter will have the necessary thickness and loft.
 As more air is incorporated into your mixture, the deep yellow color will lighten and your mixture will thicken., Once your mixture is the right color, lift a beater out of the bowl. If some of the mixture falls back into bowl and forms a ribbon-like stream that holds its shape for a few seconds, you have reached the ribbon stage.Batters that aren’t whisked long enough to attain the ribbon stage will result in dense, rubbery cakes.

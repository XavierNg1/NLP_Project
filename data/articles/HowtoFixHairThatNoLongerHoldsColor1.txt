 You can buy hair strippers for usually under US$8 from places such as drugstores and department stores in the beauty/hair section.;
, Your hair can either be clean or in need of a wash to use this. (Preferably wait until you're due for a shower to do it, that will save on washing time.) Open and read included instructions-â€“it's easy to use and safe for even damaged hair.
 Let it sit in a plastic cap for 20 minutes. After doing so, get in the shower and spend at least 10 minutes washing your hair out.


Hair strippers smell bad. Make sure that all surfaces it can potentially get on (sink, counter, etc.) are covered with paper or plastic and that anything it comes in contact with gets washed well.
 After your 20 minutes is up, it may not appear like all your hair has been changed. Don't worry! Whatever dyes you ever used will completely wash out of your hair in the shower.


If you have ever bleached your hair before and it has never completely been cut and regrown, the parts of your hair that has been previously bleached will not return to your original color; they will go back to being blonde.
 What has happened is the hair stripper removed all the dyes left in the pores of your hair, which has clogged up and made it difficult to impossible for new dye to be added and remain in the pores of your hair. You should now be able to dye your hair (even on the same day as stripping it) your new color. Avoid bleaching it again anytime soon.

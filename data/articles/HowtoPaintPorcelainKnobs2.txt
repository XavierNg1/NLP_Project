 The effect you wish to achieve will influence which painting method you choose for painting your porcelain knobs.


Consider using craft paint designed for use on porcelain if you want the original color of the knob to show and you want to paint a design on the knob. Craft paint is available in liquid form that requires you to use a brush and in marker form which may make detail work easier to execute.
Look at fabric and wallpaper designs for inspiration. If you want to paint a pattern on your porcelain knob, small scale designs will work best.
Plan to use a combination of primer and paint if you want a uniform finish and color on your porcelain knobs. You can use latex, acrylic or oil paint over the primed knob, and this provides you with a greater option of colors and finishes to choose from than if you use porcelain craft paints. You can also use spray paint over primer in addition to brushing on the paint of your choice.
 If you choose to paint a pattern or design on the knob, sketching out the design to scale before painting can help you produce a more uniform and professional looking result.


Measure the diameter of the porcelain knob you want to paint.
Draw a circle on the graph paper with the same diameter. You can use a compass and pencil if you are not comfortable sketching the circle freehand.
Divide the circle into quadrants by drawing 1 vertical line and 1 horizontal through the center or the circle.
Sketch out the design you plan to paint on the knob.

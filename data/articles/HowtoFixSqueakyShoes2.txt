 If you are trying to fix a new shoe, the squeak may be a manufacturing defect that makes you eligible for a refund or replacement. Using glue or other heavy-duty materials may void your warranty.
 Saddle soap is controversial among owners of fine leather shoes. Some claim it causes the leather to dry out, while others find it harmless. If you're willing to take this risk, apply saddle soap in small quantities to the problem area, and buff with a dry cloth. This may be particularly effective on a squeaky tongue.Never use saddle soap on suede.
 This should only be done if none of the "easy fixes" above work, since excess glue can easily damage or stain shoes. If the shoe heel is loose, use a small dab super glue or rubber cement to reattach it firmly, pressing together for several seconds until the adhesive begins to take hold.This will not work on urethane shoes.
Take expensive high heels to a shoe repair shop instead to avoid the risk of damage.
 Purchase a tube of silicone caulking material with a squeeze top, or a specialized silicone product for shoe repair. Stick the nozzle of the tube into an open space between the shoe and the sole, and slowly squirt it in until the void is filled. Clamp the shoe together with rubber bands, weights, or hardware clamps and let dry overnight.
 Take the shoes to a cobbler or repair shop and ask for advice, or hire someone to fix it for you. About half of squeaky shoes squeak due to a loose shank inside the shoe, or another problem that should be left to a professional.

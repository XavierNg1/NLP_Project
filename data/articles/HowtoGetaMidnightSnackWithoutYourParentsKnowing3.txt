 Do not turn the lights on. It will give you away. Before you start pushing things around looking for something and making noise, take a glimpse at the food, and push things away slowly, then grab your food. If it is in a package, hold it in your mouth for this next step.
 If not, then go to your room they way you came. Be sure to close the door and leave everything the way it was before you came down - otherwise, your parents might become suspicious!

, Once safely in your room, go under your covers or some other place you can eat, and eat your food quietly. If it is in packaging, open it slowly - don't rip it up.
 If your parents see the wrappers, or anything else, you could get busted.


If your parents see your evidence, have a reasonable story.

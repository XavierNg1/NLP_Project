 Once it does, select “Try Ubuntu” from the screen. This will verify that your computer hardware, such as monitor, keyboard, etc., can be properly detected by Ubuntu.
 This will initiate the installation wizard that will guide you throughout the installation process.
 On the installation wizard, choose the language you want to use from the list. Once you’ve selected, click on the Continue button to proceed to the “Preparing to install Ubuntu” window.
 On the “Preparing to install Ubuntu” window, set your desired options before installing Ubuntu:


Download updates while installing—If there are new updates to the Ubuntu version you have, you can choose to download these updates while the system is being installed. But if you want to specifically install version 13.10, then do not enable this option.
Install third-party software—Instead of having its own programs to open media files, Ubuntu uses third-party software to do these. Check this option if it’s okay with you to use these software. If you don’t want to download these third-party programs, do not check this option.
After you’ve set the options you like, click on "Continue" to proceed to the “Installation type” window.
 You can select from the following options.


Install Ubuntu alongside them—You can install Ubuntu without replacing your current operating system, and your files and documents won’t get deleted.
Erase disk and install Ubuntu—All your hard disk’s contents will be wiped out, and Ubuntu will be installed fresh. All your documents and files will be deleted.
Something else—You’ll be able to manually set how much space can be allocated for the Ubuntu OS, such as disk partition options and more.
After you’ve selected which installation type to use, click on the Install Now button to begin the installation process.
Note that the installation process cannot be interrupted.
Apart from the small difference mentioned above, the installation process remains the same for all installation types.

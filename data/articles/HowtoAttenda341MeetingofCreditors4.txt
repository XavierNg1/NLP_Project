 You have the right to a translator if you would feel more comfortable answering in a language other than English. Tell the trustee before the day of the meeting that you need a translator. He or she will call translation services. The translator will probably listen in by speakerphone.


It might be better to tell the trustee well in advance if you need a translator, especially if you speak a language not commonly spoken in the jurisdiction. There are translation services available in more than 200 languages, but there might not be someone available on short notice if you speak an uncommon language.

 To calculate the growth rate, you're going to need the starting value. The starting value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the beginning of the period.

For example, if the revenue of a company is $10,000 at the beginning of the period, then the starting value is 10,000.
 To calculate the annual growth, you'll not only need the starting value, you'll also need the final value. That value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the end of the period.

For example, if the revenue of a company is $65,000 at the period, then the final value is 65,000.
 Since you're measuring the growth rate for a series of years, you'll need to know the number of years during the period.

For example, if you want to measure the annual revenue growth of a company between 2011 and 2015, then the number of years is 2015 - 2011 or 4.
 The formula for calculating the annual growth rate is Growth Percentage Over One Year =((fs)1y−1)∗100{\displaystyle =(({\frac {f}{s}})^{\frac {1}{y}}-1)*100} where f is the final value, s is the starting value, and y is the number of years.Example Problem: A company earned $10,000 in 2011. That same company earned $65,000 four years later in 2015. What's the annual growth rate? 

Enter the values above into the growth rate formula to find the answer:

Annual Growth Rate =((6500010000)14−1)∗100{\displaystyle =(({\frac {65000}{10000}})^{\frac {1}{4}}-1)*100}


=(6.514−1)∗100{\displaystyle =(6.5^{\frac {1}{4}}-1)*100}

≈ (1.5967−1)∗100{\displaystyle (1.5967-1)*100}

= 59.67% annual growth


Note — raising a value a to the 1b{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{b}}} exponent is equivalent to taking the bth root of a. You will likely need a calculator with an "nx{\displaystyle n{\sqrt {x}}}" button, or a good online calculator.

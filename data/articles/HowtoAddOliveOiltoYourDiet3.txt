 Dressings can be used on vegetables, salads, sandwiches, or anything else you like to eat dressing with! Depending on the recipe, use 1 - 1 1/2 cups of olive oil in your dressing.
 Homemade mayo with olive oil is healthier, tastier, and a lot fresher than store-bought mayo, since it has fewer additives. Slather the mayo on sandwiches or mix it in with your chicken and tuna salads. Use 6.7 oz. (200 ml) of olive oil for this simple homemade recipe.
 Pesto is great for pastas, seafood or poultry dishes, and sandwiches. You can rub it on seafood and poultry as a marinade, cook with it in your pasta dishes, or spread it on a sandwich. You can buy pesto at your local grocery store or make it at home with 1/2 cup of olive oil.

1/2 teaspoon of pressed garlic
1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon of parsley

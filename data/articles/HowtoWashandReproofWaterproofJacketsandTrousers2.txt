 Over time waterproof jackets and trousers lose their water repellent ability or breathability. One can make out these signs when they notice the following symptoms:


When water starts soaking into the fabric of your waterproof clothing instead of just slipping away on the outer surface.
The water repellent coating has worn off and you start getting wet from your sweat inside.
Increased weight of the jacket or trouser.
 Follow the following to reproof your waterproof jackets and trousers:


Once wash your jackets and trousers to get rid of all stains and dirt.
Spray a waterproofing agent on to it while ensuring a proper spread on the whole jacket.(spray from a distance to increase spread area) Some sprays work best on dampened jackets and trousers so spray them while they are still wet.
Now tumble dry it at a medium heat (for best results use the temperature mentioned on the bottle of spray) set to activate waterproofing.
If you don't have a spray then use the normal tech cleaner, such as Granger's 30'c wash as we did while washing.
For trousers instead of simple drying, use the tumble drying to reproof it.

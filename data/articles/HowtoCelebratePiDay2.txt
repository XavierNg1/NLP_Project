 Math geeks and clothing manufacturers have a better relationship than you might expect. Consider purchasing a t-shirt with the mathematical symbol for pi on the front and wearing it on the special day. You can easily find these shirts online.


If you don't want to buy a shirt, consider decorating a plain t-shirt using fabric paint and a pi-shaped stencil instead.
You can also wear pi accessories. This idea can be taken further to include pi symbol pendants and other jewelry, or you can take a representative approach by wearing something like a necklace with beads representing the numbers in pi,
You could even consider wearing a pi symbol temporary tattoo.
 Shop around online for some fun pi paraphernalia, like pi mugs and pi watches.


Another option would be to put pi symbol stickers on your belongs.
If you want to spread the celebration, try giving away pencils with pi symbols on them.
Make your computer or phone background into something related to pi. The symbol might work, or you can have a background filled with bubbles or other circular shapes.

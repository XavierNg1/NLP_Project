 For example, if your college professor tends to use PowerPoint presentations but doesn't follow them word for word, it might be easier to use an Outline Note system instead of maybe copying the PowerPoint verbatim, or using Cornell Notes.;
, These can be invaluable organizational tools for educational success. They improve note-taking efficiency and come with features that any other word processor won't have. For example, look at Knowledge NoteBook.
 The Outline Note taking system is very simple, but certain tiny details aren't as easy to find. To do this style of note taking, you basically copy down whatever is on the PowerPoint verbatim in a system that looks like an outline (one point then sub-points below it, then further sub-points, etc) and adds in anything else that the professor happens to say.
 This system isn't good for those who like to copy down every little thing. This is more if you like to get the main things out of a lecture, or if your professor tends to go on and on. To do this style of note taking, take your notebook paper and draw a line horizontally at the top of your paper, and then draw a line vertically along the margin of the paper or a little wider if you write big. Start by tilting your notes with the title of the lecture. Then write main points on the left side of the vertical line and elaborate more on the right side. Studies done by Cornell University have shown that this is the most effective strategy for taking notes.
 Such as using the outline system for a history class, and the Cornell style for a psychology class.
, This is proven to improve memory and raise grades.

 Lymphocytes need amino acids to be able to function properly and keep your immune system strong. The amino acids found in protein are also responsible in part for the production of B-cell lymphocytes. Because of this, its important to get a healthy amount of protein each day.


The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound). Use this reference to calculate how much protein you should be eating each day. For example, a 120 pound person should try to eat 43 grams (1.5Â oz) of protein a day.Sources of protein include: poultry meat, fish, beans, lean beef, pork tenderloin, and dairy products like milk and cheese.;
, Studies have shown that having a high fat count in your body can actually thicken your lymphocytes, making them less effective. To keep your lymphocyte count up and your immune system working effectively, you should try to eat low-fat products.These include:

Lean meats like poultry (without the skin), fish, and lean beef.






Low-fat dairy products (including milk, cheese, and yogurt).
 Catechins found in green tea help lymphocytes to do their job by speeding up their response time. In addition, green tea also contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which triggers the germ-fighting components from the T-cells that helps to boost the immune system.Try to drink at least one cup of green tea everyday to get these immune-boosting benefits.
 Water helps to flush the body of toxins that might have otherwise affected the number of white blood cells in your body. It is important to stay hydrated in order to be healthy. You should try to drink at least 8 to 12 glasses of water every day.If you are not a huge fan of drinking plain water, you can drink fruit juice diluted with water, coconut water, or herbal tea.

 Start with the Flesh Effects gel and squeeze some onto your hand. Use it on the chosen area of skin to create your burn. As it becomes tacky it is easier to stretch into shapes and the more crevices you create, the deeper and nastier the burn will appear.;
,, Start with the Red and dab it on to the Flesh Effects gel with your finger. Blend well, especially where it meets the skin; the aim is to make the burn look raw and inflamed.
 As with the Red, blend well and use sparingly.
 Add a bit off black to make the burn look charred but be very sparing. Ben Nye professional clown series in Black is a good product to use for this purpose.
 Finish the wound with some Ben Nye thick blood. Dab it on using a wooden spatula, paying particular attention to the crevices that you created with the Flesh Effects gel.

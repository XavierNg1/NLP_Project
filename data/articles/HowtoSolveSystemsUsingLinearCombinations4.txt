 It is more likely that your system of equations will not have a pair of matching or opposite coefficients. When you line up the two equations and compare coefficients, unless two coefficients (the A and B of the standard format) match exactly, you need to take a couple extra steps.

For example, consider these two initial equations:


3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6}


8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}



When you examine them, there are no matching coefficients for similar terms. That is, the 3x does not match the 8x, and the 2y does not match the -4y. There is also no pair of opposites.
 Examine the two equations and decide what number you could use to multiply one of the equations, to create a pair of matching or opposite coefficients. For example, given the system 3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6} and 8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}, you should be able to see that the first equation contains a term 2y{\displaystyle 2y} and the second equation contains a term -4y{\displaystyle 4y}. If you double the first term, you will have a pair of opposite coefficients.

Multiply each term of the equation to create a new equation for solving. In this example, multiply each term of the first equation by {\displaystyle }. This will turn the original equation 3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6} into 6x+4y=12{\displaystyle 6x+4y=12}. Notice that you now have a pair of opposite coefficients in the y{\displaystyle y} terms of 4y{\displaystyle 4y} and -4y{\displaystyle 4y}.

In some cases, you may need to do a double multiplication, or use a fraction. For example, in the system 2x−3y=2{\displaystyle 2x-3y=2} and 5x+2y=1{\displaystyle 5x+2y=1}, there are no coefficients that are simple integer multiples of each other. You could multiply the first equation by 5/2{\displaystyle 5/2} to create 5x−152y=5{\displaystyle 5x-{\frac {15}{2}}y=5}, and now the x{\displaystyle x} coefficients are ready to be canceled. Alternatively, if you prefer not to work with fractions, you could multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2. This would create two completely new equations, as follows:


2x−3y=2{\displaystyle 2x-3y=2}     (first original equation)


5x+2y=1{\displaystyle 5x+2y=1}     (second original equation)

Now multiply the first equation by 5, and the second equation by 2


5∗(2x−3y=2){\displaystyle 5*(2x-3y=2)}→→10x−15y=10{\displaystyle 10x-15y=10}


2∗(5x+2y=1){\displaystyle 2*(5x+2y=1)}→→10x+4y=2{\displaystyle 10x+4y=2}




, If you have created a matching pair of coefficients, you will subtract terms to eliminate one variable. If you have created a pair of opposite coefficients, you will add terms to eliminate one variable. Consider the following example:



6x+4y=12{\displaystyle 6x+4y=12}      (first equation)


8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}       (second equation)

----------------------


14x=14{\displaystyle 14x=14}      (add two equations together to cancel y terms)


x=1{\displaystyle x=1}          (divide by 14 to get solution)



, Take that solution, in our example x=1, and substitute it in place of x{\displaystyle x} in either one of the original equations. This works as follows:


3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6}      (original equation)


3∗1+2y=6{\displaystyle 3*1+2y=6}      (insert x value)


3+2y=6{\displaystyle 3+2y=6}       (simplify multiplication)


2y=3{\displaystyle 2y=3}         (subtract 3 from both sides)


y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}}     (divide both sides by 2)


, Verify that you have done the work correctly by checking your solutions. You should be able to place your two solutions, in this example x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}}, into each of the original equations. When you then simplify the equations, you should get true statements.

For example, check the first equation:


3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6}      (original equation)


3∗1+2∗32=6{\displaystyle 3*1+2*{\frac {3}{2}}=6}      (insert x and y values)


3+3=6{\displaystyle 3+3=6}      (simplify multiplication)


6=6{\displaystyle 6=6}       (simplify addition to get solution)

The true statement 6=6{\displaystyle 6=6} shows that the solution is correct.



Now check the second equation, as follows:


8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}      (original equation)


8∗1−4∗32=2{\displaystyle 8*1-4*{\frac {3}{2}}=2}       (insert x and y values)


8−6=2{\displaystyle 8-6=2}       (simplify multiplication)


2=2{\displaystyle 2=2}       (simplify subtraction)

The true statement 2=2{\displaystyle 2=2} shows that the solution is correct.
 The final solution, which you have proven to work in both equations, is x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}}.

If you are working on graphing linear functions, you may also write your solution as an ordered pair. This for this example, you would write x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}} in the form (1,32){\displaystyle (1,{\frac {3}{2}})}.

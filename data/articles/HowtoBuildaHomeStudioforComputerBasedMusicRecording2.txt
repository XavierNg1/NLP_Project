 It must be installed in the room you want to create music.
 For a few hundred dollars or pounds, you can pick up the Focusrite Scarlett Studio, with a 2i2 interface, CM25 mic and HP60 headphones.
 The Scarlett Studio comes with all the cables included.
 PCs are best with Cubase, Macs with GarageBand or Logic Pro X.
 Plug it in.
 Enjoy!

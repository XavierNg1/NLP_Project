 There are many different screen recording programs available for Linux, with different ones available on different distributions. You can download new Linux programs using the package manager.


The package manager in Ubuntu is called the "Software Center".
 This is one of the simplest and most popular screen recorders, and is available for Ubuntu and a variety of other distributions.
 Lowering the quality will result in a blurrier image, but a smaller file size. This is useful if you are recording a long video and don't want to spend time encoding it later.
 Most users can ignore these if they're just recording their desktop, but if you need to change the FPS or disable certain aspects of the Linux UI while recording, you can do so from this menu.
 You can also click the "Select Window" button to select a specific window to record.
 Once you are finished recording, click the "Stop" button.


While you're recording, you can control RecordMyDesktop from the system's menu bar. Click the red circle to open the recordMyDesktop controls.
 You can then edit it using a video editing program or upload it to YouTube.

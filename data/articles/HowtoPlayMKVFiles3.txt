 Despite the best efforts of the creators, MKV files can be terribly tricky to get to play, especially on PCs. Developers at Matroska know this, which is why they have created a tool specifically to diagnose issues with MKV playback. This tool, called matroskadiag.exe, analyzes your MKV file and determines whether you have the right codecs and filters installed to be able to play the video. This diagnostic program is available for free download on the official Matroska website, matroska.org.
 The official diagnostic tool described above isn't the only tool on the market for analyzing your video files. Many free diagnostic tools aren't just limited to analyzing one file format, either. One comprehensive third-party option for diagnosing video playback issues is KC Software's VideoInspector, which is available for free download on afterdawn.com.
 The media players and codec packs listed above should solve most MKV playback issues. However, one common, persistent issue with MKV playback that even the solutions above may not be able to fix has to do with something called RealVideo. Realvideo is a type of video compression format. Basically, it's possible for MKV files to be compressed in the RealVideo format, and, in this case, you may encounter issues when attempting the normal playback options above. Unfortunately, to play MKV files that contain RealVideo, you'll need to download a special, compatible player. The official RealVideo player is called, fittingly, RealPlayer, and it is available for free download from real.com.


Alternatively, if you don't want to download the official player, you can also download a free third-party player that plays RealVideo files. Real Alternative, available for free download from a variety of sources online, is such a player.

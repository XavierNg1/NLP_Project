 This will help make room for the creation of striped horizontal candies, wrapped candies, and color bombs -- all of which are special combinations that can help detonate the icing blocking the cherries in the two side columns.


Try to make multiple striped vertical candies to help clear the icing on the main playing board. Vertical striped candies can be created by matching four candies of the same color in a row, as long as you move the last piece into the combination up or down in a vertical direction. Vertical striped candies can help clear entire columns of candies and icing, and allow cascading candies to fall into the columns and eliminate more candies.;
, While wrapped candies and color bombs can also be helpful in level 181, striped horizontal candies are required to help you beat the level without boosters.


Match four candies of the same color in a row to create a striped candy, making sure you move the last piece into the combination in a horizontal direction to form horizontal stripes on the candy., When combined, striped candies and wrapped candies will clear all candies from the three surrounding rows and three surrounding columns, eliminating a significant number of candies and icing. This special candy combination will also help clear the icing below the cherries in both side columns.


Make wrapped candies by matching five candies of the same color in a T shape, L shape, or + shape.
 When matched with a striped candy, a color bomb will turn all candies of the same color into striped candies that wipe out all candies in the same rows and columns. This special candy combination is another useful way to clear the icing below the cherries in the sidebars.
 Since the cherries are being blocked by icing and not candies, color bombs wonâ€™t necessarily help bring down the cherries. Only detonate color bombs if you can combine them with striped or wrapped candies, or if detonating them will help you make striped horizontal candies.

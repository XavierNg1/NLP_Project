 Yogurt has many nutrients that are good for the skin. As a by-product of milk, it contains lactic acid which contains bleaching properties. Combined with honey, yogurt can be used daily to naturally bleach your skin. The honey not only helps bleach your skin, but also acts as a moisturizer. This combats dry skin, which is a common factor for uneven, dark skin tones., Use one tablespoon of yogurt and ½ tablespoon of honey. Mix them together thoroughly in a bowl and apply using your hands. Apply over your face and neck.
 Leave this mixture on your skin for 10 or 15 minutes. After this, simply rinse it off with warm water.
 Because yogurt and honey are natural and far less harsh than bleach, you can use them every day on your skin. If you do this, you’ll see your skin become noticeably lighter., Milk contains the same properties as yogurt for lightening your skin. If you don’t like the feeling of yogurt on your skin, you can put honey on a facecloth and dip it in milk. Rub this over your skin and let it sit for 15 minutes.

 This method works best with items like glass jars, which can be soaked and submerged without being damaged. Pick a container, like a large bowl, which can hold your item along with a few cups of water. Combine dishwashing detergent with hot water and fill your container.


Don’t fill the container to the brim, or it will overflow when you insert your item.
 Using the example of a glass jar, make sure the sticker and residue are completely submerged. Over this half hour, the glue will dissolve and the residue should come off easily., After soaking for half an hour, whatever residue is left shouldn’t be particularly difficult to remove. Dampen a cloth or rag, then rub until the residue comes off.
 If there’s still some residue tenaciously sticking to your surface, add vinegar to the bowl of water. Whatever residue remains will already be softened after soaking, and will easily come off with vinegar.Don’t use vinegar on marble, stone, aluminum or cast iron. It can corrode and damage these surfaces.

Focus on your desk, your hands, or some other object in front of you. Breaking eye contact with the angry person will help you regain your composure., Get some distance from the person who’s yelling at you by taking a step backwards or scooting back in your chair. Taking control of your physical space can make you feel less helpless and cut back on your urge to cry., If you’re not going to be able to stop yourself from crying, step away from the situation. Make an excuse if you can, such as not feeling well. You can also just tell the person you’re getting too upset to keep talking to them.

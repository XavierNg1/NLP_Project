 If you do so, then you can cause destruction, before switching back to yourself. It is simple and quick to use, not to mention effective.
 Mod, that causes you to become the fabled Herobrine. Herobrine never existed in any version of MC, but you can trick people into thinking that he did.
 You can't go out in sunlight, any skin you have applied turns straight into the Herobrine skin, and you can even ride spiders in the same way you ride pigs.
 The MC "Slender." mod, is a great way to scare newcomers. Slender, as we should all know, is a game based around the fabled Slenderman myth. It includes Slenderman armour and a Slenderman facemask. Endermen are taller, but you can also get Slenderman, who kidnaps you. He makes you Nauseate and poisons you, and it slowly drives you insane. It's a great way to freak the living daylights out of people.

 If you want to choose the freshest, tastiest beets, then you should choose beets that are nice and firm. If they're spongy, that means they're older and won't taste as delicious. Fresh beets will also have dark green leafy tops; beets that are past their prime will have tops with a yellow coloring., Slice the leaves off using a sharp knife. The leaves should be sliced close to the tip of the beet, but not completely removed. Leave a small portion that is just big enough for you to hold. This will make it easier for you to slice the beets, if you decide to do that.


Consider saving your beet greens. The greens can be cooked separately and can be saut√©ed, roasted, or steamed as well. It won't take nearly as long to cook the greens as it would to cook the beets (just 4 minutes in a steamer will do for the greens), so you'll still have to separate them from the beet, even if you do plan on eating them.
 You can also trim off the long end of the beets. You won't need those for cooking and they can make the beets harder to handle. You can also do this after you're done cooking them.
 Wash them under running water, scrubbing them thoroughly with a vegetable brush until you no longer see any visible dirt. You can also just use your hands, but you have to be thorough about it.

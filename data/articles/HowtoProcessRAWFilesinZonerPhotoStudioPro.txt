 Did you use a flash, were you inside, outside, in the shade, etc. Look at it and decide if that looks 'right' to you. If not, click the white balance undo arrow. If you follow one wrong selection with another one, it's still wrong.
 The example here was done this way.
 Here is where experimentation will be the most helpful. Basically, if you want to lighten it, you can use the exposure or lights slider bars.
 The one that can be the most fun (and potentially insanity producing) is the Tone Curve. However, learning this tool will make the RAW module just that much more effective.

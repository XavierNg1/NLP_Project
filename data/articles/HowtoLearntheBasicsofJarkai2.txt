 Saberstaffs are harder to master than dual blades. Most of the moves of the main forms you will have to adapt, or you'll end up slicing yourself in half with your second blade. Take up quarterstaff training to help., This is a mistake that many people make. With a saberstaff, the blades form a straight line. Therefore, if you know the location of one of the blades, you should be able to infer the position of the other., In fact, a regular lightsaber may be better. If you're attacking somebody in front of you with a saberstaff, the second blade is pointing behind you, so you can't attack with two blades at once. Saberstaffs are far more unwieldy indoors than a regular lightsaber. Most of their value comes from the fact that, as they are very rare, it can be quite shocking to suddenly find yourself facing one., Because a saberstaff is longer and heavier than a regular lightsaber, it has a higher "moment of inertia". Basically, you have to apply more force to make it spin at the same speed. Use both hands at the centre of the handle., Saberstaffs are much better than regular sabers for defence, as there is more blade to defend with. Try practising Soresu or Niman as one of your main forms.

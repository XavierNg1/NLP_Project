 Using paper towels is one way to help pull out a stain when you are on the go and can't wash your clothes immediately. Find a few paper towels to place behind the stained part of the fabric. The thicker the paper towels, the better they will be at pulling out the blood and water.


You can also use a rag or cloth towel if your have one handy., Take another paper towel and soak it in cold water. Place the saturated paper towel over the stain and apply pressure. The water should pass through the fabric and soak into the paper towels placed behind the stain. Keep soaking the paper towel in water to continue removing the blood from the fabric.


If the paper towels behind the stain become saturated, switch them out for dry paper towels., The water may not pull out all the blood in the fabric. If you have access to a public restroom, use some hand soap. Take another paper towel and soak it in cold water. Rub a small amount of hand soap into the paper towel and dab at the stain. Rinse with clean cold water to remove the soap.
 If you don't have access to soap, you can use your saliva. It may sound disgusting, but your saliva is capable of breaking up blood stains because saliva contains an enzyme that will break down the proteins found in the blood stain. After you have rinsed the fabric in cold water, work up a generous amount of saliva in your mouth and spit onto the blood stain. Rub the saliva into the stain, then rinse again with clean cold water.


No matter the method you use, try to wash the item in cold water as soon as possible.

 You want to be more in tune to your other senses, especially your sense of touch. Closing your eyes eliminates the visual messages coming to your brain and allows you to focus fully on your other senses. This way, you will be able to concentrate on feeling the wind with your skin., Stick your index finger down in water to get it wet. Hold your finger up and away from your body. The side of your finger that gets cool is the side that the wind is blowing from.If you put your finger in your mouth to get it wet (which works well when there is no water nearby), be sure that you get it wet all the way around.
 Turn to face the direction you think the wind is coming from. The skin on your face will be more sensitive to a light wind than somewhere like your hands. Keep turning until you feel that you are facing directly into the wind., If you are facing directly into the wind, it should sound the same in both ears. You can turn your head left to right and listen to the wind. Keep repositioning your body until the wind sounds the same in both sides.

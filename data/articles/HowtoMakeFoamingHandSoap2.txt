 In addition to an empty bottle with a dispenser pump, you will need liquid scent-free soap and perfumed essential oils. Essential oils will determine the color and the scent of your foaming hand soap and are believed to have various health properties.Make sure to use a scent-free soap. Otherwise, the soap will overpower the subtle smell of the essential oils.
Essential oils can be found in most supermarkets and health shops. There is a large range of colors and scent, such as orange, rosemary, violet, and many more.
Aromatherapy claims that essential oils have many health benefits. While some are true, many others are largely exaggerated., Cover the surface on which you will work with a plastic tablecloth and be sure to have a tap in the room. Wear an apron to avoid staining your clothes and use gloves if you have sensitive hands. Keep a kitchen roll handy in case water spills on the table or on the floor.


Be particularly careful with essential oils. They stain easily and are very hard to remove.
 Pour the tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Add a teaspoon of essential oil and mix until the ingredients form a homogeneous liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle.If the scent is not strong enough, add another teaspoon of essential oils. Don't add too much at once as essential oils are both powerful and expensive.
You can also modify the color by adding food coloring. Always use natural coloring to avoid chemicals.

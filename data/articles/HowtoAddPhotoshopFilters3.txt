,, You should see a list of filters that includes the newly installed filters as well as the pre-installed ones (newer filters usually appear at the bottom of the list).
 This will apply the visual effects associated with the filter to the image (for example, if you select "Retro-Vintage" it will make your image look like an old photograph).

 Give the oil a few minutes to reach a boil. This will get you ready to deep fry the poppadoms.
 Now, take the raw poppadom dough you've made and place one piece at a time into the oil. Carefully watch over it as it fries. Of course, you can deep fry more than one poppadom at a time if you're getting really impatient, but this can lead to problems because they may fuse together, or you may lose track of one of them and lead it to burn a bit. The poppadom will begin to "pop" out a bit, and will take on a more full, airy texture., Once it has cooked on one side, use a slotted spoon to flip it over so that it cooks on the other side. It won't need to cook for as long on the second side as on the first, though you should watch to make sure it is cooked evenly on both sides and cook it for a bit longer or for a bit less time on the second side if necessary. The finished product should be a nice rich golden brown color.
 Carefully use a slotted spoon remove the poppadom from the oil. You can hold it over the oil for a few seconds to let the excess oil drip from the bottom of the spoon.
 The paper towel will absorb some of the extra oil. You can even flip the poppadom over after a minute or so, so that the oil from both sides is absorbed a bit.
 Now, continue to deep fry the poppadoms until they are all cooked to your liking. You may want to line multiple plates with paper towels so that more of their oil is absorbed.
 Enjoy these tasty treats on their own, along with your favorite Indian meal, or even eat them like chips and dip them into a bit of chutney.

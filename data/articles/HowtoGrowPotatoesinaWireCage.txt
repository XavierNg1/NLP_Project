 Make it about ten feet (approx. 3 meters) long, and roll it into a cylinder about 3 feet (approx. 91 centimeters) wide. Fasten the end to the fence with wire to hold it together. It should form a strong but easy to open cylinder that stands about four feet (1.2 meters) tall.






;
, Loosen it, and add a bit of fertilizer. This will get the potatoes off to a good start.
 Place them about three to four inches (approx. 7.5 cm - 10 cm) deep, hand tamping the soil around them.
 Place them around the planted seed potatoes, centering the future plants.
 Your potato plants will soon be popping out of the soil; as they grow, fill in the space inside the fence with leaves, straw and additional dirt. Do not bury the plants; only bring the soil level up inside the cylinder two to three inches (5 cm - 7.5 cm). Once the potato shoots grow to about 1 foot, do cover completely with leaves, straw or a similar material. You want to keep the light off the developing tubers, as it can cause them turn green.
 The plants will use this extra soil to grow even more potatoes in. Soon, the cylinder will be filled with leaves, straw dirt and potatoes. Potatoes do not need a lot of additional rich organic material, but they do need additional water, at least 1 inch per week. Enough to soak them thoroughly without drowning them.
 When the plant tops dry and wither, the potatoes are ready to harvest. Simply undo the wire fasteners and pull away the fence.Your potatoes will be ready to harvest, without digging, right in the cylinder of soil. Gently spread out your new potatoes and allow them to air dry for at least a day, to help "toughen" the skins. If rain is threatened move them to a covered area. Once they are matured, they can be stored in a cool dry place until you're ready to feast on them.

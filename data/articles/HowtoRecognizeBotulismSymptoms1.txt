 Botulism can often cause a variety of issues with your vision. For example, blurred vision or double vision are common symptoms of botulism. You may also experience drooping eyelids.If you notice other symptoms it is a good idea to look in the mirror to see if your eyelids are drooping.;
, Many people who are suffering from botulism experience an extremely dry mouth. They will also have difficulty swallowing or speaking, often as a result of dry mouth., Facial weakness, on both sides of the face, is a common symptom of both wound based and foodborne botulism. For instance, you may notice drooping eyelids, the corners of your mouth may droop, and you may have difficulty using your facial muscles. Severe muscle weakness, including paralysis, can also be a sign of botulism.Keep in mind that neurological deficits are usually symmetrical. If you have a unilateral facial droop (a droop on one side of your face), then that is more in line with something like a Stroke or Bellâ€™s Palsy.
 Foodborne botulism is often accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting. This is because the toxin has been ingested and often manifests itself in symptoms related to the gastrointestinal system.

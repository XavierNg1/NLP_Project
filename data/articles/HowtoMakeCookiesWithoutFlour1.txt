 Flour acts as a binder to keep your cookies together. To replace flour as a binding agent, replace flour in your recipe with chopped nuts (like pecans, macadamia nuts, or walnuts) or rolled oats. These will bind your other ingredients together and help the cookies hold their shape as they bake.


Try a no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookie or traditional flourless almond cookies.
You could also try baking cookies using a ground nut flour or wheat germ.;
, Whip egg whites and use them as a binder for your cookies. Egg whites give texture to cookies and can make them chewy and crackly on the outside. Meringues and macarons are good examples of flourless cookies that rely on egg whites for body.You could also make mini-Pavlova cookies that are like little meringues. Fill these with fruit, nuts, or chocolate for a simple flourless dessert.
 There are a lot of alternative flours available if you'd like to swap out traditional all-purpose flour for something that's less processed. To replace 1 cup of all-purpose flour in your cookie recipe, use one of the following:3/4 cup of coarse cornmeal
3/4 cup of rice flour
1.5 cups of oat flour

 Do this by slamming a door, clapping your hands, yelling, blowing a whistle, or by banging pots or objects together to create a loud noise. Hopefully, the loud noise will distract your cats and break up the fight., Barriers are helpful because they block the catsâ€™ view of each other. Place a cushion, piece of cardboard, or another barrier-like object in between the cats to obstruct their view of each other. Once the cats have ceased fighting, place them in separate rooms so they can calm down.You may need to slowly reintroduce the cats to each other to prevent a future fight.
 If you put your hands in the middle of two fighting cats, you risk getting scratched or bitten. One or both of they cats may lunge toward your face as well.Additionally, one of the cats may see you and re-direct its anger on you. As a result, their behavior toward you may change even after the fight has ended.
 You can do this by making sure your cats do not have to compete for resources. Each cat should have its own litter box, food bowls, bed, perches, and toys in different areas of the house. Additionally, neutering or spaying your cats may help reduce fighting between them.Reward your cats with praise and treats when they interact in a friendly manner.

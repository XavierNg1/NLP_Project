 Add approximately ¼ cup (59 ml) of apple cider vinegar to a glass spray bottle. The vinegar should fill the bottle halfway.The spray bottle should hold at least 4 ounces (118 ml).
 Once the apple cider vinegar is in the spray bottle, mix in 30 drops of lemon essential oil, 15 drops of lavender essential oil, and 5 drops of tea tree essential oil. The oils will help keep the spray from smelling like apple cider vinegar.Feel free to customize the essential oil blend that you use to suit your personal preference. You can any combination as long as they equal 50 drops. Keep in mind that it’s best to use antibacterial oils, so consider substituting peppermint, eucalyptus, bergamot, oregano, lemongrass, and/or thyme.
 After you’ve added the essential oils to the vinegar, pour ¼ cup (59 ml) of distilled or spring water into the bottle. The bottle should be completely full once the water is added. Shake it well to ensure that all of the ingredients are mixed.If want your deodorant spray to provide extra odor protection, substitute 100 proof or higher vodka for the water.
 When you’re ready to apply the deodorant, spritz the spray 1 to 2 times under each arm. Let the spray air dry on your skin before you get dressed.The deodorant spray will stay fresh for up to a year.

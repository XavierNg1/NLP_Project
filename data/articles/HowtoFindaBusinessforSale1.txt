BizQuest.com. Has over 30,000 listings.
Businessesforsale.com. Has over 50,000 listings for business sales in 130 countries. This is the best site for international sales.
Loop.net. Focuses on large business deals worth several million dollars.
Craigslist. Small businesses in your area might only advertise on Craigslist. Check there if you are interested in buying a local small business.;
, At these websites, you can generally search by industry, location, and price range. You can also narrow down the results based on when the listing was posted., Instead of returning to these business websites every day, you can often set up an email alert. When a business is listed that matches your criteria, youâ€™ll receive an email. To set up alerts, you generally need to create an account with the website.
 These websites often contain quite a bit of information. For example, on BizBuySell, you can find various financial information, such as cash flow, gross revenue, inventory, and real estate value.


At BizBuySell, you can also request a valuation report, which will compare the business to others like it. However, you must pay for this report.

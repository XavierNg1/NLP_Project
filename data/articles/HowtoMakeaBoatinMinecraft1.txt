 You will need five Wood Planks from any wood type, and they don't all have to be from the same type of tree. You can get four Wood Planks from one block of Wood. Blocks of Wood can be obtained from chopping down trees, found in some NPC villages, and occasionally found in mineshafts.;
, Arrange the Wood Planks as follows:


Place three Wood Planks across the bottom three slots of the Crafting grid.
Place one Wood Plank one slot above the bottom-left Plank.
Place the last Wood Plank one slot above the bottom-right Plank.
All other slots should remain empty.
 You can immediately add the Boat to your inventory by dragging it into one of the lower slots or by holding Shift and clicking on it.

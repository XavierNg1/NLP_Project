 Maybe you pass one on your way to work every morning. If you don’t, search the internet, or (if anyone does this anymore) use a phone book to find one. USBC (United States Bowling Congress) has a website that has a Find a Center search engine to help with this., Check out the place. See if you like the atmosphere. Is there a snack and beverage bar that you like in there? Is there a pro shop where you can ask questions to learn more about the game/sport?

, Ask what nights there are leagues on. If you’re competitive or more of a recreational bowler ask which nights those leagues are on. Be able to tell the employee what you typically average on the lanes (if you know), if you have your own ball/shoes, and what your expectations are of joining a league (i.e. a night out with friends, to win some money, to practice your technique and get better).
 Pick a night (or day, if that's preferable) that works best for your schedule or friends’ schedules. It’s always good to have friends sign up with you to add to the commitment but also so you have at least one person you know. Go into the league with the goal to meet new people that share your same interests. Bowling leagues are a great social, competitive atmosphere where you can get some exercise and have fun if your put yourself in the right frame of mind.
 When you pick a night and sign up, make sure you know what you’re committing to. Most leagues run 30 plus weeks from approximately August through April. Some are longer and some are shorter. When you sign up, don’t drop out unless you absolutely have to for an injury or family emergency. There’s nothing worse for the other bowlers to have someone leave the season early and have to bowl unopposed.
 Have fun, be competitive. Enjoy!

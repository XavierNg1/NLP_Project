 Some people only drink milk or coffee in the morning, but adding at least one glass of water will help to increase your hydration in the morning. You can keep a water bottle beside your bed if that makes it easier to remember to drink it.;
, Water bottles are cheap to buy and can be carried to work, to school, or whenever you are away from the house for several hours. Some have marks for reading how many milliliters or fluid ounces of liquid you have, so that you can keep track of how much you have been drinking.


A common recommendation is to drink at least 8 eight ounce glasses of fluid daily, and more if you are exercising or out in the hot weather. However, men need an average of 13 eight ounce glasses of fluid and women need an average of 9 eight ounce glasses of fluid every day.Or, you can also divide your body weight in half and drink that amount of water in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, then you would need to drink 80 ounces of water per day.
 When you are thirsty, your body signals that it already has a lack of fluid. To stay hydrated, you should drink water often enough to keep this from happening. As you age, your thirst receptors will become less effective at sensing your body's need for hydration, so it is a good idea to get into the habit of sipping water throughout the day.
 People who are consuming adequate fluids will have plenty of clear, light yellow urine. On the other hand, those who are dehydrated will have less urine that is a darker yellow as it is more concentrated.
 Caffeine makes your body lose its fluids more rapidly, and sugar in drinks, even orange juice, is not ideal for hydration purposes. Instead, aim to drink more water. Even though water may be less tasty or appealing at the outset, it is better for your body's overall health.

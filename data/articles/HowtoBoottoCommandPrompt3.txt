 Beginning with Windows 95, all Windows OS variations (except Windows 8) have had a start menu. The easiest way to start going about accessing the Command Prompt on the earlier systems is to find the start bar.
 The fastest way to get to your Command Prompt on early Window OSs is to search for the executable directly. Go into your search bar (found on the start menu) and type 'command' into the text bar. From there, you can access the Command Prompt.
 If you're using Win95, press the F8 key while you're getting the 'Starting Windows 95' message. Windows 98 users can reach the same thing by holding down the Ctrl key while your computer is booting up. Next, choose 'Command Prompt Only' from your Startup menu.

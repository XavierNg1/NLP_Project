 Oil will very easily remove the glue used to secure false eyelashes in place, but it also coats the false eyelashes and makes them unusable in the future. As a result, you should only use oil to remove your false eyelashes if you intend on throwing them away afterwards. The most effective types of oil to use are coconut, almond, and baby oil.
 Oil naturally breaks down makeup, easily removing it from your face. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about taking your makeup off prior to removing your lashes, and you don’t have to worry about damaging your false lashes, since you’ll be throwing them out anyway. Splash your eyelids with warm water, and then gently rub the oil onto your eyelids and lash line to remove the makeup. Splash more water onto your lids to remove the makeup and expose your lash line more clearly.
 Use your fingertips or a pair of tweezers to grip the false lashes as close to the lash line as possibly. Starting at the inner corner, gently pull the lashes off from your lid. Work slowly until you reach the outer corner, and the lashes are fully removed.
 When your false eyelashes have been removed, return to your eyelids and check for any remaining glue. Apply a few fresh dabs of oil, and work it into your lash line until the glue comes off.
 Use your favorite facial soap and warm water to clean the rest of your face. Gently rub the soap onto your skin until it lathers, focusing on areas where there is still makeup. Splash warm water onto your face to remove the soap, and use a clean towel to pat your face dry.

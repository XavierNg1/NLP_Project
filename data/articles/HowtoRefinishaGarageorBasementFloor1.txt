 Make sure to get all the corners of the garage or basement floor clean, as well. Use a small paint brush to sweep dirt from corners.;
, If the floor already has a coat of old paint, you will need to rough up the surface. Sand the floor to scuff up the glossy surface, and sweep away all dust and debris.
 Use a floor degreaser to remove all old stains from oil, antifreeze or any other substances on the floor. Rinse the cleaner with water, and let the surface dry thoroughly.
 Put up plastic protective sheet on the walls around the entire floor to protect them from the epoxy coating you will paint on the floor.


Use the duct tape test to make sure the floor is completely clean before painting it. Stick a piece of duct tape to the floor. If there is any dirt on the bottom when you pull it off, sweep and clean it again.

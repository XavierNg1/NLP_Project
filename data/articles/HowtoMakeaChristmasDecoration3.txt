 Line up the wide edge of your dresden ruler to the top of your fabric sheet. Make sure your ruler is positioned all the way to the end of your paper. Use your rotary cutter to cut out a blade in the shape of your dresden ruler. Turn your ruler upside down and lay it on your fabric sheet against the cut you have just made. Cut out another blade. Repeat this until you have twenty uniform blades.You should be able to make three blades for every fabric sheet.
If you want to alternate patterns, make sure you have ten blades of each pattern.
 Lay two of your blades on top of each other facing inward. Use an iron to straighten them out. Use the sewing machine to sew one side of them together. After they are sewn together, open them and iron them flat. Sew ten sets of two blades together. Repeat the process, but this time, sew two sets of two blades together. Keep folding, sewing and ironing until all twenty blades are connected.


Use a quarter inch seam when sewing your blades together.
If youâ€™ve sewed your blades together evenly, there should be hole in the center of them.
 Trace a circle around a coffee up on a piece of cardboard. Cut out your circle from the cardboard. Trace your cardboard circle onto a piece of fabric. Cut out about three fourths of an inch around your circle from your fabric. Hand-sew a running stitch around the outside of the circle in your fabric, flip it over and place the cardboard circle in the center. Pull the thread so that the fabric wraps around the cardboard. Cut the excess thread and iron your centerpiece with the cardboard still in it.


A running stitch is a simple in and out sewing pattern.Make sure your threading is secure so that your centerpiece will keep its shape.
 Fold your center and slide the cardboard out. Hand-sew your center to the hole in the middle of your blades.


Make sure your centerpiece is positioned evenly in the middle of your table topper.

 Stevia is a natural sugar replacement. It's healthier and sweeter than Sweet 'n' Low or Splenda, so you should use it instead of a cheaper version.
 Once it stops being as loud as it was when you started mixing it stop the blender and give it a little shake. Blend it again and then swirl around in it with a spoon to make sure everything is smooth. Taste it. If you're happy with it pour it into two large glasses and enjoy! If you're not go ahead and make any adjustments you want.

 Older pipe anchors come loose over time and may need to be tightened or replaced. Pipes are usually anchored to wood floor joists using metal clamps.


Replace these clamps if they are loose, or add more clamps if the pipes are easily moved. Install anchors every 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) on horizontal pipes and every 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 m) on vertical pipes.;

Wrap a piece of rubber around the pipe and secure the wrapped area to the joist with a metal clip. If you don't have pipe insulating foam, a piece of rubber inner tube or garden hose will work. Do this every 4 feet (1.2 m) along length of the pipe.
Leave room for expansion around the pipe or anchoring mechanism. This is particularly important when insulating plastic pipes.
Avoid galvanized anchors on copper piping. Even small pipe movement can create a lot of noise when metal on metal comes against metal.

 Chances are, you are going to be texting or calling your new partner. However, if you are trying to keep it secret, you may want to use different names in your phone. This way, if someone sees a new text pop up on your lock screen, they won’t see your partner’s real name.The problem with this is that they may ask who this new person you are texting is. You may tell anyone asking that it’s a friend from work or school, or someone you just reconnected with from your past.;
, When keeping your relationship a secret, you can’t just go into town to go to dinner or a movie. Anyone you know may see you. Instead, go to private spots where no one will find you, or go on dates in nearby towns or cities.For example, you may decide to see a movie in the large city near where you live, or decide to drive to a restaurant in a smaller town where neither of you know anyone.
If you live alone, you can have dates where you stay in, order take out, and watch movies. However, if you live near people who know you, they may notice the same car outside your home. They may also recognize your partner’s car in your driveway.
 If you are only hanging out with each other, people are going to suspect that you are together. Instead, hang out with other people at work or school. When you go out to the same places, you should make sure to mingle with other people instead of being obvious by spending time with each other.Don’t spend the entire time staring at your partner or sharing looks with them. This will tip people off that something is going on.
You may want to reduce the temptation to let your feelings show by limiting the amount of time you both go out to the same places or with the same people.

 Make sure the children have their fists outstretched on their tables where they can be easily reached. As the teacher, walk around the classroom and tap one child on the hand. That child will be “it.”


Make sure the child who is “it” does not talk after you have chosen them. You don’t want them to give away their identity to the rest of the class.
You can encourage the kids to behave by saying things like, “I’m only going to choose a student who is being quiet and following all the rules.”

, The student who is “it” will walk around the room and tap six other students on the hand. When a student is picked, that student will get up from their seat and walk to the front of the class. After everyone has chosen, the students in the front of the class will say, “Heads up, seven up!” and all the students at their desks will lift their heads up and open their eyes., Tell them to raise their hands if they think they know which student is “it.” Select one student at a time, and let them tell you their guess. Keep selecting students until someone gets the answer right.


Suspense will build as students are ruled out from being "it" by process of elimination. Be ready to calm your students down if they get overexcited.
You can make the game more fun for the kids by giving a prize to the child that guesses correctly. Let the winner choose one item from a bag filled with assorted candy or small items like pencils and erasers.
 Heads up, seven up is a very popular game and your students will likely want to play it several time. Try to play quite a few rounds so that everyone has chance to participate. Keep track of the children you have already chosen to be “it.” Try to give as many kids a chance to be “it” as you possibly can.


You can also use the game as a reward for good behavior.
Say things like, “If everyone is good today, we’ll play heads up, seven up for the last thirty minutes of class.”

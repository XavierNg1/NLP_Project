 Trailing varieties of Lantana are pretty robust and will tolerate drought but do need plenty of light. They will tolerate a small amount of shade for some of the day but you’ll see them grow leggy (with long stems rather than compact bushy growth) and produce fewer blooms if they aren’t getting enough sun and water.


You can encourage bushy growth to make good ground cover by pinching the plant back. To do this, remove the stem tips just above where each stem branches into two stems. This will encourage more side branches to form.
 Although Trailing Lantana tolerates drought, it will bloom better if it doesn’t get too dry.


Water once or twice a week during dry periods.
 Removing spent flowers will encourage new ones to form so don’t be shy about trimming the bush during the growing season. You should try to trim just above a leaf set.
 Every few years the Trailing Lantana may get a little too woody and overgrown. A vigorous prune to within a foot of the base will usually rejuvenate the plant. Do this over the dormant season in winter or early spring.

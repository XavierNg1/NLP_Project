 This will give you a sense of what being part of a team is like and how to play a real game. It will also give you a chance to interact with other footballers, coaches and teams. Sharing your tips to playing better or running faster never hurts, and someone might even share theirs with you. When you play in a club or team, your chances of getting noticed and scouted by a team are much higher.
 In football you have to take risks, so go for it! You will make silly mistakes sometimes, you will get injured, but that's all part of the learning process. See you on the pitch...

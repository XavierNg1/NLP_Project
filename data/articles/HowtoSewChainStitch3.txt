 This variant on the basic chain stitch actually looks like a real chain. Unlike the method above, we won't start with a basic chain stitch here. Instead, simply bring the needle from the back side of the fabric to the front.
 Next, bring the needle in front of your working thread (the "slack" length of thread that you haven't used yet.) Wrap the working thread one complete turn to form a tight loop around the needle.
 Stick the needle back through the front of the fabric a short distance from where you brought it through. Then, without pulling the thread tight, bring the point of the needle back through the fabric again a short ways down the line.


An easy way to do this is to bring the needle through the fabric at a shallow angle, rather than at a 90-degree angle. This way, you can slip the needle into the fabric and back out again using only the length of the needle, so you won't need to pull on the thread.
 Start pulling the needle to tighten the thread. Make sure the needle travels over the working thread rather than under it. Finally, pull the thread tight.


If you've done everything correctly, at this point you should be left with a stitch that looks like an oval shape or the number 0.
 Though it may not seem like it at first, all you need to do to continue your cable chain stitch is just repeat the steps above. As you lengthen your stitch, you'll eventually get a string of "0s" joined by short "-" segments that resemble the links in a real chain. To recap, for the rest of the stitch, you'll need to:Wrap the working thread around the needle
Scoop up a short length of fabric by putting the needle through the thread and bringing it back through without tightening the thread.
Pull the needle back over the working thread
Pull to tighten.

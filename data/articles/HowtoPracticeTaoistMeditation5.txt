 Take time to relax your entire body and focus gently until the body becomes present to you.
 It can be any colour you like, or you may choose one which has symbolic energy connections. Yellow for example, is useful for a busy mind and the stomach system, white is useful for the breathing system, as well as sorrowful emotions, green is useful for tension or anxiety and the liver system, blue is useful for fear and cleansing the kidney system and finally really red or pink is ideal for the heart system and the happiness & unhappiness emotion.


The colour that arises naturally at the time is usually best and may be symbolic, but it is best not to read into these things, it is a process of healing and complicating it will reduce or stall its effectiveness.
 If you wish, you can sense it as a wave from your head down to your toes, in a body cycle like small universe breathing (above section) or in anyway you like, such as a colour massage.
 As you breathe in, allow the colour to flood to where it is needed, such as an injury or illness, and then as you breathe out, imagine a dark smoke rushing out of your body, or if you are good at imagining, the smoke filling a waste bin.


As you do this, remind yourself that your channels are opening and blockages, toxins and diseases are melting away and leaving your body in the smoke.
 With this meditation, you will usually feel when enough has been done as it no longer feels necessary to continue. At this stage, thank the universe and allow your heart to be filled with a gentle gratitude while you rest for a minute with your eyes closed. Remind yourself with good confidence that your energy channels are open and cleansed and that healing has happened. Then gently move your body, rub your face and head to stimulate energy and open your eyes.

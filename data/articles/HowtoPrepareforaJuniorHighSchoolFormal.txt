 Look around and get something that you honestly like and you are comfortable in (don't get a strapless dress to impress your friends if you are uncomfortable in it). Look on the internet but be sure to search on trustworthy websites such as JCPenney's, Macy's, and Lulu's. Windsor has amazing formal dresses also!;
, Now that you have the dress that you are happy with, you need shoes and accessories. Shoes are a must have and they can make or break your ensemble. Practice walking around in your shoes at home (especially if you plan to wear heels) so you can really work them the night of the formal! Choose wisely and go with something that you know will work. Accessories pull together the outfit and make it look like you're put together. If you are planning on buying new jewelry just for formal, DO NOT buy something expensive (you will only be wearing it for a few hours!). If you do buy new jewelry go somewhere like Claire's or Icing's because they sell nice looking jewelry at a very reasonable price. Dangle earrings are a nice choice along with a corresponding necklace. DO NOT overdo it with jewelry! Keep it subtle, not gaudy.
 You have two choices: a salon or beauty parlor, or doing it at your house. Whatever you choose, DO NOT overdo it. Keep it subtle, remember that you are still young! A natural look is the best way to showcase your real beauty.
 For fancy updos, you can go to a hair stylist, or you can do the hairstyles at home with the help of your relatives. If you're not sure about what hairstyle to try, look through magazines like Seventeen and search the Internet.
 You can either get them at a salon, DIY, or buy the realistic stick on or glue on nails. For a simple look, french tips are a classic. For a more fun look, try a bold, bright color!

, If you get a spray tan, get a light natural glowing shade. Don't make yourself turn out orange!

, Avoid strong or musky fragrances.
 It's also a good idea to carry mints.

 An arithmetic sequence is an ordered series of numbers, in which the change in numbers is constant.This method only works if your set of numbers is an arithmetic sequence.

To determine whether you have an arithmetic sequence, find the difference between the first few and the last few numbers. Ensure that the difference is always the same.

For example, the series 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 is an arithmetic sequence, because the difference between each term is constant (5).
;
, Each number is a term. If there are only a few terms listed, you can count them. Otherwise, if you know the first term, last term, and common difference (the difference between each term) you can  use a formula to find the number of terms. Let this number be represented by the variable n{\displaystyle n}.

For example, if you are calculating the sum of the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, n=5{\displaystyle n=5}, since there are 5 terms in the sequence.
 You need to know both of these numbers in order to calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence. Often the first numbers will be 1, but not always. Let the variable a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} equal the first term in the sequence, and an{\displaystyle a_{n}} equal the last term in the sequence.

For example, in the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 a1=10{\displaystyle a_{1}=10}, and an=30{\displaystyle a_{n}=30}.
 The formula is Sn=n(a1+an2){\displaystyle S_{n}=n({\frac {a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}})}, where Sn{\displaystyle S_{n}} equals the sum of the sequence.Note that this formula is indicating that the sum of the arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms., Make sure you make the correct substitutions. 

For example, if you have 5 terms in your sequence, and 10 is the first term, and 30 is the last term, your formula will look like this: Sn=5(10+302){\displaystyle S_{n}=5({\frac {10+30}{2}})}.
 To do this, add the two numbers, and divide by 2.

For example:Sn=5(402){\displaystyle S_{n}=5({\frac {40}{2}})}Sn=5(20){\displaystyle S_{n}=5(20)}


, This will give you the sum of the arithmetic sequence.

For example: Sn=5(20){\displaystyle S_{n}=5(20)}Sn=100{\displaystyle S_{n}=100}So, the sum of the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 is 100.
 Consider all consecutive integers.

Determine the number of terms (n{\displaystyle n}) in the sequence. Since you are considering all consecutive integers to 500, n=500{\displaystyle n=500}.

Determine the first (a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}) and last (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) terms in the sequence. Since the sequence is 1 to 500, a1=1{\displaystyle a_{1}=1} and an=500{\displaystyle a_{n}=500}.

Find the average of a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and an{\displaystyle a_{n}}: 1+5002=250.5{\displaystyle {\frac {1+500}{2}}=250.5}.

Multiply the average by n{\displaystyle n}: 250.5×500=125,250{\displaystyle 250.5\times 500=125,250}.
 The first term in the sequence is 3. The last term in the sequence is 24. The common difference is 7.

Determine the number of terms (n{\displaystyle n}) in the sequence. Since you begin with 3, end with 24, and go up by 7 each time, the series is 3, 10, 17, 24. (The common difference is the difference between each term in the sequence.)This means that n=4{\displaystyle n=4}

Determine the first (a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}) and last (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) terms in the sequence. Since the sequence is 3 to 24, a1=3{\displaystyle a_{1}=3} and an=24{\displaystyle a_{n}=24}.

Find the average of a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and an{\displaystyle a_{n}}: 3+242=13.5{\displaystyle {\frac {3+24}{2}}=13.5}.

Multiply the average by n{\displaystyle n}: 13.5×4=54{\displaystyle 13.5\times 4=54}.
 Mara saves 5 dollars the first week of the year. For the rest of the year, she increases her weekly savings by 5 dollars every week. How much money does Mara save by the end of the year?

Determine the number of terms (n{\displaystyle n}) in the sequence. Since Mara save for 52 weeks (1 year), n=52{\displaystyle n=52}.

Determine the first (a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}) and last (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) terms in the sequence. The first amount she saves is 5 dollars, so a1=5{\displaystyle a_{1}=5}. To find out the amount she saves the last week of the year, calculate 5×52=260{\displaystyle 5\times 52=260}. So an=260{\displaystyle a_{n}=260}.

Find the average of a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and an{\displaystyle a_{n}}: 5+2602=132.5{\displaystyle {\frac {5+260}{2}}=132.5}.

Multiply the average by n{\displaystyle n}: 135.5×52=6,890{\displaystyle 135.5\times 52=6,890}. So she saves $6,890 by the end of the year.

 You need four bases, although you can use shoes or shirts to designate bases if you don’t have any real bases available. You also need a rubber ball about the size of a basketball. , You do not need to play with an official size field, but you should have enough space to run around and kick the ball. Since people are going to be kicking a rubber ball you should make sure you are not in a place where you will damage anything fragile or valuable. , Ideally you want nine people on your team and eighteen people total. You can’t play kickball by yourself, and it’s generally accepted that you should have at least four people on each team. With fewer people it becomes much harder to play the field or to get people on bases.


Remember to decide who will be on which team.

 From your conversation, you may have learned some things about your wife. Perhaps she told you that her desire to have another child comes from loneliness. Or she may miss when the kids were younger and needed her more. Find ways to help her work through these issues and revisit the conversation about having more kids later.For instance, if she feels lonely, make an effort to come home earlier from work. Spend quality time together each day. Play with your kids together as a couple and mark out family time.
 Though you might feel sure of your decision right now, you may change your mind later. Set a time in the future for you and your wife to discuss having more children if you foresee that you might change your mind.

If you don’t want another child because your children are very young, you could agree to talk about this when your children are in school and more independent.
 There are very few ways to compromise on the issue of having another child. But for example, if your wife is looking for someone to take care of, see if she would be happy with getting a dog, instead. Or offer babysitting services to your friends or family so your wife can get more interaction with infants.Babysitting small children might even change her mind about wanting another baby!

, Be sure to spend time each day appreciating your family. Have family dinners together without electronics on hand. Plan regular weekend outings to the skating rink or bowling alley. Limit your hours working overtime so you don’t miss out on time with those who mean the most.

Is it Important to me?
Does it need Imaginative thinking?;
,


An example is, "I don't have enough money". Basically, you are just saying it. It doesn't encourage thought or ask for answers. An alternative could be:

"How might I get more money?"



, Say what you are doing, instead of what is being done to you.
 Do you sound like you just want to complain or whine? Or do you sound curious and open-minded?

, This allows others to know that you are hoping for some type of response.


We need ways to make more money with arms crossed and toe tapping does not encourage people to step forward with an answer.
 Sometimes when you address a group, whether in person or online, people are less likely to respond. Try one-on-one communication. This shows the person you really do want their opinion.
 For people who are hesitant to give feedback or advice, telling them why you value their perspective helps. Example: "Sarah, I know you went through something similar with your family. I'd really love to know your take on this."

, Sometimes people don't feel comfortable answering because they don't want to tell others what to do. But, if you rephrase it asking what they would do in your shoes, then it becomes about them.

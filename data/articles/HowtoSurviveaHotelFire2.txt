 If you need to get out of the hotel, don't worry about your personal belongings. If you have your hotel keys and flashlight, you've got everything you need. Nothing else is important. Material possessions are not worth sacrificing life and limb for.


If no alarm has sounded, look for a fire alarm and sound it. If your room does not contain a fire alarm, don't move to the hallway just yet simply in order to sound it.
 As soon as you notice signs of fire (including the sound of your smoke detector or a fire alarm), try to stay low. You may not immediately notice smoke, but even a small amount of toxic smoke can incapacitate you. It's best to stay low â€” smoke and heat rises, meaning it will be thicker further from the ground.
 Don't open the door without first feeling it. The back of your hand is very sensitive to heat, and by using it you also won't risk burning your palm or finger tips. If the door or doorknob is hot, the fire is probably right outside. If that's the case, don't open the door.


Even if the door isn't hot, get ready to slam the door quickly shut if you need to. Open the door slowly, just a crack, with a steady hand. The pressure from the fire can force the door open if proper care isn't taken.
 If you are able to make a call, notify the front desk of your whereabouts. If you can't reach the front desk, try to call the fire department or call the local emergency number to let them know where you are. Hang a sheet or article of clothing out the window as a beacon to rescuers.

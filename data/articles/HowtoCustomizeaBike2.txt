 Whether it's a used one online or a new frame from a bike shop you can swap out your frame for something a little more conducive to the speeds of the road like a carbon or aluminum frame that brings durability and lightweight.


You’ll want something light but the size of the frame is most often based on your height and weight.
The weight to shoot for the entire bike itself is under 20 lbs and the frames can help make up a lot of weight. You’ll want to consult someone from your local bike shop if you have any concern about your weight and the durability of a frame.
 Your bikes tires and frame are connected using a fork. Buy one made of carbon to give you that lightweight a road bike needs.
 Road tires are pretty narrow and are not built to withstand the bumps and rough terrain of mountain bikes. You’ll want a road touring or racing tire. There should be a number on the tires to indicate the size. You’ll want something that is a 700 width and should read something like 700x23. The first number is outer diameter of the tire in millimeters and the second number is the actual width of tire itself in millimeters.
Most road bikes use inflatable tubes and the tube can be replaced if your bike requires it in the future.

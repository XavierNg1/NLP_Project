 Going to the center of the map is less time-consuming but your risks of crashing are higher., To start off with, look at the map in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and follow it to where the the four quadrants meet. The snakes you are looking for may not be in the exact center, but should be very close.Â As soon as you see a huge snake, you know you are there., At this point you should still be a small snake so it will be easier to navigate. You don't have to kill any snake just yet, others will do it for you. Once you see a snake nearby being killed, collect some mass so you get longer then leave the center of action. Now you should be a good size but on the outside of the chaos., It's not as plentiful as on the inside, but you can be more careful and in less danger from the outside.,

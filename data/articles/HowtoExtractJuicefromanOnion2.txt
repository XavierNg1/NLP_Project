 You need a container with sides, but the mouth must be wide enough for you to fit a box grater, also called a cheese grater or flat bottomed grater, and at least one of your hands inside since you will need to grate the onion inside it.
 Press down on the grater using even pressure to keep it steady, preventing it from sliding around as you attempt to grate the onion.
 Grab the rounded end of the onion, if left intact, with your free hand. Press the flat end that once attached to the root to the top of the fine side of the grater. Move the onion in a downward motion over the holes to grate it. Continue to press the onion against the grater, moving it up and down over the holes, until you have grated the entire onion.
 This bowl should have higher sides but must have a wide enough mouth to accommodate the entire diameter of the strainer. If possible, rest the strainer over the lip of the bowl. If the strainer is too small, however, hold it with your hand.
 Place the grated pulp from the other container into a fine mesh strainer. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to push the pulp into the strainer, separating most of the juice while keep the majority of the solid pulp out of the second bowl. Continue pressing until most of the juice has been separated, but do not press so much that you begin pushing the pulp through the strainer.
 Place the pulp into the center of the cheesecloth and bring all the corners of the cloth together, effectively wrapping the pulp inside. Push down on the pulp to squeeze out more juice into the second bowl. Continue pressing and pushing until no further juice drips out.

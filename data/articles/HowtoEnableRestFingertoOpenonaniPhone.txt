 Although the methods where you had to slide a slider bar to get into your phone are history once you update to iOS 10, tapping the home button twice will allow you a chance to get into your device so you can configure these settings.;
, Once you have enabled the feature, it'll remind you that one finger must be set up for this trigger to work.


If your device doesn't support TouchID, at this time there isn't a workaround. You can contact Apple to let them know why you don't feel tapping the Home button twice is ideal!

, It looks like a grey gear icon.
, You'll be using some of their accessibility functions for this workaround.
 On an iPhone 6 or newer device, you shouldn't need to scroll as it should be on the screen already.
 Your phone will not require pressing the Home Button to unlock. The words "Press home to open" may still appear, but you will only need to rest your finger if you have Touch ID enabled.
 Tap the "Accessibility" option near the top left corner of the screen.
 Put your device to sleep, then seconds later try to unlock your device using TouchID using the feature. With this workaround in place, you can use TouchID similar to how you used it in past iOS versions.

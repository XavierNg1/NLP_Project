,, Here's a picture (outlined areas are copied, yellow filled areas are series, open-ended outlined areas may be from series -- I forget. Not all have been tried, so if you find a discrepancy, please report back to us all-- thanks. They should be close though.) I suggest the table be entered in cell range T1:W103. Define Name LOOKSTER as the  range T3:W103 and LOOKSTER2 as the range U3:W103 in that case.

 Escape for a few moments to the corner coffee shop and indulge in a hot chocolate or tea. Sit on the beach with your favorite book. Grab your iPod or an audiobook and go for a long nature walk. In the evening, take a candle lit bath. Feel free to treat yourself to something that makes you feel good, and is good for baby.


Do things you might not be able to do for a while once your baby comes. For example, a trip to the movies won't be possible without a babysitter, so take advantage of this time.;
, The last month of pregnancy is often taxing: emotionally, mentally and physically. Take time to sit in a peaceful place and relax, releasing your concerns and focusing on the positives. When you can, close your eyes and give your body the much needed sleep it is craving at this time.
 Many spas have packages specifically designed for expecting mothers. Pregnancy can cause major stress on the mind and body, and the better your body feels, the better your mindset and overall well-being.Make sure you choose a reputable spa that is properly licensed and with certified staff members.
 If you have trouble sleeping, you may enjoy picking up a good book to help you unwind. This is the perfect time to dive into a great book because once baby arrives, you may not get a chance to read.
 No matter how uncomfortable or painful it may be, it only lasts for a short time. Remind yourself that most of your pregnancy is behind you now, and soon you'll have a new baby in your arms, and life will never be quite the same.
 Being pregnant doesn't mean you are disabled or can't take care of yourself, but you can still allow others to dote on you. Skip heavy, strenuous house chores or complicated dinners. Let your family and friends make you dinner, clean your house, or do your laundry. Pretty soon, you will be taking care of not only you, but another person around the clock, and it may be more difficult to get these things done.

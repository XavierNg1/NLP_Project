 Sit down and then engage your abs by pulling them inward towards your back. Then use your abs to gently lower yourself on to your back. Keep your back as flat to the floor as you can. This will help you do the dead bug in the most efficient and effective way.Rotate your pelvis downward and squeeze your glutes, which can help you get your back flat.For your back to be flat against the floor, you shouldn’t be able to get a hand in between your back and the ground.;
, Raise your arms toward the ceiling. They should be in a straight line, with your wrists and hands directly above your shoulders. This will allow you to perform the dead bug correctly and minimize your risk of injury., Bend your legs so that your knees are above your hips and thighs. Keep your abs and core engaged as you slowly lift your feet off the floor. Continue to use your abs and core to raise your bent legs so they are in a 90-degree angle. Your knees should be directly above your hips, forming a straight line with your thighs., Choose an arm to lower first. Keeping your abs engaged, lower it and the opposite leg at the same time. Bring your arm and leg to just above the floor and return to the starting position. Move slowly to ensure that you engage the proper muscles and don’t use momentum. This also keeps you from raising your back off of the floor., Once you’ve finished your first arm and leg, lift and lower the other side. This ensures that you develop both sides of your abs and core evenly., Gradually work yourself up to three sets of five or ten reps of the dead bug. You may only be able to perform one to start or do reps until your abs start shaking because they’re tired. Build onto your current sets as you are able.

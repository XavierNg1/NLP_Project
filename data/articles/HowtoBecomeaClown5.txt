 In addition to clown college, you might find it beneficial to enroll in circus school. Circus school will give you a background in a number of different disciplines, including aerial arts, ground skills, physical theatre, and dance.You might find these skills useful as a clown who plans to audition for the circus.
 Try to get some more minor gigs--like birthday parties or festivals--before you audition for the circus. Practice your skills and performance.In particular, circuses look for a good sense of body language, comedic timing, improvisation, and special skills, such as gymnastics or juggling.Every circus will look for a different amount of experience and slightly different skills.
 If you choose to join the circus, you will need to travel with the circus, wherever it goes. Make sure your family knows about your plans. Make arrangements for any pets that you have. Determine if you want to keep paying rent or terminate your lease.
 Look online to find job openings at different circuses. Look into the big circuses, such as Cirque du Soleil and the Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey, but also don’t be afraid to begin your career with a smaller circus. If you've taken classes or known other clowns, ask them if they know of upcoming job opportunities. Apply for every job you think you could do. Although there are many job openings in circus careers, having options is still good.If you have trouble getting auditions or don’t get a job offer, take classes and add more clowning skills to your repertoire.

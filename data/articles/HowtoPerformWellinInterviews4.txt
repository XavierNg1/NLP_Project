 It’s a bit of a cliché, but that’s not to say that this question is never asked. The trick here is to turn your weakness into a positive:


“I always lacked confidence so I joined a public speaking course two years ago”
“I can be obsessive about detail but a little bit of that can go a long way.”
“I sometimes struggle to let go of a project I’ve worked hard on when it’s time to hand over to others”
It can be a tight-rope walk answering this sort of question without sounding smarmy so have a good think and make sure your answer really reflects who you are. If your weakness-to-strength story is a real one from your life you will sound sincere and open.

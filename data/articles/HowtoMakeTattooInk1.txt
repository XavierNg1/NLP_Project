 In order for wood ashes to work well as a tattoo ink, you need to completely burn the wood you’re using. The ashes should be totally black, with none of the wood’s natural color still visible. They should also be completely cooled when you use them.Different types of wood will give you a slightly different shades of color when the ashes are used as ink. Lighter woods will produce a grayer pigment; darker woods will produce a blacker pigment.;
, Once you’ve burned the wood of your choice to create ashes, you’ll need to grind the burned wood. You want the ash particles as fine as possible so that they make a smooth and easily usable ink.
 To create tattoo ink from wood ashes, you’ll need to mix the ashes with a liquid. Some people recommend that you use distilled water, but this still risks some bacteria getting under your skin as you press the needle in. Instead, use a clear spirit – like vodka or gin – as your liquid base. The alcohol will kill any bacteria and the clarity of the alcohol won’t change your ink color., Mix your ashes and clear spirit together by blending them in a blender for 10 to 20 minutes. The consistency should be a slurry – a little thicker than water, but thinner than a paste – and should not have any chunks in it.It’s hard to recommend an exact proportion of ashes to liquid for this, since it will depend on how finely you grind up the ashes, the type of wood you use, and the desired pigmentation of your ink. It’s better to add liquid slowly – you can always add more, but you can’t take any out.
 If you’re creating a larger tattoo, make sure you track the ash and liquid amounts you’re using. You’ll likely have to mix up more than one batch of ink, and knowing the exact measurements keeps the pigment of the ink consistent.

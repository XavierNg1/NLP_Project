 Prepare two baking trays (sheets) by lining with baking (parchment) paper or a silicone baking sheet.
 Beat until a soft, creamy and light mixture forms., Continue beating until the ingredients are well combined., Fold until the mixture is smooth., Place the cornflakes into a food-grade plastic bag. Place down on a work surface. Lightly crush them using either your hands or a rolling pin. They should still have large pieces in them, so do this very gently., This is in readiness for coating the cookies. Take a tablespoon of cookie batter and roll into a small ball. Then gently roll the cookie ball in the crushed cornflakes until well coated., Keep sufficient space between each ball to allow for spread during baking., Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden in colour., Let sit on the tray for 5 minutes, then place the cookies onto the wire cooling rack to cool completely. When cooled, the cookies are ready for serving.

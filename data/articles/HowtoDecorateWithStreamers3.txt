 You can hang streamers from just about any surface—all you need is some scotch tape. Hang a row of streamers across the top of a doorway or window. Alternatively, you may hang streamers along the front of a table or the back of a chair.
 Tape one end of the streamer to a surface, like a table or a wall. Loosely run the streamer across the surface. As you go, periodically tape the streamer to the surface itself to create a “U” shaped drape., Tape the streamer to one end of the banister or railing. Wrap the streamer tightly around the banister or railing until the entire length is covered. Cut the streamer from the roll and tape the end in place.

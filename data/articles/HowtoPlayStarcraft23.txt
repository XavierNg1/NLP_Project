 Buildings that take damage can eventually collapsed if left untreated. To repair a building, select an SCV, then right-click a damaged building. Assign more SCVs to repair a building to patch it up quicker.
 An SCV must continue working on a building in order to construct it. However, you can order the SCV to retreat if it comes under attack. Simply select the SCV, then press Escape. The SCV will halt construction and can be moved around. When you're ready to finish the building, select any SCV, then right-click the building.
 Supply Depots increase your supply, but you can also use them as makeshift bulwarks. If the only way into your base by ground is through a chokepoint, build two or three supply depots side by side, then build a Bunker behind the Depots and fill it with marines. Any hostile units will have to tear down your Supply Depots to reach the marines firing at them from the safety of the bunker.
 Medivacs serve two purposes: they shuttle units in and out of battle, and they automatically heal wounded units within a certain radius. Build two or three and include them in each group of combat units you create.


Load units into a Medivac by selecting up to eight units, then right-click the Medivac.
The fastest way to defeat your opponents is to cut off their income channels. Load combat units into a Medivac and fly around the perimeter of an enemy base until you spot their line of workers harvesting minerals. Drop your units right in their midst by selecting the Medivac, right-clicking the ground near a mineral patch, and clicking Unload.
 Use one SCV to scout the map until you find an enemy base. Don't go inside. Instead, construct a Barracks, pump out Marines, and send groups of four to five into the base. You may not claim victory, but at the very least, you'll pose a distraction.

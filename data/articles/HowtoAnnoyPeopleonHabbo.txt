 Your social status on Habbo is ruined if you go about on your real account annoying everybody. Make a new account and call it something noobish, like coolboy165243 or hotgurl829456. If you're using numbers at the end write your user name on a piece of paper.;
, Completely disobey the rule of looking good when you arent HC. For the ladies, use bacon hair, the bunny slippers and wear pink a lot (that colour's overused). For men, dress up as a gangster, with a hoodie, bling and sneakers.
 Go for something overused and just plain stupid. Like 'Ouch, you clicked too hard' and 'I am da gangsta babez'. Be creative, no-one's going to know it's you!

, and 'Aren't I the coolest?'. They will get so frustrated they will leave the room and delete you from their contact list. Or you can act like a real newbie and then when they're gone message them stupid stuff. Victim number one - mission complete!

, Dance in the middle of the lounge dancing and move to HC's and call them a noob repeatedly. Keep friend requesting them and insulting them.
 Block doors, say stuff like '(username) has a big head' and say LOL to everything people are saying, even if they're talking about Barack Obama.
 It lags up the game and will annoy people. If a Habbo asks you to stop your noobish dancing, say 'HOW?' or 'I CAN'T!' or even better... 'LOL!'.
 This just annoys everyone. It'll be so bad people will yell at you and have trouble with what you are saying. ls dnt s ny vowels s ths wll bg vryn (Also don't use any vowels as this bugs everyone). If you want to be yelled at type like this.
 Ask stuff like 'Where's the space bar?" (while clearly using the space bar) or "OI YOU (username)! Where did you put my orange juice?'. Be utterly nuts.
 Ask random crap like; "Did you eat my burger?" or even just spam the chat with rude words. You can't get banned by these as far as I know.

 If your computer doesn't have a card reader, you can purchase an external adapter that connects via USB.


MicroSD cards will likely need to be inserted into an SD card adapter to fit into most conventional SD card slots.
Most Macs support SDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity) cards in the same card reader and without extra software installation. This is because SDXC uses the exFAT file system, which is built-in to OS X.
 Your SD card will be automatically mounted and an icon for it will appear on the desktop.
 You can move files around just like you would in any other folder. Copying content to and from your computer will take longer than moving files between folders on your computer.
 Some SD cards have physical locks on them that prevent the data from being modified. You can find the lock on the left edge of the SD card when you're looking at it from the front.


If the lock is broken, click here for instructions on fixing the card.
 If your SD card is not functioning properly or OS X can't open it, you may need to format it into a file system that is recognized. Formatting will erase all of the data on the card, so make sure that you don't have anything on it that you want to save.


Open the Utilities folder in your Applications folder. You can also click "Go" â†’ "Utilities" on newer versions of OS X.
Select your SD card from the left menu.
Click the "Erase" tab.
Select "FAT32" from the Format menu.
Click Erase.
 Formatting your SD card using the Windows Format tool can occasionally lead to poor performance or less available space. The SD Association offers a free tool that you can download from their website (sdcard.org/downloads).


This tool is necessary if you are formatting an SDXC card.

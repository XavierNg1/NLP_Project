 It's best to have plenty of light when putting on your makeup, especially if you're trying to conceal a pimple, as you need to be able to see it from every angle. Make sure you have plenty of light before starting., A primer goes under concealer to help hide the blemish.Pick a yellow or green primer, as it counteracts the redness., Use a concealer brush to dab primer over your pimple. Apply just enough to cover the pimple, as too much will draw attention to it rather than covering it. Use your finger to smooth it out.








You can also use a cotton swab if you don't have a concealer brush.
 Next, use a concealer that's close to your skin tone. Use the concealer brush to dab some on top of the pimple. Once again, add just enough to cover the pimple.








When purchasing a concealer, test it on the back of your hand or the back of your jawbone to make sure the tone matches. An emollient-based concealer will help moisturize your skin while hiding the pimple.
Remember that you may need a different concealer in the winter than in the summer, especially if you enjoy being out in the sun in the summer. You can blend the two in spring and fall., Make sure the concealer is blended into you skin. Gently go around it with your finger to rub the perimeter into the rest of your skin.
 A powder helps set the makeup so it stays on all day. Apply the powder on top of the other makeup using a puff. Press down gently, but don't rub it.

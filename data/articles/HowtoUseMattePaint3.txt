 The majority of matte finishes used for a car are semi-gloss, so this is a versatile option that should work well. This type of finish does give your car a slight shine, like other semi-gloss finishes, but reflects significantly less light. Your car may look a little polished, but it will not be a bold or flashy look.If you go the semi-gloss route, be careful when waxing your car in the future. Traditional wax can harm a semi-gloss finish, so go for waxes specifically designed to be used on matte paint.
 Satin paint is a type of matte finish that has a subtler effect than semi-gloss options. It reflects even less light. This can be a good option if you want something very played down.Usually, satin finishes are done in black. However, you can apply them in other colors if you really want to, but it may be more difficult to find colorful satin paints.
 A single-stage matte paint is applied without a clear coat on top. While this can save some time and money, it provides less protection from dust and damage. Dual or multi-stage matte paints are covered with a clear coat that shields your car from potential damage. In general, they're easier to maintain and provide more protection than other single-stage paints., A double-stage matte paint is usually sufficient to give your car gloss while protecting it from damage. Multi-stage paints aren't necessary for protection and are primarily used for aesthetic purposes, such as creating bolder colors. Unless you want a very bold look, a double-stage matte paint should be sufficient. This will save time and money.

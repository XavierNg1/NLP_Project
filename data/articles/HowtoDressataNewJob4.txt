 It can be a button-down or pull-over style, but it should still look fitted and keep your cleavage hidden. Knit and cotton blouses work well, but most materials will be fine as long as the blouse itself is cut in a flattering style.
 Suit jackets may look a little too dressy for business casual settings, but a fitted cardigan in a nice material can keep you looking appropriately clean-cut.
 Fitted knit sweaters can look feminine and professional at the same time, but you should avoid seasonal patterns and oversized sweaters.
 Pencil and A-line skirts still work best here, but you have more freedom to play with color and pattern than you have for a traditional business dress code.
 There are a wide variety of office-appropriate dresses available on the market. In general, you should look for one with a knee-length skirt and a neckline that does not expose any cleavage. Opt for solid colors and simple patterns, and look for structured materials that give your style shape and form.
 Stick with trouser-style legs and avoid skinny styles that taper off below the knee. Dark corduroy pants may also work for many offices, but you should wait until you have a firm grasp of the office dress code before attempting it.
 You can play with color some, but you should still avoid shimmery metallic shoes or sexy, strappy designs. Closed-toe shoes still work best.
 A belt across your blouse or a simple pendant necklace can look fashionable without going over the top.

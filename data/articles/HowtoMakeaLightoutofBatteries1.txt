 You can use a light bulb or small light fixture for this. Also, electrical tape is preferred, but any other kind will work.D battery
Insulated wire cable (2 3” pieces)
Light bulb
Electrical tape
Scissors;
, Using your scissors, strip 1/2” of insulation off of each end of your wire. Do this on both pieces of wire. Be careful not to cut through the wire.
 Tape one end of your wire onto the negative side of your D battery.
 Now that you have a wire attached to your battery, take that same wire and touch the other end to your light bulb. Take the second piece of wire and touch it to your light bulb. Tape these pieces down.
 Take your second piece of cable (with the exposed end) and attach it to the other side of your battery. This should be the positive side of the battery. When you touch the wire to the surface of your battery, it should light up. This is because the electrons flow out of the negative terminal of your battery, through the bulb, and back into the positive side. This creates a circuit that causes the bulb to light up.

 Make sure the vents are not blocked. Check to see if any insulation in the attic is wet or damaged. If the insulation is damp, remove it immediately. Inspect and repair any visible leaks in the attic or on the ceilings in the house.;
, If the attic is not insulated, or has wet insulation that needs to be removed, purchase insulation for the entire attic, including the ceiling and the floors. Loose-fill or batt insulation will provide consistent coverage. Ensuring the attic's temperature is maintained and cool will allow the snow to melt evenly on eaves and gutters. Check with area home builders or contractors for advice on how much insulation is needed for your particular home and climate.
 Purchase a set of tape or cables that include electric heating wires. String these along the roof just above the gutters. The heat tapes will also help the snow to melt, and will prevent water from backing up into the roof. These can be found at any hardware or home improvement store.
 If the gutters can be safely reached, use a broom to sweep snow off the gutters to prevent icing. Hire a professional to remove snow from the roof to avoid accidents.
 If icing does begin to develop in the gutters, sprinkle some rock salt on top of it. The salt will begin to de-ice the gutters.
 Use a waterproof sealant around electrical cables and vent pipes to stop water.

 The difference in how vowels are pronounced is what often makes languages sound very different. Pronouncing vowels correctly will allow you to be more easily understood by other speakers. It is important to note that German has three vowels which are not present in English.


a - sounds like “ah”
e - sounds like “eh”
i - sounds like “eee”
o - sounds like “oh”
u - sounds like “oo”
ö - sounds somewhat like “oo-uh”, very like on the “uh”
ä - sounds like short “eh”, like in melon
ü - no English equivalent but it sounds somewhat like “oo”, or the middle sound in the word “ewww”
These last three letters with the umlaut can also be written as oe, ae, and ue. Don’t get confused.
 German consonants are not very different from those in English, but there are some noticeable differences which you will want to be aware of if you want to be understood.


w - sounds like “v”
v - sounds like “f”
z -sounds like “ts”
j - sounds like “y”
ß - sounds like “ss”

, As in English, there are letters which sound different when placed in conjunction. You will need to be able to recognize these and pronounce them correctly if you wish to be understood.


au - sounds like “ow”, as in English “brown”.
eu - sounds like “oy” or “oi”, as in English “toy”.
ie - sounds like “eee” or “ea”, as in English “tea”.
ei - sounds like English “eye”.
ch - there is no English equivalent. This is a guttural sound, which sounds vaguely like an “h”.
st - sounds like “sht”. The “sh” is made with your lips further outward than in English, like you are blowing out candles. Your mouth muscles should be much more rigid and tight than when making the English “sh”. The t is pronounced normally.
pf - both sounds are pronounced, but the p is nearly silent.
sch - sounds like “sh”.
qu - sounds like “kv”.
th - sounds like “t” (the h is silent).

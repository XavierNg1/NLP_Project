 This wrap is ideal for babies that are 5 months and older. Locate the piece of fabric that is closest to your body. This is the side that you will hold your baby. Shift the fabric so that one “X” is on the side of your body instead of crossing over the front., Gently pull one of the baby’s legs through the hole of the shoulder section that is closest to you. Spread the fabric over the baby’s shoulders, back, and bottom, reaching to the hollows of the baby’s knees., Pull both of the baby’s legs through the section with the logo. Pull up the fabric over the baby’s back and bottom. The baby should now be propped up on your hip comfortably.

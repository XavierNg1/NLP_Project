If you need the image to hang to the left, add "style='float:left'" to the tag, as in "img style='float:right'" within the "<>" symbols.
If you need the image to hang to the right, add "style='float:right'" to the tag, as in "img style='float:right'" within the "<>" symbols.
If you need the image to hang in the center, the code gets a bit more complicated. There is not "float:center" property, so you have to add the work-around "style='align:center;text-align:center'" to the tag, as in "img style='align:center;text-align:center'" again within the "<>" symbols.

 If you are an employee or student, then your company or university may provide VPN access. Consult with employee or student services about obtaining access to such an account.
 Consider the kind of security, privacy, amount of bandwidth needed, whether you require exit servers in other countries, platform needed, whether you'll need customer service, and how much you'll want to pay. Read more about each of these in the "Tips" section at the bottom of this article.
 If you are purchasing a VPN service from a VPN provider, then you may need to pay for your new service. After signing up and paying (or verifying that your employer or university does provide such a service), the provider should give you information that will allow you to access your VPN such as a username, password, and IP or server name. You can use one of the methods below to connect to your VPN.

 The most effective time to reseed a weedy lawn is early fall when warm days and cool nights provide a good environment for grass seed germination.


If you cannot reseed your lawn in the fall, you can also reseed it in the spring. Summer and winter months are not ideal for reseeding.;
, You can have your soil tested by a local Extension Office or garden center about one month before reseeding. Ask them to determine the pH of the soil and nutrient levels. This will reveal any problems with the soil that may have contributed to the weed problem.If you do not want to go to a garden center, you can also determine the pH yourself.

 Good soil preparation is an important step in the reseeding process. Remove the weeds first using a post-emergent weed killer. In general, reseeding can be done about six weeks after applying a weed killer, but this varies, depending on which herbicide is used.


Select an herbicide that will kill the weeds growing in the lawn and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations carefully.
 Mow the remaining grass to a height of ¾ inch, using a catcher on the mower to catch the grass clippings.Cutting the grass this short will help for the seeds to take root and grow.
 A dethatching machine or power rake can be rented from an equipment rental company, which is the easier way to go, or it can be done by hand with a dethatching rake.
 If the pH of your lawn was off and led to weed growth, you will likely have to add some soil amendments to your lawn to keep the weeds from coming back.


Soil amendments will make your lawn either more acidic or more alkaline, depending on where you live and what weeds you are dealing with.
 Use a broadcast spreader to apply starter fertilizer over the lawn. This fertilizer will help your new seeds to grow strong and healthy. You should spread the fertilizer at the rate of 20 pounds per 1,000 square feet.The fertilizer should have one of the following ratios:


10-5-5.
10-6-4.
16-8-8.

 While you’re running, on an elliptical machine, or doing whatever exercise you do, work on a group of five words. Say them over and over to yourself and think about them as you work through the rhythm of your workout. Do the first one from your flashcard, and then repeat the word and definition without it 10-20 more times., If you’re really have a tough time remembering some of the words, you could make up different gestures to go with each word. The gesture you choose might have something to do with the meaning, but it could also be tied to the rhythm of the word, the number of syllables, or how it sounds. Find the gesture that most accurately mimics the word for you. Keep doing it over and over with your word.


Try kicks or jumps for the syllable with the most emphasis.
Try hand gestures or head motions for the syllables that aren't emphasized.
 Sometimes you need to get out of your comfort zone and do something different to help yourself remember the words. If you normally work at a desk, choose a different place in your study area to sit cross-legged on the floor. In that position, think about one word that you want to remember. Focus on that word and its definition. Repeat 10-20 times. For the next word, find a different position – standing by the window, sitting against the wall, leaning against the door – the position doesn’t matter. What matters is that then hopefully you will associate that word with being in that place and that position and remember the word.

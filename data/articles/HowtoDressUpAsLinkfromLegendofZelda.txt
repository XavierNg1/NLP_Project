 There are over 10 different Links in the series, so this may be a tough choice. The most recognizable Link is the one from Ocarina of Time. Check the Tips section for ideas on how to cosplay as Link from a different game.;
, If you cannot find one, a green wizard hat may work too. If you have any spare fabric, measure your head and cut 2 long triangles. Then sew the fabrics to make a hat. If you're wearing a wig, measure them too.
 If you don't have one, you can use a non-collared shirt and sew a collar on.
 You can get a tunic pattern from a fabric store and modify it or use an over sized t-shirt as a pattern. If you're going as the Twilight Princess Link, make a bigger tunic from fabric that looks like chainmail.
,, You can also sew gloves from leather too.
 Tight spandex pants work best.
 Also remember that Link has long hair (for a guy anyway). The Twilight Princess and the Skyward Sword Link has short blond hair.
 Elf ears can be bought from a costume store too.
 You may have to modify it, if it doesn't look like the boots that Link wears.
 The shield can be made with wood, and the sword with wood and duct tape. You can also use Fun Foam to make the Master Sword and shield.
 And you're Link! Protect Zelda from Ganondorf!

 You can take out the funnel or cup holder as well, or you can leave them in. Leaving the funnel or cup holder inside will help guide the vinegar/cleaning solution into the exit spout and prevent any spills., If there is a water filter inside, take it out and set it aside.
 You will need to let any cleaning solution sit in the larger Keurigs for a long time, and the brewer will need to be on during this time.

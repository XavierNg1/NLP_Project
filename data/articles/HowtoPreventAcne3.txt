 Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that cause acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but studies show that benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions while being less irritating to the skin.Additionally, benzoyl peroxide helps peel away layers of dead skin on the epidermis, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated skin in its place.
 Like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid kills bacteria responsible for pimple growth. It also causes skin cells to shed more rapidly, promoting the growth of new skin. Put small amounts of salicylic acid onto affected areas before you go asleep, after you have washed your face.
 While this is not specifically bottled for acne, it is a very effective home remedy. Tea tree oil has anti-inflammatory properties that can make the redness and size of pimples less noticeable.In one study, tea tree oil proved to be just as effective as benzoyl peroxide in reducing inflamed lesions of acne patients.Because tea tree oil is very strong, dilute it first in a little bit of water before applying to the skin with a Q-Tip or similar instrument. Too much tea tree oil may irritate skin.
 A dermatologist is trained to spot and treat skin disorders. The doctor may recommend a prescription containing clindamycin phosphate or benzoyl peroxide, both very popular acne deterrents. Prescription strength medicines are often much stronger than solutions you can buy over the counter.
 Manuka honey is another natural remedy that many people find very effective for acne, while also being exceptionally gentle on skin compared to most other acne treatments. It has potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, it helps reduce and prevent scarring, and it helps soothe and hydrate the skin, too. You can use it as your face wash (but if you need to wash off makeup, you'll need to use an actual soap or cleanser first), as a mask, and/or as a spot treatment.

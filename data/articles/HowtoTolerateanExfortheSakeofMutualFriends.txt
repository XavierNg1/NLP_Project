 This will help make sure you're probably over him or her.;
, Either throw it out, or pack it in a box and store it away.
 It's already unhealthy enough as it is to Facebook or Instagram or whatever you use to stalk them, before or during a relationship. Yes, many people do this but tracking their moves still proves you're not over them, no matter how much you tell yourself you're not. It's like taking a step back instead of forward.
Â Avoid awkward handshakes or hugs. Depending on how the relationship ended, try to be the bigger person.
 If you don't they will suspect that you're trying to avoid a conversation of some type.
 Your ex is still a person and it's still considered rude to check your phone.
 That is the number one thing to do. Show them you're the bigger person. You're happy without them. You're not sobbing your eyes out (regardless of the fact that you might have been doing that for months) and eating through hundreds of ice cream tubs.
 Confidence is key. Make a conversation. Engage with them, just as if you're making a new friend even though you've probably kissed them and slept with them.
 Honestly, try to avoid doing it most of the time unless you guys are in a really good place. Even if you guys are on a good level, still try not to text them a lot. It will drag you right back into the relationship.
 Basically, it's to forget the former intimate relationship and to be basic friends and nothing else. Don't get all awkward when someone brings them up in a conversation.
 You might get a little obsessed.

 Are you looking for a more unique entrance? Consider having a theme instead of just the traditional entrance. If your wedding has a theme, you could go with that. Or, you could create a separate theme for the entrance.Maybe you are huge sports fans. Many fans of the University of Nebraska football team choose to enter to the team’s “Tunnel Walk.”
If you are really into Hollywood glamour, you could make the entrance a red carpet style announcement and encourage people to snap lots of photos.
 Don’t feel like you have to be tied to the traditional wedding party entrance. This is your wedding reception, and you should feel free to do it however you like. Maybe you would like to enter first with your new spouse. Then you can join the guests in cheering on the wedding party.You could also choose to have the bridesmaids enter as a group, and then the groomsmen, instead of in pairs.
 Some fun dance moves can help your bridal party’s entrance really stand out. Traditionally, members of the group walk in. Ask your party to learn a few easy steps to get the party going.For example, if you choose a song by Michael Jackson, ask the groomsmen to try to moonwalk.
A song by Donna Summer might inspire you to teach the crew a few disco moves.
Respect your wedding party. If your friends don’t feel comfortable learning complicated steps, don’t force the issue. You don’t want them (and the rest of your guests) to feel uncomfortable., Generally, each pair in the wedding party walks or dances in to the same song. Mix things up by changing the music for each pair or person. For example, let your Irish cousins lead the way by dancing an Irish jig.You could also consider letting each person or pair choose their own music. This is a great way to allow your friends to express their individuality.

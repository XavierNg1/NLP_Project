 These notches will be used to string the bow. They only need to be deep enough to hold the string in place.


Be sure not to cut all the way into the outside of the bow.
 Tie loops to both ends of a length of nylon. The bowstring should be 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2Â cm) from the handhold when the bow is complete.


Bend the bow and loop the nylon onto each notch.
Do not pull back on the string yet, the bow is not complete and could break.
 Rest the bow on the center handhold, with the string perpendicular to the ground.


Use a tree branch or a piece of scrap wood to hang the bow from.
 Check and see how the bow bends. Ideally, both sides will bend the same, at the same angle.


Make adjustments by removing wood from the inside of the bow where it is not bending enough
Continue to make adjustments and pull the string back a bit more each time. Do this until you reach the draw length. Your draw length is the distance from the string at rest to your upper chin. This is how far back you would pull to shoot.

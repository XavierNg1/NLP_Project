 In this variation of 21 Dares, players spin the bottle instead of counting from 1 to 21. You may play 21 Dares: Spin-the-Bottle Edition with a big group of strangers or a tiny gathering of close friends. Grab an empty bottle and take a seat in a circle.


If you don’t have a bottle, use a pen or cup instead.
 Place the bottle in the center of the circle and have one player spin it. Wait for the bottle to stop spinning on its own. The player the bottom of the bottle points at must come up with a truth, dare, or situation; The player the top of the bottle points at must answer the question or complete the dare. If the player refuses to answer the question or complete the dare, then they are out of the game. If you complete the dare, share the truth, or answer a situational question, you will remain in the game.


Truth: Ask the player a question which they must answer honestly.
Dare: Challenge the player to complete a specific task.
Situation: Give the player a situation with four distinct options. “Who is your least favorite teacher: Mr. Smith, Mrs. Gomez, Ms. Bell, or Mr. Patent?” “Would you rather kiss Johnny, Bill, Gil, or Xavier?” “Which celebrity would you want to date: Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Schumer, Kim Kardashian, or Rooney Mara?”, Continue to take turns spinning the bottle. Challenge each other to fun dares, ask challenging questions, and pose zany situations. Keep spinning the bottle until only one player remains, people get bored, or it is time to move on to the next game.

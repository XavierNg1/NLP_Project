 Line a deep, rectangular baking pan with aluminum foil, then grease with cooking spray or butter. It will be easy to cut the cake into whatever shape you like, but you can use specially shaped containers if you prefer.

You can skip the foil, but the cake may stick to the pan.;
, Melt 3 tbsp (45 g) butter over low heat. Use a heavy-bottomed frying pan or skillet.



Or combine butter and marshmallows in a large bowl, then microwave. Microwave in three 1-minute bursts, stirring in between., Pour in 5 cups (250 g) mini marshmallows. Continue to heat and stir until they have melted completely.


Skip this step if you used a microwave.
 Take the frying pan off the heat. Pour in 6 cups (150 g) crispy rice cereal and stir until all of the crispy rice is well coated.
 Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking pan and press down. Let cool to room temperature, or until marshmallows have solidified. If you want to sculpt the treats into a certain shape, cover with plastic wrap and press down until quite firm.


The sticky mixture is easiest to handle with a greased spatula, or with clean, slightly buttered fingers., Sprinkle the treat with nuts, candy, or edible glitter. For a birthday cake, spread store-bought or homemade frosting over the top. You can cut the dessert into bite-size pieces, one-person chunks, or leave it as one cake.

 No matter how hard you work to memorize multiplication tables, sometimes memory fails. Also, you can only memorize so high in the multiplication tables. You will probably not be able to commit your multiplication tables through 26 to memory. There are a few tricks you can use to help you recall basic multiplication in a bind. One such trick involves multiplying powers of five.


Remember, 5 is the equivalent of 10/2. This means you can figure out a multiple of five in your head by multiplying that number by 10 and then dividing by 2. Remember, multiplying numbers by 10 is easy because you simply add a zero to the end of the number multiplied to find the solution.For example, take 5 times 26. To figure out the value in your head, remember that 26 times 10 is 260. Divide 260 by 2 to get 130. Therefore, 5 X 26 equals 130., There is also a trick regarding multiples of 9. The trick here is to remember than 9 is the equivalent of 10 minus 1.


Take the equation 9 X 24. As 9 is equal to 10 minus 1, we can rewrite the equation as 24 X (10-1). We can further rewrite the equation as 24 X 10 - 24, using the distributive property of mathematics.It's easy to multiply by powers of 10. We know that 24 X 10 is 240. Then, subtract 24 to get 216. Therefore, 9 X 24 equals 216., If you need to multiply big numbers quickly, doubling and halving numbers can help. By doubling one number in an equation and then halving the other, you can find the answer by hand.


Look at the equation 47 X 24. Double 47 to get 94. Half 24 to get 12. Then, repeat the process to get 188 X 6. Then again to get the problem 3 X 376. This problem is much easier to figure out by hand. The answer comes to 1, 128.If you're in a bind with a problem, simply double and halve numbers until you get an easy equation to solve by hand.

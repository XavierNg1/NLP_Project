 If you both share the same friends, it might be less stressful if you ask one of them to introduce you to the girl you want to approach. In this case, you can approach the girl with your friend, and she will most likely already be open to meet you.


Ask your friend "Do you mind introducing me to Morgan? I want to be her friend."
When your friend introduces you to the girl, some good things to say are, "Are you having fun here? What's your favorite thing about this place?" or "What school do you go to?"

, Girls look for confidence in people, and it's important that you don't take too long to approach her.The longer you take, the more awkward it will feel when you finally decide to approach.


If she doesn't like you, you weren't meant to be friends in the first place, but there isn't anything wrong with you.
Practice makes perfect. The first time you approach a girl, it might not go well, but you'll learn from every experience and become better at it over time.
 Stay respectful at all times. Don't make negative comments about her appearance, or make fun of her. Even though your friends may laugh, it can ruin your relationship with a girl.


Stay away from sexual jokes or things that are disgusting.
You can tease a girl a little bit, but don't go too far and hurt her feelings. If she's not smiling or laughing, you know you've gone too far.
 If it looks like she's having fun with her friends, then you may want to wait till after she's done. Some girls in fifth grade are concerned with social status, and will probably want to make sure that you're cool enough to her friends. She may be pressured by her friends to ignore you.

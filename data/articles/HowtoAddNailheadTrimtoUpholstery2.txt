 Pre-made trim comes in many different styles, colors, and shapes. Choose a trim that matches or compliments your upholstery. You can find pre-made trim at most hardware stores and craft stores.Some trim is accented with a piece of leather or cloth beneath the nails. This can be a great way of drawing a little more attention to your trim.
 Use a pencil and a straightedge, like a ruler or meter stick, to draw an unbroken line where your nailhead trim will go. Be especially careful that this line is the same distance from the outside edge of the upholstery. This will help keep your trim straight.


When attaching your pre-made trim, you’ll only have to pound in nails every few inches (7 to 10 cm). The trim will cover your outline, hiding it from view., Attach your trim in sections to the outline. Do this by holding the trim in place over the line and pounding in nails to attach the trim where it has gaps. Continue this for the entire length of the outline.Your pre-made trim should have come with special nails that match or accentual the design of the trim. Use these for attaching the trim.
If your pre-made trim didn’t come with nails, go to the hardware store to find nails that match your trim pattern. This way the nails used to attach the trim won’t look out of place.
 Even slight deviations from your trim outline can leave your trim looking unsatisfactory. Step back and check for evenness. Adjust the trim where necessary by pulling out nails with a tack puller and reattaching the trim. Enjoy your nailhead trimmed furniture.When adjusting trim that is uneven, use fresh nails to reattach it. Nails that have been pulled out will be more likely to warp and need to be removed again, or they may deform, which can result in an undesirable appearance.

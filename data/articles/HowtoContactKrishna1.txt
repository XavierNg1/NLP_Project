 It has been said that elevation of the mood and joy can result from simply singing or chanting God's holy names, and when one repeats this mantra aloud Krishna dances on his tongue! Sing this to yourself in remembrance of all the Lord has provided you, and to reorient yourself when you should become thrown of the path to Krishna:
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare;

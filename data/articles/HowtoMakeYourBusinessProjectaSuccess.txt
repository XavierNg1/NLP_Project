 You want to recognize exactly what it is that must be given up, to whom, and when. Make it formal, write it up formally and get them to sign it off. This document will create the foundations by which to measure your success.;
, Get them included in the analytic thinking and planning, as well as performance. You don’t have to seek their approval, just keep them informed. The more you include them, the more their level of buy-in and the better it is to deal with their prospects.
 Never agree to long-term timeframes. Divide the project into “mini-projects” if you want to. Keep every mini-project to less than six months. This maintains everyone motivated and focused.
 Put delivery deadlines to your milestones and try to deliver on each deadline, no matter what. If you’re late, explain to your customer about it as early as possible.
 Make weekly condition reports and run regular team meetings. Practice these project management templates in your spare time.
 Put your client's wish to be dealt with in a timely fashion first and then have their buy-in to expand the delivery dates if you wish to.
 Forever recap quality and never let it slip. Implement “peer inspections” so that team members can review each others' deliverables. Then put in place external surveys to verify that the quality of the solution fills your customer’s wants.
 Prioritize and resolve them before they impact on your project. Take pride in keeping hazards and issues to a minimum.
 Get them to sign an acceptance form to say that it meets their expectations. Only then can you mark each deliverable off as 100% done.

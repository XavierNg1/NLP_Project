 Gag gift stores like Spencer's and Gadgets and Gear sell "false positive" prank pregnancy tests that always give a positive reading, regardless of whether the person taking the test is pregnant or not. These can also be purchased on eBay and other online stores.;

Explain that your period is at least 2 weeks late.
Tell him or her exactly when you were supposed to get it and didn't (count back about 2 weeks).
He or she will probably then recommend that you take a pregnancy test.
Do this a day or two before taking the test so that there will be some buildup.
 The prank will be more believable if your mark actually sees the false positive pregnancy test.
 You can take a pregnancy test in two ways:


Urinate directly on the test stick.
Urinate into a cup and dip the test stick into it. This method is usually less messy.
 Real pregnancy tests usually take between 3-5 minutes to develop.
 When it is revealed that the test is "positive," it's important that you pretend to have an appropriate reaction to the situation--cry or scream if you must!

 Japanese people are traditionally fastidious about not overeating. In fact, they have a saying “hara hachi bu,” which roughly translates as “eat until you are 80% full.” Because our bodies do not immediately recognize when we are full, people have a tendency to overeat. To remedy this, eat your meals slowly and take a 15 – 20 minute break in the middle of the meal. This will ensure that you become properly full and avoid overeating.Try eating without distractions — turn off the tv, computer, tablet, phone, etc. and concentrate on your meal. Try eating with someone and having a conversation to slow the pace of your eating.

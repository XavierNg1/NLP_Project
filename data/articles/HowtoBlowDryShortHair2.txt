 Divide your hair into four sections: the left, right, front, and back. Clip three of the sections, leaving the last one free. It's generally easiest to start with the back section free and move forward.









Part thick hair into more than four sections.
 Wrap one section of hair around a round brush. Bring the hair forward so you can reach it easily with the blow dryer.
 High heat blow-drying has a more significant effect, but can easily cause damage. Set your dryer to a medium temperature instead unless you have resilient hair.
 Pull the hair gently with the brush to expose a straight length of hair. Hold the blow dryer about ½–1 in (1.25–2.5 cm) away from the hair, gliding along this length without touching your scalp or the brush. Repeat several times from below, above, and both sides. Gradually roll the brush to reveal more hair as you blow dry.









Direct the air away from your head, not toward it.
For everyday blow drying, it's best to keep the nozzle 8 inches (20 cm) away from your hair.This will reduce damage to your hair, but will make it much more difficult to style.
 Rotate the brush to form a half or full twist, to encourage more volume. Leave your hair in this position until it cools.









To prevent your hair flipping up, twist this toward your head, not away.
 Bring the brush as far forward on your head as you can to maximize volume. Pull the brush forward so your hair is tense; this will make your hair more shiny. Blow dry from all sides until dry, adjusting the section to expose wet areas.
 Move on to the front section, blow drying it while pulling it to one side of your face. Pull the sections on the left or right away from your head, to increase bounce and volume.









If the ends of your hair tend to flip up and disarrange your hairdo, blow dry them from above, with the dryer pointed straight downward. You'll still add volume as long as you keep your hair pulled tightly away from your head.

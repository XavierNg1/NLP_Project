Choose Bandolier for perk 1.
Choose UAV Jammer for perk 2. Using either Double Tap or Stopping Power is important to the P90. It has low damage (but very high fire rate), so adding damage or maxing out the fire rate will help kill faster. SMGs are usually very weak at long range. Using Stopping Power will help. That is, if you don't care about staying stealthy.



 


Choose either Dead Silence, Extreme Conditioning or Steady Aim for perk 3. Extreme Conditioning will help you sprint very far, Dead Silence keeps you stealthy and Steady Aim helps you with hip firing. SMGs already have high hip firing accuracy, so adding Steady Aim will help you dominate at close range, without needing to aim down the sight.

, When in ADS mode, you don't lose speed walking. So strafe and fire!

, Remember, SMGs are best at close range, and in a building, you should be able to dominate.
 If there is a battle in one part of the map, use the following tactic. Never go straight into a battle with an SMG. SMGs let you sprint fast and far. Try to go behind the enemy (by running around the battle) and flank them.
 Preferably find targets around the corners or camping.

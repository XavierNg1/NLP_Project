 Pick up the cotton swab and run it under water. Then, go in and around your belly button. Dry the bully button off. This is to remove grime.
 Take another cotton swab and run the cotton swab under water a little bit. Then, gently run it around the clip on to take some of the grime off. Dry off the "belly button ring". You don't want it to get rusty.

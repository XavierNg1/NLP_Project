 Plugins are commonly free to download and install; just search the Internet for them.

, Most Photoshop plugins come compressed inside a RAR or ZIP folder for easy transfer. Simply right-click on the downloaded file and extract it anywhere on your computer.
 Copy the entire folder that contains the plugin files. Do this by right-clicking on the folder and selecting “Copy” from the context menu.
 The Adobe folder is located in the Program Files folder in Drive C of Windows.


For Mac, it is located in Applications.
 Inside the Adobe folder you’ll find another folder labeled “Adobe Photoshop.” Open this folder and look for the “Plugin” folder (C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Plugins).
 Right-click an empty area in the “Plugins” folder and select “Paste.” This will install the plugin. Wait for all the files to be copied.
 Do this by clicking its shortcut icon on the desktop or by opening it from the list of applications installed on your computer.


If Photoshop is open while you copied and pasted the downloaded plugins into the Plugins folder, just restart the program.
 Select the tools required to use the plugins you installed.


For example, if you installed brush style plugins, use the Brush tool to test the styles you’ve installed.

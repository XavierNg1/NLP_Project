 The raft for 3 people will need logs that measure around 12 feet/3.6 meters in length. The raft will need to be 6 feet/1.8 meters wide. Each log should measure around 12 to 14 inches/25-30cm in diameter. Importantly, they should match in size so as to ensure evenness across the flat area when assembled.
 If the skid logs are not even, use an axe to smooth them (remove twigs, bumps, etc.).
 These notches need to be both top and bottom of each log and they must match up in a line when the logs are pushed together.


The top notch rows should be offset from the bottom notch rows; have the top notch rows more to the edge and the bottom notch rows inward more but still close.
Small poles with straight edges can be used to make the notches; or a string pulled taut.
 These need to be approximately one foot longer than the width of the raft.


Drive the crosspieces through the notch sets on the underside of the raft.
Flip the raft over and drive the crosspieces through the top notch sets.
If wished, lash the overhanging areas of the crosspieces together with rope, vine, string, etc. Note that this is not absolutely necessary, as the crosspieces will swell when they are immersed in water, which will bind the logs to the crosspieces anyway. If you do have material to lash the overhang with, it will help tighten the whole structure.
That said, if the crosspieces appear to be too loose in the notch grooves, wedge with pieces of wood taken from a dead log. It must be dead because dead, dry wood swells on contact with water and creates the necessary tight seal.
 Light poles can be added on top of the raft to form a deck that will keep you and your traveling companions, plus gear, drier.

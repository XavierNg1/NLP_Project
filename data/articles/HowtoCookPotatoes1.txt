 The boiling time will vary according to the cut of the potato:

A large whole potato will take up to 40 minutes to boil



 


Quartered (or halved) potatoes will take up to 20 minutes to boil






Diced potatoes will take up to 12 minutes to boil.






You'll also need to decide whether to peel or not. Unpeeled potatoes retain more nutrients than peeled ones.





;
, This helps to retain the nutrients in the potatoes. Note that old (mature) potatoes should be brought to the boil in the water, while new potatoes (chats) should be added to boiling water.







Bring to the boil. Then turn down to a simmer.






Let simmer for 20-40 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes.
 Use the same method as the previous step for whole potatoes, except reduce the amount of cooking time.

For quartered or halved potatoes, boil for 15-20 minutes.






For diced potatoes, cook 10-12 minutes.
 Boiled potatoes are ready when you can pierce right through the potato with a metal or bamboo skewer. Remove from the heat immediately and drain. Either serve immediately or cover with a clean tea towel to absorb excess moisture.


The cooking water can be added to soups, broths and casseroles to increase their nutritional content.






Boiled potatoes can be used to make soup, salad, or mashed for baking. For making mashed potatoes, see below.
 The main benefit of using the pressure cooker is that the potatoes should cook in about one third of the time required to boil the same sized potatoes.

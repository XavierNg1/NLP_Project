 You can use more dish soap to make more slime, but you'll need to add more cornstarch as well.Consider using some colored or scented dish soap. For a more traditional slime, consider green dish soap.
You can also use shampoo instead of dish soap. The thicker the shampoo, the better!;
, You don't have to do this, but it will make your slime more interesting. If you used clear dish soap, add in a drop of food coloring. If you want sparkly slime, add in a pinch of glitter. Stir everything together with a spoon.
 This will thicken the dish soap and turn it into slime!








If you used more dish soap, you will need to use more cornstarch.
If you can't find cornstarch, use cornflour instead.
 As you stir, the dish soap and cornstarch will come together and react to form slime!







, At some point, the dish soap will have picked up all the cornstarch it can. Once that happens, dig in with your hands, and knead it with your fingers until everything comes together.









If the slime is too runny, add more cornstarch. If the slime is too thick, add more dish soap., Let it run through your fingers. Yucky! When you are done playing with it, put it into an airtight container. Keep in mind that this slime won't last forever, and that it will eventually dry out.

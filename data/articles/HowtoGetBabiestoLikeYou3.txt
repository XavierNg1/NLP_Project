 Every body loves to receive gifts, and babies are no exception. Bring a baby an age appropriate toy to get them to like you. Search for fun, non-electronic, interactive toys for that baby’s age group. Then use that toy to play with them!, If the baby in question is over six months old, and if their parents have already introduced solid foods, sharing a little bit of what you are eating can be a fun and easy way to make the baby happy and get them to like you. Excellent foods for sharing with a little baby are bananas or other very soft fruit. Always check with the parents to see which foods are allowed and what size bites are safe.
 Babies are surprisingly adept at accessing a person’s mood. You can foster a connection with the baby by taking on whatever mood they seem to be in. If they seem fussy, you may want to make fussy faces back at them. If they are cheerful, respond in kind. These small gestures of empathy can lead to the baby enjoying your company., Babies love to learn. Anytime you play with them, it can be a great opportunity for learning. You can teach them about the ABCs while playing with blocks, you can practice new words as you walk through the garden, or you can teach them the sounds of different animals when you play with stuffed animals. If you make an effort to teach them, babies will grow to love you.
 Babies as young as eight months old can start to be helpful around the house. If a baby is able to hold small objects, they can begin helping you clean up their toys. If they are mobile (crawling or walking), they can help even more. Even though a task will almost certainly take longer with a baby’s help, allowing a baby to help gives them a sense of belonging and pride. It is building a good foundation for them, and as a result, it will encourage them to like you.

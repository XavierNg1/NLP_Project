 There are several classifications of water resistance within the Casio G Shock brand, ranging from the class of “Water Resistant” to “Divers’ Watch 200M.”A “Water Resistant” watch, the first classification on the scale of water resistance, is only resistant to splashing and minor contact with water, and is not designed to be be rinsed or submerged in water.
Make sure that you have at least a “Water Resistant to 50 M” classification watch, which is the next classification after “Water Resistant ”, before you submerge it.
 Once you have ascertained that you have at least a “Water Resistant to 50 M” Casio G Shock watch, turn on the faucet and wait until the water is warm, then hold the watch directly under the jet of water. Turn the watch over to ensure that you are rinsing the entire surface of the watch., After you have gotten the surface of the watch wet, squirt a small amount of hand soap into your hand. Hold the watch away from the running water and use your fingers to spread the soap over the entire surface of the watch, including on the band and into the nooks and crannies of the watch.Use clear soap, as colored soap may stain the band of the watch, especially if you own a white watch.
 Once you spread the soap all over the watch, hold the watch back under the jet of water. While the water is running over the watch, use your fingers to massage the soap into the watch, letting the water wash the soap away. Run water over the watch until all the hand soap is removed from the surface of the watch., Once you have finished washing away all the soap, dry your Casio G Shock watch with a clean, soft cloth. It’s better for the materials of the watch to manually dry it rather than to air dry it.

 Decide on your route before you depart on your trip, even if it’s just across town. Asking for directions can tip off a would-be carjacker that you are lost and/or not paying attention to your surroundings. Plan ahead of time which route you will take and any stops you may need to make along the way.Choose the most direct routes possible, and mix up your routine so that you are not a predictable target for criminals., Avoid high crime areas, rural areas with less populated roads, and congested traffic spots.Look for a navigation app with the safety feature of avoiding high crime spots.If you notice a lot of cars in disrepair, graffiti, liquor stores, check-cashing stores, or tire skid marks on the street, you may be in a bad neighborhood., According to the National Crime Victimization survey, 25% of all carjackings happen in parking lots, parking garages or near commercial areas. Park in a spot close to the building’s main entrance and under a lot of light,avoiding areas that are visually obstructed by walls or large plants.Don’t sit in the car and go through receipts or have a conversation on the phone or with your child in the backseat. Get in, lock the doors and go.


Don’t put your seatbelt on while pulling out of a space. If something happens, you may need to get out of your car quickly. Instead, belt yourself as soon as you are out of the space and ready to drive.In parking garages, park close to the exit and back into the space. It’s easier to drive forwards than backwards in an emergency., Keep a GPS system in your car or a GPS app on your phone in case you get lost.Always have a charged cell phone with you. Even if it is not under a service contract, you can still use it to call 911 if necessary. Just keep in mind that if you do not have a wireless provider and your call with an emergency operator gets disconnected, you will have to call back because they cannot call you.

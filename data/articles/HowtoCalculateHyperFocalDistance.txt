 Very simply, focal length depends on the type of lens you have on your camera. If you have a zoom lens it will be written on the lens barrel, for instance 100-400mm or 18-24mm. Typically, camera manufacturers produce a large variety of lenses ranging from 12mm to 135mm and every lens has the focal length written on the lens barrel. Not all lenses are zoom which means that the focal length is fixed, for instance, 17mm and means that you cannot zoom in and out, so if you want a closer shot you have to stand closer to the subject.;
, This means an aperture fstop number that is low, for instance, f8 will let in more light than a higher number like f22. Using a high number aperture like f22 means you will have to allow enough time for the light to reach the camera sensor so it is essential that that you use a tripod to avoid an out of focus shot.


Use a high 'f' number like f22 to have some of the foreground as well as infinity in focus -- best suited for landscape shots.
Use a low 'f' number like f8 for the shot to be more focused on the foreground, and the distant view less sharp.
Remember hyper focal distance is about maintaining sharp focus in the middle of the shot all the way to infinity.
 Some cameras will automatically select the correct speed depending on the aperture selected.

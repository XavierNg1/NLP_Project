, Web hosting is available for a minimal fee or consider a free group hosting available from Google, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, and others. The use of Internet groups for the hosting is a good idea because they will not only host the Mp3 audio file for you but also make the subscription to the podcast easy and keep a database of those to send the announcement to when a new podcast when made available. All Internet groups provide for RSS (really simple syndication). When an individual joins an Internet group they automatically have access to RSS.

 In particular, look for a spot near an east- or west-facing window. Hoyas do best in bright, indirect sunlight throughout the day, though they also prefer to have two to four hours of direct sunlight.A south-facing window is also okay as long as there is a sheer curtain hanging between the window and the Hoya plant. Hot, direct sunlight all day is too much for these plants.;
, A two- to three-year old plant that does not bloom is probably not getting enough sunlight. If this occurs, try exposing it to another hour or two of direct sunlight.
 Use room-temperature water that has been “aged” or left sitting in an open container for at least 24 to 36 hours. Hoya plants are tropical plants that could be stressed by cold tap water.Letting the water sit for 24 to 36 hours also allows chlorine and fluorine dissipate naturally. Chlorine and fluorine are chemicals commonly found in tap water that can potentially harm plants.
 This allows the moisture to be available to the plant throughout the day. Doing this also ensures that the leaves will dry before temperatures cool at night.
 Empty the catch basin beneath the pot after the water drains through. Water left in the catch basin could be absorbed back up into the potting soil, keeping the roots too wet and depriving them of oxygen.


Hoya plant roots need oxygen to keep them healthy. If the roots are kept too wet they could develop root rot.
 Hoyas need to be watered more often during the spring and summer while they are actively growing and less often during the fall and winter.If a Hoya plant begins to drop its leaves, it is probably being watered too often. Let the soil dry a little more before watering it again.

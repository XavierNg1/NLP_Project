 If a child is in physical danger, you should call emergency services.For example, a parent might be beating a child in public. Try to stay near the child and abuser until the police arrive. You’ll have to give the police the following:


your location
description of the child and abuser (take a picture with your phone if possible)
names of everyone involved (if you know)
description of the abuse

, The abuse might not be life-threatening. If not, you can report the abuse to Child Protective Services in your state.Provide the same information you would provide to the police.


In some states, you must report suspected abuse if you work in certain professions, such as daycare, education, social work, or healthcare. These are “mandated reporters.”However, everyone should report the abuse. Members of the public can ask to report anonymously.
You are protected if you make a good faith report of abuse. If you saw the abuse with your own eyes, then you are protected.
 Child Protective Services will open an investigation into the alleged abuse. If they need more information from you, they should contact you. Provide all requested information as soon as possible.


Mandated reporters typically must follow up with a written report.Your state probably provides forms for you to fill out.
Generally, you do not have any right to find out the results of the investigation.

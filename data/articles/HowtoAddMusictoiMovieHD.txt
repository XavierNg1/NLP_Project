This button is designated by a music note symbol.
Enabling the "Music and Sound Effects" button displays all of the audio options available for you to add music to your iMovie. Not only does this allow you access to your entire iTunes library, but this area also includes audio sound effects, loops, and jingles provided by Apple as well.
 If you know the music file you want to add to your iMovie HD, you can also use the search feature at the bottom of the "Music and Sound Effects" window to locate the file more quickly.
 Be sure not to drop the audio file directly onto a video clip or it will play during that small clip only. The iMovie HD project screen will place a green highlight over the areas that the background music you have just added starts and ends.


If the audio file you have chosen is longer than your video footage, iMovie will automatically fade the music out at the end of the video footage.
If your video footage is longer than the audio file you have chosen, you can simply click and drag another audio file onto the gray project screen.
If you want the background audio file to begin playing later on in your movie, click on the green highlighted portion at the beginning of the audio file and drag the audio file start to the desired position on the video footage. The green highlight will then turn purple to designate that it begins on a specified clip. If you move the clip itself, the audio file will stay synced to that clip and move with it.
 An "Inspector" window will open allowing you to adjust the audio file's volume to its desired level as well as adjust the fade in/out timing.

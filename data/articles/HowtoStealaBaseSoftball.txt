, The coach on first or third will help you. They will tell you to steal, or to stay. Sometimes they might instruct you with more complicated orders, but the make sure you know the steal sign that your team created.

 When the pitcher releases the softball, take two or three large steps. Be prepared to quickly run back just in case the catcher feels she can catch you off base with a quick throw. Make sure not to run before the pitcher releases the ball, though, or the umpire will call you out.
 The backstop is the fence behind the catcher. The bigger the backstop, the easier it will be for you to steal.
 If there are people on base ahead of you, make sure that they steal before you follow. Otherwise, you would have to go all the way back to the base you started at

, If there is nobody ahead of you that is base running, you may steal at your own will.
 Put your either foot on the outside corner of the base and your other foot behind the base. As the pitcher rocks back, you rock back. When she rocks forward into her windup, you rock forward. This will help you get a push off of the base and a head start to the next base. Putting your hands in front of you and 'fake' the windup to know when to go.

 You will need different amounts of each depending on how you prefer your lipstick to be, so experimenting a little is okay. But, for a base here is what you will need:


About a teaspoon of beeswax
About a teaspoon of any food oil
About a teaspoon of shea butter, mango butter, almond butter or avocado butter
About 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of a natural powder for color (beetroot powder: bright red; cinnamon: reddish brown; cocoa powder: deep brown; dehydrated beetroot powder: less bright red/pinkish); add more for more color
Turmeric powder will make it more coppery.
 Put the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave them in 15-30 second increments. Stir well.
 Add more as desired.
Â You can use old lip balm containers, plastic jewelry boxes, pretty much anything that is clean, food-safe and easy to store, and has a lid. Let the lipstick harden.

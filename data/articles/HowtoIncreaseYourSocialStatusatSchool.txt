 Just be yourself and don't listen to what other people think you should be.;
, What do you like about yourself? Emphasize those traits, skills, and talents that make you uniquely who you are and not like everyone else.
 Start out with a casual smile or a half-hearted wave. Don't stumble to blurt out a "Hey!" to someone who you barely know. It takes time. They will warm up if you start out small, but you can't just stay quiet and shy. It intimidates people, believe it or not.
, Call yourself sweet names and compliment yourself when you feel lousy. List all of your best qualities and then look in the mirror and tell yourself, "I can do this, I know there is someone out there who thinks I am gorgeous and then there are others who want to be me. I'll make them proud".
, Instead of trying to fit in with the popular crowd, real leaders are genuine individuals. When people see that you are your own person, they will want to be surrounded by you because you exude self-confidence. Who cares about social status. Be yourself.

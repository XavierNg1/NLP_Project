 All you need to do in order to pull weeds in Animal Crossing is to stand next to a weed and press the “b” button. This will cause your character to bend over and pull the weed out of the ground.


If you don’t play for a long stretch of time, there will be a lot of weeds in your town and you may have to spend longer on this step.
 Citizens don’t like weeds. They detract from the beautiful scenery otherwise created by flowers and trees. If you leave the weeds alone, it will cause your citizen satisfaction to decrease.
 Both you and your citizens are capable of planting and watering flowers. However, your citizens won’t be able to keep all of the flowers happy. When a flower doesn’t get enough water, it will begin to wilt and turn grey. This also causes a decrease in citizen satisfaction.
 If you do not have a watering can yet, scroll down to Method 3 to learn how to get one. If you have a watering can, you can press “x” to bring up your character’s inventory. In the inventory, find the icon for the watering can and equip your character with it by dragging and dropping it onto your character’s icon.


Alternately, you can tap on the watering can and then choose the option “hold” to get your character to hold the can.
 With your character equipped with a watering can, position your character so that he or she is standing next to the wilted flower. When your character is in position, press the “a” button. This button will trigger the action and your character will water the flower.


Again, if you don’t have a watering can, read the next section to find out how to get one.

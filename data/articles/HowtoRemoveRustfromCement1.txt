 Dirt and dust will just get between your cleaner and the stain, making your work less effective. Once you've cleaned the surface of the concrete you should let it dry before moving on., Almost all rust remover uses acid to lift and scrub away the stain, and the high concentration of citric acid in pure lemon juice makes it a worth-while cleaning candidate. Pour on the lemon juice and let it sit for 10 minutes before scrubbing with a wire brush.
 Let the vinegar sit for several minutes before scrubbing it with a wire brush. Rinse away the rust with some cold water and repeat for difficult stains., Let the lemon juice or vinegar sit for 5-10 minutes. Scrub the surface with a stiff bristled nylon brush if it is smooth or painted concrete. Work in small circles to remove as many of the rust stains as possible.


Do not use metal bristles as they can remove the top paste layer in the cement and expose the aggregate material beneath this layer.
 After rinsing, let the concrete dry. You may want to go after the stain again when you're done, as multiple washing is often the best way to fully remove rust stains.
 If you cannot use a wire brush without damaging the surface, stick to a sponge with some warm water. However, make sure that you test the cleaning product on a small corner of the concrete first -- many acids will strip or ruin the paint. Water down 1 cup of vinegar with 1/2 cup of water and start scrubbing in gentle circles. It may take 3-4 washes, but it will work over time.

 Dilute hydrogen peroxide with warm tap water in a 1:1 ratio. Soak your aligners for at least 30 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with warm water.


Note that hydrogen peroxide will not remove plaque build-up.
 Mix equal parts white distilled vinegar and warm water, and submerge your aligners. Let them soak for 15-30 minutes. After, brush gently with a soft toothbrush and rinse with warm water.The vinegar smell will disappear soon, don't worry.
 Whichever home soak you use, take advantage of the break to clean your teeth thoroughly before putting your aligners back in.

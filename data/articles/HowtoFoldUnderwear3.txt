 Place them on a flat work surface, like a countertop or the bed. Position the briefs so that the waistband is pointing away from you. Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands.
 Fold the left side of toward the center, then fold the right side over the left. The folds are similar to those you'd use to fold a business letter into thirds. Smooth out the wrinkles.
 The bottom edge of the crotch and the top of the waistband should be aligned. Smooth out the wrinkles.
 The briefs are now folded and ready to stack in your underwear drawer.

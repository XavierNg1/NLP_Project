 Good students never cause disruptions or distractions during class, so be aware of your behavior. Don't talk to other students while class is in session, don't interrupt your fellow students or your teacher while they are talking, don't use your cellphone in class, don't curse or talk back to your teacher, and don't speak without raising your hand.
 If your teacher can tell that you are not putting any effort into your homework or class assignments, they won't be very impressed with you. Teachers like students who study for tests, turn in their homework assignments, and participate in group projects. If you're having trouble with your schoolwork, approach your teacher and ask them for help. If your teacher sees that you're trying, they'll usually appreciate your effort., Teachers appreciate students who genuinely enjoy learning and helping in the classroom. Always volunteer during class, offer to arrive early or stay late to help prepare a lesson or clean up the classroom, and ask your teacher if there are any extracurricular activities for you to get involved in. If you improve as a student, your relationship with your teacher should improve as well.

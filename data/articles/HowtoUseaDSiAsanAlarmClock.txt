,,,,, Select "Yes" or "No", which ever one you want. But if you want to set an alarm you might want to either select Yes or see another method below.
 Some of you don't explore in it, but believe me, I did, and it's useful. And I found a button on the right side in the shape of an Arrow. Tap it with the stylus. Unless you lost it. (In that case use something else or your finger)

, Tap one of the alarms: you can set up to three at a time. Choose the hour and minute of the time you want it to go off. For example, if you need to wake up at seven thirty, you wold put the hour at 7 and the minute at 30. In this one, you'll want to put the time, not the Elapsed Time aka the time between Right Now and the time you're setting this for. You put the Elapsed time on plain DS or DS Lite. (Am I talking too much?)

, tap the speech bubble at the bottom-ish left. Then choose one of the three sounds in the selection or tap the Saved Sounds tab to find your sounds from DSi Sound. Otherwise record some there, including ones made specifically for alarms in Photo Clock. Then choose it for your alarm sound and click the button on the bottom that sets it. Tap yes if you want to set it, and no if you don't.
 You can either leave it there to let it go off or set another. DO NOT GO TO THE MENU TO KEEP IT ON! IT WILL NOT GO OFF!

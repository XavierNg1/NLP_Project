 Make sure that the container has a tight-fitting lid, and that it will fit in your freezer.


This recipe is based on the use of 6-ounce Limeade cans. if you’re using 12-ounce cans, the ratios still work; you may just want to cut them in half if you don’t want to wind up with 132 ounces of margarita.
 You’ll use the empty Limeade cans to measure out your other ingredients (hence the use of “cans” as a measurement). What to add to the container:


2 cans frozen Limeade concentrate
6 cans water
2 cans tequila
1 can triple sec

, This can take 4 or more hours. You can keep the mixture in the freezer overnight; the alcohol content will keep it slushy — it won’t freeze solid., Before serving your drinks you’ll want to prepare your glasses by wetting their rims with fresh lime juice and dipping them in coarse salt.
 Remove the container from the freezer. If it has a tight lid on it, you can shake it vigorously to break up the ice and ensure that all the ingredients are properly mixed.


If you’re unable to tightly seal the container and shake it, open it up, place it on the counter, and stir it with a whisk.
 The recipe makes 66 ounces: you should be able to make roughly 8 to 12 margaritas from it, depending on the size of your drinks.

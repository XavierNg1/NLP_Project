 Orthodontists are dentists who specialize in diagnosing, preventing, and treating irregularities in your teeth.See your regular dentist and ask for a referral to an orthodontist. Your dentist can probably make helpful suggestions for finding a professional in your area. The orthodontist will evaluate your teeth, jaw, and gums and help you decide on the best treatment plan for you.

If you have health insurance that covers dentistry, call your insurance company and ask for a list of in-network orthodontists that they will cover.
Some dentists can do orthodontic work, whereas others will refer you to a specialist. Just ask!;
, Braces are a traditional way of realigning crooked teeth. You will have small brackets cemented to your teeth and connected by wires. The braces will apply pressure to slowly move your teeth into a straighter position over time. You will see your dentist or orthodontist periodically so they can appropriately tighten your braces.How long you have braces varies and depends on your teeth, but the normal range is between one and three years.
Braces now are more comfortable than ever before., Braces can be fun bright colors, or subtler tooth-colored brackets. Some braces can even be placed behind your teeth (lingual braces) so you don’t see them much – they’re nearly invisible, but may be less comfortable.Discuss your options with your orthodontist., Your dentist or orthodontist will probably give you a retainer after your braces are removed. This is a removable mouthpiece that keeps your teeth in their new position. You’ll wear it at night for a while, but not forever.Be sure to wear your retainer as directed by your dentist so your teeth don’t start to shift back to their previous position.

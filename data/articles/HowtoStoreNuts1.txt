 If you are storing nuts harvested from your own yard or purchased at a local market, you may need to freeze the nuts for two days prior to storing them to kill off any pests or eggs.


Insect eggs and larvae thrive at room temperature. Your eye may not see any pests on the surface of the nuts you collect, but that does not mean that there are no pests to be found. As such, fresh nuts need to be sterilized via freezing.
If you are storing commercially purchased nuts, you should not need to freeze them. The manufacturer should have killed off the nuts before selling them.
Place the nuts in an airtight container and sit that container inside the freezer. Allow the nuts to remain there for 48 hours at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or lower.;
, Place the nuts in a glass or plastic container. The container should be clean and dry, with a lid that snaps or screws on with an odor-tight seal.


Plastic and glass containers are better than plastic bags. Plastic bags are permeable, so even though the bags have a good seal, odors can still seep into the space and taint the flavor of the nuts., Place the jar of nuts in a dark, cool location, like a pantry. You should be able to keep the nuts fresh for two to four months when you store them this way.


Chestnuts should never be stored at room temperature. They lose moisture quickly and can actually develop mold. If you do store chestnuts at room temperature, make sure that you use them within two weeks, since mold usually develops when kept past this amount of time.
Light can cause the nuts to go rancid at a quicker pace, so you should never store them on a shelf, kitchen counter, or other exposed area.

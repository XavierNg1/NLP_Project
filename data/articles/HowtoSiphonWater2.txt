 Place the plastic tube completely under the water in the container from which you will siphon the water. Submerge the tube slowly under the water to allow air to escape from the tube.
 Put a finger over one end of the plastic tube. Ensure that your finger covers the entire opening at the end of the tube.



Remove the plugged end of the plastic tube from the water.
Place the plugged end of the plastic tube into a container that is lower than the container from which you will siphon the water.
Keep your finger over the plugged end of the tube until you have set that end into the lower container.
Ensure that the immersed end of the tube does not come out of the water in the higher container.
 Remove your finger from the plugged end of the plastic tube. Water will flow through the tube into the lower container.

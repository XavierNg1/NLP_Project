 Organic garden centers specialize in organic products and will have the biggest, highest quality selection of organic dry fertilizers to choose from in store. You could also try a general garden center, as many of these will carry some organic dry fertilizers, as well, but the selection will be considerably less.
 The availability of home and garden chains is a definite plus, since you can find a store within a short drive of nearly any city, and the low cost offered by many of these stores is another positive. On the downside, you may have trouble finding a wide selection of organic dry fertilizers to choose from, and you may not be able to find one that suits your garden’s specific needs.
 The best way to get maximum selection is to buy online from a manufacturer or specialized retailer of organic fertilizers. If you are uncomfortable buying online, you can usually locate the seller’s website and place an order using the phone number listed there. When buying online, however, it is vital that you check reviews and reputation. Otherwise, you could end up getting scammed. An online store that has some sort of organic certification is an even better option.

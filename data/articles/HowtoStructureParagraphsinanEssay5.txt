 You summarise everything you write in three sentences or so. You should always link back to the question and ensure that there is no new information.


You shouldn't start it off with ‘In Conclusion’ as the reader should be able to tell what you write that you’re completing your essay.
 Your last sentence in the conclusion should be the most memorable. Make it sound developed and decent. You explain what happens if that or thing was not there or anything you want.


It is sometimes not good to tell your feelings or opinion unless it is the type that you have to write about.

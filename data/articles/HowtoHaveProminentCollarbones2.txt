 It is best to perform them after exercise to relax your shoulder muscles.



Chest Lift. Take a deep inhale in such a way that your chest lifts, protruding your collarbones. Hold this posture for 5 seconds and exhale out slowly, bringing your shoulders down. Repeat 5 times.

Forward bend. Lift your arms straight up and cross your fingers, such that your palms are facing upwards. Stretch your arms and slightly bend forward.Â Hold this posture for 10 seconds and release.

Chest stretch. Similarly, cross your fingers behind your back and stretch your arms, keeping your chest up-lifted. Hold and release slowly.

Elbow press. Raise your right arm straight up and fold it on your back such that your elbow is pointing upwards. Place your right hand on the back of your neck (or below this region) and press your right elbow with your left hand. Hold and release slowly. Repeat the same for the other side.
 It is important to relax your collarbones and massaging does not only relax them but also enhance your collar bones.


Apply massage cream to your collar bones. Place your index fingers above and your middle fingers below the collar bones. Gently rub your finger along the collarbones in an outward direction such that you feel them becoming visible. Repeat as much as required.

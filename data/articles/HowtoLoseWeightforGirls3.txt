 You will want to set aside a certain amount of time to exercise like 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week.
 Find ways to make it fun. Pop into your roller blades, jump rope, do an exercise video or wake up early and take a jog. You could also take up sport lessons or a team sport.
 If you take days off from your exercise routine, it will take that much longer to get back into shape and meet your weight loss goals. Make sure to find the time to exercise.

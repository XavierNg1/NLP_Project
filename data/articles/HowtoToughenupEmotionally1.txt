 Resilience is the ability to bounce back after difficulties, frustration, and significant stress. Resilience does not mean that you toughen up so much that you do not experience negative events, just that you can move on from them.Adaptation to new circumstances is a key feature of resilience.
Essential factors in developing resilience are having a supportive emotional network, feeling confident in yourself and your abilities, and using problem solving skills.;
, Understanding the specific source of your pain will help you better prepare to face the issue head on.Tracking your feelings in a journal is a good way of seeing how often and, more importantly, why you feel frustrated or upset. Once you see a pattern, you can decide where to focus your energy.
 Instead of trying to negate or remove your feelings, realize that accepting your emotional distress is a way in-and-of-itself to cope with life’s ups and downs.You don’t have to be superhuman. Emotional avoidance can actually work against you by building up stress below the surface. Suppressing your pain can backfire and diminish your sense of well-being.
Allow yourself appropriate time to sit with your emotions and acknowledge and feel them before moving on. Sometimes, just sitting to have a good cry or breathing through your anger is the necessary first step.

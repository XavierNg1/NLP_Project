 If you’re playing Farm Heroes Saga on your Android or iOS device, you need to connect the game to your Facebook account in order to ask lives from your friends.


Tap the gear icon on the game’s main screen to open the Settings menu. From here, tap “Connect” next to the Facebook icon.
Log into your Facebook account on the screen that pops up and tap “OK” to link the game to your Facebook.
 In order for this to work, you must have 4 lives left or less. Check how many lives you have left by looking at the top left of the game screen (for all platforms). Check the heart icon with a number in the middle. A heart with a 5 means you have a full set of lives. If you have 4 and below, you can proceed to ask lives from your Facebook friends.
 Tap/click the plus icon next to the heart icon at the top left. A list of your Facebook friends will appear. Tap/click on the friends you want to ask lives from. A checkmark will appear next to their names. Tap/click “Send” to notify your friend of your request.
 Friends who respond and give you lives will, at first, fill up your hearts. Once the hearts are filled, remaining lives will be converted into Magic Beans.


1 life converts into 100 Magic Beans.

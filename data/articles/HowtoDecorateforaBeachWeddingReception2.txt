 Tropical, nautical, Hawaiian and nature motifs are popular for beach wedding receptions. Because the options for beach wedding decorations are seemingly endless and quite diverse in style, it is easier to plan decorations around a theme. For example, you could have guests wear leis and decorate tables with hibiscus flowers for a Hawaiian theme. Or use oars, anchors and ships flags to decorate for a nautical theme. A nature theme might include only natural materials found on the beach, such as driftwood and shells.

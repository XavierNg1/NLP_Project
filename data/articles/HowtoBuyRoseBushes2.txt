 Bare root rose bushes are sold without any soil on their roots. They are sold online, through the mail and at garden centers. Container plants are sold in containers with soil around their roots.
 Bare root bulbs are usually sold in the spring and should be planted immediately. Make sure the roots do not dry out. Buy only healthy bare-root roses that have some weight to them when you pick them up and have stems that are green and smooth.


If a rose bush feels very light and the stems appear shriveled, it has dried out and is most likely dead. Even if it is not quite dead yet, the rose bush has been severely stressed and is not likely to survive after being planted.
 While they should be planted in the spring or early fall, they can be planted at any time throughout the year as long as they get plenty of water after they are planted. Buy only container roses that are planted in 1- or 2-gallon containers.


If the container is smaller than 1 gallon (3.8Â L), the roots have probably been severely pruned to make the rose fit which can leave the bush with too few roots. A rose bush with heavily pruned roots will probably not have enough of a root structure to thrive after it is planted.

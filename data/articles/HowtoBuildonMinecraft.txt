 Consider how big you want your building to be. Keep in mind that in order to add proper detail, your foundation must be 11 by 12 at the least.;
, Your walls' height should be at least four blocks per floor. If you are new to building, make sure your building is no more than two stories tall. As a rule of thumb, your walls should all be made of the same material.
 This makes it more pleasing to the eye.
 Detail is important. Keep your house symmetrical.
 Make the roof out of stairs. The edges of the roof should have an overhang. This way the roof looks better. Don't make your roof like a pyramid. Make it go either north-south or east-west.
, Make your floor and ceiling a different block than your wall for a nice effect. You usually shouldn't build your structure out of overly colorful materials.
 Have your chests organized in a corner so that you have quick and easy access to your stored materials. This will be a pain at first, but will helpful later.

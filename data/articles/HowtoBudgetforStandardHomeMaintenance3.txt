 If you are looking to save a little money on your home maintenance, you might consider doing the work yourself. Labor is often a large part of a contractorâ€™s bill for performing home repairs and maintenance. If you are willing to tackle a project on your own, taking the DIY approach to home care can save you a lot of money.Some DIY projects that you could tackle on your own are painting, applying wallpaper, installing tiles, or laying hardwood or laminate flooring.
You should probably hire professionals for major plumbing and electrical projects, replacing windows, installing cabinets, replacing siding or roofing, and any major structural changes.
 One way to keep maintenance costs down is by purchasing discounted equipment and materials. Look for used tools and equipment instead of buying new ones. Take advantage of sales at local hardware or home goods stores to buy any materials that you need for your project.This is only an option if you are performing the labor yourself. If you hire a contractor, they will use their own materials and supplies. However, you can often negotiate with them on what materials they use.
 Instead of buying high-end materials, consider purchasing cheaper alternatives. For things like flooring and countertops, buying less expensive materials, like vinyl or composites, can save you a lot of money. Many cheaper substitutes are just as durable as their high-end counterparts and often require less maintenance.For example, purchase vinyl flooring for your bathroom instead of expensive natural stone tiles.

 Use a piece of paper you grabbed from your printer. Don't cut it! You need the rectangle shape.
 You now have a fold down the center and a fold down the center of one of the sides.
 If you folded the right side, fold the tips of that side to make small triangles -- they should be about 1" (2.5 cm) in size.
 Only now, the little triangles are folded down (on the inside).
 Make sure the flaps are on the outside. When you go to fold it, the flapped side should be on the table -- you'll be looking at a regular ol' piece of paper.
 That is, take the top and fold it into the middle; then, take the bottom and fold it into the middle. Again, the flaps need to be on the outside when you start your folds.
 This is just to create a firm crease for later. Did we mention creasing it firmly?








, You should now see a big pocket for cash and two flaps to keep the smaller stuff.
 You may want to stick your fingers in the flaps to stretch them out a bit. Now stock it with the Benjamins!

 Sleep helps to restore your body and keep your immune system strong. Keeping your body well rested will help you to stay healthy. The amount of sleep you need depends upon your age. Younger children and teenagers need more than 7-9 hours of sleep, whereas people over 55 often need less. On average, it's best to sleep 7-9 hours per night.
 When you don't get enough sleep, your T-cells go down. This can make it easier for you to catch a cold or the flu.Lack of sleep can make it more likely you'll get a fever as well.
Sleep deprivation can make vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, less effective in preventing illness.
 Exercise decreases your risk for heart disease, flushes out bad toxins, and helps white blood cells circulate at a higher rate. It can also help reduce hormones associated with stress.If you're at a healthy weight, try to get 15-30 minutes of moderate exercise a day. For people who are overweight, it may be useful to get more exercise, since excess weight can suppress your immune system., Too much exercise can actually temporarily hurt your immune system.Since your body needs to recover from intense exercise, your immune system's defenses may not be as strong after more strenuous exercise.If you're just had an intense workout, like a marathon, stay away from anybody who is sick, since you are more susceptible after exercising.
Anytime you feel a little ill, stay away from intense exercise. It may make you more likely to become ill if you ignore your body's warning and work out anyway.

 You need a minimum of a high school diploma as well as a working knowledge of mechanical and electrical maintenance. This training is often offered at vocational training schools or through community colleges. Some colleges offer degrees in property management, and building owners will often choose the college graduate over others with less formal training.;
, Apartment building managers are normally expected to make small repairs such as replacing broken tiles, patching small holes in a wall, replacing broken windows and painting. Other jobs could be unclogging pipes, replacing plugs on electrical appliances, routine maintenance on heating and air conditioning units like changing filters and cleaning. If the building has a laundry room, washer and dryer repair skills would also be needed.
 An apartment superintendent needs to work with many people from all walks of life. The superintendent must be diplomatic, but able to settle disputes between tenants so both parties are satisfied and coordinate repair work schedules to the best advantage of the tenants while still providing the contractor with adequate access to the job site.
 An apartment superintendent must be organized. Routine maintenance tasks must be performed on schedule, but the schedule must be flexible enough to allow for emergencies. Some routine chores you will encounter are listed here.


Perform various cleaning tasks in public areas. This includes vacuuming and/or scrubbing lobbies, stairs, elevators and hallways.
Outside maintenance such as grass cutting, weeding, tree trimming, window washing and leaf collecting are all tasks that the apartment building supervisor would be expected to handle.

Add in 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar into the butter and stir until the butter is smooth. Add in the apple pieces and cook on medium-low heat until the apple pieces are slightly softened yet retain their shape. This should take approximately 6 minutes.
Stir 1/8 teaspoon of ground cinnamon into the apple mixture. Move the mixture to a small bowl and set aside.



Turn the heat down to low and let it simmer until the cider mixture is syrupy and reduced to about 3/4 cup. This should take approximately 25 minutes.



Using a knife or pizza wheel, cut the pastry into 12 rectangular pieces by slicing 4 horizontal rows and 3 vertical rows.
Place the pastry pieces into a greased muffin tin. Be sure to grease both the bottoms and sides of a cup.
Use a fork to prick the bottoms of the pastry piece a few times.
Spoon cooked apple into the pastry cups.
, Sprinkle with grated mild cheddar cheese.
 Enjoy!

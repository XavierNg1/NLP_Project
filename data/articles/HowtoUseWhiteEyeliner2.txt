 Using white eyeliner, trace the inner corner of your eye along the upper and lower lash line. The resulting shape should look similar to a sideways “V.”


Since the inner corner is naturally one of the darkest spots of the eye, highlighting it with white can extend the appearance of the eyeball and make your eyes seem both wider and brighter.
 Swipe the white eyeliner along the entire bottom edge of your eyebrow. Keep the line relatively thin along the inner brow, but make it wider as you approach the outer edge.


Start at the inner eyebrow, just beside the point where the eyebrow begins to arch upward. Follow the direction and shape of the brow until you reach the outer edge.
When done properly, this should highlight your brow bone and help define the shape of the eyebrow. It should also brighten the eye area overall.
 Use your fingers, a cotton swab, or a smudge stick to smudge the eyeliner at your inner eye and along the eyebrow, giving it a more subtle appearance.


When highlighting your eyes, the idea is to make them appear naturally brighter. If you don't blend the white liner into your skin around these areas, it will stand out as a cosmetic instead of looking natural.

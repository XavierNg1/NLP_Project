 Most flea markets will require a state license from a firearms' dealer, but you should check that they have their license posted. If not, you run the chance of buying a stolen gun. While that is not a crime in itself, if you decide to have the serial number checked at a later date and the gun was stolen, the police will confiscate it and you will not be reimbursed for the purchase price.

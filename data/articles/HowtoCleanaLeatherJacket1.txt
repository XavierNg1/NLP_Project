 Run a few ounces of warm water into a large, open container. Add about two teaspoons of liquid dish detergent and stir until the soap is completely dissolved. The goal is to produce a very gentle solution you can use to wipe down your jacket without damaging it.Too much detergent can cause leather to deteriorate and strip it of dyes, resulting in a blotchy, discolored appearance.;
, Submerge the towel or sponge in the soapy solution. Wring out the excess liquid. The towel or sponge shouldn’t be sopping wet, just damp. If it’s too wet, the water can soak into and saturate the leather, potentially causing even more damage.


Use a soft cloth. Rough fabrics may leave scratches on soft leather if you’re not careful.
 Run the damp towel or sponge in long, smooth motions rather than forcefully scrubbing. Pay particular attention to water spots, discolored patches and places where dirt or oil have built up on the leather. Clean the entire jacket, re-wetting the towel when needed., Wipe the jacket again, this time using clean water to clear away any soap residue. Make sure there’s no standing water remaining on the jacket. With a dry towel, pat the leather until it is completely dry. Hang the jacket up in a closet and allow it to finish drying.Direct heat can be very bad for leather, especially if it has just been moisturized, so don’t dry the jacket in a machine or use a blow dryer.

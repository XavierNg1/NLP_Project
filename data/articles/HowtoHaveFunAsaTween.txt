 Sleeping in is great because you get more sleep, but if you get up early you can do more and you might be able to see the sunrise! You choose what you what to do.;
, If it involves the stove, oven, or microwave, ask your mom or dad first and try to have them help you. Some ideas for a great breakfast are pancakes with whatever you want in them, waffles, pop-tarts, or a sugary cereal. Don't limit yourself to these choices though. Choose any breakfast you want!

, Make sure to call your friends first if you want them to come. Then have fun hanging out and enjoying your own/ your friends company!

, If you are a girl, a few suggestions are to go shopping for clothes, accessories, makeup, hair products, or 'spa' products/products used to pamper yourself like body lotion/moisturizer, face mask, or nail polish. For boys, try going shopping for video games, graphic tees, baseball caps, or CDs. Don't limit yourself to these though; shop for whatever you'd like!

. The tween years are a great time to develop a new hobby such as learning how to draw, play an instrument, dance, etc., For fast food restaurants, try going to McDonald's, Harvey's, Wendy's, KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), or A&W. For dine-in restaurants, try Red Lobster (it's quite expensive though), Swiss Chalet, or the Mandarin. If you don't want to go to any of these restaurants, choose the one you want to go to.

. Local "mom and pop" restaurants are just as fun., Pop some popcorn or get other munchies to snack on, and watch the movie with your friends or even your parents.
 This will probably need to be planned out, so make sure that you have food, room for everybody, and anything else that you may need.
 Try ordering pizza or Chinese food.

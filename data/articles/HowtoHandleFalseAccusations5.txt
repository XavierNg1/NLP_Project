 If someone wrongfully sued you, accused you of a crime, or said or published something false that harmed your reputation, you may have strong grounds to file a lawsuit of your own. An attorney can help you assess which cause of action is appropriate for your situation, as well as your likelihood of success and the amount of damages you can expect to recover.
 Libel and slander are two forms of defamation. If someone makes a statement about you, like an accusation, that was false, you can sue for defamation. You will also be required to prove that a third party heard or read the statement, and that your reputation was harmed by the statement.

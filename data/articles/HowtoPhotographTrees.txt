 Try different things; any number of things. You may accidentally find your own niche, just that way. Some suggestions are:



Macro shots of parts of the trees
Lying on the ground, looking up
Interjecting yourself someway into the photo
Landscape shots
Photographing the root system if they are showing
Photographing the ground cover. You would be amazed at what is in the undergrowth (in a forest, anyway).;
,, Then start moving around the tree getting different angles.
 That will really help your photography grow, just watching the changes. How you shoot will change from time of day to time of year.
 If you are going to be taking photographs and you want them to be good ones, know something about the tree. What is its optimum point for photography or wildlife, or anything else. Knowing the tree will help you to know what time of the year and what time of the day will be best.
 Otherwise, it's just a picture of trees somewhere. No sense in size, location, etc. If you can make the tree the focal point, by all means, do so.

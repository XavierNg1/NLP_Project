 For example, if you like one band/singer, don't pretend to like Justin Bieber because everyone else does.;
, Wait a second though, there's a but. Don't be rude about it! Respecting doesn't mean agreeing.
 It's also a way to make new friends who have the same interests as you!

, Just be yourself and new friends will come to you, and old friends can leave if they don't like it.
 For example, make a list of things that makes you YOU and don't compromise your morals. Stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
 Do things that make you worry, 'feel the fear and do it anyway' as they say. It doesn't have to be something like sky diving, it could be walking around town on your own, taking a bus on your own for the first time, starting a conversation with a stranger, wearing a tighter fitted top than usual in public.
 If someone bitches behind your back, ignore it unless it's really serious, people will always dig into people they don't understand or are jealous of, it's natural. Just feel pleased you're mature enough for it not to bother you. If someone directly starts something, meet them head on, you're an independent person and you've got guts enough to have discussion about this. If someone gets violent however, obviously use your common sense and leave in a calm and collected manner.
 Look up the poem 'I am Me' and the Desiderata, 'If' by Rudyard Kipling and even 'Chicken Soup For The Soul' books, all of these are esteem boosters and chunks of things to think about.
 And love that that's who you are.

 The only way to legitimately get Latias in your FireRed game is to trade from Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald. Latias cannot be caught in the wild in FireRed unless you enter a cheat code using a CodeBreaker cheat device, or an emulator.;
, It is easiest to catch Latias in Sapphire and Emerald. In Ruby, you'll need an event ticket that is no longer available.


To catch Latias in Sapphire or Emerald, you'll need to defeat the Elite Four first. After defeating the Elite Four, you'll need to track Latias down, which can take a long time since it appears randomly across the map. Once you've tracked down Latias, use your Master Ball to capture it, or whittle its health down and use Ultra Balls. See this guide for detailed instructions on catching Latias in Sapphire, and here for instructions in Emerald.
If you're going to be trading for someone's Latias, you're going to need to be able to offer something equally rare in return. Legendaries like Rayquaza, Groudon, Kyogre, Deoxys and Mew all make good trading stock. You can also offer to trade a full team of well-trained Pokémon in exchange for the one Latias.
 Before you can trade Pokémon from Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald, you'll need to defeat the Elite Four in FireRed. After defeating the Elite Four, you'll need to get the Ruby from Mt. Ember, the Sapphire from Ruin Valley, and the Sapphire in Five Island Meadow.
 You'll need two Gameboy Advance (GBA) consoles in order to trade between the games. You cannot use Nintendo DSs to perform the trade.


You can connect the two GBA devices using a GBA Link Cable, or by using the GBA Wireless Adapter for each GBA., You can initiate the trade by stalking with the person on the right when you enter the Pokémon Center.

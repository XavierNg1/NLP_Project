 Place the bowl in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes, or until the temperature reaches just above freezing.


The thicker the milk or cream you use, the thicker your foam will be. However, using 2% or low-fat milk may be easier if you are frothing by hand. Lower-fat milks usually include whey proteins that are critical stabilizers for milk foam.
Check on your bowl to make sure the milk hasn’t frozen. There should not be any ice crystals.
 While the milk is being cooled, make your espresso using the first method.


You can then make the foam while your coffee is steeping.
 Once you remove the cold milk from your freezer set it on a towel on your counter top.


You can now go about frothing your milk in a couple of ways. One way is to proceed as you would with milk heated on the stove. Blend the milk, then shake and microwave. Another way is to blend and shake. But not microwave.
 You can also pour your milk into a smaller container for easier blending or whisking. Blend until there is a good, stiff froth.


If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can use a whisk and stir the milk in a smaller container. Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands. Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.
 Once you’ve poured your milk, tighten the lid and give the jar a good shake. Don’t fill the jar more than halfway. This won’t leave enough room for the milk to foam.
Shake until the milk is bubbly and nice and foamy. You should be shaking for about 30 to 60 seconds. You can leave the cold froth as is, or microwave if you want extra foam.
Leaving the froth cold will mean that you have to scoop it right away onto your drink before it settles back in.
 Take a spoon and place a dollop of froth onto the top of your drink.


Sprinkle with cinnamon for added flavor.
You can also pour the milk mixture into your drink if you like.

 When selecting shoes, know that khaki tends to pair well with gray. If you want a shade that will easily match with your khakis, go for gray shoes. Something like light gray heels will compliment a khaki dress well.However, if you don't love gray, you can go for other neutral shades. While gray is generally a good color with khaki, it is not the only option. Blacks and browns can also work with khaki.
 Suede and khaki go great together. Suede shoes, especially heels, are a great addition to your khaki outfit. Try pairing a midi khaki dress with a pair of suede heels. This can be a great look for either the office or a night out., If you want something a little bit different, try leopard-patterned shoes. While the look is a little bold, it can be perfect to add some flare to khakis.Leopard pattern shoes may work best for a more dramatic, form-fitted dress. They may look a little off when paired with something like a casual off-the-shoulder khaki dress.
 If you want a more casual look, go for gladiator sandals. They can pair well with looser, more casual khaki outfits. They can also work for a more casual day in the office. Gladiator sandals add some style to your outfit without being too formal.If you want something very casual, try just wearing plain sandals with khaki. This can work great for something like a casual afternoon lunch.

 Self-centered people may display their confidence by dominating conversations and bragging about their talents. Deep down, they do this because they are seeking validation. A quietly confident person understands what they bring to the table. Therefore, you won’t need to openly seek the validation of others.Believe in your self-worth. If you have trouble with this, it can help to make an ongoing list of some of the major challenges you have overcome and the milestones you have passed. Reflect on the list often to remind yourself of your value.
 When you know your value, you have no problem letting others know what you need from them. Passive people may expect people to read their minds, or guess at their needs. Quiet confidence means having the self-assurance to meet people halfway and communicate your needs to them.Tell people what you need in a respectful, clear, and honest manner. For instance, you might tell a friend, “I am worried I might lose my job, so I really need to cut back on extra spending” rather than snapping at her because she wants to go shopping.
 A quietly confident person is okay with saying “no” when a request doesn’t serve them. Start small and practice saying “no” with the people in your life.For example, your coworker tries to shove his extra work off on you for the second week in a row. You might say, “No, Patrick. I can’t take your work. I was happy to help last week, but I don’t have the time to do your work and mine.”

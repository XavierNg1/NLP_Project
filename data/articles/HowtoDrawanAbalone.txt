 First create a simple scenery showing sand and water. Using a soft brown  pencil start drawing the rounded lip for the front of your abalone.
 Lightly swirl a line to draw together the small end of the shell. Each growth section to the back of the shell are drawn next with soft broken lines. Decrease the size of each section back to the beginning of the swirl. The shell is not very large in size in real measurement maybe 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm). Along the left side of the shell create holes that start in the front and gradually get smaller as they follow in a line to the smaller end of the shell., Carefully blend areas of color with pastel chalk. Pick chalk one shade brighter than your pencil and fill in particular areas that show the curve of the shell, bringing out the areas around the holes and the swirl as well as the edges., It should be looking pretty good and lively., Now, all that is needed a spray fixative for the pastel and your signature on the page.

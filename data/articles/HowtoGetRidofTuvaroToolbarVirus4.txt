 If you can't get rid of Tuvaro using the above steps, it's likely that you are infected with more than one piece of malware. It can be incredibly difficult to get rid of a major infection, so you're usually better off backing up your important data and wiping the slate clean. Once your data is backed up, you can usually have Windows reinstalled in about an hour.

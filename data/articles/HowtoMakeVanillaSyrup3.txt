 Vanilla syrup is a versatile ingredient when it comes to drinks. A few spoonfuls in any bitter beverage will give it a delicious creamy flavor. Below are just a few ideas for drinks you may want to try your syrup in:


Coffee or tea
Hot cocoa
Lattes, etc. â€” note that chains like Starbucks use vanilla syrup to make their vanilla-flavored drinks.
Italian sodas
Cocktails

, Vanilla syrup is a great topping for desserts. Its rich flavor goes well with most types of ice cream (except, perhaps, vanilla). You can even add it to chocolate ice cream for a "backwards" version of a typical ice cream sundae. Cakes, pies, and other sweet confections also go well with the syrup.


For a lower-calorie treat, try your syrup on frozen yogurt instead.
 Maple syrup may be the gold standard for pancakes, but vanilla syrup can make this breakfast classic into a decadent dessert. Try this combination on its own, or, if you're cooking breakfast for a group, set out a selection of spreads, fruits, and other toppings and let your guests make their own choices.
 Vanilla's rich, sweet flavor satisfies the same urge as whipping cream, only with less fat (and more sugar). Try serving strawberries, blueberries, peach slices, or your other favorite "...and cream" fruits with vanilla syrup for a new spin on an old dessert favorite.

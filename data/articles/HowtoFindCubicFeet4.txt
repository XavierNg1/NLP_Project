 If it doesn’t measure well into whole feet, feel free to measure it in inches for now.


Ex. 8 inches (20.3 cm).
 If you measured the length in inches instead of feet, be sure to do the same with the width to stay consistent.


Ex. 18 inches (45.7 cm).
 This gives you the two-dimensional area of the base of the pyramid.


Ex. 8 inches (20.3 cm) x 18 inches (45.7 cm) = 144 square inches.
 Be sure to measure in a straight vertical line from the bottom to the top, not a diagonal line that follows one of the sloping sides. Write down this number.


Ex. 18 inches (45.7 cm).
 This gives you a three-dimensional, or cubic, measurement.


Ex: 144 square inches x 18 inches (45.7 cm) = 2592 cubic inches.
 Since the length times width times the height gives you the volume of a cube, not a pyramid, you must modify this result to find the volume of a pyramid instead. To do this, divide by three. This works with all pyramids.


Ex. 2592 cubic inches / 3 = 864 cubic inches.
 To convert from cubic inches to cubic feet, divide the result by 1728.


Ex. 864 cubic inches / 1728 = 1/2 cubic foot.

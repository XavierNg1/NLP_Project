 Kissing is an important element of any relationship, and a kiss on the neck is no exception. Learning to be a good kisser can have a really positive effect on your relationship. Research shows that having good kissing chemistry is very important in a relationship, especially to women.If you are concerned that you and your girlfriend aren't having successful kisses, try something new. Be more gentle, or be more confident. You can also try getting verbal feedback. Try saying something such as, "I really like it when we kiss good night. How about you?" Pay attention to her response.
 A great kiss involves more than just lips on lips. Other essential elements are confidence, and other physical touches. For example, try giving hugs or other caresses while you are kissing. This will heighten the level of affection.Good hygiene is an important element of kissing. Bad breath can be a major turn-off, as can general body odor. Make sure to freshen your deodorant before a big date.
 The most important thing to remember is that kissing is personal. What matters most is that you and your girlfriend enjoy it. It's also good to remember that your first kiss probably won't be your last--you have time to improve! And practicing getting kissing right can be very enjoyable, for both you and your girlfriend.

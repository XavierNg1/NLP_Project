 Dice your onion. Mince your garlic. Slice or tear your basil leaves up into shreds. Do this before you put your pockets in the oven to bake. Your sauce should take about as much time to cook as your pockets will to bake and then cool off enough to safely handle., Line the bottom of a large saucepan with olive oil. Set the burner to medium-low. Once the oil heats up, add the onions and saute for two to three minutes, or until they turn translucent. Add the garlic, wait one minute, then stir in your tomato paste and saute for one more minute., Pour in your diced tomatoes. Stir in the sugar and basil. Add salt and pepper as desired. Place your pockets in the oven at this point, and let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally (or longer, if the pockets need more time).If desired, use an immersion blender to smooth the sauce out.

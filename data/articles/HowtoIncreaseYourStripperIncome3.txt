 Some clubs have VIP rooms where customers pay upfront to spend time with the girl of their choice. VIP rooms are huge moneymakers – you know exactly how much you’ll be making upfront and depending on the guy, you may have to do very little work.Sometimes, all a guy wants to do in a VIP room is talk. If so, indulge him. The better the conversation, the longer he’ll stay and the more money you'll make.
If a patron ever tries anything in a VIP room that you aren’t comfortable with, you are fully within your rights to shut them down and get out.
 Stripping in the same clubs can be great – you can foster relationships with the club owners and build your client roster – but sometimes you need a change of scenery. Go on a road trip to a new city or state and try out the clubs in that area.Most strippers are able to pay for their travel using money they make on the road. Stripping is a profession that lends itself very well to a nomadic lifestyle.
Research conventions, major sporting events and festivals. Any time there are large numbers of men gathering, clubs hire additional strippers to staff their clubs and you have the opportunity to make a lot of money.
 If you’re already a successful stripper, making the move to Vegas is the next logical step in your career development. Vegas has the largest number of strip clubs per capita and is a prime destination for men looking for a good time.Vegas is also one of the most competitive markets for strippers, so if you’re going to make the move, prepare to hustle hard.
Be smart about your money. It’s very easy to blow your cash on cars and drugs, but you’ll burn out fast and end up with little to show for all your work.

 The European Union generally follows a set pattern for all (non-4G) phones across all providers when it comes to setting up call forwarding. They are similar to the codes for 3G phones in the United States.


Pick up or turn on your phone.
Dial the following code based on the type of forwarding you want:

Dial *21* to set up unconditional call forwarding.
Dial *67* or *69* to forward calls on a busy signal.
Dial *61* to forward calls on no pickup.


#* After entering the code, dial the 10-digit phone number you want to forward calls to, and then press # to finalize forwarding.
 This is identical to the process for setting up call forwarding on a 4G phone in the United States.


Turn on your phone and navigate to the appropriate app to set up call forwarding.

This feature is included on nearly all 4G phones, but its location varies from phone to phone. Consult your user manual if you can't find it.


Set the options and numbers for call forwarding by using the prompts on your screen.

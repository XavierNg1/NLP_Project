 Caramel fudge is great, but if you can't stand fudge without chocolate, don't worry — it's easy to make caramel-chocolate fudge. Start by making either of the recipes above. When your caramel fudge is in its lined baking pan, melt some chocolate (of your preferred darkness). Pour this chocolate over the fudge in a single thin layer. When your fudge comes out of the fridge, it'll have a delicious chocolate stripe running along the top!See our article on melting chocolate for help.
 Salt and caramel is a classic combination — just like peaches and cream and mustard and mayo. Sprinkling just a pinch of your best sea salt over the top of a plate of caramel fudge will give the sweet dish a subtle but mouthwatering "bite."


If you don't have fancy Himalayan salt, plain table salt also works well.
The trick here is not to use too much. Pouring loads of salt on your caramel can completely overpower its flavor.
 Walnuts, peanuts, pistachios, almonds, and other nuts all pair well with the smooth taste of caramel. Chop your favorite nut and toss it over a plate of fudge or use a mix of nuts — it's up to you!


If you're serving your fudge at a party, be sure to label it with "contains nuts" for the benefit of anyone with allergies.
 Salt, caramel, and strawberries may not seem like they go together, but one taste will have you convinced! Try serving these ingredients with a set of skewers for some easy at-home fondue.


Ripe strawberries are much better than unripe ones here — their sweetness goes with caramel much better than the tart flavor of unripe strawberries.

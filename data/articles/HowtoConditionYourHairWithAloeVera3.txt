 Use as much coconut oil as you need. It depends on how much conditioner you want to make. Place the coconut oil in a small, microwave-safe bowl and microwave it.You should microwave the oil until it's melted into a liquid form. Cooking time depends on your microwave and the amount of oil.
Cook the oil for short periods, like 10 seconds, and then check it. Continue to microwave the oil as necessary until it has melted.
 Mix a tablespoon of aloe vera gel into the coconut oil. You can buy aloe vera gel at a drugstore or purchase it online. You can also extract it from an aloe vera plant., Use a wire whisk or fork. Gently beat the ingredients together. Keep beating them until you have a uniform mixture. The oil may bubble slightly when being mixed, but this should not be a cause for concern., After shampooing your hair, put a small amount of gel on your palm. Work it into your hair. Start at the roots and work the hair down to your tips. Keep working in the mixture until your hair is evenly coated in aloe vera gel.You may want to cover your hair with a towel in case the mixture drips.
 Set a time and wait 10 minutes. After 10 minutes have passed, hop back in the shower. Rinse all the aloe vera gel out of your hair. If the gel works for your hair, it should leave your hair silky and soft.

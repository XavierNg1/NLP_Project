 It's always important to have as many details as you can before starting a conversation with someone you don't know well. See where he works, what he does for a living, and where he lives. You can also look for common ground, such as similar interests or the fact that you both have two cats., That is, if you are contacting person because he's a friend of a friend or because someone he knows recommended you chat, bring it up.As an example, you could say, "I'm writing to you because Jeff Grace of ABC Financials suggested I get in touch with you."

, If you notice the person works in a similar field, ask about the job he does.For instance, you could say, "Hi, I'm Jess. I notice you also work in engineering. I'm new to the field, so I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about your job."

, That is, tie in your location to initiate the conversation.You could say, "Hi, I'm Beca. I'm new in Phoenix, and I was wondering if you have some time to talk about jobs in computer science in this area."

, If you're looking to make connections, mention that. If you're trying to find places that are hiring, ask about that. Most people are willing to help if you state what you want.For example, you could say, "Hi, I'm new to the area, and I'm looking to make professional connections in my field. Do you mind chatting with me for a few minutes?"

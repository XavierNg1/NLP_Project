 Writing down your personal strengths is a great way to remind yourself of everything you have to offer the world. List at least three things you are good at, but don’t stop there. Write down as many strengths as you can think of. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family what strengths they think you have and write those down too.


Keep your list of strengths in a safe place. Whenever you are struggling to feel confident in yourself, read through the list and remember all the things you are good at.
Examples of strengths you might write down can include being a good listener, caring for others, having strong ethics, being a hard worker, or excelling in a particular area, such as music or athletics.
 You deserve to feel good about who you are. Give yourself a confidence boost by complimenting yourself just as you would someone else.When you recognize something positive about yourself every day, you’ll start developing a habit of feeling good about yourself. As your confidence goes up, it gets easier to avoid caring about what others think or say.
 When others say something nice about you, let them know you appreciate their kind words and say “thank you.” Don’t brush off a genuine compliment because you think you’re undeserving.By gracefully accepting compliments, you are showing the other person your appreciation. You should also discover your confidence increasing with time.
 Just as receiving a compliment can boost your confidence, giving compliments can too. Letting someone know you like their outfit or that they did a great job on something is a great way to maintain a positive attitude, which can help you feel more confident overall.
 When you look at the bright side of things, it’s easier to maintain a positive attitude. That positive outlook is important to feeling more confident, as well as not caring what others think about you.To stay positive, avoid dwelling on negative situations or experiences and minimize complaining.

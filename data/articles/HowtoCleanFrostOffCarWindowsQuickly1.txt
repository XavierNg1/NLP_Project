 This method uses water to rapidly soften and melt the ice on your windows. The larger the area of glass that you'd like to melt, the more water you'll need. For instance, if you just want to melt the ice on the front window of a four door sedan, you'll only need a few cups, whereas if you want to melt the ice on all six windows, you'll need a gallon or more. Your water shouldn't be boiling hot - in fact, the rapid temperature change brought by very hot water can cause the glass to crack.


If you take a morning shower, use the opportunity to fill a bucket or jug with lukewarm water. This way, you save time because you only need to wait for the water to heat up once.
Another reason not to use hot water is that, in extremely cold environments, hot water can actually spontaneously freeze into powder when thrown through the air.;
, Splash, throw, or pour your water on the windows you want to defrost. You should notice the ice become immediately translucent. You may even notice it disappear completely.
 Though water will quickly soften or melt most ice, in some cases, the ice remains on the windshield in a translucent, "slushy" form. Fortunately, this softened ice is usually very easy to remove. Use your windshield wipers, a gloved hand, a conventional scraper, or another similar tool to push the ice out of the way.


Re-apply warm water to any spots you missed, then re-wipe.

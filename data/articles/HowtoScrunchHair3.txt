 A diffuser is an attachment for your hairdryer which helps keep curls intact by reducing the pulling and straightening effect of regular blow drying. Long-finger diffusers usually have a bowl or cup for the air to sit in while drying, this allows for less movement and produces less frizz.
 When using a diffuser, you should always set your hair dryer's heat and speed settings to low. The low heat protects your hair from burning while your hair is sitting in the cup of the diffuser, close to the heat source. The low speed minimizes air movement, thus preventing frizz.
 Turn the hair dryer on and direct the flow of air upwards, to help lift the roots. Take a section and scrunch the hair up towards the scalp, holding it there with the fingers of the diffuser until the hair is dry. Rotate the diffuser in a slight circular motion. Move on to another section of hair and repeat, until all of your hair is dry. Don't forget to turn your head upside down to dry the underside.
 Once all of your hair is dry, you can spritz it with some hairspray to hold the curls in place, or work in a dime-sized amount of gel to help give the curls some definition.

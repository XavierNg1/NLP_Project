 Snapchat users can now create a link that will open their Snapchat profile in the Snapchat app when you tap on it. Have your friend send you the link via text or email so that you can tap it.

The link will look like https://www.snapchat.com/add/username.
 You'll need to open the link on your phone that has Snapchat installed. When you tap the link, a Snapchat page will open in your phone's browser., This will launch the Snapchat app. You may be prompted to select the Snapchat app from a list of apps before it opens., This will add the person to your Snapchat friends list. The person will be notified that you've added them, and they'll need to add you back in order to send Snaps or see their Story., You can send your Snapchat URL to your friends from your profile screen:

Open the Snapchat profile screen by swiping down on the Snapchat camera screen.
Tap "Add Friends" and then "Share Username."
Select how you want to send the link. You can use your messaging app, or add it to an email. You can also post it to your social media apps by selecting the app you want from the list.

 Weirdly enough, one rock out of your many rocks scattered around your town will store money. It's as simple as hitting a rock a few times, but the question is how well you can do it. Well, what people don't know is that you actually only have 10 seconds to get out as many bell bags from the rock as possible. To achieve more bell bags flying out of the rock, you need to keep yourself to the rock, because every time you hit the rock the pressure bounces you back. If you "bounce/fall back" you will waste time that could be used getting bells, which reduces the number of bells you make. This can be fixed by digging three holes in a straight row behind your character while it is right against the rock, stopping your character from falling back so you have more time to hit. Only one rock per character per day holds money, and if you are quick enough, you can make up to 8,000 bells per character per rock, or 32,000 bells if all 4 of your characters do it perfectly.
 They do exist in the Wild World. If you are lucky enough to have earned a golden shovel, you may be able to earn a few bells. Firstly, with your axe, cut down a tree and dig out the stump. Replace it with a bell bag. If you are lucky, in a few days it will grow into a tree bearing bells. If you succeed, there will be 3 bell bags hanging on the tree. Shake the tree to retrieve them. Each bell bag will be worth the price that you 'planted' in the first place divided by three, so altogether you will re-earn the bells, but note the bells won't regrow! But, like most methods of bell earning in this game, this can be risky and may not work. View some more articles on how to do this for more depth.

Prune your ficus tree after new growth stops for the best results. Most ficus trees put out new growth in spring and early summer. Late summer and early fall are good times to prune.
Prune right before bringing a ficus back indoors if it was summered outside.
Pruning can be done anytime if it’s necessary to make the plant fit into a certain area.
Prune off dead or broken branches at any time.



Decide whether you need to limit the height or the width or both.






Look at the form of the tree and try to prune so that the tree has a natural looking form.
 This is where a leaf or a twig joins the stem.



Cut as close to the node as you can without cutting into it.
Always leave at least 1 node on a branch if you want new growth in that area.
If you want to eliminate a branch so that no new growth occurs there, cut it back to just before the trunk or main limb and don’t leave a node.

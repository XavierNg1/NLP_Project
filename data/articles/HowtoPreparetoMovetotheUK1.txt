 Get a job in the UK, apply for a course in a British university or just come for fun or to improve your English!;
, Visit the UK Border Agency website and apply for a visa (the type of visa will depend on the reason for your visit). If your country belongs to the European Union, you only need a passport or a National Identity Card. Make sure they will not expire while you are on your way here!

, Take a course if necessary. The better your English is, the more serious people will take you here. Your chances of getting a job are much better and you will make friends easier. If your native language is English, you are already ahead of the game. You may want to familiarise yourself with the various British accents (watching movies is a great idea) and the local slang.
 Consider whether you would prefer a direct flight (more comfortable but usually more expensive). You may want to book with British Airways as they fly to and from most countries. Or, you may find some good deals in Last minute, Opodo and similar websites. It is a great idea to look at every possible option; you could save quite a bit of money.

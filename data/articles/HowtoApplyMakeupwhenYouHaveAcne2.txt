 Removing your makeup at the end of the day is one of the best ways to avoid further breakouts. Get into a good routine of cleansing and moisturizing before bed.Very gently wash off makeup using your bare hands with warm water and a facial cleanser for 10 seconds or less.


Avoid towelettes, makeup-removing wipes, washcloths, or scrubbers, as these can further irritate your skin., Wash your brushes and makeup tools with a mild shampoo or brush cleaner, and replace sponges regularly.Acne is caused by bacteria and keeping clean tools can help minimize breakouts.


Wash your pillowcases and towels often.Items that touch your face should be kept clean and bacteria-free.
 Choosing makeup made for acne-prone or sensitive skin will help prevent breakouts caused by some makeup. Try to choose sheer or light coverage varieties that are non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores) and fragrance-free.Look for products with these guidelines:


Avoid products with thick or very creamy texture, which will clog pores more easily.
Gels, light serums and fluids are better for pores than thicker makeup.
Oils don’t clog the pores but can make your skin appear greasy.
Avoid products that contain irritants such as alcohol, menthol, peppermint, eucalyptus, camphor, lemon, grapefruit, or lime., Some cosmetics brands have lines of makeup containing salicylic acid, an ingredient in acne medications.These are not proven to be more effective at preventing acne, but may be worth trying out.

 Inform your friends that you are aware they don't think a lot of your fiancé but that he is the person you've chosen to spend the rest of your life and that he is the most important person in the world to you as a result of making this choice to get married.;
, By impressing upon them how much this means to you and how important you find it that both the friends you care about and the Fiancé you care about find some common ground, it will at least give them the impetus to try, even if it's just to humor you, or out of guilt.
 Things like gossiping about him, snide comments, and rolling their eyes whenever he's about can be both hurtful and distressing and it's important to let them know that this is really hurting your happiness.
 Find out how he feels about this and ask him if he can find it in his heart to give your unfriendly friends another chance. Then, tell them that he has agreed to behave better around them, so that they feel reassured about any difficult behavior that he might have been exhibiting toward them.
 Have them around to dinner with him at your place and give it your best shot.


Remain polite and diplomatic when helping smooth things over between your friends and Fiancé.

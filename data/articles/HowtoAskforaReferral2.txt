 If you show your appreciation for every referral, your clients will feel more motivated to keep sending business your way.There are a lot of ways to express gratitude for a referral:

Give your client a simple written or verbal “thank you,” or send a thank-you card.
Send a simple gift, like flowers or a nice pen.
Treat your client to dinner.
Some businesses may offer referral incentives, like a gift card or discount on future services. However, non-monetary rewards tend to generate a stronger sense of trust and community., Even if you haven’t done business with them in a long time, don’t be afraid to keep in touch with your clients and let them know that you still appreciate their support. Send an occasional email or note card to touch base. Ask them how they are doing, and state upfront that you are interested in any business they might be able to send your way., Don’t bombard your clients with referral requests and reminders constantly. Choose a regular schedule for getting in touch with key referral sources.For example, you might send out reminders once every three or six months.
If demand for your services tends to spike at a particular time of the year, send out referral requests a few weeks before that.

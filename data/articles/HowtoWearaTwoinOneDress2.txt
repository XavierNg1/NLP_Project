 Start with both straps gently draped over your shoulders. Move one strap to the right, overlapping the other strap. This should create what looks like a longer strap over your right shoulder. Then, weave the straps behind your back together moving down until you're halfway down your back. At this point, move the straps over to the front of your body and then loop them around to the back of your body. Tie the straps together tightly in the back. When you're done, you should have a one shoulder dress., If you want to add some flare to the one shoulder look, repeat the same process above. However, stop when the first two straps are at your front. Instead of looping them around the back to tie, tie them together in the front. This will create a lovely bow for your dress., Start with the straps draped across each shoulder. Hold the straps together just above your breasts with one hand. With the other hand, move the straps off your shoulders. Move the straps behind your back. Then, loop them around to the front and pull them around to your back once more. Pull the straps together tightly at your back and tie them. You should be left with a mermaid-like sleeveless dress., Leave your strapless dress secured, but take the slack from the straps tied around your back. Pull them over your to your front and then toss them over your shoulders. Tie them together at the back of your neck. This will create two small straps for your dress., To create sleeves, leave your strapped dress in place. Unfold both straps slightly, and pull any balled up fabric downward covering your shoulders. This creates two short sleeves for your strapped dress.

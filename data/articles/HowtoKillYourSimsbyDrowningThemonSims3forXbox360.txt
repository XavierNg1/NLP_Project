 If you already have a pool, you can skip this step. Having a pool gives you more things; When you sell your house, you gain more money and your sims can have a calm swim whenever they want.;
, Fill their needs (might take 30 minutes at most) and when they are happy, put them in the pool.
 If you let your sim round the edges, you can not complete the next step. Sims outside NEAR the pool must be moved otherwise you cannot complete step 4.
 Because they are in the centre, it will allow you. They will either drown of falling asleep, starving, etc.
 The sim will soon die. Your sim has vanished (except the ghost has come now.)

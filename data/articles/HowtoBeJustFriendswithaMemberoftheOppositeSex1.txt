 Be honest with yourself.


Do you find yourself fantasizing about what a relationship would be like with them?
If you weren't in a relationship, if they were single, or if something else wasn't in the way, would you probably be romantically interested?
Do they seem to be romantically inclined towards you? Remember that actions speak louder than words. Trust your gut feeling.
Do you really believe that this person is better suited to you as a friend than as a romantic partner? Why? Your answer to this question is what makes all the difference, and what will keep the relationship platonic when or if boundaries ever become blurred.;

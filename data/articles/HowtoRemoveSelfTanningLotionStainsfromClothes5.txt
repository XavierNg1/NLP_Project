 Hydrogen Peroxide is a very strong cleaning agent, so make sure to do a spot check before you use it on your garment. Take a hidden or inconspicuous area of your garment and put a drop of hydrogen peroxide on it. If after a few minutes the spot has changed colors significantly, do not use hydrogen peroxide on your stain.


Hydrogen peroxide is a lifting agent, so it can lighten clothing. You may want to use it only on clothes that are already light-colored or white. Like bleach, use hydrogen peroxide only if you have tried other methods of removing the stain.
 If you have already eliminated most of the stain by this point, it may not be necessary. However, hydrogen peroxide is such a powerful agent that it may be a good idea so that the peroxide doesn’t soak into the back of the shirt.
 Put a few drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide on a cloth or cotton ball. Gently dab the stain with the peroxide.


Make sure to use a white cloth. Hydrogen peroxide will lighten material that isn’t white. , Once the stain is fully removed, launder the garment as usual. You will want to wash the garment alone or with other white pieces of clothing, because the hydrogen peroxide may lighten garments that aren’t white.

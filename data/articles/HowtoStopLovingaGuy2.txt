 Instead of focusing on what you wanted in a future with your ex, start looking at what you want your future to look like.Identify your hopes, dreams, and goals and allow yourself to get excited about these things.


For example, what is your dream job? Would you like a new job or maybe just a promotion at your current job? Would you like to go back to school to train for a new job? If so, what might you need to do to start that process? Complete an application? Visit a local college?
You might also think about personal wellness goals, such as losing weight, improving your self-esteem, or developing a spiritual practice.
Give yourself permission to dream about what you want your life to look like and then identify some things you can do to move in that direction.
 Think of something that makes you feel good, like going shopping for new clothes, or getting a new haircut. Go out and do that for yourself to get your mind off of the guy. Giving yourself a new look, buying something new to wear, taking a day off, or even just listening to your favorite music can all help you de-stress and focus on something besides him.If you have the time and the means, try taking a little overnight trip somewhere. It doesn’t have to be far away—it could even just mean staying over at a friend’s house. It will get you out of your comfort zone, which is where you’re probably most likely to dwell on the guy you’re trying to get over.
 Exercise is a great way to boost your mood and keep yourself busy. Instead of sitting around and dwelling, go out for a walk, take a jog, go swimming, or get your aggression out on a punching bag. Not only will you feel physically energized and more upbeat, you’ll also distract yourself from thinking of the guy.


Yoga is also a great option. It’s great for focusing on yourself and your breathing, as well as working on your physical health.

 After personal inventory space upgrades get expensive, there is nothing left to do except get a mount. The mount is not only used to reduce travel time, it is also used to increase your storage space! Each mount storage space upgrade will increase your total storage space by one. This may not sound like much, but it will add up in time.
 A single mount upgrade can be performed each day, and there are other things to upgrade, not only its bag space! This is why it’s extremely important to log on daily and upgrade the storage space at first, because it takes around 60 days to reach the maximum level of storage, without upgrading anything else. Even though each upgrade costs 250 gold, it’s still cheaper than personal inventory upgrades after a while.
 As weird as this sounds, after a certain point in the game it’s easier, and cheaper, to make another character and purchase a second mount for him or her. Pick a class that you may want to play after a while, and log on each day on this character as well, to upgrade the mount. This will provide you with a lot of extra bag spaces that you can use if you keep the second character next to your stash, and simply move items into his or her inventory.

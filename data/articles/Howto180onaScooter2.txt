 Skate parks have barriers of all sizes, but if you can't get to a skate park, you can use a small cardboard box.


Avoid using anything that has sharp edges or could cause serious injury.
Use soft materials (cushions, cardboard boxes, etc.) for practicing over.
 Make sure that you can clear the barrier with an ollie. If you can't, you'll probably need to move to a smaller barrier or practice your ollie.
 Push yourself in quick bursts to reach a fast speed. This will help you build enough momentum to get "air".


Gauge how fast you can reach on the scooter and aim for a few notches below this speed.
 This means bending your knees and getting as low as possible while remaining balanced. Center your weight below your torso.
 Push off the ground in a jumping motion while holding onto the handle bars. Once you're in the air, pull the scooter in towards your body.


Make sure that both wheels are at least half a foot off the ground; otherwise, one of the wheels might catch the barrier as you perform the 180.Make sure that your center of gravity is directly below your torso and try to keep your eyes focused right above the barrier.
 Shift the top half of your body, beginning with your head, in the direction that you want to do the 180. You can either go left (backside) or to the right (frontside). Rotate a full 180, or until you are facing the opposite direction.


When you turn your head/upper body, the rest of your body and scooter will follow.
Begin doing this right as you ollie.
 Youâ€™ll probably need to practice a few times before you stick this landing. Have confidence and learn from your mistakes. If you notice your wheel clipping the barrier each time, you need to adjust when you initiate the ollie.

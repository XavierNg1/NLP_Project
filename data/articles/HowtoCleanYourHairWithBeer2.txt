 The alcohol in the beer can be damaging and drying for hair but these effects can be counteracted by adding a few essential oils. It not only adds extra nourishment to your beer hair wash but can also provide you with a calming effect when you're massaging the beer into you hair, all the while leaving you smelling great. Consider adding:



Lemon oil: It strengthens hair, adds shine, and fights against dandruff.Almond oil: It moisturizes and soothes the scalp.

Chamomile oil: It adds shine and softens hair.

Jojoba oil: It adds nutrients to hair and moisturizes the scalp.

Lavender oil: It acts as a deep conditioner that moisturizes, nourishes and adds antioxidants to hair.Sandalwood oil: It helps with dry or split ends.
 Vinegar helps with counteracting rough or brittle feeling hair but smoothing out the scales or cuticles found on each of strand of hair. Shampoo especially aggravates hair by lifting up these scales and preventing hair from feeling smooth and looking shiny.


Consider using raw apple cider vinegar rather than commercial vinegar. Raw vinegar is not distilled, heated, or clarified. Raw vinegar has much of the good bacteria, nutrients, and enzymes needed to improve hair texture.
You can mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to 8 ounces (250 mL) of water instead of beer and treat your hair the same way you would with a beer wash.
It's best to only use a vinegar rinse a few times a week. If used everyday, it can be quite drying for hair.

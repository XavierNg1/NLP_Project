 See what it does. Playfully hit it. See what it does again. Watch for other behaviors too. Relate these actions to things that might happen to you. (e.g. Someone is bothering you, and you hiss or some one is mad at you, walk away or hiss, etc.);
, Tigers favor water more than any other big cat. If you seriously flat out can't swim, it's no big deal. But it's best if you want to really prove you have tiger in you. When swimming, you might want to throw some object in the pool and jump on top of it (which relates to hunting fish).
 If someone you dislike comes in your territory, roar or growl at them. If someone you don't know comes in, curiously inspect them. If they seem nice, let them in. If you sense danger,chase them out.
 Tigers are strong animals, so you need to keep in shape. Get strong, and exercise a lot so that you will have endurance, speed, and strength.
 This is entirely optional. You can wear tiger striped shirts if you want, but you really don't have to. If you know what a furry is, and you want to wear a furry costume, then go ahead, because that's a great choice. There are many furries around. Most people who want to release an inner animal actually are furries! If you can't acquire a costume or tiger-related clothing, just wear some orange-white clothes.
 Your friends might think you're crazy, but that's okay. If your clan members or friends think something is wrong with you, then just explain to them what you are doing. If they are a good friend, they will understand. Also,if someone else is being dominant and being leader,roar at them to tell them they are acting like a wolf,not tiger.

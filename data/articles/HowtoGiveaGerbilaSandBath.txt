 IMPORTANT: Chinchilla Dust is NOT the same as chinchilla sand. Chinchilla dust damages their respiratory system, as well as making their fur ruffled and unhealthy. It will say somewhere what type it is, so just read all the labels.;
, Something like a cat food dish, enough for your gerbil to roll around inside. Avoid plastic, make sure it is not spiky, and that it's heavy enough that your gerbils can't tip it over.
 Chances are your gerbils will come investigate. They may try to eat a bit, but as long as it is not chinchilla dust, this is perfectly harmless. It may take a few times for them to get the hang of rolling around in, but they will eventually. Most get it straight away.
 Put it in every few days so they can get clean.

 Boiling parsnips is a simple and quick way to enjoy their natural flavor. Here is what you should do to boil the parsnips:


Bring a pot of water to a boil. Salt the water if desired.
Trim the root and leaf ends of the parsnips.
Scrub the parsnips with a vegetable brush while rinsing under cool water. Peel any part of the outer parsnip that is not favorable to eating.
Place the parsnips into the boiling water and reduce to a simmer.
Cook for 5 - 15 minutes, until the parsnips are tender.
 Steaming the parsnips is another quick and easy way to cook them that does not require the use of butter or other spices during the process -- you can add any butter, salt, pepper, or other spices later. Here is how you can steam the parsnips:


Trim the root and leaf ends of the parsnips.
Scrub the parsnips with a vegetable brush while rinsing under cool water.
Peel any part of the outer parsnip that is not favorable to eating.
Put the whole parsnips into a steamer and place over boiling water.
Steam for 20 - 30 minutes.
 Once you've trimmed the root and leaf ends of the parsnips and scrubbed them under cool water, there are only a few things you need to do to cook the parsnips in the microwave. Here is how you do it:


Quarter the parsnips lengthwise.
Put 2 tbsp. (28.56 ml) of water into a microwave safe dish.
Place the parsnips into the dish and cover.
Microwave on high for 4 - 6 minutes.

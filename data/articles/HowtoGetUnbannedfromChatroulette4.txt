 If you want to clear away any basic record of Chatroulette coming into contact with your computer, you can do so by changing your settings for Adobe Flash.


The Adobe Flash online settings manager can be found at: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html

Note that the settings panel is displayed at the top of the screen. At first glance, it may appear to be a graphic, but it is the actual panel itself.
 The display panel is located at the top of the page. On the panel, you will see a list of websites, all of which have left information on your computer. Scroll through this list until you find Chatroulette. Click once on the name and press the "Delete website" button to get rid of it.


If you do this shortly after your ban, Chatroulette should be a recently visited website, so it should appear near the top of the list.
If you cannot find Chatroulette or wish to reset your Internet presence, you can also press the "Delete all sites" button. This will clear out the information left by all websites on the list.
 Close out of your Web browser completely. After a minute or two, open it back up again and head to Chatroulette.


You might be able to access Chatroulette immediately even without restarting your browser; however, restarting your browser resets your browser's settings, giving the new change a chance to set in and increasing your odds of success.
If you cannot access Chatroulette after this step, continue to the next step. If you can access it, then stop here.
 If closing out of your Web browser did not do the trick, try shutting your computer down completely and restarting everything from a powered down state.


If a complete reset to your computer's settings does not prove successful, this method did not work.

 Many nicknames are drawn from the things that make a person unique: a runner might be called "Legs," a proud New Yorker living away from New York might be called "NYC," or a straight-A student might be called "Prof."


You might also incorporate an adjective that describes a person into his name, as in "Honest Abe."A variation on this is to use an ironic nickname that does not describe the person at all. Famous example of this are "Curly" from The Three Stoogesand "Little" John, the gigantic friend of the legendary Robin Hood., This is one of the best sources for nicknames, but it is also the most difficult to control. Inside jokes can be a rich source of inspiration, but you can't force them to happen, or to catch on. You just have to cross your fingers. If you have an inside joke already in mind, try to think of nicknames that might be drawn from it.
 There are lots of quizzes and nickname generators online that can suggest potential nicknames based on your personality and your given name. These might be a good source of inspiration if you are stuck.

 Start with a piece of basic computer paper; fold it down the middle, lengthwise.  Put the fold on your left and draw half of the bottle or vase.  Press hard to imprint the lines through the 2 layers of paper.  Open the paper and draw the other side of the bottle. If the imprint isn't strong enough, do it again, or hold the paper up to a window and trace. You have made the first bottle.
  Use a half sheet on its side to get a squatty bottle.  Aim for variety in shapes, sizes and neck configurations.  Cut out the five bottles to use as patterns.,  This line will represent a shelf or window ledge.  Place the patterns or templates you made along this line, arranging and rearranging until you get a pleasing pattern of bottles in a row. ,  Remove the paper templates.  Place the remaining two bottle shapes, completely overlapping the ones already drawn on the paper.  Draw them and remove the templates.,  First paint the bottles in the rear, one each color. Remember, these bottles must be completely painted even though there are bottles standing in front of them.  Allow to dry completely.
  Note what happens where the bottles overlap. Again, dry the entire paper thoroughly., Wet the background well and glide on color you've mixed and made into a big puddle. Blue usually reminds people of the sky and yellow the sun., Make the shadows colorful the way they look when light comes through colored glass., For fun and to add a little drama, add the image of a mischievous cat as seen through one of the bottles. Is the cat thinking, "Should I give this bottle a tiny push?"

 You don't always have to switch arms when you are doing the jerk. If there is a change in beat or you just want to change the move up a bit, you can move the same arm twice or more. Adding the double motion can be a simple way to include a bit of variation to the jerk.

Bring your arm up to your head as you normally do.
Bring the arm back down again.
Don't switch to bringing your other arm up. Instead bring the same arm back up.
 The pony is a dance from the 60's that can blend nicely with the motions of the jerk. The move is an easy one to learn and can be a nice addition to your jerk moves. Take a look at the following overview to get the basics of the pony down:Take a big step to your left. Stand in place and step on your right foot then back to your left.
Take a big step to your right. Stand in place and step on your left foot then back to your right.
Have your arms down at hip level on the big step.
Bring your arms up with the smaller steps you take when standing place.
 The twist is a simple dance move that looks great and can work together nicely with the jerk. You will need to be on your toes, twisting the direction your heels face, and moving your weight from side to side. Keep some of the following basic steps in mind when practicing your twist:Stand on your toes.
Shift your legs and hips so that your heels are pointing either to the left or the right.
Shift your heels to the other side.
Keep this motion going and move your body from side to side, shifting your weight to your right or left leg.
You can throw in a squat while you are twisting your feet for some extra style.
Keep your arms loose and at about chest level, twisting them slightly from side to side.

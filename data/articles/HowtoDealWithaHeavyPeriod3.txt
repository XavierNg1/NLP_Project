 A normal flow requires 3-6 pads or tampons per day on average, but for a heavy flow you may need to change your hygiene product every 3-4 hours – or more. You’ll learn your flow and be better able to gauge how regularly you need to change your hygiene product.
 Sometimes with heavy periods using a pad can make you feel nervous or dirty. Nobody else will know if you’re using a pad or not, but if you feel uncomfortable with them then try to learn to use other methods. Tampons and menstrual cups can help keep you dry throughout the day and are probably more comfortable if you’re being active. If you change your tampon regularly enough, you can even swim during heavy flow days.


Consider using a menstrual cup. Some of them have a greater capacity than pads or tampons and you don't need to carry any supplies throughout the day.
A lot of girls have trouble with tampons and cups at first, so don’t be embarrassed if you find it difficult. Ask your mom, other female relative, friend, or doctor to give you advice on using them.
 Tampons and pads come in different shapes and absorbency. Make sure you’re using the right ones for your heavy flow. “Super” tampons and “overnight pads” offer more protection to your clothes and linens. If you don’t have overnight pads – which are generally longer and thicker – try using two pads when you go to bed, one in the front and one in the back of your underwear.

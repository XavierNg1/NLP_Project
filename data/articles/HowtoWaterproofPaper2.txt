 To waterproof your paper, you will be making a solution that will alter the surface of its fibers to change its absorbency. This will make your paper not only waterproof, but also more durable. You'll need:


Alum 8 oz (found in the spice area of grocery stores or online)
Castile soap 3Â¾ oz (grated)
Water 4 pt
Gum arabic 2 oz
Natural glue 4 oz
Flat tray (deep) or wide mouth bowl
Tongs, When you have treated your paper with your solution, it will need to hang to dry. Clipping your piece of paper to a string or clothesline will be suitable for it to dry. However, droplets of this solution could possibly do damage to flooring or fabrics that aren't intended to be waterproofed. Be sure any droplets land in an appropriate receptacle, on a drop cloth, or onto newspaper., To mix your ingredients properly, you will need your water to be slightly heated. When your water is warmed, mix your ingredients into the water one at a time.
 You will need to stir your ingredients until your solution is an even blend of all its parts. Be sure not to overheat your water during this time; the water can get hot but should not boil.


The stirring process may take several minutes. Be patient and mix all ingredients thoroughly.
 You should remove your solution from the heat and let it cool for a short time. While the solution is still warm, pour the mixture into a large flat tray with deep rims or a wide mouthed bowl. These will make dipping your paper into your solution easier.
 Use your tongs to hold the paper, and dip it into the mixture, coating it completely. Don't allow the paper to remain in the solution too long, just long enough to coat the paper front and back.
 Once coated, remove your paper and hang it from a string or line. You can also use a wire cooling rack covered in wax paper to dry your paper. The wax paper will prevent your counter from any negative reaction to the solution.

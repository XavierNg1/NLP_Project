 If your new job comes with a company cellphone, consider whether you can turn it down. Your company cellphone comes with many strings such as constant connectivity with your workplace outside of work hours. If you turn down the company cellphone and stick to your personal cellphone, fewer people will have access to your telephone number and you will be more likely to have time to yourself on the weekend., If your phone tells you about each new email in your inbox, it can be hard to completely ignore it. This can reduce your chances of enjoying personal time during off hours or on the weekend. To avoid this problem, simply turn off the email notifications on your smart phone. Instead, just check it at regular times that work for you., If you check email on the weekend or in the evening, try to remember that not every message needs an immediate response. If you respond to every message on a workday evening, you may find you have little time left to yourself.Avoid opening work email outside of work hours. If possible, simply ignore your email inbox during non-work hours.
If you are on vacation or on sick leave, avoid checking your email. Instead, set an automatic away message explaining that you are out of the office for a few days.

 Unlike high school, colleges offer hundreds of classes. This can make choosing classes intimidating. Look through the course catalog to see your options for classes. Take classes that you think you will find interesting and that will help you choose your major. Don’t be afraid to take a class that is brand new to you and to try something new., Try to spread your classes out in a way that works for you. Spreading your classes out throughout the week gives you time for studying and other activities each day. Try to choose times that are good for you. Don’t pick morning classes if you are not a morning person and don’t choose night classes if you can’t focus well at night.


Don’t take too many or too little credits. Start with the recommended amount by your school then adjust it if you need to., Try to get a few requirements out of the way each term. You will need to take core classes or general education classes such as math, history, and science courses. Try to take the majority of these classes your first two years of college so you can focus on your major later., At some schools you meet with your advisor at registration. Otherwise, try to meet with them before you register. Your advisor can help you figure out what classes you need to take to fulfil requirements and suggest classes for your interests.


Come to your meeting with your advisor with a list of questions., Don’t start off with classes that are too difficult, especially your first term of college. You want your schedule to be balanced in difficulty and variety. Don’t take too many classes in your easiest subjects or too many classes in your hardest subjects. Have a schedule with a mix of hard classes and easy classes.


Have different types of classes in your schedule. For example, don’t take all writing classes and end up having to write five essays a week.

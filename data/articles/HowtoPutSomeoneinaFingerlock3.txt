 Secure either of your opponent’s wrists when grappling to begin the finger lock.


Make this move when grappling rather than striking, as both of your hands will be occupied with this move, leaving you open for a strike.It is typical to secure the wrist with your non-dominant hand, as you will want to perform the finger lock itself with your dominant hand.
 Take hold of one or more fingers on the hand of your opponent that you’ve secured. Bend fingers so that they are hyperextended outside their range of motion.


Lock fewer fingers (just one or two) to make this move more painful, and thereby more effective for subduing an opponent.
Try pulling the fingers backward toward the knuckles, or bending and twisting them sideways., Push the thumb of your opponent’s hand in toward the palm to perform the finger lock on the thumb.


Curl the thumb as much as possible and pin the tip of the thumbnail down tightly against the palm for the greatest effect.Perform the thumb compression if you cannot grab the other fingers, or the thumb is more accessible to you.

 As noted above, if the numerator and denominator of an expression share factors, these factors can be removed from the fraction entirely. Sometimes this will require factoring the numerator, denominator, or both (as was the case in the example problem above) while other times the shared factors are immediately apparent. Note that it is also possible to divide the numerator terms by the expression in the denominator individually to obtain a simplified expression.


Let's tackle an example that doesn't necessarily require drawn-out factoring. For the fraction (5x2 + 10x + 20)/10, we may want to divide every term in the numerator by the 10 in the denominator to simplify, even though the "5" coefficient in 5x2 isn't bigger than 10 and thus can't have 10 as a factor.

Doing so gets us ((5x2)/10) + x + 2. If we like, we may want to rewrite the first term as (1/2)x2 to get (1/2)x2 + x + 2.
 Expressions under a square root sign are called radical expressions. These can be simplified by identifying square factors (factors that are themselves squares of an integer) and performing the square root operation on these separately to remove them from under the square root sign.


Let's tackle a simple example - √(90). If we think of the number 90 as the product of two of its factors, 9 and 10, we can take the square root of 9 to give the whole number 3 and remove this from the radical. In other words:

√(90)
√(9 × 10)
(√(9) × √(10))
3 × √(10)
3√(10)



, Some algebraic expressions require multiplying or dividing exponential terms. Rather than computing each exponential term and multiplying or dividing manually, simply add exponents when multiplying and subtract when dividing to save time. This concept can also be used to simplify variable expressions.


For example, let's consider the expression 6x3 × 8x4 + (x17/x15). In each occasion where it's necessary to multiply or divide by exponents, we'll subtract or add the exponents, respectively, to quickly find a simplified term. See below:

6x3 × 8x4 + (x17/x15)
(6 × 8)x3 + 4 + (x17 - 15)
48x7 + x2


For an explanation of why this works, see below:

Multiplying exponential terms is essentially like multiplying long strings of non-exponential terms. For example, since x3 = x × x × x and x 5 = x × x × x × x × x, x3 × x5 = (x × x × x) × (x × x × x × x × x), or x8.
Similarly, dividing exponential terms is like dividing long strings of non-exponential terms. x5/x3 = (x × x × x × x × x)/(x × x × x). Since each term in the numerator can be canceled out by a matching term in the denominator, we're left with two x's in the numerator and none in the bottom, giving us an answer of x2

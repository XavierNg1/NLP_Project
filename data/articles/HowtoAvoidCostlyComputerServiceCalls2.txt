 If you receive emails or instant messages from unknown contacts that contain links avoid clicking them.


Tip: copy the link into a google search to check validity.
 Unusual messages from friends that contain links should be validated before clicking. If a friend sends you a message such as "Checkout this awesome link: www.wikihow.com" ask them what it is before clicking.
 Before downloading executable files (.exe) or plug-ins from unknown sources run a quick Google search to verify the vendor and software.
 When a URL has been shortened using services such as bit.ly it's impossible to tell where it points on first glance. Use a service such as unshorten.com to find out where the link really goes.

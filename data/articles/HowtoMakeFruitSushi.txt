 Empty the rice into a large bowl then fill it up with water. Use your hands to wash the rice until the water appears milky white then use a strainer to remove the water.;
, Add water, rice, salt, and sugar inside a heavy bottomed saucepan and simmer the rice. Lower the heat and continue to cook the rice for 12-15 minutes.
 Pour some coconut milk into the rice after the rice has soaked up the water.
 Remove the rice from the pot and transfer onto a lined tray to allow it to cool down.
 Using a knife cut the fruit into long sticks just like sushi fillings are cut.
 Scoop some of the rice either with your hands or with a spoon into a rectangle like shape.
 Carefully put the strips of fruit about 2/3 away from the start of the rice.
 Once you've added all the desired fruits roll the sushi tightly but carefully into a log like shape making sure it dosent unravel.
 Place the sushi rolls onto a plate alongside thinly sliced cantaloupe as pickled ginger and fresh fruit pur√©e as soy sauce. Don't forget to eat with chopsticks!

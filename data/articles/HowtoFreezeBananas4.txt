 Do not attempt to mash the banana with the peel on.
 You might find it easiest to mash the banana in a food processor or blender, especially if you want a thinner puree, but bananas are soft enough to mash by hand. To mash bananas by hand, simply press down on them with a fork or spoon until they reach the desired consistency.
 One large banana makes about 1 cup (250 ml). Lemon juice preserves the banana longer, but you can also use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ascorbic acid mixed with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) water. Mix either the juice or acid mixture into the mashed banana until thoroughly combined., Place the mashed bananas into sealable, plastic containers approved for use with the freezer. Mark the current date on each container and how many bananas or cups of banana are in the container. Stored in this manner, bananas can remain good for a solid four months.
 It will be difficult to measure out the mashed banana if you do not thaw it first. If using it in a frozen recipe, you can wait until it is only partially thawed. If using it in a non-frozen recipe, however, you should wait until it is completely thawed.

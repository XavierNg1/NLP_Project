 A litmus test works best with gases that are dissolved in water (an aqueous solution). To achieve this on a small scale, you only need to wet the paper with water. When the gas touches the wet paper, some of it will dissolve into solution right on the test strip., You should do this part under a fume hood. Open the container of gas and allow some of it to come in contact with both red and blue litmus paper. Use all appropriate safety precautions for the gases you are testing., The papers react to gases in the same way that they react to liquids, except that the gas reacts more evenly across the entire surface of the paper. Record the color changes of each paper. Use the data to determine if the gas is an acid, a base, or neutral.If red paper stays red - Neutral or Acid
If red paper turns blue - Base
If blue paper turns red - Acid
If blue paper stays blue - Neutral or Base

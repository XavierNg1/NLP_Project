 You can tone up and build strength without any equipment at all - just using the weight of your body. Isometrics exercises involve contracting your muscles without actually moving. For example, you can stand right in front of a wall with your back against it and with your arms straight. Push your arms against the wall behind you. You'll feel your muscles contracting, but your arm itself won't have actually moved because the wall is in the way.
 Callanetics has been around a long time though it is not that well known. It tones up your muscles at a very deep level using tiny ultra-slow motion pulsing movements without using equipment (other than a chair or makeshift barre).Look Callanetics videos online or see if you can borrow a Callanetics book or DVD from your local library.
, Use the equipment you already have at home as small hand-weights. You can use soup cans (still with contents intact!) or water bottles (filled with water or sand). You can use these for any exercises where you would usually use small hand weights. If you use water bottles, start with water and then as you get stronger, you can progress to sand and then maybe to small pebbles or coins. Another alternative for kitchen hand-weights are those plastic milk or orange juice jugs filled with water. They are great because they have a handle to hold.
 It'll help you build muscles in your arms and chest when done properly.
 Donâ€™t buy an expensive hand grip trainer - squeeze a rubber ball or tennis ball as hard as you can instead.

 To save water, you should usually opt for the lightest cycle on your dishwasher. If your dishes are not extremely dirty, this should clean them thoroughly. The dishes you normally use in the week for eating, drinking, and cooking should come clean on a light cycle., Very dirty dishes, such as those used for heavy cooking or baking, may need a stronger wash. Usually, switching from a light wash to a normal wash should clean off most built up residue. Dishes with set in stains can be washed using a heavy wash. Greasy dishes would benefit from a hight-temp wash., Skipping the dry cycle saves energy. Unless you need to use the dishes immediately, allow them to air dry in the rack before putting them away.

  This shows the directors that you care.


Find where you will be auditioning and wait politely.
Smile softly and be calm.
Don't make rude or annoying noises or drum your fingers.
Wave to other auditioners.  If they are waiting as well and you are not in the same room as the people who are currently auditioning, speak softly to them and introduce yourself.
When you are called in, smile, hand in your form, and walk confidently inside.



Present your slate.  Make eye contact with the directors.
Smile and pause for about two seconds.
If you have accompaniment, wait for them to play your introduction.  If not, begin.
Sing clearly and with your best voice.
Smile and continue to make eye contact.
Give a slight bow and say "Thank you."
Go sit in the back.



Watch the director intently.
Copy their movements as best as possible.  If you do not understand, ask them politely to show you again.
If you still can't get it, don't worry.
Smile!  The directors care more about what is on your face than what your hands and feet are doing.  This will draw them in.



Do not say that you did a bad job.  Do not ask to go again.  Don't say anything about your performance (besides congratulating other auditioners) until you get home.
Act happy with yourself.
Don't forget anything before you go!  This will make you seem forgetful and childish.

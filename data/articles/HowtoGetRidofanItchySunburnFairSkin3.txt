 If you are experiencing what is known as the "Hell Itch"--extreme itching that usually sets in about 48 hours after a burn, a very hot shower may be the best course of action. The Hell Itch does not respond to other treatments, and is so persistent and severe it can lead to sleep deprivation, depression, aggressiveness, and suicidal thoughts.If no other treatment works, including those recommended by your doctor, you may choose to try this method. If you are under 18, talk to your parents first.
Take a shower in water that is turned up as hot as you can stand.Don't use soap or scrub your skin--the hot water will dry your skin out and soap will make this worse.
Continue with the extremely hot showers until the itching subsides (usually about two days).The hot showers work because the brain can only process one sensation at a time. The heat of the water activates the pain nerves, which will suppress or shut down the sensation of itching., If the itching is so bad you can't concentrate on anything else--you can't work, can't sleep--and feel like you might go crazy, your doctor may be able to help with an aggressive treatment. A high-potency steroid cream may reduce inflammation and calm the itching.These medications are available by prescription only, and can weaken your immune system and cause other serious side effects. They should only be used in the most extreme cases.

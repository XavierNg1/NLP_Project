 Remove the stockpot of soup from the heat source and carefully pour the soup into a special fat-separating pitcher.


Note that a "gravy separator" is essentially the same thing as a "fat-separating pitcher." Either pitcher will look like a large measuring cup with a spout extending out from the bottom.
Since this method relies on the use of a strainer built into the pitcher, it will only work for broths and liquids. Soups that contain pieces of rice, pasta, vegetable, or meat will not work since these solid chunks of food would be strained out along with the fat.
 Set the pitcher aside for 5 minutes or so. During this time, most of the fat should rise to the top of the soup.


The exact amount of time can vary depending on the amount of fat in your soup. Watch closely and wait until you see a visible layer of fat forming at the top of the pitcher before proceeding to the next step., Carefully pour the soup back into the stockpot or into a serving bowl. The liquid should pass through the spout and the fat should remain trapped inside the pitcher.

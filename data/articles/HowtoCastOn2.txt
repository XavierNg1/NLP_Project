 This will count as your first stitch. To make a slipknot, fold some yarn in half to make a loop in your non-dominant hand. Then, bring the tail end over the working end of the yarn so it crosses. Use the thumb and finger of your non-dominant hand to make a single loop, and poke your knitting needle through this loop. Gently tug on the yarn and yarn tail to tighten the knot.






;
, Push upward until you form a loop.
 The tip of the needle should be pointing towards your thumb.
 Make an upward motion with the needle as you do this.
 Make the loop snug, but do not make it too tight.
 Both the cast on loop and the slipknot should be the same size and tension. You may need to tighten or loosen the knots to do this.
 Each cast on equals one stitch. The slipknot also counts as one stitch.









Try not to make knots too tight, or you won't be able to knit into them later.

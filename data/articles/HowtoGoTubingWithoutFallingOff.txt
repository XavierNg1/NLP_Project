 Leaning back pulls the front end of the tube up, allowing for the tube to skim across the water and not be pulled under.;
, If you are barely gripping the handles, you may fly off when going around a corner or if you hit a big wave.
 If you have all your weight on the left side of the tube, you will likely tip to the left and fall over. If you balance in the center of the tube, you won't have that problem.
 If you're curving left, you don't want to put any weight on the left side. Try to shift your weight to the right, or do the opposite if you're turning right.
 Constant movement makes the tube swerve which can be a perfect situation for a wipeout.

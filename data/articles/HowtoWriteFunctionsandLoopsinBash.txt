 Type the following command at the command prompt: vi FunLoop.sh. This will create the file you are going to use as a script file and open it for editing.;
, Every shell script needs this to tell it what shell to run in. Type #!/bin/bash.
 You will need one to capture the choice entered by the user and one to set the directory based on the user's choice. Type directory="" and choice=0.
 It is a straightforward code and it has a name that is case sensitive. Name it menuList. Everything between the opening and closing brackets is any code you wish it to be.
 It should look like: menuList().
, It should look like this: clear.






echo "1. Run ls on my home directory."
echo "2. Run ls on the root directory."
echo "3. Run ls on the bin directory."
echo "4. Exit program."




,,, You should add runLS().
, ls -la $directory where $directory is the one specified by the menu choice.
,, while . Where $choice is the input from the user and 4 is the menu item to tell the program to close, -ne is a conditional operator used in bash shell scripting for number evaluation.
 Type in do.
 You have four menu items so you will need four if statements and a catch all for values that don't meet the menu items' requirements. Write the if statement as follows:





if then
$directory="~/"
runLS
elif then
$directory="/"
runLS
elif then
$directory="/bin"
runLS
elif then
clear
echo "Thank you for using list files"
sleep 3
exit
else
echo "Invalid choice, please try again"
fi
done




,, Type in: chmod u+x FunLoop.sh.

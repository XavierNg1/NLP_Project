 If a general wash did not work to remove all of the grime from inside the carboy, you should try doing a longer soak. Fill your carboy with a mixture of four ounces (118 ml) of household bleach for every five gallons (19 L) of water., Let the carboy soak in this solution overnight. This should only be done if you are using a glass carboy. Plastic will absorb the bleach, which may spoil your next batch of beer or wine., After the carboy has soaked in the bleach mixture overnight, dump out the mixture. Then, thoroughly rinse your carboy using warm water to ensure that all of the bleach has been removed.

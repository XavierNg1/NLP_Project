 In these games, everyone has a role; they can be an Innocent, a Sheriff, or a Murderer. There will be one Murderer and one Sheriff per game, and the rest are Innocents. The goal is for the Sheriff to catch and kill the Murderer, while the Innocents have to stay alive., The Innocents try to survive from the murder and try to help out the Sheriff. If the Sheriff dies, Innocents can pick up the sheriff's gun where he died and kill the murderer, meaning the game can still be won., As a Sheriff, your goal is to try to kill the murderer before he kills everyone - including you., As a Murderer, you try to kill everybody, even the Sheriff. Be careful of the Sheriff, though, or you'll be killed.

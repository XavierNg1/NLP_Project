 Use a small saucepan or kettle to heat 2 qt (2 L) of distilled water to 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).


Gently heat the water on the stove over a medium heat setting.
The water can be as hot as 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Avoid any temperature higher than that, however, since extremely hot water can be bad for your body.



Alternatively, you can break open four to five capsules of dry acidophilus or use 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of probiotic yogurt.
Acidophilus is a live culture and type of beneficial bacteria. When it is applied directly to the colon in the form of an enema, the bacteria can propagate more effectively and help the colon cleanse itself.
This type of enema can be especially helpful for those suffering with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, hemorrhoids, or colon cancer.
 Administer the enema as usual and retain it for at least 10 minutes before evacuating.


If you do not retain the enema for at least 10 minutes, the beneficial bacteria it provides may not be able to get deep enough into the colon to be effective.
Retaining it for more than 10 minutes will increase the effectiveness of the enema, but you should usually evacuate within 20 minutes.

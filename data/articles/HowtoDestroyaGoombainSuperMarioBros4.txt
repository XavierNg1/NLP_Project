 In the 2D versions of the game, you can throw Koopa shells at them. In the Super Mario 64 DS, you can even throw Bob-ombs at Goombas. To get a Koopa shell, jump on a Koopa; this will cause it to hide under its shell. Pick up the Koopa by approaching it and press/hold B (for Wii/U, approach the shell and press/hold 1).


You can also pick up Bob-ombs the same way, but make sure you’re close to a Goomba since Bob-ombs are activated once you touch it.
 Or in the case of carrying a Bob-omb, run to a Goomba! Keep pressing the B or 1 button to hold the shell or Bob-omb as you approach a Goomba.
 Once you’re near, and there’s no object between Mario and the Goomba, release the B or 1 button. This will send the item flying, hitting the Goomba square in the face, destroying it.

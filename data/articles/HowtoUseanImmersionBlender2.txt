 Glass can chip or shatter if it comes into contact with the blades of your blender. If this happens, you'll have to throw out your mixture, otherwise you could ingest glass, which can be deadly. The non-stick coatings on pans, too, can chip off into your mixture. This coating can be unhealthy if ingested.


The safest kind of mixing container for you to use with your immersion blender will be stainless steel., By lowering the motor of your immersion blender into your mixture, you could cause the motor to burn out, the electrical components to short out, or you could potentially electrocute yourself. Even with especially deep dishes, refrain from lowering the motor into or beneath your mixture., Always unplug your blender before cleaning it. Never immerse the motor of your blender in water when cleaning, but you can clean it with mild soap and a sponge or damp cloth. The blending shaft should be washed by hand in hot water and should also be cleaned with a mild soap.


When cleaning the blending shaft, be extra careful around the blades. These are very sharp, and can cut you easily., Immersion blenders are simple enough for children to use, and may be confused for a toy. This can be very dangerous, so you should store your blender in safe locations that are difficult for children to access, like in a high cupboard.

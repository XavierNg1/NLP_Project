 If you find out (either from your parents or another relative/friend) that your parents have been keeping a secret from you, try not to take it personally. Most likely your parents feel as though they are protecting you or doing you a favour by not keeping you informed.Or, it may also have something to do with your parents own personal hangups or insecurities.


For example, if one of your parents has a serious illness they may keep it from you for a while until they know more details. They are likely doing this to protect you, or because they are still processing the news themselves.
 Before responding, you should take some time to calm down and clear your thoughts. When you first find out that you have been left in the dark, you may feel upset, betrayed, or even angry. It is best not to react to the news from an emotional place. Instead, take some time to yourself so that you can collect your thoughts.If you react to the secret immediately, you may actually make the situation worse.
As you take some time away from the situation, you can also call a trusted friend to get some perspective and find out if you are reacting in a reasonable way.
 Your parents may be keeping secrets from you for a variety of different reasons. For example, they may cover up health issues or money problems so that they can maintain control over their daily lives. By admitting to you that they are struggling, they fear that you will drastically change their lifestyle. Many aging parents, for instance, fear being placed in a long term care facility.You could say "I understand that you want to stay in your own home as long as possible. In order to do this, I need to know if you need extra help. We could hire someone to clean your house, or have your meals delivered."
Let your parents know that you understand their position and that you want to help them.

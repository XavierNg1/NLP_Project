 You can make one meal in bulk and measure out portion sizes into mason jars to eat later in the week. They’re also freezable, so you can store food for longer periods of time. If you’re packing dinner to transport elsewhere, mason jars offer an elegant and portable presentation option., Since they’re already so gorgeous, those lunch salads will present beautifully for dinner. You can make them heartier by going with the optional protein choices, like adding the baked or grilled chicken. You can also substitute chicken for grilled shrimp or salmon to dress your salads up for dinner., Curry and rice will pack some robust flavors into your mason jar dinner. To make the curry, simmer the chicken, salsa, and curry powder or garam masala in a large skillet covered with a fitted lid over low heat for 30 minutes. Then remove the pan from heat and stir in the low- or non-fat yogurt and use two forks to shred the simmered chicken.Then divide 1/2 cup portions of the pulled chicken in wide mouth pint jars.
 Bring the rice, water, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan, then lower the heat and simmer until the rice is tender and has absorbed the water, or 20 to 30 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the cilantro and lime juice and zest.Add 3/4 cup of the rice over the chicken in each jar, then top with a lime wedge and cover the jar to store for up to five days or to transport. Make sure the chicken goes in the jar first, so the rice will be less likely to become soggy.
To reheat, microwave for 90 seconds, and enjoy dinner from the jar or pour its contents onto a shallow dish.

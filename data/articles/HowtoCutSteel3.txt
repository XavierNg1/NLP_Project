 Torches give off intense heat and light. When you use them to cut through steel, they also throw off sparks, which makes them a fire hazard. It’s imperative that you wear gloves and shaded eye protection in the shade range of #7 to #9. Wear a protective jacket used by welders. Don’t wear pants made of natural fibers and make sure they’re not cuffed (the sparks can get trapped in cuffs).Work in a well-ventilated room and, if necessary, wear a respirator.
Make sure there’s nothing flammable in the immediate vicinity, since the sparks could ignite the material., It’s ideal for metal that is 0.25-inch and thinner. These torches won’t warp thin metal, whereas the oxy-fuel torch might. Plasma torches make very clean cuts and are extremely efficient.


A plasma torch can cut through any conductive material, not just steel. The oxy-fuel torch is only able to cut steel.
 Oxy-fuel torches cut through far thicker materials than plasma. Use oxy-fuel to cut through any steel thicker than 1 inch (2.5 cm).It’s possible for an oxy-fuel to cut through up to 48 inches (120 cm) of steel. Steel plates, however, are usually 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick or less.Oxy-fuel torches make cuts with a smooth, square cut surface.


Do not use oxy-fuel torches around oil or grease. High-pressure oxygen tanks can react violently with them.
Acetylene is also a dangerous gas to work with. It is unstable over 15 psi, so try to keep it around 5 psi during use. Always store these tanks upright.

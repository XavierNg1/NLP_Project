 In some parts of the world human feces are used as fertilizer on crops. Ascariasis can be spread by ingesting fruits and vegetables that come in contact with roundworm eggs while growing or being harvested. It is best to avoid using human excrement as fertilizer.
 It is always a good idea to wash fruits and vegetables before eating especially if they may have come in contact with Ascaris eggs at some point., Peeling off the outer skin and cooking vegetables can also help ensure that ascariasis does not spread to humans. Typically eggs will be removed in the peeling process or killed while being cooked. This is of particular importance if you are eating crops that may have been in contact with soil contaminated with human fecal matter, often in the form of fertilization.

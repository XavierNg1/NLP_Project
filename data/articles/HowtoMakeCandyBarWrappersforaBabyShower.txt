You will find templates on http://office.microsoft.com that are specifically designed for Microsoft Word.
You can also perform a search for “Microsoft Word candy wrapper templates” and choose the template of your choice.
Make sure that the template size matches the size of the candy bar that you have chosen.
, If you like the images in the template, then you can keep them. Otherwise, delete them and replace them with clip art of your choice.



Change the size, color and content of the text according to your requirements.
Make sure to use the mother’s name and the date of the shower in the primary text box on the top of the label. For example, “Allison’s Baby Shower May 6, 2012.”

, Paper between 3 millimeters and 6 millimeters will capture the colors of your design while still being pliable enough to fold around the candy bars.
, Center the front of the candy bar under the main text of the wrapper.
 The bottom and top edges should overlap slightly.
 Trim the wrapper further, if needed.
, Place the bottom taped end beneath the top end and press the edges gently so that the double-sided tape makes a seal.

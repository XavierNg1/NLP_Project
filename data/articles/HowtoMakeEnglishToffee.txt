 Pour the sugar, vanilla essence and the water into a large pot and heat to 235 Fahrenheit (113 Celsius), stirring constantly. The sugar water should be slightly stiff, if you put a spoon in the mixture and pull it out again, the mixture should draw into strands rather than dripping.;
, If adding almonds, stir half of these in now.
 Immediately pour the mixture carefully onto the cookie tray, trying to achieve an even surface. Do not try to spread the molten toffee out with a tool, as the moving surface will cause sugar crystals to form and spoil the texture. If using almonds, sprinkle the rest of the chopped almonds onto the surface of the toffee.
 Once the tray is cool enough to touch put it in a freezer to cool it faster, as this helps stop crystals forming.
 You can now enjoy the toffee as it is, or coat it with chocolate for an even more decadent treat.

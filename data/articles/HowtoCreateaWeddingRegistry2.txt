 It is increasingly popular to have a registry for contributions to your honeymoon, as opposed to tangible gifts. Use a website such as Honeyfund to describe the honeymoon you’re planning, and offer guests the opportunity to pitch in towards your flight, accommodations, or another aspect of your trip., Another alternative to a traditional gift registry is inviting guests to donate in your name to a non-profit of your choosing. This can be done with little effort; contact a beneficiary organization directly and ask them how you can direct guests to donate.


This may be as simple as including a link to the beneficiary's donation page on your wedding website.
If you do go with a traditional gift registry, some registry hosting websites, such as The Knot, will donate to a charity of your choosing for each gift purchased through their website.
 The terms “bridal registry” and “wedding registry” are often used interchangeably, though some couples choose to have a registry for both the bridal shower and the wedding. Another option is to fore-go a traditional wedding registry altogether and having a bridal registry instead, perhaps only for attendees to your bridal shower.This can be a fun way to get smaller or more intimate gifts from your close friends. You can also still request specific items, such as guidebooks for your honeymoon, lingerie, or gift certificates for a pedicure before your wedding.

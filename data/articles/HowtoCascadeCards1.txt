 Take the deck in your dominate hand. Place your other hand below the deck. With your dominant hand, use your thumb to rifle through the deck. Stop about halfway through. Take one half of the deck in either hand., Set your cards on a flat surface. The two decks should be set side by side so the shorter ends of each deck face each other. The decks should be close enough that they're almost touching., Set your thumbs on the edges of the decks that are facing each other. Curl your remaining fingers around the edges of the deck that are facing outward.There is no precise way to secure the stacks with your fingers other than your thumb. Hold them in whatever way allows you to feel comfortable and in control.
 Pull your thumbs upward to create a slight arch in each deck. Then, gently tip each thumb backwards. This will cause the cards to fall inward, overlapping with one another. The cards are now shuffled.When you're done, the decks should be lying on your flat surface. The tips of the cards on each deck should overlap with one another.
 Place both your thumbs at the point where the cards overlap. Place your thumbs down firmly, as this helps secure the deck and then complete the cascade., Secure the edges of each deck by curling your middle, ring, and index finger around the edges. Lift the cards off the flat surface. Bend your hands downward slightly to create a mild arch with the cards.When you're done, your cards should form an arch. They should be connected at the center of the arch by the overlapping tips of each deck.
 All you need to do now is uncurl your thumbs. The cards should naturally cascade together.The cascade may not go smoothly the first time as it takes awhile to get a hang of the movements required. If your cards don't cascade, start over and try again.
 After cascading your cards, push the deck back together. Straighten your cards into a neat pile. If you want, you can repeat the process a few times to fully shuffle the deck.

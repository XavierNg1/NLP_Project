 Once you have developed the message of your pitch, you should being contacting sponsors. Using the data you collected about potential sponsors, you can conduct cold calls and emails to gauge interest. You will likely get many rejections with this method, but you may also get some meetings out of it. You can also utilize any connections that you may have with potential sponsors. If you know someone who works at a company, contact them about setting up a meeting.
 When you are arranging for the meeting, try to meet with someone who has influence over the outcome. You do not want to pitch to someone who has to relay the message to someone higher up. There is the chance that they may misrepresent your proposal.Try to make your initial contact be with someone who will be directly responsible for approving a sponsorship.
 Once you have your foot in the door with a company, arrange a meeting to present your event and a potential partnership. Practice your pitch ahead of time and make sure that you cover the information that will appeal to the potential sponsor. Work over the pitch with your colleagues and fine-tune your message in the days leading up to the pitch.Make sure that you set a time that will allow you to focus on the pitch. If you can, avoid scheduling it in the afternoon when you may be drowsy from lunch.
 When you give your pitch, you need to highlight the appeal of your event but also demonstrate how it will benefit the sponsor. Emphasize the ways in which your event will attract new customers, increase revenues and boost marketing. After the pitch, thank the potential sponsors for their time

 Rub a generous amount of petroleum jelly over the paint on your skin, using your fingers and applying firm pressure.









Keep the petroleum jelly restricted to the area contaminated by paint. If you let it spread too far past that area and onto clean skin, there is some risk of spreading the paint onto your previously clean skin, as well, causing the stain to spread.
Petroleum jelly is an oil product, so it is often effective against spray paints, which are largely oil-based, as well.
You could also use other beauty products that use petroleum jelly as their base. Vapor rubs and petroleum jelly products mixed with lotions and creams can even prove more effective due to the added oils and chemicals they contain.
 Wipe the paint and petroleum jelly off simultaneously by passing over them on the skin with a clean paper towel, working in even, straight strokes. Continue until all the petroleum jelly is gone.









You could also use a clean rag, but understand that this rag may end up being stained permanently by the paint.
 If you notice some change, but also see some spray paint left on your skin, repeat the process until all the spray paint has been removed.

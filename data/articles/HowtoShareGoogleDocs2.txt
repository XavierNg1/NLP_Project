 There are times when you want to make a document more accessible. You can give anyone with the link access or make the document entirely public.


You can limit the amount of editing power that anonymous users have over the document.
 This will open the Sharing window.
 This will expand the Sharing window with more options. You will also see a link that goes directly to the file.
 You will have three options for sharing the link with others:



On - Public on the web - Anyone can access the document, even if they don't have the link. Search engines will crawl the document, and it may appear on search results. No Google account is required.

On - Anyone with the link - Anyone that visits the link will be able to access the document. No Google account is required.

Off - Specific people - This reverts the document back to sharing with people that you specify (see the previous section).
 If you've chosen either of the "On" options, you'll be able to determine the level of editing power that anonymous visitors will have. If you don't want anyone to make changes, select "Can view" from the "Access" menu.


Since you're sharing the document with anyone that has the link, most people who open the document will be logged in anonymously. You won't be able to track their changes to the document.
 By default, any editors can add more people to the editor list, as well as change other users' permissions. You can lock the document down by selecting "Only the owner".


Click the "Change" link at the very bottom of the Sharing window to set who can add people and change permissions.
Only the owner will be able to delete the document completely.
 The link is located at the top of the Sharing window. Anyone with the link will be able to access the document. You can share your link via email, chat, SMS, or other methods.


You can use a URL shortening service if you need to tweet the link or want it to look cleaner.

 Gain a following on Twitter by participating. Send out at least 1 tweet a day.


Use relevant keywords in your tweets. This will help targeted followers find you. For example, if you run a spa service, use keywords such as "massage," "pedicure" and "facial" in your tweets.;
, Tweets should be interesting, informative and engaging. You can use tweets to drive people to your blog, website or other social networking site.


Use Twitter to give things away or provide coupons and discounts for your goods and services. You will easily attract Twitter followers targeted to your business if you offer them something they cannot get elsewhere.
 If you see something on Twitter that will be useful to your own target market, retweet it. This will also get the attention of the original tweeter, which is useful if they do not already follow you.
 Hashtags start with the number sign - # and then include a keyword or phrase. For example, if you tweet about Thanksgiving catering services, put #Thanksgiving2012 after your tweet. This will attract followers who are looking for Thanksgiving tweets.
 Follow anyone that has relevant content. They might follow you back, and their followers will get exposed to you as well when you retweet or use similar hashtags.

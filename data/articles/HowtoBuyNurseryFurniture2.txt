 It’s important that you do not buy or accept a used crib. Older cribs may not be up to current safety standards. They also could be damaged or in disrepair. Make sure you purchase a new crib from a reputable merchant and that the date of manufacture is displayed on the shipping package., A single function crib serves one purpose as a crib for your baby, while a convertible crib can transition into a toddler bed once the child grows. A single function crib will be cheaper initially, but a convertible crib can grow with your child and make the purchase a longer term investment.
 Many cribs are adjustable in height. This feature provides flexibility for both you and your child. Cribs with adjustable bed heights allow you to lower the height of the bed as your child grows and learns to stand up in the crib.
 Avoid finials, scrollwork, and drop-side cribs. Infants can become entangled in detail work, making such cribs unsafe. Drop-side cribs, which allow a parent to put down one side of the crib to get a child in or out, are no longer considered safe., Make sure the spaces between the crib’s slats are no more than 2 3/8 inches or 6 centimeters wide. Check for protrusions or abnormalities that could harm your baby such as corner posts, sharp edges, or screws and nuts that protrude., Don’t wait to buy a mattress. It’s critical that you purchase both the mattress and the crib at the same time. Legally the mattress has to be at least 27 ¼ inches or 69 ¼ centimeters wide and 51 5/8 inches or 131 centimeters long. It can’t be more than 6 inches or 15 ¼ centimeters thick., These all pose significant suffocation hazards for your child and should be completely avoided. Remember that nothing should go in the crib except for the baby.

 Before working with the area that suffered a scratch, be sure that your hands are clean and disinfected. Wash your hands using soap and warm (or hot) water for at least 20 seconds. Be sure to clean between your fingers and under your fingernails. Then rinse your hands well with clean water., Use clean running water from your faucet to rinse the cat scratch and the area around it.Avoid overly hot water, which may worsen any bleeding that is present.
 Carefully wash the area of the scratch with a gentle soap. Try to wash areas near the wound as well as the scratch itself (for example, if the scratch is on your forearm, it may be helpful to wash your entire forearm, not the scratch alone.) After washing, rinse completely with clean water from the faucet.Do not scrub the wounded area during washing, as this could add further injury (bruising) to the injured tissues.
 You should treat the scratch with an antiseptic ointment.A triple antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin can be used; these ointments contain neomycin, an antibiotic that is very effective in allowing cut injuries to heal.Triple antibiotic ointment can be applied to the wound three times daily.Bacitracin is a good alternative for anyone who has an allergy to common triple antibiotic ointments.
Oral antibiotics should not be necessary for a superficial scratch from a housecat., The scratch wound should be fairly superficial if you are treating it at home, so there should be no need to bandage the area. Keep the scratch clean while it heals, but allow it to be exposed to fresh air.

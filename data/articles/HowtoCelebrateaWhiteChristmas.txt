 Of course, receiving presents is great but giving fills you with a joy in your heart unlike anything else. This is rather cliché but it is true. Wrap your gifts with beautiful shiny paper and silky ribbon. Invest in the prettiest things to embellish your presents. Opening presents on a snowy day is the most cozy family feeling you can experience.;
, Ask your family to come outside. Separate yourselves into teams of equal ability in age and fitness. Roll and throw snowballs. When someone is hit, they are out. The team who has all of their players out first loses and the opposing team wins. This is the most fun thing to do on a White Christmas. Remember to wrap up to keep warm!

, Be imaginative! Decorate your Christmas pudding with a blanket of snowy-white royal icing. Sprinkle the Christmas stollen with a little extra icing sugar. Be creative with your centrepiece, such as placing dusted holly berries around your turkey with icing sugar too. It creates the snowy Christmasy feel you'll enjoy.
 This helps to create the snowy Christmassy feel you are looking for and will fill everyone's hearts with delight. You could even welcome those family members who love rough and tumble or practical jokes with a snowball in the chest on their arrival.
 You could even get a white Christmas tree for a change. Make sure your Christmas tree fits the white theme you want, overall.
 Many people around the world don't experience even the slightest dusting of snow at Christmas, so embrace it while you have it. Of course, most of all, enjoy your White Christmas and let be one to remember!

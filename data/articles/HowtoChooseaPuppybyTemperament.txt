A responsive puppy is adaptable and binds well with humans, which makes it a good choice for a first-time dog owner.
A nervous or shy puppy is unpredictable, and not a good choice for families with children or other busy households.
An aggressive puppy is dominant, sometimes unpredictable and does best in a household without children or other pets.
An independent puppy is stubborn and best suited to an outdoor life.;

An aggressive dog will resist your handling and petting, will growl and bite your hand or the leash, and bark and lunge at everything.

Nervous and aggressive dogs require an experienced dog owner and a lot of attention to keep them in line, while an independent dog is best suited to be a working dog such as a guard dog, sheep dog, or hunting dog.

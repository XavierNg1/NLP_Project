 Your body is your life, so keep it in top working condition. Train correctly, regularly, and intelligently. George Foreman tried to return to the ring late in his career and appeared out of shape and unprepared. Don't make the same mistake. Get injuries taken care of and rested before jumping into the ring and risking your career. Avoid drugs, alcohol, and other unhealthy lifestyle choices.
 If you want to stay on top of the fighting game, you're going to have to keep fighting. Taking too much time off might allow people to forget your skills and let you slip in people's estimation of your talents. Treat your training as a job and your fights as a promotion. Constantly work toward the next victory and the next rung on the ladder.
 Few fighters will retire undefeated. If you're beaten, go back to the gym and get training. Do your best to forget about the losses, and avoid becoming overconfident about your victories. A fighter should always be eager to prove that he's the best. Challenge fighters that are better than you to continue honing your skills and get better.


Michael Jordan used to tape negative criticism (even if it wasn't that negative) to his locker to motivate himself for games. A good fighter will adopt a similar attitude. Prove yourself to the crowd, to the other fighters, and to yourself.
 Eventually, a career as a fighter will end if you don't make it to the top. Too many losses or too many periods of inactivity will result in lost sponsorships and a demotion in the prestige of your fights. To maintain a career as a fighter, you have to seek championship fights and defend your titles against the best fighters in your division.

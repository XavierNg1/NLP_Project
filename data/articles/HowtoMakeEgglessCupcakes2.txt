 Turn on your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Take a 12 hole muffin tin and grease and flour it. You could also line the muffin pan with cupcake liners or just use cooking spray.You can also spray the cupcake liners so they peel away easily from the cupcakes.
 Place the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and whisk to combine them. You shouldn't be able to see any lumps and the cocoa should be evenly distributed so the mixture is a light brown color. Put these dry ingredients in the bowl:1 1/4 cups (156 g) of all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (40 g) of cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoons of salt

, Put 2 mashed bananas and 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar into a separate large bowl. Stir them together. Stir in the following wet ingredients:1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (82 g) of vegetable oil
1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

, Add a little of the dry ingredient mixture to your large bowl of wet ingredients and stir it together, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and stir the batter until there aren't any lumps or pockets of flour.If you want a little crunch in your cupcakes, you can add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts. If you want a stronger chocolate flavor, add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.
 Fill the muffin liners or holes so that they're three-quarters full of batter. Bake the cupcakes for 15 to 17 minutes in your preheated oven. A cake tester should come away clean if you poke the center of a cupcake with it. If not, let them bake for a few more minutes and then test them again.Let the cupcakes cool completely on a wire rack before you frost them with a frosting or icing of your choice.

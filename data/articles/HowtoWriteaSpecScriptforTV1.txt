 Choose a TV series to write about that you enjoy watching and feel in tune with. Consider different genres and decide which one you feel you'd be more apt to write. Opt for a currently-running show that is popular with both audiences and critics, but that you are not trying to work for.Note that spec scripts can also be pilot episodes for new shows.;
, To really get to know the show that you will be writing about, look online for scripts. Make sure that the scripts are not just transcripts of episodes, which essentially present the dialogue without stage directions and descriptions. Visit a site like http://www.simplyscripts.com/tv.html to see what scripts are available, most for a small fee., Even if you are already a fan of the show, make a point of watching as many episodes as you can to note all of the integral information and details. Consistency is important in television shows, particularly with regard to character development. Take note of important details about characters, like:.


Catchphrases (for example, Homer Simpson saying "D'oh!" on The Simpsons)
Phobias (the character of Sheldon Cooper on "The Big Bang Theory", as an example, has several phobias, including germs and birds)
Habits (e.g. excessive coffee consumption by the titular characters on "Gilmore Girls")
Vices (for instance, Agent Booth's gambling addiction on "Bones")

, Find a creative way to brainstorm and organize your ideas before writing the script. Use a whiteboard to write things as they pop into your head and erase them when they not longer fit into your vision. Buy note cards to write down individual thoughts in a non-linear way and organize them into a cohesive story.Different color note cards can be helpful in visualizing elements by tone (e.g. comedic, dramatic, informative, neutral) or organizing plots (e.g. main plot and sub-plots).

 Let the professor know that you are open to earning extra credit for the class, especially if you have missed a class or are trying to make up an assignment you missed. Talk to them about extra assignments you can do for credit. Ask them if there are events you can attend that would count as extra credit. This will show them you are committed to doing well in their class., If the professor mentions an event on campus that they are hosting or are involved with, make an effort to attend. Sign up for any initiatives put on by the professor. Participate in campus events the professor is a part of to show them you want to be supportive., While you may want to be friendly with your professor, do not overstep their boundaries. Respect their time and space as your professor. Do not try to contact them outside of class using their phone number or private email. Maintain a professional demeanor with the professor so they respect you as their student.Being respectful of the professor-student relationship does not mean you cannot be friendly or chatty with the professor. It just means you should be aware of the boundaries of the relationship and abide by them.

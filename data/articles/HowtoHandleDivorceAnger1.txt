A therapist can help you to identify the sources of your anger and learn healthy strategies for dealing with your anger., Journaling can be an effective way to express your anger and to understand the reasons behind your anger as well. By simply writing about how you feel, you may start to notice patterns and you can use these patterns to figure out what triggers your anger regarding your divorce.Try making a list of everything about your ex that makes you feel angry. What does your ex do or say that makes you feel angry? Then, for each item, try to identify at least one potential solution that you can work towards as a long-term goal.
For example, if you feel angry at your spouse for cheating on you, then you might decide that a possible solution is to forgive your spouse for this offense. Keep in mind that you do not have to achieve this goal overnight. Check your progress once per month to see how you are doing.
 Sharing your feelings with a friend or family member can also be a good way to express your emotions.

 Instead of surrounding yourself with people who give you blanket praise, find people who are honest with you. Ask them for honest feedback on your projects, work, or hobbies.Honest feedback and constructive criticism helps you become better at what you do. You can’t grow if you are surrounded by people who give you empty praise.
 One way to help you get over your praise addiction is to stop trying to get people to praise you. Most praise addicts have become adept at receiving praise without asking for it directly. Break yourself of this indirect or direct praise seeking habit.Don’t ask people how you did, how they like something you did, or even mention things you have done to others. Stop going to others for validation in your accomplishments.
You may need to avoid talking to certain people, like your friends who always give you praise.
You may want to spend a weekend focusing on yourself and staying away from others to eliminate your need for praise.
 Since praise addicts feel so much envy and jealousy, start trying to break those feelings by praising others when they deserve it. When someone you know succeeds, instead of feeling jealous, celebrate it.Celebrating someone else’s accomplishments can help you replace negative thought patterns with positive ones.
 Every accomplishment you finish does not need praise. Some things, like going to work or doing the dishes, should be normal behavior. Normal behavior shouldn’t be praised since it’s what you should be doing as part of your everyday life.Save praise for things that are above and beyond. Only give yourself praise when something extraordinary is accomplished.

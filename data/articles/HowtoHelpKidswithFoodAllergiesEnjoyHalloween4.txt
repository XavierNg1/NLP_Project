 A corn maze is a path carved through tall fields of corn. The corn reaches a height above which most people, and certainly most children, cannot see. Escaping the corn maze is a fun challenge and a non-traditional Halloween adventure. Your food-allergic child and their friends will have a great time navigating the corn maze., Kid-friendly haunted houses are a great way to spend Halloween. Instruct your child to invite a friend, or group of friends. They can still dress up and admire each other’s costumes, but instead of going trick-or-treating, they will get to visit the haunted house for some spooky chills and thrills., A Halloween party gives your kid the chance to enjoy Halloween in the comfort of their own home. With you (and, if you choose, other parents) controlling the food, your child will definitely avoid foods to which they are allergic. Your party could feature any number of fun activities for your child and their friends, including:Reading a scary story.
Watching a scary or Halloween-themed movie.
Knocking about a piñata filled with allergen-free treats.
Coloring pictures of ghosts, witches, and monsters.
 Many municipalities offer special Halloween activities that have nothing to do with trick-or-treating or eating food which may or may not cause an allergic reaction in your child. Check your community calendar for Halloween-themed events including:Zoo tours.
Artistic events.
Haunted museums.
Plays or dramatic performances.

 Use a brush meant for lip liner, as this can also work to define eyeliner. Use a clean brush to shape your eyeliner, blotting out any uneven edges and pushing the line upward more. Use the brush tip to draw over the top of the line running along your lash line. Then, use the brush to outline your wings to smooth out any uneven edges.
 If you smeared your makeup at all during the process of applying eyeliner, grab a q-tip. Dip the q-tip in a small amount of makeup remover. Gently dab out the smeared portions with the tip of the q-tip.








If your wings are asymmetrical, you can also use the q-tip to push them into more similar shapes.
 If you frequently apply eyeliner, try using a makeup removing pen. You can buy these at a local supermarket, drug store, or beauty store. These can easily be used to trace over unwanted smudges or uneven portions of your eyeliner. They can be particularly helpful if you're just starting to apply eyeliner, as you'll be prone to making mistakes.

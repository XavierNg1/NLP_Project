 At night you can go do something else but you must come back when it's day! (In-game day and night.);
, Acting mysterious or strange will automatically get people to kill or eliminate you. Also, when ANYBODY private messages you or whatever asking you what your role is, say you are a camper. Make sure you sure SOUND like it! You can watch other campers do the same and copy their methods if they are doing really good.
 If someone asks who you are, just say you're a camper and that's it. Say it's pretty boring and don't let them try to drag anything else out of you!

, Only tell the ones that FOR SURE are campers and you have real proof/reasonable reasons to back that up!

, You can lie to all the other players, though!

, Are some people on for a while at night and then go off or stay on and then at day, they leave? That's most likely a slasher!


Is anyone on the entire time but aren't talking, especially during the day but might be only private messaging SOME people? They're probably slashers!

,, The slashers will tell each other you know too much and they'll kill you off! So whenever you are going to tell people stuff like that and you're sure the slashers are going to kill you, have the cop protect you! Don't know who the cop is? You can ask others!

, Only do majority voting (vote for the person with the most votes so far) when people (larger amount of campers than slashers left) have good enough back-up/evidence!

, This makes you a good victim to kill off for the slashers!

, This works, too, because sometimes all the other slashers are dead already and every night nobody's been attempted to be killed. Eliminate all the offline people, then!

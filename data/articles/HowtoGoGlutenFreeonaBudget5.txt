 If you can prepare your own meals in advance, you eliminate the need to search high and low for gluten-free lunch options.


You can avoid paying a premium for gluten-free foods simply by being prepared. Bring a meal from home. Oftentimes, you can make a week of gluten-free lunches at home for the cost of 1 or 2 gluten-free lunches at a specialty cafe.
 Composing meals of whole, fresh ingredients not only eliminates the need to check ingredient labels, but it also saves you the cost of buying specialty gluten-free products.


Chop up your own vegetables for soups and stir-fries, and make your own sauces or dressings out of juice, cream, gluten-free spices, fruits, or fresh herbs.
Combining a cup of orange juice and olive oil with freshly minced garlic and ground pepper when you are making a family salad is much cheaper than purchasing a line of gluten-free dressings.

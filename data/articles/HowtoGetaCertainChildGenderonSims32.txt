 All Sim pregnancies have a small chance of twins. You can't guarantee it, but taking these steps makes a multiple birth much more likely:Get the Fertility Treatment lifetime reward for one or both parents (getting it for both is likely to result in triplets).
During pregnancy, have the mother read pregnancy books, watch KidZone TV, and listen to children's music. You may do all three at the same time.
If you have the Showtime expansion, wish for a large family with a genie, or drink a procreation elixir., Find a Sim that's at least level 5 in the Medical career track (Resident or higher).Have the pregnant Sim have a friendly conversation with this doctor and ask to determine the gender of the baby. You will get a popup saying that you are expecting a boy or a girl. This prediction is always accurate â€” but only for one baby.


The pregnant Sim needs to be visibly pregnant before this option appears.
 As described above, eat watermelons for a girl or apples for a boy. If you're lucky and end up with twins (or triplets), this increases the chance of getting the gender you want for the second child.


For example, if the doctor predicts a boy, eat melons to increase the odds of a girl. One baby will be guaranteed to be a boy, but if he has a twin, there's a high chance it will be a girl.

 Don’t be afraid to reach out to the people around you and ask for help if you are struggling. Sometimes boring homework is actually homework that you find difficult. Take the time to ask for help.Help is available all around you. You can ask your teachers for help at school, your parents or siblings for help when you get home, or a classmate who might be able to explain the homework to you.
 It always helps to have a second pair of eyes go over your work and help check for any mistakes. Ask your parents or an older sibling to look over your homework before you put it away for the night.


Your checker can also help keep you on track to getting your homework done. For example, if you ask your mom to check your homework at 8:00 PM, you are committing to having your homework finished by that time.
 Sometimes the best way to get through boring homework is to do it with a friend. Find a classmate you can do your homework with to help keep each other motivated and on task.For extra motivation, you could start a challenge with your homework buddy. For example, you could compete to see who can get the highest grade on the next test.
Be cautious when picking a homework buddy. You want to find someone who helps you focus and not someone who distracts you.
 When you finish making your homework plan, share it with your family at home. By sharing your plan with the people around you, you’re making a commitment to finish the work and you’re asking those people to hold you accountable.


Be specific with your plan. Tell your family exactly when, where and what homework you’ll be doing. For example, instead of saying, “I’m doing homework!” you can say, “I’m studying for my math test in my room for the next hour. Can someone check on me when the hour is up?”

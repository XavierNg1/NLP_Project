 It’s okay if you don’t bake cookies this year or decorate your house on December 1. The holidays rarely turn out picture-perfect for anyone, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy them for what they are.If you feel underwhelmed when the holiday season rolls around, you’re not alone – many adults feel the same way. When you accept that the holidays probably won’t live up to your childhood memories, you’ll have an easier time finding small things to enjoy throughout the season.
 Early in the holiday season, sit down and make a list of everything you want to accomplish. Include things like shopping for gifts, cooking or baking, visiting family, and volunteering. Then write out a schedule of when you’ll tackle each task. This will help you avoid doing everything at the last minute and getting stressed out.If creating a timeline is overwhelming for you, ask a friend or family member to help you.
Get your shopping done early in the season, so you won’t have to contend with last-minute crowds.
If you’re bringing food to any get-togethers, look for recipes you can make ahead of time and freeze until you need them., Decide ahead of time how much you’re comfortable spending on gifts, and stick to that number. Budgeting will help protect your finances if you’re prone to overspending during manic episodes. If you’re worried about sticking to your budget, ask a friend to come shopping with you to keep you on track. Another tactic is to bring only the amount of cash in your budget, and leave other payment methods at home.

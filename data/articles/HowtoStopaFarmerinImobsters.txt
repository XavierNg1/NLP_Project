Cows with Delusions/Wannabes

These "Farmers" are the easiest to get rid off, to know if your farmer is a wannabe they fall into the following;
They care about their stats
They are scared of the hit list
They are scared of clans
They are getting farmed themselves.


Max them for a few days and then tell them that it will continue unless they stop.
Griefer

These are a bit harder to deal with but can still be handled. To know if you farmer is a griefer they fall into the following;
They max hit list you throughout the day
They farm you even if you have no money on you
They constantly taunt you


To deal with them just don't entertain yourself, give them no response whatsoever. They will get bored of you soon and will leave you alone.
Farmer

Just like the griefer they are a bit hard to deal with but not impossible. To know if you have a farmer they fall into the following;
They take your money constantly, some of them even figure out when you get paid.
If they do not get money the first time they will leave you alone (unless you are dealing with an exp farmer)
They are not scared of clans and will sometimes war two or more at once.
Have $0/hour income


Beef up your defence, this is a great way to handle a farmer and the only way to handle an exp farmer. If they can not steal your money (or get exp) they will leave you alone.;
, Deny that and we will find a better cow (but we make check up on you later)

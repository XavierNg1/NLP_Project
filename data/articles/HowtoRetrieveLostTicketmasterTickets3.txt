 If you’ve misplaced the email that confirms that your friend, family member, or other acquaintance has transferred their tickets to you, they will have to cancel the transfer request so the transaction can go through again. The transaction can only be cancelled if you haven’t accepted the tickets yet.If you’ve already accepted the tickets, you should be able to find them in your Ticketmaster account.
To cancel the transfer, your friend should log into their Ticketmaster account and go to the Orders tab. They simply have to click on the corresponding order number and click “Cancel Transfer” at the top left.
 Once your friend has cancelled the ticket transfer, they’ll be able to send them to you again. Re-transferring the tickets will issue another email to your account that provides a link for accessing the tickets.To transfer the tickets, your friend should click on the appropriate order number again and click the Transfer button once more.
 When you receive the email about the ticket transfer, simply follow the link to the tickets. You can then print out the tickets so you have them to take with you to the event.

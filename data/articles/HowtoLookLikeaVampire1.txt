 Vampires are supposedly undead and only come out at night. This means their skin is usually paler than the average color of human skin. For a paler complexion, apply a foundation that is lighter than your skin tone. Use a foundation that is one or two shades paler than your skin.Foundation makeup typically comes in a variety of thicknesses and styles, including powder or cream. For vampire purposes use the thicker foundation.
Apply foundation in the center of your face and work toward your jawline. Blend using your fingers or a brush, according to the foundation you're using.
If you have a dark complexion, don't worry! Vampires can have all different sorts of skin tones. Just remember that you're supposed to keep out of the sun, so you want to avoid looking like you have a dark tan.;
, Vampires are dramatic and nocturnal looking. They also can be hundreds of years old. You want to look like you might have seen things nobody could possibly have seen. To pull this off, use dark eyeliner and possibly shadow to pull off the right look.



Apply eyeliner and use a small amount of dark purple eye shadow with black mascara. This will help your eyes "pop" a little more than normal, giving you a dramatic look.
Light red eye shadow around the eyes is also good. This hints at the connotations of you looking undead or bloody.
For a more dramatic look, use darker eye shadow on the top of your eyes, and lighter eye shadow underneath your eyes., The lips are usually the most vibrant part of vampire makeup. Depending on your complexion and intended look, use somewhere between a bright red and blood red.


Go for a basic matte style. If preferred, use lip gloss instead of lipstick.

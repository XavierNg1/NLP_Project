 You can do this simply by taking a one gallon bucket and gauging the length of time it takes for the bucket to fill. If your one gallon bucket fills in one minute, and you take a 15 minute shower, you will use an estimated 15 gallons of water (15 minutes x 1 gallon/minute = 15 gallons)


The goal of a navy shower is to reduce the amount of water you use to about 10-11 gallons. To reach this goal you must first understand your average water consumption.;
, Using the information you have gathered about the flow rate of your shower, determine the amount of water on average you use. You can do this by multiplying the amount of water used in a minute by the total minutes on average you shower.


The typical flow rate of a shower is approximately four gallons per minute. If you have difficulty measuring your flow rate for some reason, use this number to predict the total gallons used.
 You can install a "flow controller" from a local hardware store to make your navy shower even more efficient. If conservation is your goal, this option is a worthy addition.
 You can also use it to shave.
 Step into the shower and quickly get yourself fully wet before turning the shower off. Use your hands or a washcloth to fully douse your body before turning off the water.
 Perform this while your shower is off by using a loofah, washcloth, or your hands.It's a good idea for you to scrub yourself firmly. You will not have the benefit of running water and its additional cleansing effect.









Perform your washing quickly, especially if you have an inefficient water heater. Waiting too long can create unpleasant variances in the temperature.
 Now that you've finished washing yourself thoroughly, rinse yourself off with a short blast from the shower.
 Using a short blast to ensure your hair is clear of shampoo and sufficiently wet, turn the shower off while lathering your hair. When you're finished applying your conditioner, turn the water on and quickly rinse off.

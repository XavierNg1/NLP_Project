 Also known as the alveolar trill, this technique is used in the Spanish language for the letter erre and comes more easily to some than others. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, but you cannot flutter tongue if you cannot roll your R's. See How to Roll Your "R"s for directions.;
, Now comes the hard part. While keeping you lips and cheeks steady, roll your R's and blow a steady stream of air at the same time.
 This should produce the characteristic "FrrFrrr" sound of flutter tonguing.
 It is most difficult to use it on the higher notes, and still quite challenging on the lowest.

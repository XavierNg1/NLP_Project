 Type Disney into the search bar on Youtube. After searching, scroll down the page to find Disney’s official channel. Change the filter tab in the upper left corner to channels if you can’t find it. Scroll through their list of video uploads and playlists to see if they have the show you want.Because Disney’s official channels don’t have many full episodes, it is best for getting a taste of old shows.;
, If you have a show in mind, enter the show’s name in the search tab. Include the words “full episodes” to find the episodes rather than clips. Some videos will contain many episodes in a row. Other times, episodes are split up into several videos and may be organized in a playlist.


For example, type “Hannah Montana full episodes” to specify full episodes posted of Hannah Montana.
This is an easy to use option perfect for anyone who wants to watch full episodes on a trustworthy, familiar site.
 If you want to find a specific starting point or episode, search for the title of the episode or include the season and episode number in your search. For example, if you want to watch the first episode of Hannah Montana, either search "Hannah Montana Season 1 Episode 1" or "Lilly, do you want to know a secret?" If the episode is on YouTube, it will come up during one of these searches.


TV databases and other sites, including Wikipedia, often contain a list of episodes grouped by season with a brief synopsis. Use this to help find specific episodes.

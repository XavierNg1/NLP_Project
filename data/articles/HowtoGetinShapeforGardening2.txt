 This will help to warm up your muscles. After a few weeks, you may no longer need to do this because your muscles will be strong enough to handle the strain. .
 Trade in short-handled tools for long handed tools and learn to use them with a straight back. Engage your core muscles before any pulling or pushing motions.
 Bend your knees and plant a foot either right or left in the direction you are raking. Devote the same amount of time to raking from the right side as raking from the left side.

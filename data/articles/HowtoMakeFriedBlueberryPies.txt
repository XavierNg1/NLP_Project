 Don't roll it too much, just enough so you can fold it in half evenly once some filling has been added. There's no set size that the pie must be, as you can use your own discretion making them as big or small as you choose as y


Sprinkle a little flour under the dough, to prevent it from sticking to the work surface.;
, Put a little water on the edges of the biscuit or pie dough, then fold into a pie shape. You now have the basic pie shape. Pinch the edges tightly, to ensure that no pie filling can escape.
  Do this to the remaining dough to complete all of the pies.
 Add enough to lightly cover the surface of the pan. Move the pan to spread the oil around.  This will prevent from sticking to the pan.
 Cook both sides. Wait until the pies turn golden brown and not too crispy or soft, on each side, flipping over with a spatula when one side is sufficiently browned.
 Maybe consider putting a paper towel underneath and on top of them to drain off some of the oil.
 While you're waiting, you can make glaze, but that's optional.
,,  Mix every tablespoon added, adding just enough until it gets creamy.
 If you choose to refrigerate the pies, microwave them to heat them up as well as melt the glaze a little for 15-30 seconds.
 Now you can eat those pies.

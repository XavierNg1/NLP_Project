“Set Lock Screen”: This option will set the photo as your wallpaper only when the device is locked.
“Set Home Screen”: This option will set the photo as your wallpaper only when your device is unlocked at the home screen.
”Set Both”. This option will set the photo as you wallpaper on both your lock and home screen.
”Perspective Zoom On/Off”. When on, this will automatically adjust your photo to fit the screen so that the photo scrolls slightly as you tilt your device.
”Cancel”: This will return you to your previous location without setting the wallpaper.

 Place it in front of you with the short side facing you., Take the top of the paper and fold towards you creating two equal halves.


Many art teachers describe this fold as a “hamburger” fold because it is the shape of a hamburger after you fold it.
 Bring the right corner of the paper over to the left corner. Then crease the fold. Make sure that you create a clean crease. This creased line will be very important in your next step.
 There should be a crease down the center from folding it horizontally and then unfolding.
 Take the right corner and fold it over making sure that the edge of the paper follows the crease you’ve just created. Now do the same with the left corner. Fold it over making sure that the edge of the paper follows the crease you’ve just created. Make sure to keep them even.

If you want to size the hat to fit a smaller or bigger head, fold both sides of the hat in by an inch or so (depending on the size you want), before you fold up the bottom flap.
 Now you have your hat. Wear it however you like. Place it with the flat side forward for a pirate look. Place it with the flat side to the side of your head and you have a deli dinner hat.


If you want to make your hat more secure, you can tape the two sides you just folded up.
 Use feathers, scrap paper, markers, or any other arts and crafts materials you might have at home.

 For a C1 wormhole, you should use a small tower, and for a C2 a medium, or if you've got loads of extra money, a large faction should do fine, such as minmatar or amarr towers. Have your scout remain in the hole and direct the industrials to a fresh moon and have them cloak when it's not their shift. For equipment, bring the following:


Corporate Hangar Array
Defense batteries (don't bother with e-war batteries unless you know what you're doing with them.)
Ship Assembly Array
Around two sleeper site running ships
Gas ventures and replacements
Scout ships with strong probes for tracking down intruders
Combat ships (t2/faction cruisers with frig support. Try the Deimos, Vigilant, Ashimmu, Curse, Zealot, and Gila.)
Industrials
PI equipment

, Begin onlining the tower and have your scout continue to run sweeps. Fuel it and set a force field password.
, This is to ensure that you didn't stumble into someone's trap; some WH dwellers will wait for a tower to online only to hold the inhabitants hostage for a payment. Do not give into the payment unless it vastly under the prices of your tower and module cost. If you get caught, simply haul your equipment away when they go offline. (Use your watchlist!)

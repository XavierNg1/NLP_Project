 Consider asking the opinion of your close friends. Your close friends (not mutual friends) may be able to give you a lot more insight and perspective than you have. This is because they’ve probably had the benefit of observing the relationship, rather than participating in it.Ask your friends if they think she’s using you.
Ask your friends if they think that you are confused about the nature of the relationship. They may say that you think that it’s a romantic relationship while she thinks that you are just friends. They might also confirm your suspicion that you’re being used.
Realize that your friends will probably encourage you to end the relationship.
Tell your friends to keep your comments in confidence.
 You should also think about whether you share many friends with her or are in the same social circles. This could be a great tip off as to the actual status of your relationship. Consider the following:


If you’re in the same social circle, consider how she treats other friends. Is this a pattern, or is this something unique to your relationship with her?
If you’re not in the same social circle and don’t share any mutual friends, this could signal that the relationship for her means less than you hoped. This could be especially true if she does not introduce you to any of her friends., If you share mutual friends, you need to be careful about sharing your thoughts with them. Talking to mutual friends could not only create tension between you and the girl, but between you and your mutual friends.Discussing your relationship with mutual friends could be construed as gossip.
Talking about your relationship with mutual friends could lead your friends to abandon you and take her side.
Speaking about your relationship with mutual friends is inappropriate unless you’ve gotten permission from the girl.

 Biscuits would be good because cookies are too textured. Also, Oreos are delicious/perfect too!
, This is because it is practical to use, and there's no mess, unlike water-based icing, or tubed icing which can be hard to squeeze out, plus you will find it hard getting just the right colors and no colors you don't need for this!, If you're using a knife, don't use a sawing motion, so it's better to use a sharp knife by yourself, but use a blunt one with children. Also, if you have one especially for pumpkin carving, use that. Just make sure it will be able to cut when pressed onto the Rolling Fondant Icing., Then, roll it over your cookie, and cut round the edge and a curve where the black head has to go, and then trim it just under a centimeter so it doesn't reach right to the edge., Roll that out and cut it around the edge, and about 1/2 a centimeter away from the curve of the red body! Again, like with the red, cut just under a centimeter away from the edges so you can see there's a delicious cookie/biscuit/Oreo/whatever you're using underneath it., Splodge it on the red body, and then get some minstrels/choccy buttons, and use the honey as glue for the spots. Remember Symmetry!, These could be white with a black spot, the other way round or colored!

 Look for the Facebook app on your device’s home screen or app drawer, and tap it.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in again. Enter your registered email address and password on the fields provided, and tap “Log in” to access your account.
 Tap on the three vertical lines at the top left corner of the screen to open the Main Menu of the app.


On the menu, tap your profile name, which is the very first thing you’ll see on the menu.
 Scroll down your profile page to the bottom to find the status you want to delete. The more you scroll down, the more statuses will be loaded on the page.
 After finding the status you want to delete, tap the down arrow at the upper-right corner of the post. A dialog box will appear.


Scroll down the options in the dialog box, tap “Delete.” Tap “Delete” again when prompted to confirm your decision, and the status will be removed permanently from your Timeline.

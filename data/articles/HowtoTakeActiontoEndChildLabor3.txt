 One of the first things you’ll need to do if you decide to start your own activist group is to recruit like-minded members.


Try personally inviting friends, family, and community members.
Send out blast emails to other groups you belong to.
Post informational flyers in local coffee shops or bookstores.
Set up a website to explain and promote your new group.
 Having meetings at a consistent time and place is vital to your group’s success.


Meet once a week or once a month, as you and your members see fit.
Keep a directory of member’s first names and email address so you can all stay in touch.
Offer to host your group meetings at your home, or see if a local hall can donate a meeting room.
Introduce new members at the beginning of each meeting and give them an overview of your group’s mission statement and main goals concerning child labor.
Develop a clear agenda for each meeting including current events and news stories concerning child labor issues.
Encourage everyone to speak-up and share their ideas.
Invite members to bring snacks to share -- this helps generate camaraderie, conversation, and idea sharing.
 This is a great way for your group to make a difference and raise more awareness about child labor injustices. There are countless types of events you can host -- from fundraisers and book drives, to film screenings and public lectures. Whichever event you choose, your efforts will make an impact and bring awareness to your group and anti-child labor cause.

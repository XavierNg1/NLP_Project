 Remove the vacuum hose and inspect closely for wear (cracks or weak spots), then clean out the carbon deposits either with a spray can of carburetor cleaner or with a pipe cleaner if the deposits are hardened or compacted.;
, Loosen any bolts fastening the EGR valve to the engine. Inspect the gasket lining the bottom plate of the valve. If it's not frayed or cracked, you can reuse it.
 Use carburetor cleaner and a small-bristled brush like a wire brush, toothbrush or pipe cleaner to clean off the carbon from the metal exhaust gas return tube and the gas entry port on the valve (usually the smaller hole with a spring-loaded pin, or “pintle”).


If there is a lot of carbon build up around the EGR valve, you may also want to just save yourself some time and replace it with a new one.
 The entry port is where the valve tubes connect to the engine (usually the intake manifold) while the EGR valve is off.
 Check to ensure the vacuum diaphragm moves freely, reinstall the EGR valve and reattach the exhaust return and vacuum hoses.

 When performing the trick at full speed, you will go through the same motions you practiced at a low speed. This time, allow the yo-yo to begin sleeping at the end of the string so that it will maintain the inertia needed to return to your hand at the end of the trick.
 When performing the trick at full speed, you will need to go through the motions swiftly and smoothly to keep the yo-yo spinning. When you begin swaying the yo-yo back and forth in the triangle, you can visually gauge how much time you have for swaying before the yo-yo runs out of inertia.
 To finish the trick, simply let the string go with both your hands. Allow the yo-yo to drop and jerk your yo-yo hand slightly to wind the yo-yo back up, just as you would with any trick. Note that if your yo-yo stops spinning during the trick, you will not be able to return it to your hand.

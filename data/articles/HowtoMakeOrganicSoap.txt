 This will help release the soap when you are done making it.

, Lye will irritate and burn you if it comes in contact with your skin. Donning safety glasses, gloves and long sleeves and pants will help protect you from burns in case there are any splatters or spills while you are mixing the ingredients. The lye becomes neutralized by the oils in the recipe, making the soap safe to use.
 Measuring the amounts of the ingredients will give you a more exact portion than doling out cups. You will need 6 ounces distilled water, 2.25 ounces lye, 10 ounces olive oil, 6 ounces coconut oil and 1 tablespoon (0.45 ounce) castor oil. Pour the lye into your bowl, the water into one of your measuring cups and the oils into the other measuring cup.
 Stir slowly to avoid spattering. The reaction of the 2 items mixing will create heat and fumes. Once integrated, set the mixture aside to cool. Lye automatically heats up to over 200 degrees and takes nearly 20 minutes to reach a temperature of 115 degrees.
,, You want them to be within 20 degrees of each other, somewhere between 90–100 °F (32–38 °C). Rewarm the oils if necessary to get to this temperature.
 Do this slowly, stirring constantly.
 If you think you have blended enough, take the temperature of the mixture. The temperature should have risen a few degrees. This can take a few minutes with a blender or up to an hour with a whisk.
 Cover. Let sit for 2 days.
 It should be solidified. Remove the soap from the box and cut in into bars. If the soap has separated or is crumbly, discard it and do not use.
 Turn the bars every day for 3 - 4 weeks until they are dry.
, To make sure you keep from being burned, it is best to wear your gloves and goggles until all your work area and utensils are clean from the lye.

 Before writing a character who has a different sexual orientation than you do, make sure you have an understanding of sexual orientation and how one sexuality is differentiated by another sexuality. For example, asexuality isn't celibacy - it's lack of sexual attraction, and asexual people can still be in romantic relationships. Do research on the sexuality that you want your character to be.
 Lots of people aren't just "gay" or "straight"—there are many gray areas. Decide on your character's sexual orientation, and if you wish, their romantic orientation—which is who they're romantically attracted to.



Gay or lesbian characters are attracted to only people of their gender identity. Gay men would be attracted to men, and lesbian women would be attracted to women. Keep in mind that the word "gay" can be used to describe a girl, but the term "lesbian" can't be used for a boy.

Bisexual or pansexual characters are attracted to most people. The difference between bisexual people and pansexual people is that bisexuals are viewed as not being attracted to people outside the gender binary, whereas pansexuals can be.

Asexual characters lack sexual attraction. This doesn't mean that they aren't interested in relationships, sex, or anything with a romantic air to it (i.e., aromantic)- it simply means that they don't find people sexually attractive.
The difference between a character's sexual orientation and their romantic orientation is that a character can be sexually attracted to one gender, but romantically interested in another. For example, a character could be sexually attracted to men, but romantically attracted to both men and women. Likewise, a character can be asexual and still be romantically interested in other characters.

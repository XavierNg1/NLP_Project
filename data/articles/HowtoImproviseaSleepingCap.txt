 Look for some that have a short inseam. It's also best if they have a drawstring.
 Just make it so that the drawstring is on the outside., You may wrap and pin it if the style is sleek and straight. If your style is wavy or curly, try putting the hair up in a loose, high ponytail with a scrunchie. You can also try putting the hair into two braids or french braid pigtails. Twist the braids around each other at the base of your head. If your hair is naturally dry, try adding some conditioner and water to the ends to preserve moisture for second day hair., (The shorts should be upside down.), If the drawstring is inside the shorts, flipping the waistband up so it's outside may help it stay in place. Otherwise just pull it tight and tie., Make sure there are no holes for your hair to escape from., Sleep tight!

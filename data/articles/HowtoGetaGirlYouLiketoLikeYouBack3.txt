 You're not the only one who's nervous. If she likes you, the same worries are probably going through her head. She can also be really brave and experienced, so this doesn't mean she doesn't like you.


Don't start gushing about how much you like her. It will most likely scare her away. Instead, let her discover your attraction through your interactions. Drop little hints, and keep her wanting, don't always text first and be the last one to text bye.
 When you talk to her, watch how attentive she is. If she is actively participating in your conversation, she is interested in what you have to say.
 Her personality has a lot to do with how the two of you will interact. If she is an outgoing person, you will need to be more outgoing yourself to get noticed. If she is quiet and reserved, a boisterous personality may drive her away. You don't have to change who you are, but you can adjust how you present yourself.

 Remember that a negative multiplied by a negative creates a positive. Thus, squaring a negative number will generate a positive number.


For example, -5X-5 =25. However, remember that 5X5=25. So the square root of 25 could be either -5 or 5. Basically, there are two square roots for the number.
Similarly, 3X3=9 and -3X-3=9, so the square root of 9 is both 3 and -3. The positive number is known as the “principal root,” though, so it’s really the only answer you need at this point., It's good to understand how to do math by hand, but there are many online calculators available that specifically calculate square root.


Look for the square root symbol in a traditional calculator too.
The online calculators will simply ask you to enter the number you want to know the square root of and hit a button. The computer will then generate the number's square root.

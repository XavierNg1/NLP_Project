 Choose one that you no longer want to wear or that's tighter than you've been willing to admit for a while.;
, If your scissors are not sharp enough, you might not be able to do this, so borrow your neighbor's if that's the case. Outline half of a rabbit's head shape along the fold (use the image example as a template – click to enlarge).


The bottom hem will become the hem of your hat. Make the hem about 7″ (18cm) wide, so 3.5″ (9cm) from the fold ought to do it.
 See what you’ve got – two rabbit shaped pieces that form the front and back of the newborn's hat.
 Sew into place. Perfect symmetry is not critical because you'll be tying the rabbit ears into a knot.
 A little zigzag stitch along the bottom would be a nice finishing touch.


For a super-cute gift, make a matching pair of pants out of the sleeves of the same shirt.

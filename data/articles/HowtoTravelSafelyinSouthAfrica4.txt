 Ask friends, hoteliers, concierges, retailers in malls, etc., where it is safe to walk and visit. Local knowledge is always preferable to even that in guidebooks, so don't be shy. Be careful, however, not to ask a stranger straight off the street.


See if it is possible to go with someone who is knowledgeable about the area you want to go to if you are afraid of getting lost.



Use common sense. If something doesn't feel right, don't go there, or leave quickly if you are there already.
SA Places recommends that you talk to the local people before walking into the very isolated areas of Kwazulu-Natal and the the Wild Coast of Transkei on your own. , Ask for copies of recent maps from the hotel or guest house.

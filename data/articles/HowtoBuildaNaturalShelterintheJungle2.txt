 Follow similar guidelines when building a shelter as when choosing a suitable site for camping. Look for a location between two small trees, which are spaced around 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart for a single person; make it wider the more people there are.;
, Make the length of the shelter such as to cover you from head to toe; a length of approximately 2 meters (6.5 feet) would be a good length. Lash the branches firmly together, as they'll end up supporting the weight of the entire shelter.
 Natural forks in the branches and branch stumps should be used to support the horizontal branches, as shown in the picture.
 Make sure the branches are well tied down or firmly wedged so that they won't move. You now have a complete frame.
 They should be still connected to their original thin branches or stems. Plants with broad leaves should be chosen as these offer greater shelter protection.


Stack the leaves on stems upwards until they block out the sun. This will likely be about three to four layers.
Tier the leaves by starting from the bottom end. This will create a series of steps with a gradient to allow water to flow downwards and not stagnate.
You may need to tie down the leaves to keep them in place.

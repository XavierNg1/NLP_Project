 As Mario or Luigi (whichever character you’re playing as) travels the levels of the game, he’ll eventually be confronted with Goombas. Goombas look like brown mushrooms with bushy eyebrows and a pair of fangs sprouting from their lower jaw.;
, Goombas have short legs, so they’re not very fast. When they’re heading towards Mario, just have him stand still and wait till the Goombas is just a jump away (about 1 block space away).
 Jumping on a Goomba is the most basic move to destroying it. To do this, press A for NES/DS/Emulator and 2 for Wii/U. This will flatten the Goomba to the ground, effectively destroying it.

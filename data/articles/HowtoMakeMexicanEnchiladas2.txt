 Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. Pour in enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, place a tortilla in the pan. Let it cook for 30 seconds, then turn it over and let it cook for another 30 seconds. Place it on a paper towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.


If your pan is large enough, cook more than one tortilla at a time.
Add a small amount of oil every few minutes, since the tortillas will absorb it as they cook.
 One at a time, sprinkle each tortilla with a liberal amount of cheese. Roll up the tortillas and place them in an oiled casserole dish. Line them up close to one another so that they stay rolled. Continue until you run out of tortillas.

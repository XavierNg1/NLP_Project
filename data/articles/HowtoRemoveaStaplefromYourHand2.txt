 If the wound is bleeding, let it do so for about five minutes, as this can help remove infection-causing materials from the injury site., Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment or cream, such as Neosporin, to the wound. If you develop a rash, stop using the ointment., Most puncture wounds will heal nicely without the use of a bandage; however, use a bandage if your wound is still bleeding or has a visible opening. The bandage will protect the wound from becoming dirty and irritated.Be sure to wash the wound with soap and water before applying the bandage. Change the bandage at least once a day or whenever it becomes wet or dirty., If you experience pain, use a pillow to keep the injury elevated above at or above the level of your heart anytime you are standing or sitting down. This will help reduce swelling., Take an over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin to also relieve the pain. Do not take more than the recommended dosage.


For ibuprofen the dosage is 400 to 800 mg three to four times daily (max 3,200 mg/day). For acetaminophen the dosage is 650 mg every four to six hours (max daily dose: 3,250 mg daily).
Do not give aspirin to anyone under the age of 19 unless you have permission from a doctor, as it may cause a serious condition known as Reye's syndrome.One side effect of chronic use of pain medications is that it can lead to gastric ulcers. Make sure that you do not take them for a prolonged time period.

 It is important to deal with the ink stain immediately. Blot the spot with a clean cloth or paper towels and apply a little pressure on it. Just blot and don't rub, since rubbing might spread the stain.








Work from the outside going towards the center and try to absorb as much ink as you can.
Change the cloth or paper towels when needed.
If the ink is already dry, it's still worth a try to remove it.;
, You can use rubbing alcohol to remove ink from leather, cloth, or vinyl, but no matter what material your couch is made from, it's a good idea to test it first just in case it alters the color or causes damage.

90 percent isopropyl alcohol is best, but you can also use 70 percent if that's the only one you have.
Wait a minute, then check the spot. If it didn't change colors or warp, you're good to go.
 Do not pour alcohol directly on the stain, since getting your couch all wet could cause it to look misshapen.
 Do not rub or wipe it, since rubbing will cause the stain to spread. Repeat the process until the cloth is not absorbing any more of the ink.









Make sure to change the cloth when it is saturated with ink, rather than dabbing more ink onto the couch.
Use fresh alcohol if you're working so long that the alcohol evaporates.
 Use a cloth dipped in water to wipe the area and clean off the alcohol.
 Take a step back and look at your handiwork. If the stain remains, repeat the process or try a different method for removing it.
 This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time.

,, Use room temperature water. If the water is cold, the eggs will take longer to cook. If the water is hot, though, you may risk the water getting too hot too early and overcooking the eggs (that is, exposing the eggs to boiling temperature for too long).
 This helps the proteins in the white coagulate faster so any cracks in the shell quickly get plugged.
, Stay close and listen; you should be able to hear the water come to a boil. Do not remove the lid to check. Remove the pot from heat as soon as the water is boiling. The eggs will not overcook. Keep the lid on so the water remains at slightly below boiling point. At this stage, decide about how long you want to leave the eggs in for:










Let the eggs sit for 3 to 5 minutes for coddled or "soft-boiled" eggs - runny yolk.
Let the eggs sit for 5-6 minutes for Mollet eggs - slightly runny yolk.
Remove the eggs as soon as the water boils. This is one method suggested by the Larousse Gastronomique for the cold water to boiling method.

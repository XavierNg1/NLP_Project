 The Pomodoro method is working for twenty five minutes, then taking a pause for five minutes.Every four sequences, take a fifteen minute break instead of a five minute.This way you will be able to track your working schedule and give you some time for internal and external distractions, such as social media accounts or hunger.
 It is important to set up a schedule in which you write every day even when you don’t need to.Having a word count objective for each day also helps you to stay on task and maintain your routine.For example, you might choose to write 1,000 words each day. Once you’ve set up a routine like this, working becomes more of a habit and less of a chore.
 Some people prefer to write in the morning, others like to write at night. Some people prefer to utilize a word count goal each day, while others prefer to write on a specific assignment. Whatever your preference, set a routine for yourself to turn the act of writing into a habit for you.While scheduling the same time of day for writing may seem inconvenient at first, after a while, you’ll find it very helpful. Here are things to keep in mind:


What time of day do you prefer to write?
How long do you prefer to work at a stretch?
What is your preferred objective when writing? Is it a word count goal, a deadline, a specific assignment, or a particular topic?
What type of writing habit are you seeking to build?

, When you work on a big project you may find yourself stuck on a certain chapter. This means it is time to switch to something else, like a second project. This can unblock your creativity and make you productive again. When you feel tired of the second project, return to the first one. This way, you will boost your productivity and work on two different projects at the same time.

 Try to learn as much of it as you can on your own. Whenever you think, "I don't understand this," ask yourself, "What part of the lesson is it that I actually don't understand? What do I not understand about it?" Asking yourself this forces you to slow down and actually think each part through, step by step. Many times, we see all of the words and numbers and get lost in them. When you slow down and try to identify which part you don't understand, you might find that it's not so difficult to understand after all!
, Sometimes you just need to try a problem to understand it!, If you still don't understand something, write it down on a sticky note in your book. You can find the answer out during class., Copying the correct way to do a problem after you see someone else do it will help you to understand the concept better., Don't forget to find out the answers to any questions you wrote down, if the teacher didn't already explain it without you asking!, Your math notes will be different than your science notes or your history notes, but there still is a way. Have a paper that says "Vocabulary" at the top, and whenever there is a new word, write it down with its definition on that paper. Make sure you write the lesson number next to it., Whether it's a younger sibling, a pet, a stuffed animal, or an imaginary class, teaching the material you've just learned to someone else is the very best way to remember it. Teaching someone else is the most effective way to learn material., This should be an example problem, broken down into steps. Make it so that you can clearly see how to solve the problem. Add whatever is relevant to the lesson, whether it be a diagram, a chart, a graph, etc., If you read through them and study them for five minutes each day, you will be able to learn the words much more effectively than trying to memorize them all in one day.

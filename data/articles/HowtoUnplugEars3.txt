 These suggestions may need to be repeated for several days in a row to completely unplug the ear, but you may experience some relief immediately.
 This will help soften the cerumen (wax), and make it easier to flush out.
 Lean your head sideways and put a few drops of the solution in your ear. A medicine dropper makes adding a few drops to the ear an easy task. Allow the solution to settle in for about 5 minutes.









To keep it from spilling out, place a piece of cotton in your ear before raising your head. If both ears need attention, repeat the process with the other ear.
 Drop a few drops of warm (not hot) olive oil, mineral oil or baby oil into your ear, and keep the head sideways for about five minutes









Lean your head upright and wipe away any oil and wax that exit the ear canal with a clean cloth.
 Fill an ear syringe with lukewarm water (body temperature: 98.6°F / 37°C, is best). An easy way to do this is fill a cup with warm water, so that it's easy to refill the syringe.









Lean over the basin of your sink, pull your ear lobe down and towards the back of your head to open up the ear canal.
Insert the tip of the syringe just into the opening of the ear canal, pointing slightly up and sideways, so you aren't directing the water directly at the eardrum.
Squeeze the bulb of the syringe hard enough so that it dislodges the wax, but never squeeze forcefully. It will sound like you're in a windstorm, and may tickle a bit.
Make sure the tip of the syringe doesn't block the water and cerumen exiting your ear canal, and don't be alarmed at the goop that comes plopping out.
Repeat until your ear is cleared, then dry with a soft cloth.
You may notice a very distinct difference in your hearing, for the better.

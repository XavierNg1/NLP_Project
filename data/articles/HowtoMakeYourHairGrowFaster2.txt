 It might sound counter-intuitive but getting your hair trimmed will help your hair grow faster. With time, the strands of hair will begin to split at the ends. These split ends tangle and are more likely to be pulled out when brushed. Keeping your hair trimmed will minimize split ends., Your hair can catch on the threads of a cotton pillowcase. A silk pillowcase reduces this friction, thus reducing breakage.Wrapping your head in a silk scarf could be used as an alternative to a silk pillowcase.
 Wrapping your hair in a towel on top of your head after a shower can also cause breakage. Instead, gently squeeze or blot excess water out of your hair.

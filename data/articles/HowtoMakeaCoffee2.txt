 To make French press coffee, you just need a French press and a kettle or saucepan to heat the water. Bring the water to a boil, ideally between 195 and 205 F (90.5 and 96 C).


Use enough water for your cup of coffee, plus a little extra in case any is lost to evaporation in the boiling process.
 Measure your grounds and place them into the bottom of the carafe. You don’t need a separate coffee filter to make French press coffee, because there's a mesh filter built into the plunger.


Use coarsely ground coffee grounds for French press coffee. They should be the size of breadcrumbs., When the kettle boils, let it rest for 30 seconds. Pour about an inch (2.5 cm) of water over the grounds and let them bloom for 30 seconds to a minute.


Stir the mixture to break up any clumps, then pour the remaining water.
Place the lid on the press and let the coffee brew for four minutes., To filter the grounds from the coffee, press down on the plunger that’s built into the lid. Press it all the way down to the bottom of the carafe to trap the grounds below the liquid.


Pour your coffee into a mug and serve as desired.

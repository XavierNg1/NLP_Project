 There is little point forcing yourself to wear a fashion item you can't stand, as you simply won't carry it off while worrying about it!;
, Fishnets paired with a mini and high heels are suggestive of quite the opposite of ladylike clothing. Instead, wear your fishnets with a skirt that sits just above the knee. A skirt that is longer is also fine.


Don't neglect the statement fishnets can make under pants worn to the office; just a hint of sexiness., Avoid patterns or prints that compete with the fishnets and let the fishnets be the interesting fashion statement only. Wear tailored shirts, bespoke jackets, and neat clothing as a whole. Keep the makeup toned right down, and the accessories and jewelry likewise. Pearls work well as elegant understatement jewelry.Use fishnets to make bland, neutral, and otherwise basic clothing look less matronly and more elegant.
 These will appear less "racy" and more toned down than wider meshed fishnets.The smaller the diamond shapes, the better the look and the easier it is to suggest sophistication.
 Stick with black, brown, or nude for day wear., Boots are also a fine option; indeed a knee-length dress or skirt with knee-high boots and a touch of fishnet in between can be very ladylike provided the clothing is good quality.
 Choose an interesting color for the tights, and make it bright for extreme contrast (providing it matches the rest of your outfit). For day wear, choose office-acceptable colors like navy blue and dark green; for the evening, be more daring, especially when coupling the tights and fishnet combination with the little black dress.

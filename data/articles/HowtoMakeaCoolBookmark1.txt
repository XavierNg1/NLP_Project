 While you could use printer paper, that's not very sturdy. Cardstock or colored card is best, as it's stronger. And if it's already colored, it's much easier to work with.


Don't be hemmed in by the standard bookmark shape. Think of other shapes that are fun, such as a heart, a leaf, a cat, a dog or a silhouette of a face with a ponytail. Different shapes are really cool.;
, Depending on your own interests, you could cut out different shapes from colored paper and glue these onto the bookmark. Or, add stickers, glitter glue, sequins, yarn, beads and many other fun crafty items to make it cool.


Drawing images is fun and an original way to decorate.
Write your name down the bookmark in large letters, using a cool script, then color it in or stick paper and cloth around the shapes of the letters.
Overlapping embellishments can look good, just don't have them sticking out the edges or making the bookmark too thick.
 Get a roll of clear, wide tape. Wide packaging tape works best. Place even strips of tape across the bookmark, making sure to completely cover all of it. Once covered, it will be water and stain resistant.


You could laminate the bookmark but only if the items under it won't melt. Marker ink will melt under lamination.

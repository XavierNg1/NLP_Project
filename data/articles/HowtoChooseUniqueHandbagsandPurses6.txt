 Initial purses are a fashion accessory with a personal touch, and they make wonderful gifts. You can have just about any kind of purse printed, embroidered or embossed with a single initial or set of two or three initials in a wide variety of styles. As for handbags, leather will be a big trend in the upcoming season for purses. Youâ€™ll see lots of small leather purses with a comfortable sling shoulder strap, elegantly embossed with two or three initials.

 There are two main options that should accommodate most visitors to Channel Islands National Park:



Los Angeles International Airport is easily the most convenient option for the majority of travelers. With thousands of incoming and outgoing flights per day, it is one of the busiest airports in the world and provides regular service to every major North American city—though not all flights will be direct.

Santa Barbara Airport is a much smaller airport, but is closer to the park. Flying to Santa Barbara from outside California will almost always require a transfer.
 Check every website that offers discount fares to see if one might be holding a sale to your destination city. If you’re willing to deal with one or even two transfers, you should be able to save some money over opting for a direct flight.
 Bear in mind that you will save money by purchasing non-refundable tickets over refundable ducats, but that you could be left with nothing if you cannot make the flight. Most tickets can be changed for a pre-determined fee.

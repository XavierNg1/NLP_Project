 Prefects have advantages over teachers in that the younger children look up to them, as a result keeping the rules is a much easier job for Prefects than it is for teachers.;
, Prefect is one of the top roles a student can have at a school. You are now working with the teachers to create a better place to learn, and a mature, helpful prefect is sure to be trusted.
 The knowledge that there are Prefects willing to help will be very reassuring to newer pupils, and they will count on you to live up to their expectations and as someone who can help guide them through their school life.
 The kind and friendly prefect will gain the most respect. Offering help to those that might need it is better than waiting to be asked, and more often than not your offers will be taken up appreciatively.
 Prefects are given a lot of responsibility in the form of organizing and running events for parents and pupils of the school. It raises your prefect profile and impresses teaching staff, and also puts you in good stead for the future. Colleges and employers are keen to see examples of people that have been involved in voluntary school activities.
 The key is to be approachable, whether it is to students, parents, or visitors. The steps above require communication to be clear and confident.


A confident prefect sometimes needs to be something you learn how to become. Meeting with fellow prefects, teachers, visitors and parents and making presentations can help build up your confidence within the school. Observe how they react to you, and change your communication skills accordingly to become the best prefect you can be.
 Many new students are very impressionable and meeting a confident, helpful prefect can be something they will remember when they apply for the position in years to come.

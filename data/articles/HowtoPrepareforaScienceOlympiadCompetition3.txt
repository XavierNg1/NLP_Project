 Create a binder that contains your resources, like your notes. Have a copy of the rules, as well as lists that are needed for an event, for example, a list of birds or fossils. If you are attending multiple events, section off the materials in your binder so you can access them easily and avoid mixing up the materials; also label the section tabs.Try to get as much information as possible on a page by reducing the size of images. Or, type up your notes in small font (but not so small that you cannot read it), and then write extra notes in the margins. Include things in your notes that you have trouble memorizing.
Color code important information so you can access it quickly. Keep the colors of your codes consistent so that you will be able to associate a color with a particular piece of information. For example, color code muscles pink, the respiratory system blue, and the endocrine system red., Make extra copies of your notes in case you lose your binder or your original notes. Protect your notes by placing them in plastic sheet protectors., For students who will need to bring models to the event, bring along a toolbox in case your model comes apart or loses a part in transit from your home to the event.

 Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.


The aluminum foil is not absolutely necessary, but it will help to prevent the baking sheet from burning or becoming slimy.
 Place the clams in a bucket and add enough water to cover them. Stir in the cornmeal and salt and let soak as the oven preheats.


Soaking the clams in this manner should loosen the shells.
 Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, pesto, parsley, and olive oil in a bowl. Add half of the clarified butter or melted unsalted butter and mix together until moist.


While the stuffing mix should be moist, it should not be dripping wet or soaked.






Only add the remaining butter if necessary, and do so 1 Tbsp (15 mL) at a time to avoid over-soaking the stuffing mix.
 Remove the clams from the water and pry them open with your fingers. Stuff the clams with enough of the stuffing mix to cover the meat completely.


If you cannot open the clams with your fingers, glide a thin, dull knife in between the shell halves and cut around the perimeter until loosened.






Position the stuffed clams on your prepared baking sheet.
 Cook the clams in the preheated oven until the stuffing turns golden brown.
 Remove the finished clams from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter.

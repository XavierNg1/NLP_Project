 Mumsâ€™ root systems cannot handle too much moisture. Mums planted in containers will require more water than those planted in the ground, as mums in the ground can absorb natural water like rain and dew.Don't allow mums to wilt between waterings. If the lower leaves wilt or turn brown you need to water them more. Avoid splashing water onto the foliage as this could promote the growth of bacteria or cause your mum to become diseased.
 Mums are short-day plants, which means they need a long period of darkness to flower.
 You should use a balanced all-purpose fertilizer. Feed them especially during the vegetative growth period to prevent premature flowering.At each watering use a 20-10-20 or equivalent solution. When the blooming season begins, switch to a 10-20-20 fertilizer or equivalent.
 Treat pythium root and stem rot, fusarium wilt, bacterial leaf spot, botrytis blight, and chrysanthemum white rust with natural fungicides like garlic oil, neem oil or sulfur.
 Abolish common mum insects like aphids, mites, thrips, and leaf miners with insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils., This ensures you will have domes of brightly-colored blossoms come autumn.Pick off dead or fading flowers to encourage more blooms.

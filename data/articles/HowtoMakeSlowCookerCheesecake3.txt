Continue to mix and fold all ingredients until they are well incorporated., Add one egg at a time to your mixture. Once the egg has been added, mix it together using a fork or whisk before repeating the process on the next egg. If you have a mechanical mixer or food processor, you can also use that to help blend things together.

Smooth out the top of the cheesecake with a spatula., Use 6 to 7-quart (5.67 to 6.62 liter) slow cooker and fill the bottom of it with water. The level of the water should only come up a half an inch off the bottom of your slow cooker., Place the pie pan inside of the slow-cooker. Make sure that the pie itself does not get wet from the water. Set the dial on high, cover the cake, and continue to cook it for two hours.If you are scared that your cake will get wet, you can use a meat rack or cooking rack that comes with some slow-cookers to elevate your pie pan out of the water. This rack will fit on the bottom of your slow-cooker., Let the cake cool inside of the slow-cooker once it's done cooking. Afterward, carefully take it out and let it cool down to room temperature before placing the cake in the refrigerator overnight before serving it.

To add a special flair to your cheesecake, top it with fresh fruit or melted chocolate or peanut butter.

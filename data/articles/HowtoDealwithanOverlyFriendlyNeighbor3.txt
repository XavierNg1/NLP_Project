 In more extreme cases, an overly friendly neighbor might insist on touching you or otherwise intruding your personal space. Even if they believe touching your shoulder when they greet you is harmless, you should tell them to stop if it makes you uncomfortable.Look them in the eye, stand up straight, and do your best to project confidence. Calmly and assertively say, “I don’t feel comfortable with being touched like that.”
There’s no need to make excuses for them or apologize, but you can gauge your response based on your level of discomfort. If your neighbor touches your shoulder, and it’s annoying but you don’t find it threatening, politely tell them to stop. If they touch you in way you feel is inappropriate, tell them their action is harassment, and don’t hesitate to notify authorities if they persist.
 In rare cases, an overly friendly neighbor might be unstable or threaten your safety. You should get help if they respond in a threatening way to the hints you've dropped or conversations you've had about your space.First, contact your property manager or homeowner's association. They can help mediate the situation before it escalates. If you believe you're in immediate danger, call the police or emergency services.
 If you live in an apartment complex or building, relocating to another floor or section of the complex might be an option worth exploring. That way, you'll avoid daily interactions with your intrusive neighbor without having to go through the burden of moving to another complex.Describe your situation to your property manager. Ask them, "Are there any available apartments on another floor or in a building on the other side of the complex?"
Be sure to ask them to waive security deposits and other fees, since you're an existing resident relocating due to an issue that's out of your control.

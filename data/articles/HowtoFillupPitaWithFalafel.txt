 This is important because the bread will hold the contents that you're about to add, preventing them from falling out when the pita is eaten.
 Pita bread has a bottom and top; the bottom is generally thinner and often has wrinkles or cracks in it., Tear around half the circumference of the pita, dividing the top and bottom (only half-way)., This will, in effect, produce three layers of bread on one side and just the top layer on the other., The pocket is now ready to be filled up (and at the end you'll roll it up).,, Spread a layer of hummus across the inside of the pita pocket. This makes for a tasty base that will help to keep the ingredients in place., Typical additions include slices of tomato, shredded lettuce, salad onion slices, grated carrot, etc.

Some things that go well in falafel: Cucumber and tomato salad (chopped thinly), pickles, cabbage salad (fresh or pickled), fried eggplants, green pepper, etc.
 This is a staple for falafel pita pockets., Flatten them with the back of a spoon or fork. They will spread across the pita pocket and be easier to eat than if left in large balls.,, You can add any sauce you like. Typical sauces include sweet chili, tomato, garlic, cheese, barbecue, etc., It can now be eaten as it is, or if you want to wrap it in paper and take it on a picnic, that's fine too. Enjoy!

Falafels go with fries.

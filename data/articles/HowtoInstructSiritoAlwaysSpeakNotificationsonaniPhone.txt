 Turning on this screen-reading feature allows you to hear what is happening on your screen at all times, from your phone locking to what time it is to the app that is currently highlighted.


If you only want to hear verbal notifications temporarily, you can create a shortcut to quickly turn on/off the VoiceOver feature. From the Accessibility menu, just tap Accessibility Shortcut. You'll need to scroll all the way to the bottom of the menu to see it. Next, tap VoiceOver. It's at the top, listed under the "Triple-click the Home Button for" heading. Now, when you triple-click the home button (the big circle button underneath your phone screen), you can either turn VoiceOver on or off.
 You'll need to scroll down on your phone differently when VoiceOver is turned on.
 The bar should turn green. Now you will get a verbal notification from Siri whenever you get a call, text or notification to your iPhone.

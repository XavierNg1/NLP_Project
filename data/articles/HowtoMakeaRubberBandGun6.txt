 Your rubber band special ops sniper rifle is made with only the strongest yardstick or meter stick. A flimsy meter stick might not be able to withstand the tension of your rubber band rounds. You'll need:


Yardstick/meter stick
Rubber bands
Paperclips

, Do this by taking two rubber bands and tying both together. To complete your round, you'll need to string a paperclip onto one of the conjoined rubber bands. Repeat this process until you have around 10 rounds of ammunition.
 Hold your rubber band round by the paper clip and catch the opposite end on the tip of your meter stick. Then stretch the rubber band along the entire length of your meter stick, holding the meter stick by supporting the underside of it.
 Now that your rubber band round is strung tensely along the entire length of your meter stick, letting go of your paper clip will launch the rubber bands. Due to the extreme tension and the attached paper clip, this round should not be aimed at living creatures, as it could do harm.

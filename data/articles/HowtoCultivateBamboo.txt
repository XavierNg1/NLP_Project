While it isn’t necessary to research each of the 1200-plus varieties of bamboo, deciding on clumping or running bamboo should be the first step in cultivating bamboo.


Clumping bamboo will work best for container gardens or small areas.

Running bamboo works best when it’s intended to fill in a large area of a landscape or needed to create a natural fence between properties.

Local garden centers or specialty bamboo stores will be able to give gardeners specific advice about varieties of bamboo that will do well in their landscape.
These garden centers can also advise gardeners about the level of care and maintenance specific types of bamboo require.



In a sunny area that receives shade for no more than a few hours during midday, prepare a loamy soil that has a slightly acidic pH.
A local cooperative extension service can test soil for pH, as can many garden centers.
, Plant it and all accompanying soil in the prepared hole, filling in the hole with the prepared soil. Keep the soil mixture loose; do not “pack” the soil.



While every type of bamboo differs, and a local garden center can give gardeners more specific guidance, most bamboo like lots of water and well-drained soil. Pay attention to the plant. If the leaves start to curl, the bamboo needs more water. Pot or root bound bamboo can develop such a dense root system within a container that the root system can actually be hydrophobic or water resistant. If these root balls are watered with a traditional garden hose the water simply bounces off. The solution to this problem is to water your new bamboo SLOWLY with a trickle for several minutes each. Micro irrigation also works particularly well for all species of bamboo, and can speed up the bamboo growth cycle by as much as 1/3.

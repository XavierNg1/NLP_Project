 Inspect the door from inside, or the side from where you can see the hinges. Locate the gaps and where the door is tight. It’s common in sagging doors for the hinge side at the bottom to be tighter against the frame. The opposite side, or strike side, is often gapped at the top and tight where the door meets the sill., Use a bubble level and carpenter’s square to determine if the door frame itself is level. Hold the bubble level against the door jamb’s left and right sides and top, and check to see if the bubble settles between the viewer’s two lines. You can hold the carpenter’s square, or steel square, to the door jamb’s four corners to determine if they deviate from 90 degrees.


You might find that the door is level, but the frame is off square. If the frame is out of square, you might have other problems, like a shifted wall or settling foundation.
In this situation, you might find planing to be your only solution., With the door open, and starting with the top, see if the hinges and screws are still tightly embedded in the door and jamb. Use a screwdriver, not a drill, to tighten all the screws, but take care not to overtighten them. If the screws give your driver resistance and the hinges are securely in place, they’re tight. Overtightening could strip the holes or push the door further out of alignment.

 If your friend sits near you, that is. If your friend sits farther away, you could crumple the note up into a ball and throw it to him/her. Or, you could pass it to another classmate that sits closer to your friend than you do (make sure they are trustworthy and won't read it, throw it away or tell the teacher) and tell them to give it to your friend.

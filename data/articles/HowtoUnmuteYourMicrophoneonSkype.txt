 Log into your Skype account and open Skype, if you haven't done so yet. Be online and prepared to start your call.


In order to unmute your microphone on Skype you must be making a call with a person or a group. This can both work on regular calls and video calls.;
, Begin by starting or joining a call.


During the call, you can mute your mic once the call has started by pressing the microphone button with the line through it. This will stop the other callers from hearing you anymore.
 To unmute the microphone, click the image of the microphone that is near the bottom. By clicking that, your microphone will be unmuted and the other callers will hear you again.


To mute your microphone another time, click the mic image once again.
 Now that your call is unmuted, others will be able to hear you.

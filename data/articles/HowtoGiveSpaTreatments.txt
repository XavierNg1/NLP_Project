 This may include nail polish, hot wash cloths, lotion, hot soapy water, etc...;
, Make sure you ask the customer to lay down on it!

, Make sure the wash cloths stay nice and warm! You might want to ask them if it is the right type for them.
,, If they do, ask them what color they want and paint them. Make sure to get out any dirt inside their nails!

, If they do, then ask them what style they would like to have. Then, you put their hair in that style. Some good hair styles to suggest to them are buns, buttons, pony tails, braids, etc.
 If they do, ask them if they want eye shadow, blush, eye liner, mascara, lipstick, lip gloss, etc. If they want any of those, that put them on in the color they want it in.
 You have just created a work of art! You should be proud of your self! Thank the customer for coming, and clean up your mess.

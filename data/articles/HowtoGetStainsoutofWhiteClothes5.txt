 You can use it in a similar way to bleach, by adding a small amount to your normal wash. It is also a strong chemical that is often found as an ingredient in cleaning products, but can be bought on its own.You should NEVER mix bleach with ammonia as the reaction causes highly toxic and potentially deadly fumes.Work in a well-ventilated room and wear rubber gloves if you use ammonia.
 If you want to apply the ammonia directly to the stain, you can mix it in equal measures with turpentine to create a good cleaning solution. Once you have mixed up a small amount pour it onto the stain and let it sink in. You can leave it for up to eight hours, before washing it.








The first time you wash it after this treatment, be sure to keep the garment separate from other clothes.
Concentrated ammonia can damage and stain your clothes., Difficult stains can be treated with ammonia at source by dabbing them with a sponge, which has been dipped in ammonia. This is particularly recommended for stains from bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat and urine.After sponging the stained area wash it as normal.

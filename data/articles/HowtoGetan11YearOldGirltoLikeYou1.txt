 Not many girls, at any age, want to date a dirty boy. It’s good to get into the practice of taking care of yourself at an early age. Don’t wear clothes that you recently wore and make sure nothing looks dirty. Wear the “nice” clothes that are in your wardrobe when you know you will see this girl.


Have your parents or guardians buy you t-shirts with a collar and pants that aren’t denim.;
, You should clip your nails, wash your hair, and brush your teeth on a daily basis. Never leave the house without doing these things. One thing that girls dislike especially is bad breath.
 It is popular to spray too much Axe body spray when you’re eleven, but resist this temptation. Instead, go to the hygiene section of a local convenience store and find the fragrance that best suits you. Pick out something that contains musk in the smell. Musk is a popular smell for boys and it'll show off your maturity.If you use a spay on deodorant, only spray underneath each arm once. Do not hold down the nozzle until you've covered your entire body.
A stick or dry deodorant is more subtle and less obnoxious.
 It is unpopular for eleven year old boys to enjoy getting their hair cut, but having the right cut will help you out. Look through magazines and look at celebrity haircuts. Pick out a few that stand out to you. Ask your mom or sister’s opinion on what type of hairstyle you should get.


Getting a second opinion can help your chances of picking out the best haircut that will suit your attributes.

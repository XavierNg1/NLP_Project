 You can treat altitude sickness by using bottled oxygen or portable hyperbaric chambers, also known as Gamow or Certic bags.; however, bottled oxygen should not be used as a substitute for descending to a lower altitude.You will be zipped into a portable hyperbaric chamber and then the chamber will be pumped full of air. You will usually spend one to two hours in the chamber until your symptoms go away.
You can carry a portable oxygen chamber with you as part of your high-altitude gear in the event of altitude illness.
 You can also take an anti-emetic, a known anti-sickness medication, to help with symptoms like nausea or vomiting. You can find antiemetic medication over the counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.If you are experiencing headaches due to altitude illness, you can also take painkillers like ibuprofen or paracetamol. Follow the dosage instructions on the label.
 You can also get prescription medication for altitude illness from your doctor, as prescription medication is often stronger than over the counter pills. The most commonly prescribed altitude medication is acetazolamide (Diamox), which has been shown to improve the symptoms of mild altitude illness.If you have developed mild altitude illness previously, your doctor may prescribe dexamethasone or nifedipine, which can help to stabilize the blood-flow pattern in your lungs.

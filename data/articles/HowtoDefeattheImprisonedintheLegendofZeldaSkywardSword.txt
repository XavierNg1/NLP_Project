 After one toe has been chopped off, it will use electric barriers to shock Link, causing him to loose a life (two if in Hero Mode).;
, The Imprisoned will then fall over.


If you do a Skyward Strike, it pushes the Sealing Spike back in quicker.
, Congratulations! You beat the first phase, and you can rest a while.
 However, the bully Groose has fallen into Faron Woods and invented the Groosenator, and you can use this to blast the Imprisoned off the wall.


You can't use the head method anymore; Imprisoned will shake you off.
You have less time to beat the Imprisoned now, as he moves a bit faster.
 It will always use the electric barriers to shock Link, causing him to loose a life (two if in Hero Mode).
, This allows it to whack you when you run to its backÂ toes.
 Avoid its tail.
, Groose will alert you at the loss of his Groosenator bombs, which were piled behind rubble, and tell you to run to him. Hurry!

, Yes, that's right. Talk to Groose and step into this creative catapult. Fling yourself onto the Imprisoned's head and get that spike once more! Congratulations, you now only have the Horde, Ghirahim, and Demise to beat.

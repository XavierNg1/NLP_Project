 Wood rot often occurs near the bottom of door frames, where water tends to pool during rain or floods. Measure the section of door frame containing wood rot and mark the area with a pencil.
 Using a chisel, dremel, or straight oscillating tool, grind out all of the rotted areas of wood on the frame. It is important to get every last bit of rotted wood you can see. If even a small amount of rotted wood remains, the fungus causing the rot will continue to spread.


If the rot covers a particularly large area or extends beyond the door frame into the structure of the house, more serious repairs will be necessary to keep the rot from returning.
Inspect your door for wood rot. When the frame becomes rotted, the door can also rot as well. An infected door can pass the rot to the door frame and vice versa. Replace the door if it becomes rotted. , Purchase a folded wire mesh and place it in the gap of the frame. Lock it in place with screws. This wire mesh will serve as a skeleton for the body filler.
 Use a putty knife to fill the mesh cavity with the mixture. Allow to set for a few minutes and add additional filler to fill any gaps. Remove excess filler with a chisel before it hardens.


Use an epoxy-based filler for substantial repairs such as filling rotted portions of door frames. Epoxy fillers, such as auto bondo, are much stronger than wood and body fillers, and are better suited for withstanding the wear and tear that doors endure.
Plan out how much epoxy filler you’ll need. Once mixed, the epoxy filler dries quickly.
Invest in a few higher quality tools if sanding or carving epoxy filler – the filler is often sturdier than the wood itself when dry. , Once dry, sand to smoothness as desired. Finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint.

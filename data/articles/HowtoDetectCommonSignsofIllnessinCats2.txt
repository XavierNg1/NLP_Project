 One of the most common signs of illness in cats is vomiting. This could signal some sort of short-lived gastrointestinal distress or a much more serious illness, such as cancer.If your cat is repeatedly vomiting, you should have it checked out by a veterinarian.
 A cat that is sick may eat less food and drink less water. This could be due to nausea or simply lack of energy. For instance, one of the first signs of cancer can be lack of appetite. Changes in appetite or water consumption signal that something is wrong with a cat's health and you should take the cat to be seen by a veterinarian.


There are also some illnesses, such as kidney disease, that cause a cat to drink more water than normal.Pay attention to this as well.
 Whether your cat has diarrhea, is urinating profusely, or is not relieving itself at all, problems going to the bathroom can signal that something is wrong with the health of the cat.The best way to keep track of this is by looking in the cat's litter box.


When you are cleaning out your cat's litter box, you should assess whether your cat is relieving itself normally.
 Changes in behavior and attitude can signal a health problem with your cat. Whether the cat is more shy than usual, irritable, jumpy, or aggressive, all of these behaviors can signal that something is wrong with the cat. For example, painful conditions, such as arthritis or dental problems, can change your cat's personality completely.Changes in attitude and behavior can also be caused by stress or changes in the cats life. If you have recently moved or brought another pet into the house recently, for instance, then that may be causing the changes in behavior.

 If you are working from homework assignments, make sure you are up on the topic being covered. If you are teaching more generally, make sure you've planned the lesson. Always check that you have any supplies you might need.
 You absolutely need to be flexible in tutoring. You are not a typical teacher; you are providing tailored sessions for your student. If the student's teacher changed his/her lesson plan, or the student has a pressing need, you may have to change topics unexpectedly.
 Your job isn't just to lecture at the kid: you want to engage him/her. When you are giving long explanations, check in with the child, and ask questions that provoke involvement.


Hopefully, this has given you a starting place for your tutoring. Don't forget that the internet is a fantastic resource for innovative experiments and sample lesson plans.

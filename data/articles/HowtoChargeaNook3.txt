 Barnes and Nobles sells car chargers for most of its models separately. You may purchase a car charging kit for the following models: Nook Simple Touch, Nook GlowLight, Nook Tablet, Nook HD, Nook HD Plus, and Nook Color. Barnes and Noble currently does not sell car chargers for the Nook First Edition or the Nook GlowLight Plus.Alternatively, you can obtain a car adapter compatible with the Nook, and use the USB cable you received with your tablet.
 The car charging kit includes a USB power cord and a plastic cigarette car charger. Unwind the USB power cable. Insert the USB into the face of the plastic charger., The plastic charger is inserted into your vehicle’s cigarette lighter socket. When you've found it, remove the cover and insert the plastic charger. Plug the other end of the USB cable into your Nook's charging port. Turn on your car.


The cigarette socket/receptacle is located in your car, and can act as an electrical outlet. It is usually found in the same area as your radio and air conditioner controls. The cover of the receptacle typically has an image of a cigarette on it.
 Once your vehicle is on, the LED light on the charger and your Nook should illuminate—these lights indicate that your Nook is charging. As you travel, your Nook will charge. When you have arrived at your next stop, unplug your Nook from the USB power cord. Unplug the car charging kit from the cigarette socket and stow it away.

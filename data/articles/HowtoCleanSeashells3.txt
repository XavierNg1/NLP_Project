 The best part of this method is that worms, insects, and bacteria will actually clean your shells for you. Just be sure to bury them deeply enough to prevent animals from smelling them and digging them up. About 18-24 inches should be fine., Leaving a marker is important so you can find the the seashells later.
 Over time, insects, worms, and bacteria will break down the organic material inside the seashells. The longer you leave the shells buried the cleaner they will get.


Burying live seashells is the easiest way to clean them but it will take time.

 It’s common for new parents to experience certain emotions. For example, new fathers often feel isolated, left out, or in competition for their partner’s attention and affection. This can lead to him becoming withdrawn or depressed. New mothers often feel overwhelmed with their sudden new role. Feelings about her appearance may make her feel ashamed or embarrassed. Put yourself in your partner’s shoes in understanding their needs.Let your partner know you support them. Say, “I know raising kids can be hard, and I’m here for you and our family as support.”
Offer to help your partner. Do child caretaking together and try to take care of any family needs that you can.
 You may abstain from sex during pregnancy or after birth, and getting back to sexual activity may be a long road. Many women may feel “touched out” after touching the baby all day and nursing. If one or both of you is not ready for sex quite yet, be intimate in other ways such as by holding hands, cuddling, and being close to one another.Be sure to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and needs about intimacy with your partner.
If you feel fear, insecurity, or anxiety about returning to sexual activity after having a baby, you may want to talk to a therapist.

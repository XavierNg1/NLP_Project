 In Australia, Dial 000 if you have a phone signal. Take special note of your starting point and the landscape and any landmarks along the way so that you can be clear when describing your location. Aim to locate yourself in a place where you will be visible from land and sky. In the outback a helicopter or the Royal Australian Flying Doctor Service may be your rescuers. If it is too hot to be in the sun, then use a landmark, your tent, or some high visibility clothing laid out for them to see. Common problems hikers experience are:


Dehydration or heat stroke. Symptoms often appear as headaches, fatigue, dizziness and feeling lightheaded. Rest in the nearest shade that is free from signs of animals. Drink water. Do not continue your hike until you feel safe to do so.
Sprained ankles and similar injuries. Wrap in a bandage or manufacture a bandage from existing clothing, a suitable fallen branch may suit as a splint, but you would be wise to pack for such contingencies if you are a long way away from other people. Slips and falls are very common with inexperienced or hasty bush-walkers, so it is recommended to be careful where you tread at all times.
Cuts and grazes. These are very likely when walking through dense scrub. All scratches should be treated with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory cream. To avoid infection, always apply a band-aid after treatment. If the climate is suitable, wear jeans and long sleeved cotton tops as robust fabric is far more resistant to scratches.

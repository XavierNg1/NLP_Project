 Calculate expected startup costs and compare them to your assets. Assets include cash and loans you have in order to start the business. Using a spreadsheet, create a list of the start-up expenses by month as well as long term capital expenditures that you expect to incur. Then compare your expected assets to expenses to determine if you have enough cash reserves based on your estimated monthly spending and money in the bank.If the costs are looking too high, look for ways to cut your expenses.
 You must be able to backup your expense deduction claims with hard copy receipts, vendor invoices and partnership and corporation agreements. Keep a startup business expense file separate from your regular business files.
 Your local Small Business Development Center, Women’s Business Center, Veteran’s Business Center or the mentoring experts at SCORE can all help you in getting your new business started. They can advise on determining what are startup expenses and what should be spread out over a period of years.

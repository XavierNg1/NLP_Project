 Even if you purchased the condoms recently, check the expiration date before you use one. If the condom has expired, then do not use it. An expired condom is more likely to break than one that is in date.
 There should be no tears or holes in the package. If there is a hole in the wrapper, the condom may have dried out, rendering it ineffective and likely to break., You should feel a little bit of air resistance from inside the package. This means the package has not been torn or punctured and your condom is good to go., While still pressing on the wrapper, gently push it the condom inside for a side-slide motion. This slight movement indicates that the lubricant inside has not dried out and, as long as the expiry date has not been passed, is still good.This slide test only works for lubricated condoms. Unlubricated condoms will not slide in the package but you can still do the air resistance test.
A dried out condom will weaken, crack, and break, exposing you to your partnerâ€™s fluids, potential pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

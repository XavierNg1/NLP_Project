 This is very important. It is a matter of life and death.;
, Looking at the crowd face to face makes most people nervous and confused (in most cases the mind goes blank), now here is where you use the Deyali technique.


Deyali technique explained: Look at the crowd but think about the topic that you are going to speak on. When you do this you will not be able to see the crowd as you will be lost in your thoughts. While thinking learn to look straight as this will give the impression to the people in the crowd that you are looking straight into their eyes (gives you the confident look) .
, Before starting your speech, mentally structure your speech as to how you will begin.
 This is very important to get the crowd's attention(you don't want people to chat while you speak).
(try to be very resourceful).
, Linking is an art, practice it with great creativity.
 This will give great structure and content to your speech. If done correctly you will not be able to see the audience most of the time (that pretty much takes care of your fear of facing the crowd). This may not make you a great orator but will definitely help you take care of your presentations at schools,offices etc.
 It helps and if you also admit your fear, it sometimes helps you to get rid of the fear.

 Traditionally, a Tallit extends from the top of the head to the knees, but some extend only to above the buttocks.


Keep in mind that type of Tallit that will be acceptable in your community or congregation.;
, Tallits are normally made out of linen, wool, cotton or silk.


Keep in mind that, according to Jewish law, wool and linen can't be combined.
 Hem the edges of the cloth, making sure to keep the hems small and not noticeable.
 Sew the corners.
 Suggestions for decorating the Atarah include embroidery, applique, batik (a wax-dyeing technique) or beading.
 This can be found online or at Judaica stores.


Per the mitzvah (commandment) of tzitzit, the color of the thread must be techelet-blue. This is the color of the sky and symbolizes purity. Nevertheless, in most communities, only white strings are used.
 Place the 4 long tzitzit strings in one row and the 12 shorter ones in another.



Before inserting that side into the prepared holes, quote the "leshem mitzvot tzitzit", meaning "for the purpose of the commandment of tzitzits."

, Make sure that they are as even as possible with the 3 shorter tzitzit ends on the other side. Make a temporary knot on the end where all 4 tzitzit strings meet together.
 Tie a double knot near the edge of the cloth near the hole. Wrap the long tzitzit string, or "shamash" around the other three string 7 times, and tie a double knot.
 Lastly, wrap it around 13 times and tie a double knot.
 Repeat the process for the other 3.

 Wash the fruit and chop it into large chunks. Remove any peels, pits, or stems. You can do a single fruit flavor or combine several fruits to make a mixed fruit Italian ice.Choose the freshest and ripest fruit you can find for the most flavorful Italian ice.;
, Place the chopped fruit, sugar or honey, lemon juice, and 2 cups of the ice into a blender or food processor. Cover the machine and blend your ingredients until they're totally smooth. Add the remaining cup of ice and completely blend it into the mixture.If you don't like seeds, consider straining the mixture through a mesh strainer.
 If you don't want to use a fruit puree as a base for your Italian ice, make a syrup that you can freeze. Combine 3 cups of water with 1 1/2 cups of sugar in a saucepan. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Then stir in 1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice. Refrigerate the mixture until it's cool.To quickly cool the syrup before you freeze it, fill a large bowl with ice. Set the bowl that has your hot syrup on top of the ice in the larger bowl. Leave it there for 15 minutes till it's cooler.
 You don't always need to use a fruit puree base to make an Italian ice. You can try making a fruit juice lemon ice for something even lighter. Or, melt chocolate and let it cool before blending it with ice to make a chocolate Italian ice. Popular Italian ice flavors include:

 You can purchase Veggie Wash at most major food supermarkets.


Fill up half a clean basin or a sink with cold water.
Add 2 oz of Veggie Wash and stir.
Give the solution a good swirl.
 This ensures each piece gets cleaned properly.


Run strawberries vigorously for about 30 seconds through the Veggie Wash solution.
Rinse those strawberries well under cold running water. You donâ€™t want any of the Veggie Wash residue to remain on the fruit.
Pat the fruit dry with paper towels, or gently dry it with a kitchen towel.

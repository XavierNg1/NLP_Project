 The curve of the blade affects both stickhandling and shooting. Blades can have many different combinations of curves which include left or right, heel, mid or toe curve, and slight, moderate or deep curve. Choose right or left based on your dominate hand. Beginners should opt for a mid-level curve, which is not too straight and not too deeply curved.Most leagues have restrictions on how much of a curve you can have, so be sure not to exceed the allowable limit.
Those who want more control when handling the puck should opt for a straighter blade, while players who take a lot of wrist or slap-shots stand to benefit from a blade with a greater curve.
 As with most other stick options, choosing whether or not to use a stick with a grip is about personal preference. Sticks with no grip will have a smooth finish and are ideal if you want to be able to easily slide your bottom hand up and down. The downside is that when your gloves get wet, you may have less control on the stick. Gripped sticks may be made with a slight texture on the end of the stick you hold, or they may have a grip that is a separate piece added onto the stick. It may be just rough or it may have a bit of tackiness to it that gives the grip a sticky feel., The lie of a stick means the angle where the shaft connects to the blade. The lie ranges from 4 to 8, with a lower number indicating a wider angle. The lie you choose will affect how the stick feels and how you can best use it. To determine the proper lie for you, think about if you would usually skate with the stick out far in front of you or close to your body. If you keep it out in front of you, a lower lie number is better, such as 4. If you keep it closer to you, a higher number is better, such as 6-7.

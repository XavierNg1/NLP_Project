 However, glazed clay, plastic or ceramic pots may work as well for you if you are careful not to over-water as this could cause standing water in the pot.


Wide pots are preferable to tall narrow pots which can cause stress to your cactus. Wide pots allow the shallow root system to spread out naturally while deep pots do not.
 Be sure the pot has good drainage holes.


Avoid pots which are too large. Large pots hold water which can lead to root rot.

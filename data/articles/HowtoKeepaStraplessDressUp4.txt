 This method requires you to wear a strapless bra. If you don’t have one already, you will need to buy one.


Make sure it will not show through the dress! If you are wearing a white dress wear a nude colored bra instead of a white one.
 These are what you will use to pin your dress to the bra.
 Before you can begin pinning them together, you need to have them on.


It will be very helpful if you have someone help you with the pinning!

, From the inside (e.g. insert the pin from the inside of the bra to the outside of the dress. This will hide the larger part of the safety pin.If your dress has a lining, you can try pinning the dress only through the lining so that the pin doesn't show on the outside at all. Make sure, though, that the lining is strong enough to support the dress! If the lining is very thin, and the dress fabric quite heavy, it may tear the lining.
Alternatively, if there is no lining or you want the extra support, pin through the entire dress, but make the space between where the pin exits the fabric and then re-enters the fabric as small as possible so that it will not be too visible.
 You don’t have to pin every inch of the dress, but have enough so that the dress is well adhered to the bra. You don’t want the dress to fall down in some areas and remain in place where it is pinned.

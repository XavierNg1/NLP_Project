 Chargin’ Chucks will charge at you as soon as you approach. Avoid this first charge by jumping out of the way (2 button).;
, When you jump once on the Chuck, their helmet will come off. They’ll gain acceleration and move faster. After a few seconds, the Chuck will put his helmet back on.
 Before he can put his helmet back on, jump on the Chuck again. This will defeat him. If the Chuck does manage to put on the helmet, you have to jump on him twice more.

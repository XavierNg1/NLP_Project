 Before you put text on an image, you should determine if the image is suitable for adding text. If the image is busy, your text will need to stand out from the background. Text does not read well when transitioning from a dark to light background (or vice versa) unless your text is outlined.
 There are several ways that you can add text to your images, based on your needs and what you have available.

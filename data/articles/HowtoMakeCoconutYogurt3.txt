 Place the cans of coconut milk in your refrigerator and allow them to sit overnight, or for at least 8 hours.Refrigeration will help separate the coconut cream from the water.
If you prefer working with fresher ingredients, you can use fresh coconut meat instead of canned coconut milk. Combine 2 cups (500 ml) fresh coconut meat with 1/2 cup (125 ml) coconut water or filtered water, blending until smooth. You can use this blend immediately; no refrigeration is required., Open the cans of coconut milk and scoop out the solidified cream sitting on top. Discard the watery portion sitting in the bottom of the can.


Do not shake the cans before opening them since doing so will combine the cream and water, resulting in watery yogurt.
 Place the solidified coconut milk in your blender or food processor. Add the lemon juice, probiotic, and salt. Blend the ingredients together until well-combined and very smooth.


Open and empty the probiotic capsules; do not add whole capsules to the blender.
If you don't have probiotic capsules, you could use 1 tsp (5 ml) probiotic powder or 1/4 cup (60 ml) coconut water probiotic kefir.
 Taste the yogurt. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid sweetener, if desired, and blend the yogurt again until the sweetener is evenly distributed.


Maple syrup, agave, coconut nectar, and natural liquid cane sugar are all good choices.
If the yogurt is too thick for your preferences, you could also add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of coconut water or purified water to thin it out.
 Transfer the yogurt to an airtight plastic container and place it in your refrigerator. Allow the yogurt to chill for approximately 2 or 3 hours.


This step isn't strictly necessary, but if you eat the yogurt immediately, it will be lukewarm and may seem less palatable.
 Remove the yogurt from the refrigerator and serve it while it's still cool.


Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container and use them within two weeks.

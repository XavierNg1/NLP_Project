 A pawn is promoted when it reaches the other side of the board. It will become a queen, rook, bishop, or rook. Once the pawn reaches the other side, you can replace it with the piece of your choosing. Pawns are most commonly promoted to queens.You can have more than one queen on the board.You may say, "If your pawn makes it to the other side of the board, it can become a different piece. You can choose the piece that you turn it into. The queen is usually best."

, En passant happens when a player moves the pawn two spaces on the first movement and the pawn is next to the opponentâ€™s pawn. If this happens, the opponent can use their pawn to capture your pawn. Your opponent must capture your pawn during the next move. If the pawn is not captured during the next move, your pawn can remain..


This move may never happen naturally. Set up the board to demonstrate how this happens.A pawn can never be promoted to a king.
 Castling involves moving the king and the rook at the same time. If there is nothing between the king and the rook/castle and neither of the pieces have been moved yet, this move can happen. The king moves two spaces towards the castle and then the castle jumps to the other side of the king.The king and the rook must be in their original positions to castle.You cannot castle if the king is in check.

 To make a homemade cleaning solution, mix cool water with a few squirts of dish soap. How much you need will depend on if you’re cleaning a whole bag or just an isolated stain.For a few small stains, use a cup (8 ounces) of water and about an ounce of dishwasher soap. You can double or triple this amount for a whole bag.
Don’t use hot water when mixing a homemade solution. Hot water will set the stain and make it harder to get out.;
, Dip a toothbrush into your cleaning solution. Then, with your hand holding the bag from the other side, scrub small areas of the bag at a time. You should move the brush in a circular motion to bring up any dirt or stains.You should create a bit of a lather as you do this.
If you there are stains on your bag, use the same procedure, but scrub a little longer. How long you have to scrub will depend on the size of the stain, but you should scrub for at least a minute.
 Once you’re done scrubbing the stain, wipe down the area you cleaned with a cloth dipped in clear water. You may need to repeat this step more than once to get all of the soap off the nylon., Nylon is pretty water-resistant, so you should be able to blot the bag dry.If your bag has cloth straps, they’ll take longer to dry.

 Treatment options for your dog’s prostate disease will depend on his specific diagnosis, so it is important to discuss the options with your dog’s veterinarian.There are several different options for medical management prostate disease, such as BPH, including Suprelorin implants (which is a slow release drug injected under the skin which is a reversible form of chemical neutering), Ypozane (a tablet which blocks receptors in the prostate from registering testosterone), and also older hormone therapy injections such as deelvosterone. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses, so talk with your dog’s veterinarian about the treatment options available for your dog. Indeed, surgical desexing may be the most effective long term option.
 Your vet will recommend a specific dosage of antibiotics for your dog for a set period of time. Make sure you follow your vet’s dosage instructions and find ways to give your dog his medication so he can recover successfully.If your dog has been castrated, your dog will likely recover with five to seven days of the surgery. His prostate gland will likely return to a normal size within several weeks.
 It is very important that if your dog is not neutered due to his prostate issue, he still abstain from mating with other dogs while he recovers. This is especially important if your dog has prostate disease due to a bacterial infection.Make sure your vet does a prostatic fluid sample to confirm your dog no longer has bacterial prostatitis before you allow him to mate with other dogs.
 If you notice your dog is exhibiting symptoms of prostate disease despite the treatment, such as difficulty urinating, lethargy, high fever, and abdominal pain, you should bring him into the vet right away. These may be signs that the disease has not been treated successfully or is recurring and chronic.Depending on your dog’s medical situation, your vet may recommend a stronger course of medication or another form of treatment for the prostate issue.

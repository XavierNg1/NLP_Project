 The electron affinity of an atom is the measure of how likely that atom is to “take” electrons from another atom. Electron affinity grows as you go from left to right across the periodic table, and up from bottom to top. In other words, small, non metallic atoms tend to have the highest electron affinity.Electron affinity is one component of the atom’s electronegativity.
Some atoms with high electron affinity are fluorine, chlorine, oxygen, and nitrogen.
A few low affinity atoms are sodium, calcium, and hydrogen.
 Ionization energy is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from any particular atom. The ionization energy rises as you go from left to right across the periodic table, and from bottom to top. This means that small, non metallic atoms are the hardest atoms from which to remove electrons. Large, metallic atoms are the easiest.Ionization energy is the other component of the atom’s electronegativity.
 By looking at the periodic table, you can tell a lot about how polar a bond will be between any two atoms. Atoms at the top right of the table will tend to ionize and hold a negative charge. Atoms on the far left of the table tend to form positive ions. Atoms in the middle of the table form less polar bonds.

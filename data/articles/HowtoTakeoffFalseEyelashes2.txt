 If you want to save your false eyelashes to reuse them later on, choose an oil-free liquid makeup remover. If you intend on tossing out your false eyelashes after removal, then any type of makeup remover will work. Whatever type of makeup remover you choose, make sure that it is not expired and that it doesn’t contain any ingredients you may be allergic to.
 Handily enough, you can use the same product to remove your eye makeup as you can to remove your false eyelashes. Before you have a go at your lashes though, remove any eye shadow or eyeliner you may be wearing. Pour some of the remover onto a cotton pad, and gently rub your eyes to remove the makeup. Don’t remove any mascara yet though, as this might damage your false eyelashes.
 Get out a clean cotton swab and dip the end into your makeup remover, so that it is fully saturated. Position yourself in front of a mirror, so that you can see your eyelid and lash line close up.
 Gently rub your lash line where the glue is most prevalent, using the saturated end of the cotton swab. Go back and forth slowly; the glue will likely ball up as it is removed from your skin. You can use the dry end of the cotton swab to sweep away the glue as it comes off. Repeat these actions until all the glue has been removed.
 The lashes are likely to be falling off on their own at this point. Use your fingers or a pair of tweezers to gently pull them off your eyelids. Keep in mind that you are less likely to damage the lashes if you use tweezers to remove them, in case you wanted to reuse them later on.
 To finish the job, wash off the remaining makeup remover and any makeup or glue residue from your eyelids. Use a mild facial cleanser and warm water to clean it off, and pat your eyelids dry.

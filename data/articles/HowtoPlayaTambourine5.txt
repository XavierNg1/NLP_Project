 Often in a multi-percussion setup, it will be necessary to mount a tambourine to a stand in order to free your hands for playing other instruments. In this case, it is acceptable to play the instrument with either a stick or a mallet. The tambourine can be struck directly on the head or on the top edge of the frame.
 If you are interested in exploring the tonal possibilities of the tambourine, varying your striking implement is helpful. For instance, a soft yarn marimba mallet will produce a much more subdued tone than a drumstick or glockenspiel mallet.

 For this method, which requires singing the edges of the fabric to create an organic, realistic effect, you'll need light, silky fabric. Avoid felt and other thick fabrics when you're using this method.
 You'll need one circle that is about a half an inch larger than the diameter you want the finished flower to be. The other circle should be half an inch smaller in diameter than the first circle, and the third a half an inch smaller than that. Continue cutting smaller circles until you have 5 or 6.
 Use a fabric pen or chalk to trace the circles. Since the edges will be singed, it's ok if the markings show up at the edges of the fabric. Cut out the shapes you traced with fabric scissors.
 Use scissors to make slits around the edges of the circles to create petals. The petals don't need to be rounded; all you need for this method are simple slits. Space the slits so that there are about 6 petals when you are done cutting. The slits should end about 1/3 way into the circles.
 Working one at a time, hold a fabric flower approximately 2 inches (5.1Â cm) over a candle flame. Rotate the flower continuously so that it does not catch on fire. The flame will melt the edges and give the fabric a realistic look. Repeat the process with each layer.
 Place the circles on top of each other so that the largest is on the bottom and the smallest is on top. Place a bead on top as a stamen. With thick thread and a sewing needle, bring the needle through the center of the flower, securing the bead in place and the layers together. Make several stitches so that the layers are securely in place.

 Open a new web browser window or tab, and visit the OneDrive website.
 Click the “Sign-in” button in the upper right-hand corner of the page, and enter the email address you used to register and click “Next.” It should take you to a new page where you need to enter your password as well. Do so and click “Sign in” to continue.
 At the top of the page is a button that says “Upload.” Click this and choose either the file or folder options from the drop-down menu given.
 If you chose the file option, a large box will pop up on the upper left-hand side of the screen. Locate the file you want to upload and click “Open” in the lower right-hand corner of the box. A progress window will drop down on the right, showing the number of files being uploaded and its progress.


You can upload as many files you want at the same time.
 If you have chosen the folder option, a small box will pop up in the center of the screen. Locate the folder you wish to upload, click it once, and then click “OK” to continue. You can upload only one folder at a time.


Most of the time, depending on the size of the folder, these uploads can take more time.
You have now backed up the file or folder.

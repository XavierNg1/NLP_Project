 Villagers are the key to a great economy, as they gather resources and build buildings.

, This guide should not be used for full game-play! Success in the game is from a strong and well-developed military, but in order to do that, you need a strong economy. Beware of rushers that will invade your civilization in the Feudal Age, early Castle Age, or late Castle Age. If you neglect militaristic development (unless you are in wonder race), you will lose the game.

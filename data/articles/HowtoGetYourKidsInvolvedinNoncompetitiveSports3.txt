 No matter what sport your child is playing, the key is to emphasize having fun. Let them know how proud you are of them for trying and sticking to a sport, and encourage them to have fun while doing it.For instance, you could say, "It's great that you're trying yoga! You're doing a great job, and it's so good that you're having fun doing it!"

, If you're trying to encourage more exercise, you need to model it to your child. Go on nightly walks together, or check out local hiking trails. You can also take bike rides together or go swimming. In the house, you can have dance parties, where kids likely won't even realize they're getting exercise in., If your kid loves being inside gaming, start buying games that encourage them to get up and move. Many video games encourage things like dancing, for instance, which engages your child in exercising without them even realizing it.For non-screen games, go old-school with games like Twister.
 One way to encourage fitness is to limit screen time and send kids outside to play with siblings and other neighborhood kids. It helps to provide outdoor activities, such as a swing set, jump ropes, hula hoops, and water guns.

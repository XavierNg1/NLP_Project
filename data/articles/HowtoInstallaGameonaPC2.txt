 The PC will automatically detect that a disc has been inserted, and a window will display on the monitor. Allow approximately 30 seconds for this to happen. You’ll probably hear the drive as it spins up and reads your disc.;
, If nothing pops up within 30 seconds, then open My Computer and search for an icon with your game's name in the file.


If you don’t see it, locate and click on an icon that is labeled removable, or local disc, and open the directory.
 It may contain valuable information about installation or usage.
 Once you have located your software and have read any read-me files, double-click on the game or installer and follow the on-screen prompts to install.
 If you enjoy reading stuff about copyrights, fairness, and how the company promises to never sell your name to anybody ever, or think it’s important to know what rights the game maker has taken for its own, then read the legal documents that are offered to you or displayed. Otherwise, simply follow the prompts and agree to everything they ask.
 This might be brief, or it could take quite a long time, depending on the complexity of your game and the speed and efficiency of your PC.
 Play the game, and have fun!

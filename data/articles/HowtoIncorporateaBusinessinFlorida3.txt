 Follow the guidelines at the Florida Department of State website, which essentially includes the same information outlined in Step 1 in the previous section. Include a cover letter with a contact name, phone number and email address. There's a fill-in form at the Sunbiz.org website that you can use to draft the document and cover letter., The filing fee is $35, and the fee to designate a registered agent is $35. You must also pay the additional fees if requesting a Certificate of Status, which certifies the corporation is in good standing, and/or a certified copy of the Articles of Incorporation.
 Mail it to the Department of State Division of Corporations, P.O. Box 6327, Tallahassee, FL 32314. Or you can deliver it in person to the Clifton Building, 2661 Executive Center Circle, Tallahassee, FL.

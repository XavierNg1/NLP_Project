 Start the side lunge by standing up straight with your feet hip-width apart. Your head should stay upwards with your chin tilted slightly upwards. Place the majority of your weight on your heels and flex your abdominal muscles to keep your back stable. Keep your shoulders back and square.Throughout a lunge exercise your arms and hands can be in any position that helps you maintain your balance. Some people may prefer to put their hands on their hips while others may prefer to keep their arms held out to the side.
 Keep your left foot flat on the ground and your back straight. Shift your weight to your right foot.








How far your feet will be apart may depend on your height, but aim to place your right foot at least 2 feet from your left foot.
Adjust your stance as you go to whatever distance allows you to feel the stretch in your leg muscles without any discomfort.
 Once your right foot is on the ground, bend your right knee so your body continues to move lower. Keep your lower leg (shin) perpendicular to the floor and line up your right knee so itâ€™s above your right ankle. Keep your left leg as straight as possible while your left foot remains flat on the ground. The majority of your weight should now be on your right leg.
 Use your right foot to push yourself upwards and return yourself to the starting position standing straight up with both feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
 Complete a side lunge to the left following all the same steps, just in the opposite direction.








Alternatively, you can continue performing side lunges to the right and then move to your left side later.
Ensure you perform the same number of lunges on both sides of your body before you finish your exercise routine.

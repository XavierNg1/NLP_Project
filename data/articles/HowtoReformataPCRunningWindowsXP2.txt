 This prompt will appear shortly after the (POST) power-on self test. Once the CD loads, press the Enter key at the Welcome to Setup screen., Since there is already an existing Windows XP installation you may receive a prompt to repair it. Press the ESC key to bypass this option and continue formatting the disk.
 All your existing partitioned and non-partitioned spaces will be listed on the screen. Use the arrow keys to select fields to be deleted.
 When prompted, press the L key to confirm partition deletion. This will clear old data from the hard drive of the computer.
 Now that all the partitioned spaces are deleted, press the C key to create a new partitioned space. Press enter to create a new partition of the maximum size.

 If you wear accessories or dress yourself in a bold way, you might be able to draw people's attention away from your mouth. Think about the things you've always wanted to try: new hairstyles, new clothing styles, new accessories. Yes, these things may catch people's eyes – but if you are authentic in expressing yourself, the attention will not be negative.
 Try wearing an interesting hat, a pair of sunglasses, or a scarf. Wear a different style of clothes, and try a new trend. Put on a t-shirt that is different from your regular attire. Wear temporary tattoos, and use jewelry to distract from your braces.
 Put your hair into a new and exciting hairstyle – or get a bold haircut! Do your eye makeup in a colorful, catchy way.


Apply sparkly or dramatic eye-shadow. Eye-shadow takes the attention away from your mouth and to your eyes. Don't use too much!
Avoid wearing bright lipstick. It will draw all the attention towards your mouth

 Buttermilk will tenderize the chicken, and adds some much-needed fat to the lean mean, keeping the final tenders moist and delicious. You can use straight buttermilk, or create a spiced buttermilk marinade for additional flavor. To do so, simply add a half teaspoon of the following spices to your buttermilk, stir well, and use this to coat the chicken:


Paprika
Cayenne
Dried green onions
Black pepper
Cracked red pepper
Garlic powder
1 tablespoon salt, Stir with a fork until the flour clumps up lightly, almost like wet sand. The touch of salt and pepper can be augmented by an additional teaspoon of the spices mentioned above as well, though this is up to personal spice preference.If you're out of buttermilk you can use a little regular milk, or even water, to clump up the flour. These clumps create the delicious crispy coating for your tenders.
 Let some of the excess liquid drain off first. Then liberally coat each piece of buttermilk chicken in your flour mixture. Each strip should have an even coating of flour, with several big clumps attached as well.It can help to use a fork or tongs to prevent messes while working with wet chicken.
 Traditionally, buttermilk chicken is deep fried, giving it the rich (though not necessarily healthy) flavor and texture than makes southern-fried chicken so popular. But you can cook this recipe on a stovetop or in the oven without losing much, and you may even find you prefer these lighter, less oily versions.

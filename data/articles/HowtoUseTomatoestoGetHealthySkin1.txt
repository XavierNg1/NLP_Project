 Place 1 small, finely chopped organic cucumber and 1 large, finely chopped organic tomato into the pitcher of a blender. Start the blender on low, but turn it up to high and process them for 30 seconds or until they’re completely pureed.If you don’t have a blender, you can use a mortar and pestle or a fork to break the cucumber and tomato down until they have a liquidy, pureed consistency.;
, Once the tomato and cucumber are pureed, transfer the mixture to a jar or other covered container. Store the toner in the refrigerator to help keep it fresh.The toner will last for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.
 To use the toner, dip a cotton pad in the tomato and cucumber mixture. Gently run the cotton over your face and neck to spread the toner across your skin.Make sure that your skin is clean before you apply the toner.
Applying the toner when it's cold from the refrigerator can be refreshing, particularly in warm weather. However, you can allow it to sit out at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes to warm up slightly if you prefer.
 In order for the antioxidants in the tomato to really penetrate your skin, it’s important to let the toner soak in. Keep the toner on your face for approximately 5 minutes to get the full benefits from the tomato.If you notice any stinging or discomfort with the toner on your skin, wash it off immediately.
 After the toner has soaked in for several minutes, wash it off with warm water. Rinse thoroughly to ensure that no residue is left behind. Follow up with your usual serum, acne treatment, and/or moisturizer.For the best results, use the tomato cucumber toner daily.

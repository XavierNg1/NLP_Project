Many hand sanitizers contain rubbing alcohol. Rub them directly on the old marks and wipe off of the board.
For tough stains, rub few drops of isopropyl alcohol around with your finger on the old marks. Use enough alcohol to leave a thin layer. Allow it to sit for a few seconds and then wipe dry.;
, Pour some peroxide directly on the old marks. Wipe the peroxide off with a cloth or paper towel. You might need to rub the board again with a clean cloth or paper towel to fully remove the marks.
 Slowly and carefully draw over what you want to erase with a dry erase marker. A dark-colored marker will work most effectively. You might need to repeat this several times.

This will work well to erase permanent marker from the dry erase board.
 Rub neutral (no color) shoe polish onto the old marks. Buff the polish off with a clean cloth. Shoe polish provides a smooth, like-new surface.

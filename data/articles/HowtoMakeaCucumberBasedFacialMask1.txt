 A cucumber and yogurt mask is great for all skin types and is particularly good for dry skin or sunburnt skin. Begin making the mask by washing the cucumber, then cutting it in half. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the dark skin from one cucumber half.If you don’t have a peeler, carefully slice the skin off with a small knife.;
, Cut the peeled cucumber half into large chunks, then place the pieces in a food processor. You don’t have to be precise with the pieces, just cut them small enough so that they can be easily blended.If you don’t have a food processor, you can also use a blender, the mixture may just be a little chunkier.
 Measure out a tablespoon of yogurt and add it to the food processor. Try to use plain yogurt for the mask rather than a flavored variety that may have added ingredients.If you have dry skin, consider adding a teaspoon of coconut or olive oil.
Yogurt contains lactic acid, which is great for refining and tightening pores. It is great for all skin types because it is gentle yet cleansing.
 Use the puree setting on your food processor or blender to blend the two ingredients. Puree until the mixture is fully blended into a wet paste.

 If you own a paddle boat, skip this step. Before renting one check the place you're renting out from in advance. Check for ducks (they can carry swimmer's itch), dead fish, etc. Check the paddle boats to make sure they're not falling apart and are in good condition.;
, It's never fun to paddle boat alone. Talk to them about their schedules, and when they're open. Consider splitting the price. Tell them what they need to bring - bathing suit, towels, sunscreen, etc.
 Water bottles, towels, etc. Make sure to bring more than you need in case someone's forgotten to bring it. Go and pick up your friends and or loved ones and drive to your destination!

, It's generally considered polite for you to do this. Now get dressed and put on some sun screen.
 Decide how you're going to rotate through the seats. Let the people sitting in the back go first, then the paddlers.
 If you're the people in the back, look for fish, go leach searching, let your feet drag in the water, just have fun! Soon you'll be paddling, so enjoy the time that you have to kick back and relax!

, An argument would ruin your boating trip. If you're the person in the front, ask everybody where they want to go. If there are children on the boat, pretend you're a pirate captain, and say things like "Land ho!" or other pirate sayings.
 Even if your paddling. if you don't know what to say, say something like, "Isn't it hot out?" or "How was it at work today?" However, make sure to let everybody talk, so no one feels left out.
 You can make a scrapbook! If you don't have a waterproof camera with you, don't bring it. If you drop it, and it's not waterproof, it will break and possibly sink.

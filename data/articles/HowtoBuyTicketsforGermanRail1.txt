 The German trains include the ICE (InterCityExpress), IC/EC (InterCity/EuroCity), RegionalExpress (RE), and RegionalBahn (RB) and the S-Bahn, which serves as a commuter train in many cities. The high-speed ICE is used for long, fast runs between major stops. It goes up to 300km/h (186mph). The ICE Sprinter is timed and planned for business travelers. It doesn't drives faster than normal ICEs, but it stops only at important stations. The IC goes up to 200km/h (124mph) and is less comfortable than the ICE, but also a little cheaper. RegionalExpress and RegionalBahn are short-distance trains. They both will be declared as "Regional Trains" in English in-train announcements. If you're traveling more than about 200 kilometres, you should avoid RE and RB because they aren't very comfortable and you can't make a reservation. Also RBs are often very old coaches (toilet smells terrible!). The CityNightLine provides overnight travel between Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and Dresden.

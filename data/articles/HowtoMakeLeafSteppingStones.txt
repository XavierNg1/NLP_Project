 larger than your leaf. Place sheeting on the ground. Make sure area is clear of debris and additional leaves. Also, this project works best in an area that is free of any moisture.;
, Make sure the leaf is centered and the veins are face up.
 Working quickly, use gloved hands to integrate concrete mixture together. Spread mixture over the leaf until you achieve a thickness of approximately 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in).


Smooth hand over concrete to remove air bubbles and create a flat surface.
 Cut wire to within 5 centimeter (2.0 in). of the edge, overlapping pieces if necessary.


Add more concrete over the chicken wire, spread again to a 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in). thickness. Smooth your hand over the top to remove bubbles.
 The plastic will remain in place as the design cures and dries, which could take up to 48 hours.


Add a second piece of plastic over the top of the design to ensure it cures properly and does not simply dry out.
 If you worked in a humid environment, the leaf may have already decomposed and broken down.


Use a hose with jet spray nozzle to remove remaining leaf pieces.
 You can place the stones in the desired area, but avoid walking on them until the curing process has finished.

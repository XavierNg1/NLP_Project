 You can use Facebook to log in, then after you create your Habbo.;
, Call for a guide to come help you.
 After you learn the basics, go and party with the other Habbos, sometimes they are at the Pool, sometimes at Club Mammoth.


Go where there are a large number of people, like about 10 or 15. It wouldn't hurt to gain a couple of acquaintances during the night or day.
 It's not real life, so don't be shy or timid.


Make sure that if you are a girl and looking for a boyfriend, you dance near the guys, and if you are a boy looking for a girlfriend, dance near the girls.
 They will invite you to places and spread your name.
 Just keep socializing!

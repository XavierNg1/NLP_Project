 Choose one that you like but try to avoid anything that contains irritants such as artificial colorings or scents. Good choices include castile soap or a gentle glycerin soap.


Avoid using soap that does not foam.;
, Using a kitchen grater, grate the bar of soap over a large bowl to catch all the flakes.
 The container should be airtight to avoid moisture affecting the flakes. A plastic sealable bag is suitable.

 A digital clock is made up of two numbers separated by a colon. The first number on a digital clock marks the hour. If the first number reads "2", for example, it's in the two o'clock hour., The second number on a digital clock, found after the colon, marks the minutes into the hour. For example, if it reads "11," it is 11 minutes into the hour., Once you have both the numbers, you should be able to tell the time. If the clock reads "2:11," this means the time is two eleven. The hour is two, and it's eleven minutes into that hour., Some digital clocks will say if it's AM or PM somewhere on the clock. In the absence of this label, remember time of day. Times are marked as AM if they fall between midnight and noon. Times are marked as PM if they fall between noon and midnight.

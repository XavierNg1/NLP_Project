 HJSplit does not need to be installed to run, and versions are available for both PC and Mac platforms.
 If either of the email providers involved have a limit for file sizes sent or received, the "parts" should be sized a bit smaller than the allowed limit.
 Be sure to note in the message how many parts are to be expected. If the recipient does not have the file splitting program, send it as well (or a link to where it can be obtained).

 You may want to check out professional or amateur productions on video, but be careful not to get locked into preconceived notions of what a character should or shouldn't look or sound like.;
, Be sure you have the talent sufficient to play all the most crucial roles. Don't even think about producing "Fiddler on the Roof" unless you have some men who could carry the load of Tevye. You might get lucky when someone appears from nowhere singing "If I Were a Rich Man" in a beautiful baritone, but don't count on it.
 Intelligence is one of the actor's most important qualities. When in doubt, it's better to pick a smart person.
 Do not base your casting on how well an auditioner can read aloud. Sometimes poor readers can act circles around good readers. Ask those who have difficulty reading to recite something from memory, even the alphabet, to get a sense of their emotive ability.
 From the moment someone walks in, you can tell if they are a contender. Notice their manner of speaking, their body language, their attitude.
 For example, you probably don't want to cast someone who is 5'4" to play Romeo to a Juliet who is 6'2". Then again, don't assume that things might not work!

, Quality of roles is better than quantity. It doesn't take much in some places to get an ensemble part, but large/leading roles show that the actor has ability.
 Once you put someone in a role, he or she may become very attached to it. Better to delay the process with callbacks than to realize after a week of rehearsal that you've made a mistake.
 You may want to select a cast and begin read-throughs before assigning specific roles. That way you can do script analysis and build cast camaraderie in the first few days while determining who fits which part best.
 You need to know when he or she is available to rehearse. Also, make sure the actor will be in town during the run of the show!

, It should state what is expected of each cast member and include a tentative rehearsal schedule.

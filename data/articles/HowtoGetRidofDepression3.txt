 Antidepressants affect the neurotransmitter system of the brain to try to counteract problems in how neurotransmitters are made and/or used by the brain. Antidepressants are categorized based on the neurotransmitters they affect.The most common types are SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, and tricyclics. Names of some of the most widely used antidepressants can be found by searching for antidepressants online.A psychiatrist will also know the best choices for medications for your particular case.
Your psychiatrist may have you try a few different medications until one seems to work. Some antidepressants backfire on some people, so it's very important to stay in close contact with your practitioner and note any negative or unwelcome change in mood immediately. Usually, switching to a different class of drug will fix the problem.
 If an antidepressant alone isnâ€™t working, your therapist might recommend an antipsychotic. There are 3 antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone). There is also an antidepressant/antipsychotic combination therapy (fluoxetine/olanzapine), which is approved for use along with a standard antidepressant. These can treat depression when an antidepressant alone is not working., To maximize how medication works, continue to visit a mental health professional on a regular basis while taking the medication., Antidepressants take time to work, because they slowly and gently modify the brain's chemical balance. Generally speaking, it will take at least three months to see any lasting effect from an antidepressant.

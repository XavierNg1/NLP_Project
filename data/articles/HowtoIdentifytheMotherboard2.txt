 This is a free utility that can display a lot of different information about your computer. You can download it for free from the CPUID website.You can also use a variety of other hardware monitor programs, including PC Wizard, HWMonitor, and AIDA 64.
 You will need to allow CPU-Z to run, as it requires administrator privileges. This is because it has to access a lot of low-level information, and most hardware options are disabled for non-administrators.


CPU-Z will take a few moments to start as it gathers information about your computer.
 This will pull up all the information for your motherboard. You can use the other tabs to find out other information about the hardware installed in your computer.
 You should be able to retrieve most motherboard information from this page. Occasionally, a motherboard will not be reporting correctly and nothing will display here. IN that case, you will need to open your PC and visually identify the motherboard.

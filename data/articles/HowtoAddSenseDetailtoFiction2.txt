 If you're writing about someone entering a cave to take shelter from a rainstorm, determine how each sense would perceive the setting. For example:


Sight: Moss clinging to the cave mouth, water trickling off stalactites
Hearing: Sound of dripping water, heart thumping in response to peals of thunder
Touch: Wet, slippery moss, sodden clothes, blast of cold wind
Smell: Musty, stale cave air, stench of sweat and rain-soaked clothes
Taste: Chalky taste of water dripping into character's mouth from the cave roof

,


Use strong, precise verbs. Saying "water plopped" or "water beetled down" is more descriptive than saying "water fell."
Understand both the dictionary definition of words and their meaning to the reader. A "babbling brook" carries the hint of happiness, while a "rushing torrent" suggests fear and danger.

 The first thing you should do is open the Spotify app on your smartphone. Look for the green circle with the black lines in it that is the Spotify icon. When you find it, tap it with your finger.
 If you’re not yet logged in, enter the email address and password for your Spotify account then tap the “Sign in” button.
 Once your account loads, look at the top-left side of your phone screen for a box with three lines. Tap the box and a menu will appear to the left of the screen.
 After the menu pops up, look for the “Your Music” option and tap it to open your saved music.


All of your saved music and playlists will pop up on your screen.
 Across the top of the screen are all of the different subsections of your saved music. The very first section is titled “Playlists”; tap this subsection to get to all of your different playlists.
 Look through your playlists and find the one that you want to delete a song from. When you find the playlist, tap it to open it up on your screen.
 Beside each song is a small box with three dots. Locate the song to delete and click on the box beside it. A list of options will appear.
 The very first option is “Remove from this playlist.” Tap on this option and the song will be deleted from your list.

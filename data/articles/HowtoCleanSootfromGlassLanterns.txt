 Either slide the glass panels out or lift off the glass globe, depending on the style of lantern you have. Some lanterns have easy-to-remove glass, while others may require minor disassembly with a screwdriver before you can get the glass out.;
, Avoid harsh chemical soaps, since these are more likely to scratch or warp the glass.
 Use a soft cloth or sponge. Anything rougher will very likely scratch the glass.
 Gently wipe the surface of the glass with a clean paper towel as you rinse it. If you still see soot residue, proceed with additional cleansing.
 Vigorously shake the bottle to combine the two liquids.
 Use this towel to wipe down the glass. Apply a gentle pressure, just firm enough to scrub away the ash.
 Apply the solution liberally over the surface of the glass.
 The glass should be completely dry. This should remove the soot, but if you still notice ashy residue, additional cleaning may be advised.
 The tub should be just big enough to fit the glass panels or globe.
 Prevent the panels from overlapping as much as possible. The glass needs to be exposed in order to get the full effect of the treatment.
 The fizzing should remove much of the soot.
 Allow all sides of the glass to get exposure to the new solution.
 The cleansers in the denture tablets will still be active long after they stop dissolving.
 Wipe it dry with a clean microfiber cloth.
 By now, all traces of soot should be gone. The glass may appear foggy, however, which could still hinder the way light shines through the lantern.
 Glass-top stove cleaners are preferable to window cleaners, since stove cleaners are more likely to withstand hot temperatures and less likely to be flammable. Gently wipe the glass with a clean paper towel or microfiber cloth until it appears dry, transparent, and streak-free.
 Doing so will allow it the chance to completely dry.
 Slide or screw it back into place as necessary.

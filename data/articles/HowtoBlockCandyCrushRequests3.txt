 Look for the Facebook app on your Android device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap on the “More” button at the bottom of the device. Select “Settings” from the menu, and you will be brought to the Settings screen.
 From the Settings screen, scroll down until you see “Notifications Settings.” Under this section, all the different notifications are listed. Each one can be disabled or enabled separately.
 Scroll down the list of notifications until you see “Application requests.” Beside it is a circle with a tick. Tap on this to remove the tick. Make sure it’s empty and “Alerts are off” is displayed under it.


You have now disabled all applications requests for Facebook.

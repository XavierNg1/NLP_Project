 A sign up window will pop up once you are on the site, or you can click the orange “Sign Up” button in the top right corner.


Enter the personal information that the sign up sheet requests.
 Once you sign up, you will be taken to this function immediately.


You can choose to upload from your computer, from Facebook, or from a URL. You will most likely be uploading from your computer.
You can create an album by clicking the box next to where it says “Upload to.” Give your album a name and description, and choose whether you want it to be public, private, or password protected. You can also assign it as a sub-album to another album, and then click the blue “Create” button.
On this screen, you will see a box outlined with a dotted line. You can drag and drop your photo files directly into that box, or you can click the blue button that says “Choose Photos & Videos.” If you do that option, find your photo within your documents and click the “Open” button.
Once your photo is uploaded, you can view it, share it, or edit it. Choose which option you want to do. If you do not edit it right away, you can edit it later by viewing the photo under the “Library” tab, clicking on it, and then editing it from there. You will have a variety of options for editing, and be sure to save when you are done.
 Photobucket gives you buttons to click to share it, such as to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, as well as via email.


Photobucket also provides you with embedded HTML codes to put your photos on a website.
If you made your album password protected, you will have to give the password to anyone whom you want to be able to see the photos.

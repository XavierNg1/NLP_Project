 There are many factors that go into deciding how often to clean your dog's ears. There is no specific rule for how often you should do this. This can range from once a week to once a month.This timeline depends on the amount of ear wax produced by your dog, any predisposition to ear infection, or your dog's general lifestyle.


For example, if your dog has a history of ear infections and has a fast production of thick black wax, he would benefit from cleaning once a week. If not, the built up wax could fester ear mites or harmful bacteria. Reducing the amount wax weekly could help decrease the breeding ground for infection.
However, if you dog has never had ear infections but still produces a lot of wax, he would be okay with ear cleanings once a month.
If you aren't sure, ask your vet for the advice about how often you should clean your dog's ears. You don't want to over clean them, which can cause problems., There are some behaviors that signal a larger issue for your dog than a need for ear cleaning. If your dog tilts his head to the side constantly or permanently to one side, avoid cleaning his ears and see your vet. Additionally, if your dog develops a head tilt after you clean his ears, seek veterinary attention before cleaning his ears again.


These symptoms are signs of ear pain or possibly a ruptured eardrum, both of which need immediate treatment. If the eardrum is ruptured, cleaning can make it worse., There are other ear conditions that might signal another issue with your dog. If you notice your dog scratching or tearing at her ears, have her ears checked by your vet before doing anything else to her ears.


These symptoms signal the possibility of a foreign object or body stuck in your dog's ear. If this is the case, your vet may need to examine her with an otoscope to check for issues.

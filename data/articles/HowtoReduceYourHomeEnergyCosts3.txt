Whereas 85% efficient used to be the standard for furnaces, there 98% efficient furnaces being manufactured today. That means that 98% of the fuel the furnace uses is turned into heat.
If your household is smaller, consider a tankless water heater for energy efficiency. They cost about the same as a conventional water heater, and as long as you donâ€™t use a large amount of water, will produce hot water faster and cheaper than a conventional water heater., It will be expensive, and it will take along time to pay for itself, but replacing your old windows with newer, energy efficient windows can bring down your energy bill by about 15%.

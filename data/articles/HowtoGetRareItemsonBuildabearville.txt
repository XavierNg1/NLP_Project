 A lot of people usually cannot buy items from BVO because you must by credits with real money.;
, This is a big part in getting rare items. Try to register exclusive bears as these bears are limited edition, thus making their items rare. Once you register them, you receive PSIs (Pet Special Items) which would most likely become rare.
 This will result in spending a lot of bearbills, but as you learn, these items may become rare. The embroidered top, for example, has become one of the rarest items on Bearville.
 Many people like the Pirate Belts, so it's good to have a couple handy. Also, stock up on Ballerina and Glitter Fairy costumes.
 Don't worry about people stealing your items; you can always cancel the trade if you don't want to trade an item.
 These items could become rare in a couple of months. Do not sell them just because you need Bearbills or more space in your inventory. If you need more space, put any unimportant items, doubles of items and Pawlette Coufur Boutique items in an attic.
 You won't automatically get every rare item in a day, for most people, it takes over a year to get Bunny Glasses or any other extreme rare item. You would be making a lot of trades, but someday you would reach your goal.

 There are only a few Roman numerals, so it doesn't take long to learn them:


I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000;
, A mnemonic is a phrase that you can memorize more easily than a list of numbers, that will help you remember the order of the digits. Try repeating this one to yourself ten times:

VI = 5 + 1 = 6
LXI = 50 + 10 + 1 = 61
III = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

, Most people who use Roman numerals save space by using subtraction to show certain numbers. You'll know this is happening if a smaller digit is in front of a larger digit. This only happens in a few situations:


IV = 1 subtracted from 5 = 5 - 1 = 4
IX = 1 subtracted from 10 = 10 - 1 = 9
XL = 10 subtracted from 50 = 50 - 10 = 40
XC = 10 subtracted from 100 = 100 - 10 = 90
CM = 100 subtracted from 1000 = 1000 - 100 = 900

, If you need to, divide a number into groups of digits to understand it better. Always make sure you catch any "subtraction problems" with a smaller digit in front of a larger, and include both the digits into the same group.


For example, try to read DCCXCIX.
There are two places in the number with a small digit in front of a larger one: XC and IX.
Keep the "subtraction problems" together and break up the other digits separately: D + C + C + XC + IX.
Translate into ordinary numerals using the subtraction rules when necessary: 500 + 100 + 100 + 90 + 9
Add them all together: DCCXCIX = 799.
 If a horizontal line is drawn across the top of a number, multiply the value by 1,000.Be careful, though: many people draw a horizontal line above and below every roman numeral, just as decoration.


For example, an X with a "â€“" written over it means 10,000.
If you're not sure whether the bar is just decoration, think about the context. Would a general send in 10 soldiers, or 10,000? Would a recipe use 5 apples, or 5,000?

 Before and after each drag, take a sip. This will keep your throat cool, and will keep some tar from sticking to it. Ideally, your drink should be non-alcoholic and non-carbonated, preferably water or juice.;
, If you take smaller drags, and hold them in for less time, you will not irritate your throat and lungs as much. Try to leave several seconds or more in between drags, to let your throat and lungs cool down.
 Try to get some aerobic exercise every day, preferably before you sing. 15 minutes is okay, but 30 or more is much better. It is essential that you exercise hard enough that you are breathing hard. The longer you breath hard, the better you will sing later (within reason).
 At first, you may not like smoking lights, but the improvements you notice in your voice will motivate you to stick with it. After you've been smoking them for several days, they will taste about like normal cigarettes.
 If you have a smoke every hour, try waiting two or three hours, and sing a song before each cigarette. You'll start to notice that the longer you wait, the better you sing. You'll also notice that you enjoy your cigarettes more this way. You can use this to motivate you to wait longer and longer.
 If all else fails and your voice hasn't improved to your satisfaction or you can't break your habits, you might want to consider taking it to the extreme and quitting altogether! You may have to choose between quitting smoking or quitting singing in the end.

 A dimmer switch allows you to control the brightness of a light fixture. Use a marker or colored tape to uniquely label each wire so you can tell them apart.


Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the “hot” wire.
Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the “neutral” wire.
Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the “grounding” wire.
 The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch.


If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.
If the wires are connected to push-in connectors, the holes that the wires are pushed into will typically have a small slot beneath the hole. Insert a small screwdriver into the slot and push forward to release the wire.
 Most dimmer switches come with wires already attached. You will see two black lead wires and one green grounding wire.


Strip 1/2 inch of insulation from each to expose the wire.
Pair one of the black lead wires to the black hot wire in the switch box.
Pair the other black lead wire to the white neutral wire in the switch box.
Pair the green grounding wire with the bare or green grounding wire in the switch box.
Wrap the ends of the paired wires together and secure with a wire nut.
 You should see the word “top” written on the switch indicating the side of the switch that should be vertically oriented toward the top.
, Do not over tighten the switch plate, since it may crack under too much pressure.
 Go back to the new switch and flip it on and off several times to ensure it’s in working order.

 The American Wirehair is fairly self-sufficient. That is, the cat doesn't need you to entertain it all day every day. Nonetheless, provide it with plenty of cat toys so that it can find ways to entertain itself when you're not around.This cat will also enjoy bird watching. Leaving the curtains open so the cat can see out is a good idea., This cat may not need constant entertainment, but it will often ask when it does want to play. If the cat brings you a toy, like a mouse, try engaging the cat in play.You could also bring out a toy on a stick/string to play with from time to time, as these cats enjoy chasing lures., To help your cat maintain a healthy weight, provide it with enough ways to exercise. For instance, you could put the litter box on a different floor from the food and water. That way, the cat needs to climb the stairs to use one or the other.You could also try using a harness and leash on your cat. Get your cat used to wearing the harness around the house, and then take it outside on a leash. The first couple of times, just hang out in the yard with your cat. After a few times, you can try going on a walk with it.

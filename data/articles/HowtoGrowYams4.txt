 Yams typically take about 14 weeks to mature. They should be harvested when the tops of plants start to go yellow and wither. Harvesting generally occurs in autumn., Use a pitchfork or similar gardening implement to gently dig into the soil and remove the tubers from under the surface. Start digging a safe distance from the stem. Be careful not to pierce the skin of the yams when removing them from the ground., Refrain from washing yams after harvesting. Instead, sort yams into boxes or baskets to cure them before storage. Curing can be done in approximately 2 weeks. To do so, place yams in a warm, dark place with some ventilation and leave them undisturbed. This process will allow bruising and wounds on the yams to heal, and seal out rot bacteria., Once harvested, yams can be kept for several months. Store yams in a cool, dry spot like a kitchen cabinet. Look up yam recipes and enjoy the fruits (or root vegetables) of your gardening.

 Look closely at your scars to figure out what color they are. Select a concealer or foundation color that's opposite to your acne scar color on the color wheel. This will effectively camouflage the acne scar. You could use:Green concealer to cover up reddish acne scars.
Yellow concealer to even out blemish areas caused by scars.
Pink concealer to balance out purple or dark blemish areas.
 Use a thin brush that is slightly feathered at the end to apply the concealer. Place a pea-sized amount of concealer on the back of your hand and rub the brush into it. Brush a light layer of concealer over the scar.You can use your finger to apply the concealer. Just take care not to apply to much or it may actually draw attention to your scar.
 You'll need to apply a foundation to hide your concealer, especially if your skin tone is a little different than the makeup or you've used a green concealer that's very noticeable. Apply your usual foundation so that your skin tone evens out and the scar is no longer visible.Take care when applying the foundation directly over the scar to avoid rubbing away the concealer.
 Let your foundation rest for a minute so that it dries a little. Take a large powder brush and apply your powder with broad upward strokes. You can use a loose powder that you simply dab the brush into and tap. Or, you can rub the brush into a pressed powder and tap it before applying.Remember to wash off your makeup every night. This is a habit that will keep your skin healthy and prevent future acne breakouts.

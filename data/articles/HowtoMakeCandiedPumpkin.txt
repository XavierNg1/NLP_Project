 Heat gently, stirring continuously to help the sugar to dissolve in the water.;
, Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until tender.
 Set aside. Continue cooking the sugar liquid until it reduces by half.


Pour this liquid over the pumpkin and put to one side to stand overnight.
 Place a wire baking rack over a baking tray.Â  Put the drained pumpkin pieces across the wire rack. Brush the syrup over each pumpkin piece. Keep doing this every hour until there is no syrup left to brush on the pieces.
 This will take 24 - 48 hours and the conditions must be dry.
 Roll the dried pumpkin pieces in the sugar to coat. The candied pumpkin is now ready to serve or to wrap in gift boxes for giving away.

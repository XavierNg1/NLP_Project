 Nude and cream go together like red lipstick and black cocktail dresses. Pair a nude suede jacket with a cream-colored sweater or blouse. Wear it with a soft turtleneck sweater in the fall and a silk blouse in the spring., Warm your shoulders up by throwing a pastel suede jacket over a spring dress. Layer a fall dress with tights, and brown or richly colored suede.
 A classic white tee looks great under classically colored brown suede. Look for suede that is a rich golden brown. Wear a looser tee with a military or slouchy suede jacket. Look for a more fitted style for bombers and moto jackets.


Layer an unopened collared shirt over a white tee and top it with a relaxed suede jacket.
 If you opt for a slimmer fit suede jacket with a tailored look, you can layer a vest underneath. Pair tan colored suede with a light grey vest and a white button up shirt. Wear a tie if you want to look impeccably put-together.

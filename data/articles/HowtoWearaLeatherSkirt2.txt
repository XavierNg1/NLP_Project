 If you are going to wear a leather skirt to the office, make sure it is suitable for the workplace. Select a leather skirt with a long hemline, such as a knee or midi skirt. The skirt should be cut in a more conservative silhouette —avoid leather skirts that are too tight or have an inappropriately high slit., Choose a simple, elegant top that complements the luxuriousness of the leather skirt. For a timeless look, tuck a crisp white button-up into the waistband of your leather skirt. If you’re frequently cold, wear a cardigan, jumper, or fitted blazer over the blouse.


In the fall and winter, pair your leather skirt with a delicate cashmere sweater or a chunky, oversized knit.
In the spring and summer, wear a lightweight blouse or high-neck tank., When you are at the office, keep your accessories simple and minimal. Slip on a pair of basic pumps, cute booties, or high boots. Wear a statement necklace or a few dainty pieces of jewelry.


If you are planning to go out after work, put less conservative shoes and jewelry in your bag.

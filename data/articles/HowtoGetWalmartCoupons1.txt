Note that coupons are only accepted for merchandise Walmart sells. You can only use one coupon per item and there must be a printed expiration date. While there is no limit to the amount of coupons used in one transaction, you might need a manager's approval when you have a lot of them.;

Share the coupons you find on Walmart.com with friends by emailing them. You also have the option to share coupons via Facebook and Twitter. Look for the social networking logos in the bottom right corner of the coupon.
 Not only can you print Walmart coupons, you can also sign up for emails so you are alerted when new coupons are posted.

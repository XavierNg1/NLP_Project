 Kids need to be able to stay on their feet while they run fast, and speed requires balance.


Utilize drills such as standing or jumping on one foot at a time to increase balance.;
, Their brains have to coordinate a lot of movements when they run.


Practice running. Before you concentrate on the speed, make sure kids know how to run properly, with good posture and relaxed limbs. You don't want them to look at their feet while they run, or valuable oxygen will be lost. Kids are also prone to squeezing their fists, which takes blood away from the heart and lungs.
Build speed and intensity as the children master the skill of running. Use running drills or encourage them to race each other.
 These are ladders you lay on the ground for children to step through as they run. It will increase good form and proper running technique.


Let kids practice their speed. If they kick the agility ladder or stumble, have them start over until they can get through it smoothly. Once they are able to master that, they can work on getting through it faster.
 Running fast is a skill and kids will only run faster if they practice and develop a consistent pace of improvement.


Develop a schedule. Have your kids run every day at a specific time, in a specific place.
 Too much intensity can cause injuries or lead the kids to lose interest in running. Recovering from a daily run is just as important for speed as the running itself.
 In order to run fast, kids will have to have a strong and stable core. Make sure general strength conditioning is part of any running program.


Instruct kids to do sit-ups, push-ups and other conditioning. This will strengthen their entire muscular system, enabling them to run faster.

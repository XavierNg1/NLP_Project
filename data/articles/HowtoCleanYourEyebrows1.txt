 Because the hairs of your eyebrows are delicate, they should not be washed with harsh cleaners. Instead, you can clean your eyebrows with your regular facial cleanser. Any facial cleanser that is gentle enough for your skin should be fine on your eyebrows. Wet your eyebrows and apply a small amount of face wash to your brows.








You can also get in the habit of applying face wash to your eyebrows when you wash your face in the morning and at night.;
, Use clean fingers to gently lather the face wash into your eyebrows. Do this in small, circular motions.








Be careful not to rub or scrub too hard on your eyebrow hairs. This can damage your eyebrow hairs and cause them to fall out or become clogged with product.
 Use lukewarm water to rinse the face wash off of your eyebrows well. Make sure you get all of the face wash off your eyebrows.
 Pat your eyebrows dry with a clean towel. Do not rub your eyebrows hard to dry them as this can damage them.

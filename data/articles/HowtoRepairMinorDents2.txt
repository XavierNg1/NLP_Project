 Dry ice needs to be applied to the dent for a short time in order to effectively remove it, so it may work best on horizontal surfaces such as the hood, roof or trunk lid of the vehicle. If the dent is on the side, you will need to hold the dry ice in place with tongs.You can purchase dry ice at many large retail stores or at office supply stores.
Dry ice works best on medium sized dents and may be less effective on large ones.
 Always wear safety glasses and heavy duty gloves when handling dry ice. Because of the extreme temperatures involved, coming into contact with dry ice on bare skin could seriously hurt you.Large rubber gloves and goggle style glasses are required for this project.
Do not open the dry ice package until you have adequate safety gear in place.
 Use a pair of long metal tongs to remove a chunk of dry ice and apply it directly to the dent. If the dent is on a horizontal surface, you may place the dry ice on it, otherwise you will need to hold it there. Allow the dry ice to contact the metal for thirty seconds to a minute before removing it again.Be sure that if you are going to hold the dry ice in place that you use tongs and wear gloves to prevent ice burns.
Do not leave the dry ice on the paint for longer than a minute or it may damage it.
 After you remove the dry ice from the metal, the warmth from the ambient air will interact with the extreme cold created by the ice. This interaction will cause the metal to shift and pop out the dent.The intense cold will cause the metal to retract then expand again as it warms.
This shift in temperature may pop the dent out.
 Depending on the size and severity of the dent, you may need to apply the dry ice and allow it to warm again multiple times to remove the dent entirely. Repeat the process until the dent is gone.Allow the metal to reach normal temperature again before re-applying dry ice.
Pay attention to the clear coat on the metal. If it begins to crack, stop applying dry ice immediately.

 Wearing one color from head to toe can flatter a shorter figure. Monochromatic outfits lengthen the appearance of your body. Try wearing a structured white top with a pair of fitted white pants. You can also create a monochromatic look by wearing the same print on both the top and bottom., One way to add height and flatter your short figure is by wearing a pair of pants, shorts, or skirt with a high waist. High-waisted bottoms can make your legs appear longer than they actually are. Try wearing a pair of high-waisted trousers with a top that easily tucks into the pants. You could also try a cropped top with a pair of high-waisted linen pants. Top off the look with flats, boots, or heels., Pants with vertical lines will beg the eye to look up and down, effectively lengthening your look. Try a pinstriped pant with a matching suit jacket. You can also go for a high-waisted pair of pants with a thick stripe for a bold look., When you are putting together an outfit, you do not want to overpower a small frame with multiple layered pieces. Instead of creating a multi-layered look, instead opt for a single layering piece like a sweater or vest â€“ not both.

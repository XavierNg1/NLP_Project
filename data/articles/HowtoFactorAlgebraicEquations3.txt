 Equations with two variables factor differently than basic quadratics. For any equation a2-b2 where a and b do not equal 0, the equation factors to (a+b)(a-b).


For example, the equation 9x2 - 4y2 = (3x + 2y)(3x - 2y).
 Note that, If the trinomial is in the form a2-2ab+b2, the factored form is slightly different: (a-b)2.


The equation 4x2 + 8xy + 4y2 can be re-written as 4x2 + (2 × 2 × 2)xy + 4y2. We can now see that it's in the correct form, so we can say with confidence that our equation factors to (2x + 2y)2


, Finally, it bears mentioning that cubics and even higher-order equations can be factored, though the factoring process quickly becomes prohibitively complicated.


For instance, 8x3 - 27y3 factors to (2x - 3y)(4x2 + ((2x)(3y)) + 9y2)

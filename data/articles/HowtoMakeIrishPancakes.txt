, Ensure to stir until all the eggs, milk and oil are well combined. Beat with a whisk, until a paste forms, smooth and thick. Add a little milk if the mixture is too thick.


Add a good portion of milk to mix well to remove any lumps from the batter.
 Continue until a thin paste forms, similar in consistency to sour cream.
 This will allow the starch in the flour to swell. This increases the lightness of the pancakes when cooked.
 If the pan is the ideal temperature, the batter should be cooked on one side for about 30 seconds.Heat the pan on medium heat. Rub with a paper towel soaked in oil. Using a ladle, pour the batter into the pan, moving the pan to cover the entire surface with a thin and uniform composition.
 Avoid creating folds and creases.
 The pancakes can be served as they are or are placed one above the other like a set.
 Serve with the standard pancake toppings, such as syrup, squeezed lemon juice or cream.

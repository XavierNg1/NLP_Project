 Once caught, place them immediately into an aerated live-well, a flow-through bait bucket, or a cooler with an aerator.Keep them well oxygenated to avoid loss. Minimize their stress as much as possible so they recuperate quickly and act normally when used as live bait.
 Use an accurate thermometer. Keep water under 60ºF. For short-term, same-day storage, add ice to your cooler or bait bucket if it’s a particularly hot day. For long-term storage, invest in a refrigerated, insulated tank or a water circulation system to minimize losses., For long-term storage, avoid losses through disease by cleaning your tank regularly. Paint your tank’s interior with pool and tank paints to seal the surface and minimize disease.

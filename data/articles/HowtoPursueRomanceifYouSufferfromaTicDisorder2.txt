 Stressful situations like parties and clubs can cause your tic to get worse. Spending time in quiet settings with your love can help you manage your tic. This will also give you the opportunity to pursue romance by getting to know each other better.


Plan dates or time together in settings where you know you will be relaxed.
For example, instead of planning to go to the gym together right after work when it will be packed, plan to go earlier in the day.
Have a meal at your house instead of going to a crowded restaurant to eat.
 When you have a Tic Disorder and you are in a relationship with someone, you can turn to them for support.Part of pursuing romance means opening yourself up and letting someone help you when you need it.


Let your romantic partner know when you are having a hard time managing your Tic Disorder.
For instance you could say something such as, “I’m kind of stressed right now, so my tics are really getting bad.”
Let your partner know how they can help you manage your Tic Disorder.
You might say, “Sometimes just you talking to me in a calm voice helps stop my tic.”

, Work with your romantic partner to develop a way to handle it when someone asks them about your tic. Talking about it in advance and having a plan will help both of you handle any stress or possible embarrassment your Tic Disorder may cause.


For example, you and your girlfriend might decide that you are going to ignore people that stare or act rude.
Or, for instance, your boyfriend might choose to tell people, “My partner has a Tic Disorder, that’s all.”

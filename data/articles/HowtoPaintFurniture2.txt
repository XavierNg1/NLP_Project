 Applying primer to the surface of wooden furniture helps the paint stick and last for years to come. Choose a color a few shades lighter than the color you plan to paint your furniture.









Apply the primer evenly to the surface of the furniture using an angled paintbrush.
One coat of primer should be sufficient, but if there are areas of the furniture that don't look completely covered, go over it with a second coat.
Let the primer dry completely before applying paint.
 Most types of paint work fine on wooden furniture, so choose the type and color that will give your table, chair or cabinet the look you want to achieve. Consider the following options when you pick out your paint:









For an upscale, high-quality look, go for a paint with a glossy finish.
Eggshell or matte paint can give furniture a "shabby chic" look, perfect for a child's dresser or a bookshelf in your sunroom.
 Use a foam roller and a high-quality, angled paintbrush to paint the furniture evenly. All of your strokes should move in the same direction for a professional-looking finish.









It's not necessary to paint the inside of furniture drawers and dressers, since a coat of paint could cause the drawers to stick.
Depending on the type of paint you're using, you may want to paint more than one coat. Let the first coat dry completely before applying another one.

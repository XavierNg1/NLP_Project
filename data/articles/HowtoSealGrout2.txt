 Turn the can around and point the nozzle at the grout line to be sealed.
 Follow each grout line.
 The cloth can be dampened with warm water to remove dried sealant. Unlike liquid grout sealers, spray grout sealers can be removed right after application.
 Apply another coat of sealant if the water is absorbed into the grout.
 The treated area can be walked on once the sealant is dry to the touch. A full cure is usually achieved in 24 hours.

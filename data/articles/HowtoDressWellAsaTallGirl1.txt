 Your legs and upper-half may be equal in length, or you may have short legs with a long torso, or a shorter upper body with super long legs. This may affect how you shop and dress.;
, If your posture stinks, you're not going to look good, no matter how you dress. Tall women tend to slouch or hunch their shoulders in an attempt to appear smaller. Really, slouching just makes you look insecure and sloppy. Throw your shoulders back and stand up straight--imagine there is a string attached to the top of your head and it is gently pulling you up toward the ceiling.
 Certain brands are known for catering to taller women. And with online shopping, you have even more options. Search for companies that focus exclusively on tall girls, and you'll have a much easier time finding clothes in your size.

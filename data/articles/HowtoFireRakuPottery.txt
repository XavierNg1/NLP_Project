 These glazes have a low melting point so they will mature at cone 06 in about an hour. check out http://members.chello.nl/~c.sleddens/index_bestanden/dewitt-raku-glazuren.htm for a huge list of glaze recipes. ***note: many of these glazes work better of applied in a thin layer***;
, This should take about an hour. If you don't know how to fire a kiln, you should have an experienced potter help you.


If you are using pyrometric cones or a pyrometer, skip this step.~~ Check on the ware every 15 minutes or so after you've been firing for about 45 minutes. You're looking for bubbling in the glaze. Once it starts bubbling, you're about 15 minutes away from "Raku Time!"

, Matt glazes are more difficult to read, so fall back on your cones/pyrometer reading if you need to.
, The cans should only be a little bigger than the pieces you want to put in them, the smaller the better to create a good reduction and lots of pretty color!

, (1)One to open the door, (2)one to pull the pieces out with tongs and place them in the cans, and (3)one to close the can lids. Each person should have a set of Raku gloves and appropriate eye protection. You may also want to wear dust masks as it's gonna get smoky!

, The door should be closed between pulls to retain heat. Place the pieces as quickly as possible into the waiting cans. Person 3 should wait for the newspaper to catch fire, then fit the lids on securely to smother the fire and smoke the pieces. **Note, always try to turn bowls upside down so the inside gets better color**

, Good cans shouldn't release too much smoke when covered, so be careful when you open them up. Keep your face away from the openings as you take off the lids. Also watch out for back drafts.
 Any remaining newspaper will begin to burn again once air is introduced back into the can. You can pour some water into the cans to put them out and cool the ware.
 **DO NOT DO THIS TO BOTTLES*** Bottles will explode if you douse them, allow bottles to cool naturally.

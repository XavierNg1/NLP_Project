 Simply use a slotted spoon and gently mix the water from the edges of the pan to obtain a round shape. Serve as informed above.
 Serve onto a piece of crisp garlic bread or French bread. Add seasoning and vegetables to the egg and any sauce of your choice (preferably Hollandaise, mayonnaise or Thousand Islands). This will cover up the broken yolk.


Leftovers such as pasta, kebabs, lobster, ox tongue, meringue, rolls and soup can be used as side dishes to divert the guest's attention.
Note: This save method is preferable for one egg. More eggs could be hidden between toast or inside another dish.

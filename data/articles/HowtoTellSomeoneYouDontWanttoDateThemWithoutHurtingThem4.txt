 No one enjoys hurting another person, but turning someone down doesn’t make you a jerk or a bad person. It’s completely normal and okay for you to say no. If you aren’t attracted to someone in that way, you can’t help that. Saying anything other than “no” is disrespectful to both of you., You aren’t obligated to please everyone, and you should never agree to date someone because you feel guilty. Respect your own feelings about the situation and don’t question yourself.


Expressing guilt openly can really confuse the other person. If you are giving them an honest answer, apologies aren't necessary.
 Maybe you aren’t even sure why you are turning the person down, you just have a bad feeling about it or them. Trust that feeling. If something feels weird or off, it probably is.
 It’s okay to say no and you have absolutely nothing to apologize for.You may even genuinely feel sorry, but expressing that out loud translates as pity and that you’ve somehow done something wrong by turning them down.

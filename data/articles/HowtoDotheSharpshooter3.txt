 Wrestler Sting used the same basic hold as a finishing maneuver, with subtle differences. The Scorpion Death Lock always rolls to the right, for example, and typically Sting will make a big deal out of rolling over the opponent slowly, whereas Bret Hart cinches it in quickly. While Sting rolls it over, he points with his other hand straight up at the sky and yells out to the crowd, cheering wildly, before squatting.


According to wrestling lore, Bret Hart actually learned the move when a backstage employee suggested that he try out the wrestler Sting's finishing move as a submission hold, making the Scorpion Death Lock the original iteration of the hold., One of the patented moves of the "Rated R Superstar" Edge, the Educator was basically a half-completed sharpshooter. To do the move, wrap up your opponent's legs as normal, and start turning over, but stop halfway. Instead of throwing your leg over, drop down on one knee, so your opponent is on his shoulder, giving the appearance of being bent sideways.


Have your opponent support his weight on his shoulder, essentially doing a side-bridge. It takes abdominal muscles of steel but looks great.
 In pro wrestling, the sharpshooter has become synonymous with controversy surrounding the 1997 Survivor Series match commonly known as the "Montreal Screwjob," in which Bret Hart–unbeknownst to him–lost after being put in his own finishing move. Because of this, the sharpshooter is the go-to move if something shady is going on in the match. Using the sharpshooter can be a tip of the hat to that still-controversial finish.

 Have a look at yourself in the mirror sideways with some of your favorite bags on your shoulder (one at a time). See if you can notice the following:


Wider bags increase the width of your hips; it will also increase the size of a full stomach or full buttocks
Bags with extra long straps so that the bag sits low tend to shorten your legs
A combination of a wide bag with a long strap shortens and widens you!;
, It is simply that your bag should not be wider than the width of your body looked at from the side. You can still fit a lot into a bag of this size, so don't worry!

, This is the halfway point from your shoulder to the floor. Again, look in the mirror to see this for yourself. If you're not able to adjust the strap length yourself, take it to someone who repairs bags to do it for you.

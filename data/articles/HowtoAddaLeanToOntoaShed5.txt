The shed in the photos is 10 feet (3.0 m) wide and 21 feet (6.4 m) long, so a partition was installed to create a 7x10-foot space on one side, and a 14x10-foot space on the other.
This partition was created by installing steel stud purlins between one of the outboard support posts and a nailer fastened vertically to the existing shed wall.
 Choose a pre-framed exterior door to make the job simple. You will still need to install some kind of framing yourself.
 If you want an earth floor, then you can skip this step. If you prefer a wooden floor, then lay your flooring material over the skids that served as your foundation.
 You can nail wide boards the studs to construct exterior walls. You can also add siding if you prefer.

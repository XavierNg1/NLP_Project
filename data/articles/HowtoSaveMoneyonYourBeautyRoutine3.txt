 Use up every bit of your cosmetics: Get the last smidgen of lipstick out of the tube with a lip brush. Revitalize a dried-out mascara tube with a few drops of hot water. Use a cotton swab to get into the crevices of little pots of eye cream or lip balm.
 You can get more lip gloss into your tube by using hot water. Put hot water in a mug and stand the lip gloss tube vertically in it for about half an hour. The heat will cause the gloss that's stuck on the side, or up on the top of the hole to "melt" down to the bottom. You should also let it cool down so it isn't really liquid when you use it. And if there isn't enough gloss in the tube, that your wand can't get it, pour it out into a little container (old cleaned out contact lens cases are great) to use for later.
 When you have a few half-used, forlorn lip balms lying around, take them out of their containers and place in a microwave safe dish. Get every last bit out of the container by using toothpicks to loosen chunks and cotton buds for smudges. Keep these containers aside.

Melt the lip balms by heating in the microwave with 10 second intervals and stir to combine. If the shade isn't ideal, add a little lipstick, microwave again, and stir.
Pour into one of the lip balm containers, freeze for a few minutes or until set. It's now ready for reuse.

If the texture is more liquid than solid even after freezing, invest in a cheap, clear gloss. Pour some into an old tube of lip gloss to reuse that, and use the brush to mix your lip balm mixture into the gloss.
An alternative method is using melted beeswax, mixing that in, and freezing it.

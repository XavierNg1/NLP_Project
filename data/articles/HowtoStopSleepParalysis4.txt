 If getting more sleep and taking steps to improve the quality of your sleep does not help, then you may need to see your doctor for treatment. Keep in mind that sleep paralysis may be a symptom of a bigger problem, such as narcolepsy., Your doctor may prescribe a tricyclic antidepressant, such as clomipramine, to treat sleep paralysis. Tricyclic antidepressants can change your brain chemistry and prevent sleep paralysis by increasing your rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Ask your doctor about this option as well as the potential risks and side effects of taking tricyclic antidepressants. Side effects may include:


Dry mouth
Constipation
Problems urinating
Sweating
Blurry vision
Drowsiness
Signs of an overdose include sedation, seizures, hypotension, and arrhythmia, which can can be fatal

, Melatonin is a sleep hormone that our bodies make naturally, but some people do not produce enough. Melatonin is available without a prescription, but you should check with your doctor before taking this medicine.Start with very low doses of melatonin, especially if you are elderly. Only 0.1â€“0.3 mg per day should help you sleep. If you cannot find a dose this low, try cutting pills in half or quarters., If you are taking any medications, then check with your doctor to see if they might be responsible for your sleep paralysis. Some medications can cause sleep disturbances, so reducing your dosage or trying another medication option might also get rid of your sleep paralysis.

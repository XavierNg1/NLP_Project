 Silk flowers cannot be dyed using fabric dye, because the fabric cannot be boiled. Although you can attempt using food coloring, it will likely rinse off the fabric because it is not permanent. The most success has come from dying silk flowers with acrylic paint. Therefore, you will need a tube of acrylic paint in a color of your choice, a container of gel medium, and water.
 Depending on the type of silk flower you use, you may need to prepare them a bit. If your flower has a stamen in the center, you’ll need to use painters tape to block it off in order to prevent it from being dyed. Anything else you don’t want colored should be blocked off with painters tape as well.
 To make the dye for your silk flowers, mix 2 parts acrylic paint with 1 part gel medium, Use a stir stick or spoon to fully incorporate this, and then add a small amount of water to thin it down. The amount of water you add to the mixture is dependent on how bright you want the dye to be; the more water you add, the paler the final color. When you’re done, put the dye in a wide-brimmed bowl or container, and place newspapers around it to prevent leaks.
 Place a single flower in the dye, and hold it so that it is completely covered in the color. Carefully lift it out of the dye using the stem or tweezers (if there is no stem), and place it onto the newspapers. Use a paper towel to pat the flower and remove the excess dye. Then, leave the flower to dry on the newspaper for 2-3 hours.
 Work through all your flowers, dying them using the aforementioned methods. After they have dried for about 3 hours, remove any painters tape you might have applied.

 No doubt you will not be the only one wanting to get up close and personal with your favorite musicians. If your aim is to get to the front row in the mosh pit, there is no need to jump the queue, push people out of the way or resort to petty violence (kicking, pinching, pulling of hair and in extreme cases: biting). These acts of desperation just rub everyone the wrong way. You could also be asked to leave the venue completely.
 It is a hassle to everyone if you push and shove your way from the back of the crowd to the front just as the band starts playing. People who have been there for hours on end will not appreciate you pushing past them for a better spot. A good concert spot is earned.

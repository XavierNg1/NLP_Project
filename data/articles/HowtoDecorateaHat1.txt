 Hats are a very personal item, and people like different styles.You can use hats that you already have, or buy inexpensive, plain hats to customize.
Pick your hats based on styles you like, or look into finding hats that complement your features.For example, rounder faces look best in hats that have some height and aren’t too close to the face, like a medium-brimmed fedora.Baseball caps, wide-brimmed straw hats, fedoras, cowboy hats, top hats, and beanies can all be customized in different ways.;
, When you plan to wear your hat will have an effect on how you want to decorate.


For example, if you just want to customize the baseball cap you wear all the time when you run errands, you probably won’t add feathers or glitter.
However, if you want to make a derby or costume hat, you might want to add more over-the-top decorations.
 Having lots of materials to work with can help inspire your final design.


Lay out all your materials in front of you, and think about which colors complement each other.Make piles of decorations you think go together.
For subtler designs you might want things like: embroidery thread and a needle, fabric paint or fabric markers in an array of colors, and scraps of patterned fabric. Craft stores will often have short ends of fabric on sale.
For a grander hat consider: ribbon, feathers, fake flowers,sequins, tulle, and glitter.
Regardless of the extent of your decoration, make sure you have scissors and some type of glue on hand. Especially for bulkier decorations like feathers, hot glue works best and glues easily.

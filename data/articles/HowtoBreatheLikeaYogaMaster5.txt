 Draw in a slow, steady breath through the nose. Make sure it is an adequately deep breath, as the exhalation will require a steady supply of air., As you breathe out, it should be in a rapid, "pumping" pulse of exhalation. It may be helpful for beginners to put one hand on the stomach to feel the active belly-based pumping action.Release short, controlled "snorts" (without emitting any sound) through the nostril. It may be helpful to imagine that you are blowing out a candle with your breath.Practice releasing rapid, silent "snorts" in quick succession. Beginners should aim for approximately 30 exhalations in a 30 second period.Keep your staccato exhalations steady and controlled. Aim for consistency before you try to increase your exhalations., It's best to start slow, but once you've comfortably pumped 30 exhalations in 30 seconds, you can gradually increase the exhalations. Slowly work your way up to 45 to 60 exhalations over a 30 second period. Don't push yourself too hard or too fast. It's best to begin with two to three rounds of whatever number of exhalations is comfortable before attempting to increase the exhalations.

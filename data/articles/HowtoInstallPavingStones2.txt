 You'll need to dig deep enough to reach a stable surface beneath the topsoil, and often deeper to ensure the stones have solid support. Large installation projects may require an excavator, and a square shovel is always useful for creating the vertical walls.


For a driveway or other area with heavy car or machinery traffic, dig 7–9 inches (18–23 centimeters) deep, plus the height of the paving stones you'll be installing.
For a walkway with only foot traffic, you only need to dig 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) deep, plus the height of the stones.
 Use crushed rock or gravel sized at about ¾ of an inch (1.9 cm). This will provide a base for the paving stones, and allow water to drain through. Rent or purchase a plate compactor, and use it to compact the gravel to make a stable, sturdy base. You may need to pour in the gravel in stages, as each compactor has a maximum depth that it can compact at one time.The final layer should be 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) deep for areas with car or machinery traffic, or up to 12 in. (30 cm) in wet soil.
Use a layer 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) deep for walkways.
 Some people install landscape fabric or geotextiles over the gravel at this stage. This helps prevent weed growth, and may help keep the base above it in place.However, other installers prefer to skip this step, as it is not a permanent weed solution and may lead to drainage problems in the long term., Pour in a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of sand to keep the paving stones in place. This sand is sold as "bedding sand" or "paver sand."

, Place a bubble level on top of a flat 2 x 4 or screed board. Scrape it over the surface of the sand, taking care to avoid stepping on the sand layer. The sand should be flat, but along a slight slope, between 1/4" (6mm) per foot (0.3m) and 1/2" (12mm) per foot (0.3 m).

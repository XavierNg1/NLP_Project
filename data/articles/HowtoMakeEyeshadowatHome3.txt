 Activated charcoal capsules are easily available online or in drug stores -- they are typically used to treat upset, gassy stomachs, but can be used to create a smoky black eyeshadow that is completely safe and chemical free.
 Use your fingers to gently break open the capsules and pour the black powder into an empty lip gloss container.









Keep going until the container is half full, or you have as much eyeshadow as you want.
Tightly replace the lid once you're done -- charcoal powder is very messy if spilled!

, Although charcoal powder can't be used to make any brightly colored eyeshadows, you can mix it with shimmering mica powders to create a glittery black shadow, or with some powdered spirulina for a green undertone.
 You can use the activated charcoal powder as an eyeshadow by blending it into the eyelid with a rounded eyeshadow brush, or you can use it as a black eyeliner by mixing it with a little water to create a paste.

 You can base it off your Minecraft username, your real name, or whatever you want! If Steve made a company, he could call it "Steve Industries", for example.;
, For example, Sips Co. makes dirt, while Honeydew Inc. makes Jaffa cakes. If you don't want to have a specific product, that's okay. You can just make a wide range of things.
 This can be a factory, a small building, or anything your imagination can conjure up. For example, you could build a tall tower with a pixel art sign declaring the name of your company, or you could just build a small wooden house.
 Your employees could be villagers, modded NPCs, or even animals.
 You want a bunch of factories, power plants, and other stuff, depending on what your main product is (if you have one).
 If you have a specific product, start manufacturing it. With mods such as Buildcraft, you can automate it. If you don't have or want mods, you can simply build the factory and manually work it.
 Have fun with it!

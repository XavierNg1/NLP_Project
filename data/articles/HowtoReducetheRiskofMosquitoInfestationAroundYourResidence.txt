 Water is the chief attractant for mosquitoes whose larvae develop in stagnant water. Water that has been allowed to stand for as little as four days can be attractive to mosquitoes.;
, Bird baths should be cleaned out regularly. Avoid leaving buckets, wading pools, toys, gardening items, pots, any other form of containers, etc. to sit outside where they can gather water.
 If they are clogged up, they can accumulate water and provide ideal breeding grounds.
 If you have leaking taps or pipes, get these fixed. It is likely that the leak is pooling somewhere, not to mention wasting precious water.
 If there are ground depressions in the yard that can fill with water that doesn't drain around, fill these in. They can be a reclaimed garden or yard playing space. Use clean fill.
 Ensure that drips from air conditioning units are running free and evaporating, rather than pooling somewhere.
 Use the right pool treatment chemicals and procedures to prevent these from becoming breeding areas.


Empty or completely cover kid's pools when not in use. This is a drowning safety issue as much as a mosquito prevention issue too.
 A pond needs to be an active pond; if it goes stagnant, it will provide an ideal place for mosquito larvae. Stock it with fish (use the mosquito fish who will eat any larvae), keep the weeds out (infestations will choke the pond and leave it stagnant) and keep leaf litter, grass clippings, etc. away from it. Vegetation cleaning will also expose the water to direct sunlight and overheating that mosquitoes prefer to avoid., This can also be used for bird baths and other similar standing water areas.

 Long grooming sessions will only exacerbate your dog’s hyper energy. Try to keep them as short as you can, whether it’s ten or fifteen minutes. You can also give your dog breaks during the grooming process to calm them down., During a bath or brushing, a hyper dog might try to bolt away from you and escape. They may think that grooming is a game, or they may be anxious and stressed about the process. Either way, you want to make sure that your dog is unable to escape.


If you are grooming them in your bathroom indoors, make sure you securely close the door.
When you are grooming your dog outdoors, make sure you are in an enclosed area.
You can also put your dog on a leash and tie it to something, like a tree, to prevent them from running. Or, you can enlist the help of another person to hold your dog while you’re grooming them.
 You may need to restrain your dog while you are grooming them. You can enlist the help of another person to hold the dog in place while you’re grooming them, or you can hold them with one hand while you work with the other. You can loop one arm around your dog’s midsection to hold them still.. Do not respond if they begin to struggle while they’re being restrained. Keep your voice even and calm and do not let them wriggle out of your hold.


Keep your voice steady and calm. Don’t use a sympathetic or baby voice during the process, since this can teach the dog that grooming is something to be feared., Hyper dogs can become even more energetic if they become overstimulated. Try to keep the grooming environment as calm and quiet as you can. For example, don't have music blaring from a stereo when you're outside and avoid grooming outdoors when the neighbors are cutting their grass or throwing a party. Indoors, try to make sure members of the household are staying relatively quiet.

 Before you can install an old version, you must first uninstall the current app.


Open the Settings of your device and select “Applications,” or “Application Manager” in some devices.” Scroll down the list of apps until you find the app you need to uninstall; tap it, and then tap “Uninstall.”

, Since you will be looking for an older version of the app, most likely it won’t be in Google Play. You will need to look for it on the Internet.
 In the search bar at the top, search for an older version of the app. For example, “Photogrid version 1.0.3 apk download.” A list of websites where you can download the apk file will appear.
 Select a website and tap “Download” to begin downloading the apk file. Wait for it to finish downloading.
 Slide down the Notification panel of your device, and tap on the downloaded apk file. On the new screen, tap “Install.” The app will begin installing; just wait for it to finish.
 Once it has installed, you will be notified, and there will be an “Open” button on the screen. Tap this to run the app and test it out. It should work just fine.

 Brush your hair well and secure it with a rubber band at the nape of your neck. Leave this pony tail loose and have some slack between your scalp and the rubber band.
 Run both hands down the back of your head to find the center of your hair where it meets the rubber band. Separate the hair here with your fingers, creating a hole large enough to fit your pony tail. Fold your ponytail underneath the rubber band and through the hole. Grab the ponytail with the thumb and forefinger of you other hand to pull the entire ponytail up through the hole. Fold it back over the rubber band, which should now be folded under a roll of hair.


Repeat this two or three times, making a hole and pulling the ponytail through until you have rolls running down both sides of your head.
 After you have created several inches of rolls on the sides of your head, fold your remaining hair under and tuck the ends into the center near your rubber band. Pin the ends securely to the scalp, creating a loosely folded bun in the back.

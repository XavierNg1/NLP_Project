 Preferably anything above toadflax can make you a decent profit. Be sure to treat the plots with supercompost. If you don't, there is a very high chance they will die and you will waste your seeds. The three places that you can plant herbs are

Catherby
North of Ardougne
Trollheim
South of Falador.
 If you wield the magic secateurs you get from completing the quest "Fairy Tale part 1", you have the potential to get more crops, combine this with the greenfingers aura and you will get double the herbs! Be sure to clean the herbs for maximum profit.

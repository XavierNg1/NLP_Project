 Make sure the location you’re considering has the necessary attributes. Clear an area about a foot in diameter of weeds and other organic material in the location you plan to plant the pomegranate. Dig up a couple inches of soil for your premature plant using a trowel., If you don’t feel like growing your own from a seed, or if you want to grow a tree for fruit, consider purchasing a young plant from a nursery.


You can find pomegranate plants for sale at nurseries. The best time to purchase cuttings are in February or March.
Buy a cutting that is a little more than a foot (30.48 centimeters) long., Plant your plant in spring just after the last frost. Submerge the roots and cover with a blend of soil and compost. Water the plant after planting. A good rule with using compost for edible plants is two parts soil and one part compost.


If you use your own compost, make sure that it is well rotted and resembles dirt. You can also purchase compost at a gardening center.
If you started from a seed, you'll need to let the plant become strong enough before planting outdoors. The best is to start your seeds in February. Watch and care for the seed while it germinates properly. Plants started from seeds should be ready to plant outside after a year or two.

 In a small saucepan, combine the first three ingredients of the recipe.If you decide to use fresh ginger in the recipe instead of ground ginger, you can peel it with a paring knife or a vegetable peeler.;
, Once the mixture comes to a boil, simmer it for five minutes.
 Use a fine strainer or cheesecloth to strain the mixture to remove the ginger slices and lemon zest. Since the mixture will still be warm, it’s best to transfer it into a heat-proof container or a measuring cup.


A glass container with a secure lid or a large canning jar works well.
Cheesecloth can usually be found in grocery and hardware stores.
After this step you can discard the remaining zest and sliced ginger in the strainer because you’ve infused the water with these ingredients.
 After rinsing the saucepan out, add the honey to the saucepan and warm it over low heat. You don’t want to boil the honey.
 When the honey is warm, you can pour in the strained lemon ginger water as well as the lemon juice.
 Once it is thoroughly mixed, pour the syrup into a clean jar or bottle with a secure lid.
 Follow the dosage guidelines listed below:Adults and children 12 years of age and older should take 1 to 2 tablespoons of the syrup every four hours.
Children ages five to 12 can be given 1 to 2 teaspoons of the syrup every two hours.
Children ages one to five can use ½ teaspoon to 1 teaspoon every two hours.
Children under the age of one should not be given honey, because of the risk of infant botulism poisoning., This syrup keeps well in the fridge, and you will probably run out before two months has passed.

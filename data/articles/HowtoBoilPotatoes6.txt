 Cubing will enable you to have more control over the cooking time by observing changes and removing them immediately if you see any signs of crumbling.
 Add the potato cubes.
 Reduce to a simmer and boil for 15-20 minutes, or until they're softer but not crumbling. Test for doneness with a sharp knife or fork.
 Drain with care into a colander and use as required.

 In a large bowl, beat these ingredients together until smooth and even. This should take just a few minutes with an electric mixer set to medium.



Note: If you're making your own pie crust, you'll want to set the oven to 350 degrees F (177 C) now to give it time to preheat. If you bought a prepared crust, you won't need the oven.
 Gradually mix in all three cups of the whipped topping. Fold it into the mixture with a spatula, then stir briefly to combine.
 Carefully spoon the filling mixture you've just made into your pie crust. When you've transferred all of the filling, use a spatula to get it flat and level with the upper edge of the crust.


At this point, you can also add whatever toppings you wish over the filling. See the "Suggested Toppings" section below for a few good ideas.
 Place the filled pie in a safe spot in the refrigerator. Keep the pie in the fridge until it is well-set. Depending on the temperature of your fridge, this can take from 1-3 hours. When in doubt, you can always let the pie chill overnight to be sure.When the filling is firm, the pie is ready to eat! Serve the dessert on its own or with the toppings suggested below.
If you bought a pie crust that came with a plastic cover, you can use this to protect the pie. If it didn't, you don't need to cover it, but a tented piece of foil will also work.

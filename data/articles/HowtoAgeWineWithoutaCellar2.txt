 The most effective way to age wine without a cellar is by buying an electric aging unit. These appliances function very much like refrigerators, and offer precise control of temperature and humidity conditions.


A chief downside to these units is their hefty price tag. Before purchasing them, consider whether you wouldn't rather spend that money on better quality wines for immediate consumption.
To determine how large a unit you'll need, do a little math. If you hope to drink 1 bottle of aged wine per week, and would like to age each wine for 5 years, then you'll need (5 * 52) or 260 bottles of storage space.
 The wine cellar will do a good job of controlling temperature and humidity by itself, but you will need to locate it properly to keep the light and disturbance to a minimum. Place the wine cellar in a dark location where it will be safe from possible disturbances, for example by curious children.
 Many freestanding units have individual racks that slide out gently, allowing you to identify your wines without disturbing them much. However, you may still want to begin keeping a wine aging log so that you know how long each bottle has been aged.

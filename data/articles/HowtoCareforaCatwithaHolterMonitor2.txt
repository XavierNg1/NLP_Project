 If your cat is sick, your vet might recommend the use of cage confinement combined with a stationary (non-ambulatory) electrocardiography device placed near the cage instead of equipping your cat with a Holter monitor. This will prevent your sick cat from experiencing an additional rise in stress levels. This might be especially appropriate for cats demonstrating signs of cardiac decompensation., Most electronic devices will not disrupt the Holter monitor. However, certain appliances or devices could cause the device to malfunction. Your vet will give you more specific instructions regarding your specific Holter monitor, but a partial list of devices that could potentially disrupt it includes:electric toothbrushes and razors
electric blankets
microwaves
magnets
MP3 players
cellphones

, Typically, this wonâ€™t be a problem, as most cats do not like swimming, and do not need baths.However, be sure to keep your cat from getting wet, since the water can damage the sensitive electronics within the Holter monitor.

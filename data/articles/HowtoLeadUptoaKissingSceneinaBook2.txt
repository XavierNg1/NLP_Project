 It may be somewhere especially romantic, or an ordinary setting. Take time to describe a few details about the setting, to make it memorable.


It's pouring out, and Roseann didn't bring her umbrella. David shares his with her. He tells a joke and they laugh.
Javier and Roberto attended the same wedding. Roberto asks Javier to dance. Javier is mesmerized by the lights, the music, the twirling couples, and Roberto's smile.
Lindsay ran off to a hill after their fight. Jake came to apologize for hurting her feelings. She cries, he cries a little too, and she apologizes also. They agree to communicate better.
 Either by accident or on purpose, they end up gazing into each other's eyes. The moment slows down, and you may choose to describe the little details here. One may caress the other, or lovingly notice a feature (looks, smell, touch, etc.). Both characters realize that they want to kiss.


Roseann trips over a curb, and David catches her. Suddenly her face is very close to his. And she isn't about to complain.
The slow dance ends and Javier and Roberto gaze into each other's eyes. Warmth floods through Javier's chest as he sees the tenderness in Roberto's face.
Lindsay places her hands on Jake's shoulders, pushes back his hair, and tells him she loves him.
 One or both characters lean in and their lips meet.


How much detail you use depends on the characters and your audience. A book for preteens probably won't go beyond a "soft, brushing kiss." An adult novel may describe exactly what they are doing with their tongues.
 How do they pull awayâ€”does the kiss naturally end or are they interrupted? How does each character feel about the kiss? Do they smile, blush, decide to kiss again?


If they are new to kissing, they may be embarrassed or even shyly run away afterwards.
If the nature of their relationship is unclear, they may need to talk about it.

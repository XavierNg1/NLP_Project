 What you fill here determines what initially shows up on your website. Don't worry if you make a mistake. You can always change it later.
 Perhaps the most important part of a website is its domain name. Pick an easy-to-remember domain name which is related to your website. Devhub allows you to register a new domain for a small monthly fee or you can use a domain name you had registered earlier with another provider. The last option allows you to register a free sub-domain, which means instead of having xyz.com as you domain name you will have xyz.devhub.com as your domain name.


Although a sub-domain is not a good choice for a business website, it is a quick and free way to get up and running and test Devhub's service.
 In this step devhub asks you to fill up your personal information along with a CAPTCHA(the password field). This ensures that you are a human and not a spam bot. You are also asked to read the terms of service. Read it and check the box if you agree.

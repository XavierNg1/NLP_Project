 If a seller refuses to talk on phone––makes excuses, etc .––walk away. Text doesn't count; you must talk to them. If the seller shows any signs of hostility or anger in any of your interactions, cancel the meeting and discontinue contact immediately.
 Even if you know the answers, make sure the seller's story makes sense.


Is the item stolen? Ask them how long they've owned it. Later in the conversation ask the question of how they obtained it again. You can usually smell a rat. This is especially important if the price seems too good.
 Anywhere with security cameras helps. Pick somewhere you are familiar with if possible.


Do not meet in apartment parking lots, houses, lane ways, out of town, anywhere sketchy.
 Thieves like setups - i.e. someone gets tipped off in the parking lot by the fraudulent seller that you are there and carrying a lot of cash.
 You don't want to flash much cash in public or walk around with showy expensive goods for too long.
 If something strange happens, at least someone has a clue what neighborhood you were going to or who you were meeting with.
 Go with your gut; if a situation feels weird, don't be afraid to bail. It is better safe than robbed, injured or worse - no deal is worth this!

 If the child does not meet the legal definition of an orphan, he or she will not be able to obtain an immigrant visa. To qualify as an orphan, a child must have lost both parents, usually through death or abandonment. The child of a single parent is rarely labeled as an orphan, but an exception is sometimes made in cases where the parent cannot care for the child and willingly signs him or her over to the state., This USCIS form officially determines whether the child legally qualifies as an orphan and, therefore, whether the child is qualified for adoption and an immigrant visa. This form must be completed after you have a specific child in mind, however; it cannot be done at the start of the process, as Form I-600A can be.
 Since your child is still a citizen of Russia at the time of adoption, he or she must have a Russian passport to travel to the U.S. The adoptive parents must submit an application for their child along with two identical photos of the child, a prepaid return envelop, and a $100 money order made payable to the Embassy of Russia to the Russian Consulate.
 All Russian children adopted by foreigners must be registered with the Consulate. You must send in a written application, your child's Russian passport, a passport-sized photo of your child, notarized copies of the parents' American passports, the Russian version of the adoption certificate, and the Russian version of the child's birth certificate. The $59 consular fee should be sent in simultaneously in the form of a money order made payable to the Russian Embassy.
 Russian adoption law requires that these additional visits take place 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the child enters your home. The visits are performed by licensed U.S. adoption agencies and evaluate the child's level of health, care, and overall welfare.

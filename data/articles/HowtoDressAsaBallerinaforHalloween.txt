 This list includes but is not limited to: A black or pink leotard, a pink tutu, pink tights, and pink ballet slippers.;
, Ballerinas must wear make-up on stage so the lights don't wash out their features. Wise cosmetic purchases may include: Pink blush, pink lip gloss, dark brown or black mascara, and brown tones of eyeshadow.
 First put on the tights, then put on the leotard and tutu. Last, slip on the ballet slippers.
 The most common hairstyle in ballet is a bun. Tools such as a "Hot Buns Bun Maker" and bobby pins will help greatly. When you have your bun made and pinned tightly, use hairspray to make it completely secure.
 Make sure the blush goes on the apples of your cheeks, and the eyeshadow should be abundant but not gaudy-looking.

 Sometimes it’s the little things that strengthen your bond with your partner the most. Find some simple everyday rituals that you can fit into your lives. Having a cup of tea together in the mornings, playing a card game in the evenings, or texting each other throughout the day are a few ways you can stay connected even when you’re both busy., Remembering and honoring milestones is a thoughtful way to keep your connection with your partner strong. Use a planner or calendar to keep track of significant dates.There’s no need to plan elaborate birthday or anniversary parties if you’re both busy. Just make it a priority to spend some time together, enjoy a good meal or some wine, and reflect on what you appreciate about each other.
 Look for ways to make your partner smile at the end of a long day. Maybe you could surprise them with a box of their favorite candy on the nightstand, give them a massage, or make them dinner after a long day of work. Little gestures of kindness can have a big impact on how close you and your partner feel., If your partner doesn’t have a lot of free time to spend with you, make sure the time you do spend together is quality. When you have a weekend or an evening free together, take the opportunity to build new memories by trying new things together. Visit a restaurant or coffee shop you’ve never been to, see a play, or just take a long walk and enjoy each other’s conversation.

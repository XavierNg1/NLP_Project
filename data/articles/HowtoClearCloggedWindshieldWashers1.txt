 Before attempting to unclog the washer fluid jets, turn them on and listen for the low hum of the washer fluid pump. If the jets are clogged, you will hear the pump despite no fluid spraying.If you are unsure if the pump is on, ask a friend to listen from outside the vehicle near the hood.
If you do not hear the pump, the pump needs to be replaced.;
, Locate the jets on the top of your hood near the windshield and look for signs that something has blocked them. Often, automotive wax or polish can gunk up the outlet for the jets, preventing fluid from spraying properly.Wipe away any wax or polish that has clogged the end of the jet.
 If wiping away blockages does not clear the jets sufficiently to allow washer fluid to spray out, try using a pin or needle to clear the holes. Press a pin into the each hole on the jet, then remove it and wipe away any clogs that come out with it.Only press the pin in as far as you can safely remove it.
Do not press the needle too hard into the back of the jet, as you may break the needle or the jet.
 If a pin doesn't penetrate deep enough to clear the clog in the jet, disconnect the hose at the bottom of the jet from beneath the hood. Then run a thin wire through the bottom of the jet, up through the top nozzle. If the nozzle has multiple openings, you may want to run the wire through multiple times until you clear both holes.Guitar strings will work well for this because they offer the rigidity needed to pass up through the jet.
You can also use a stripped electrical wire.

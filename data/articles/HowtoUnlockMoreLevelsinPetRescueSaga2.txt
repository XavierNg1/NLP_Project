 Mystery Quests aren’t available directly from the game app on Facebook. You will need a mobile device running the game as a stand-alone app.


You can use either an iOS or Android device.
 Mystery Quests are random repeats of levels you’ve already played. The only difference is that these will require higher points. You can only play one Mystery Quest a day, which means you will need three days to play and win all three to get the needed tickets.


You may need to play Mystery Quests often since there’s not a lot of people playing Pet Rescue Saga, unlike Candy Crush Saga.
 If the Pet Rescue Saga app on your mobile device is constantly connected to Facebook, log out first. Mystery Quests won’t appear while you’re connected to Facebook.


From the Map screen, tap the paw icon at the lower left corner. This brings out a small menu. Tap the door icon to go back to the main menu then tap the paw icon at the lower left corner again to bring out another menu.
Tap the gear icon to go to Settings. Scroll down this window until you see “Log out of Facebook”. Tap the “Log out!” button below it to log out of Facebook.
 Go back to the main game map where you’ve left off. Go to the locked gate, with the wiggling warning sign over it.
 Tap on the gate or the warning sign icon to bring out the “Unlock more levels!” window again. The “Mystery Quest” option should now be there. Tap on this to view your Mystery Quests.
 The Mystery Quest level number will be displayed, together with the target. Tap the “Continue” button, then the “Play” button on the next screen, to start playing the level.
 You can only play one Mystery Quest a day, so make it count.


At this rate, you will need at least three days to get the three tickets to move to the next level. Come back every day to play these Mystery Quests until you’ve unlocked the next levels.
 Once you’ve won all the three Mystery Quests, the next levels will be unlocked and you will be brought to the next one. Keep on playing.

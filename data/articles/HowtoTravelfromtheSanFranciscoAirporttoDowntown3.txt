 If you just arrived, you may need to take an escalator or elevator down a level from the Arrivals level.
, Cross the first lane of traffic at the cross-walk. Find the shuttle dispatcher. If you have booked a shuttle in advance, tell him this information and he will point you to the right section for that company. If you have not, he will point you toward the next available shuttle van.
 He will add you to his route. Let the driver load your luggage in the back and board the van. Many shuttle companies will wait until they have a full van of about 8 riders.
 You may have a longer ride than a taxi because the driver is dropping many people off at their destinations.
 Shuttles cost between $13 and $25 (9 to 17 euros, 8 to 16 pounds) and there are usually some discounts for having more than 1 person in your party. If the driver has been helpful, it is customary to tip 10 percent on the fare.

 Open a new web browser on your computer and go to the Google Voice website. If you’re not logged in yet, enter your Gmail email address and password into the fields provided, and click “Sign in” to continue.
 Like Gmail, you can find voicemail notifications in your Google Voice Inbox. To filter your Inbox, click the “Voicemail” option on the left panel; this will show only voicemail notifications in the Inbox.
 You can listen to your voicemail in any order you want; just click the play button below the profile picture of the caller and it will start playing.

 This will depend upon how you will submit your critique.


If you are writing an author assessment for school or work, find out if there is a form you should use. Some companies have a form that has questions that need to be answered for all considered work.
Use Microsoft word or Adobe Acrobat to attach comments in a digital format. Click on the "Tools" menu and scroll to "Track Changes." Highlight the areas you are referring to and write comments about your suggested changes.
Write a separate document on a word processor or by hand that addresses the work from your initial reactions, to positive encouragement and then to suggested changes.
 Include the following items in your author assessment.


Include your initial reactions and what you learned in the introductory paragraph. Offer your opinions about what the scope of the work is. This paragraph should explain the work to someone who has not read it.
Add a paragraph about what the author has done well. Include examples or references to pages, if possible.
Address grammatical errors on the copy of the work itself. These are given for editing purposes and do not need to be explained in prose.
Outline your constructive criticism about the work. Include comments about the plot, structure, scope and specific sentences or points. Include concrete examples, but do not rewrite sentences themselves, unless you are an editor.
Include a section about why you think this work would be marketable and who would enjoy it. If you are doing a book review or a manuscript assessment, this is essential to advise future readers.
 Remove any sections that try to change the voice or writing style of the author. Add any further helpful comments and proof for spelling and grammar errors.

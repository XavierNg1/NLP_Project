 The easiest way to activate Windows is by connecting to Microsoft directly through the internet. Microsoft will verify that your product key is legitimate, and send the activation code back to your computer.

If you don't have access to the internet, click here to activate by phone.;
, You can start this by clicking the Activation icon in your System Tray. You can also click Start → All Programs → Accessories → System Tools → Activate Windows.
 You may be prompted to enter your 25-character product key before you can proceed.


If you don't have a product key, click here.
 Windows will try first to connect via your network (Ethernet or Wi-Fi) connection. If no network adapter is detected it will look for a dial-up modem.
 Registration is optional, and now that Windows XP is no longer supported, there's no real point to it. To skip registration, select "No, I don't want to register now; let's just activate Windows".
 As long as you have an internet connection the wizard will automatically connect and activate your copy of Windows.
 If you have used your Windows XP product key on a different computer or installed new hardware, you may be prompted to contact Microsoft by phone. This is a step required by Microsoft to prevent piracy. As long as you are not violating your license, you should have no problem getting the support rep to activate your account.You will be asked by the support rep to provide the "installation ID", which can be found on the activation wizard screen.
After providing the installation ID, Microsoft will verify and will provide you with the code you need to enter to activate Windows.

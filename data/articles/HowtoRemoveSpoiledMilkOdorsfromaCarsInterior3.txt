 The longer milk, or any type of spill sits, the harder it is to remove the stain and smell. The sooner you soak up the spill, the better your chances are at preventing a smell from forming.
 After milk is spilled, it is always a good idea to open the car windows for a few hours. This will allow any milk moisture that has evaporated into your car's air to leave and be replaced with fresh air., Food and liquid can provide favorable conditions for bacteria to begin growing and smelling. Regularly vacuuming and shaking off car floor mats can be a great way to prevent bad odors.

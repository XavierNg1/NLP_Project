 You can insert a horizontal bar at any part of your document. This line is one of the easiest to use, since you can easily move it around your document after inserting it.;
, If you're using Office 2007 or later, click the Home tab to find the right button. If you're using Office 2003 or earlier, click the Insert menu.
 The "Borders" button can be found in the Paragraph group, and looks like four boxes with dotted lines. Clicking the down arrow will display all of the border options.
 This will insert a bar-like horizontal line where your cursor is.
 This will open a new window, allowing you to adjust the line options. You can change the color, width, height, and alignment to suit your needs.
 You can move the line to anywhere in your document. It can't exist on the same line as text, so it will be placed on its own line directly beneath any text.
 Clicking and dragging the boxes along the line's border will allow you to resize it. You can turn the line into a thick bar, or shrink it so that it doesn't take up as much space.

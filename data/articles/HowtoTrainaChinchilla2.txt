 Most chinchillas choose a designated spot in their cage to urinate in and return to that spot consistently. It may be obvious right away, or it may take some observation before you deduce where your pet urinates.Look for wet spots on the wood chips or bedding inside your chinchilla's cage.
If you don't feel a wet spot you may be able to deduce where there was urine by noting changes in color or texture on the bedding.
 If your chinchilla has established that spot as a designated urination spot, it will continue to use that location no matter what is covering the spot. Moving the box to that location teaches your pet that it should urinate in the litter on that location, and once it gets used to the litter box you can move it anywhere in the cage., Many chinchillas that urinate in a litter box have trouble learning to defecate there, but some chinchillas can and will learn to use the litter box to pass all of their wastes. Though there's no guarantee that your chinchilla will learn to defecate in the litter box, this is the only way to attempt that type of training.Never scold or punish your chinchilla while you litter box train it.
If your pet does not learn to defecate in the litter box, that's okay. Remember that all chinchillas are different and yours may simply have trouble with this task.

 If you decide to reconcile with the person who hurt you, you will need to meet with him face-to-face at some point.


Reach out to the other person and decide on a convenient time to meet.
Share your feelings and how the other person hurt you. Use "I" statements, which are phrases that minimize blame and allow you to take ownership for your feelings. For example, you might say, "I feel betrayed after you lied to me, but I am choosing to forgive you."
Include suggested amends, if you like. Add this to the above statement: "I would appreciate it if we both are open and honest with one another moving forward".
Allow the other person a chance to talk and perhaps apologize.
Research shows that when amends and forgiveness follow a betrayal, and the perpetrator and the victim constructively problem-solve together, they both have a higher chance of seeing improvements in relationship quality., If the betrayal was so upsetting that you cannot imagine ever facing this person again, or if the person died or is no longer around for you to meet face-to-face, writing a letter can be a great way to express forgiveness and get closure.


Write down your deepest and truest thoughts and feelings regarding the betrayal. Avoid demonizing the other person; instead strive for empathy and think about their flawed actions in terms of being human. Explore what forgiving this person means to both of you in the letter., Spend some time reflecting on what you have learned from this experience and how you can apply that knowledge to similar life situations.

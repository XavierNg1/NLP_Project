 Once you've played the basic game for a while, you might want to try something a little more challenging. In "Salvo," take your turn by firing five shots at once. The opponent responds as normal, telling you which shots were hits and which were misses, but only after you've selected five squares to aim for.This version of the game was played at least as early as 1931.
 Increase the tension, and reward the player who sinks the first ship, by adding this additional rule to the "salvo" rues above. Instead of firing five shots at a time, each player only gets to fire one shot for each surviving ship. For example, if player one loses the cruiser and is down to four ships, player one only gets four shots per turn.
 Play with the original salvo rules above, but don't tell the opponent exactly which shots were hits or misses. Instead, tell them how many of the shots hit, and how many missed.This results in a complicated game, and is only recommended for advanced players.


Because you don't know for sure which squares were hits, the ordinary red peg / white peg system probably won't work well for this variation. You may need a pencil and pad of paper for each player, to write down each salvo and the opponent's response.

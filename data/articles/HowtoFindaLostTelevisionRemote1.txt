 There's a good chance that you lost the remote in the room where you watch television. Many people tend to leave their remote near the television set, or near where they sit when they're watching T.V. It is very common to lose a remote in the couch., Check underneath books, magazines, blankets, and coats â€“ anything that might be resting on top of the remote. Check between the cushions of couches and chairs. Look underneath and behind furniture.


Check beside the kettle, the shelf in the hall, the bathroom cabinet, and anywhere else you might have brought it with you.
 Perhaps you carried the remote out of the room, set it down while your mind was on something else, and accidentally left the remote in a strange place. Consider whether you might have left the remote somewhere en route to the bathroom, your bedroom, the kitchen, or the front door.


Check the fridge. If you had something to eat or drink during the past few hours, you might have left the remote in the fridge while grabbing your food.
Maybe you took a phone call recently, while you were watching television, and you set the remote down while you were on the phone. Perhaps you answered the door during your favorite show, carried the remote out of the room, and set it down in your entryway.
 This is useful if you watch TV in bed. The remote will often get buried under the sheets or covers and the best way to find it is to just run your hands along the bedspread until you feel something boxlike in shape. If this does not work, look under the bed, and then check the area at the foot of the bed.

 This is one of the oldest methods of preserving meat.


Use curing salt which can be purchased online through retailers such as butcher-packer.com, mortonsalt.com, and sausagemaker.com.Place pieces of meat in air-tight storage jars (or plastic storage bags), making sure to fully cover the meat with salt. Alternate layers of meat and salt to ensure all parts of the meat are covered in salt.Keep the jars/bags in a cool place (36-40 degrees Fahrenheit) for a month. Do not allow to freeze.Determine how long to salt cure meat using this formula: 7 days per inch of thickness. For example, a 12-14 pound ham which is 5 inches thick will need to cure for 35 days.Salt cured meat can last 3-4 months without refrigeration if kept in air-tight packaging such as plastic bags.
You will want to rinse the excess salt off the meat before cooking.

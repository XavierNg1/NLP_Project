 It's also a good time to clean things up.


Look for cracks and burns which can be a common sign of electrical problems. Replace any components that are too damaged to be used.
Clean the reflectors and lenses.




Use compressed gas, alcohol, soft rags or big Q-tips to clean heavy dirt accumulated on the auto tail lights.






Use the utmost care to prevent scratches on the reflectors or accidentally removing the plastic's coating.






Soapy water mixed with raw rice can be used to clean the Taillight cluster.

Replace crumbling gaskets:




Place a thin layer of silicon sealer in the seating groove.
Mix in a little oil while the silicon is still soft.
Allow this concoction to dry and get hard.




Check the electrical connections that join the bulbs. For a better connection, the spring connections on the bulb base can be moved towards the bulb base to generate more pre-load against the bulb.

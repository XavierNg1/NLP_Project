 Then, gently take the bow out of its container and tighten the horse hairs (which are white) until they are taut. Look at the wood of the bow: it should not be bent downward or upward.


If too tight, move the peg of the bow left until the wood is straight. If too loose, move the peg right so that the wood does not sag.
 Once you have the correct rosin, uncap or slide it out of its container. Use a closed pen to scratch your rosin until it is rough and gritty. Try to rub gently so you don't damage your rosin. Once the resin is exposed, you're ready to apply the rosin to your bow.


Wash your hands before so you don't get your rosin dirty. Be sure you also wash your hands after because your hands will be sticky and messy with rosin dust.
 The frog, which is the dark part of the bow near the peg, should be next to the rosin. The horse hair should be on top of the rosin.
 The application is simple: from frog to tip and back, "play" the rosin back and forth until you feel the bow gripping and no longer slipping. The heat created by the friction of the back and forth motion will cause the surface of the rosin to soften enough to allow the transfer of rosin to hair to take place.


Gently, and with little pressure, brush the hair of the bow against the rosin. One stroke down should end with the tip of the bow (the other end) next to the rosin. Then, go backwards so that the frog is next to the rosin again. Repeat up and down strokes five times.
Be careful. Don't "play" the rosin very quickly, or you'll risk breaking the bow. The new bow is not yet used to the high tension

, Keep "playing" the rosin until the entire bow is coated in rosin. Rub the rosin back and forth over a 2 inch (5.1 cm) area, several times quickly. When you've thoroughly coated this part of the bow, move to the next 2 inch (5.1 cm) section.

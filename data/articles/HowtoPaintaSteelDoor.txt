Use a screwdriver or drill to remove the knob and strike plate.
Remove any other accessories on the door, such as a kick plate or door knocker.
 Use a drill to loosen and pull the screws from the frame.
 Use rubbing alcohol and a rag to clean the entire door. Pay close attention to areas with extra dirt, grease or grime.
 Use painter's tape to mask off windows, trim or anything else you don't wish to paint.
 Use auto body filler to even out dents or cracks. Sand the affected areas until their surfaces are even with the surfaces of the door. Start sanding with 100-grit sandpaper, and transition to using 150-grit sandpaper to finish smoothing.
 Sanding the door prepares the surface so the paint will adhere to the steel door.
 Roll or brush on 1 coat of a universal quick-drying oil-based primer. Allow the primer to dry at least 24 hours.
 Allow the first coat to dry before applying the second coat.


Use a brush to apply the paint. Using a brush to paint the steel door reaches any grooves or inside parts of door panels. Avoid brush strokes as you apply the paint.
Roll the paint onto the door. Be careful to fix any drips or uneven roller strokes before the paint dries. Use different sized rollers to reach crevices in panels on doors.
Utilize a paint sprayer to paint the steel door. A sprayer requires more experience to achieve a smooth finish. If you have experience with a paint sprayer, this process may provide the smoothest finish.



Install the hardware back onto the door using a drill.
Remove the tape you used to mask off areas you didn't want painted.
Put the door back up on its hinges, using the same method you applied when taking it down.

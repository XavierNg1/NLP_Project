 Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lightly coating it in a thin layer of olive oil.

You could also use a shallow baking dish instead of a baking sheet, but avoid roasting pans with tall sides.
Lining the pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper is not recommended. You can, however, coat the pan with nonstick cooking spray if you are running low on cooking oil.
 Keep the pieces in a single layer.

By arranging the broccolini in one layer, you ensure that the individual pieces cook as evenly as possible.
 Drizzle 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of olive oil over the broccolini and toss lightly with a spatula or tongs to coat evenly.

It is a good idea to toss the broccolini in oil before tossing it in any other seasonings. The oil provides and even coating for the other seasonings to stick to, making it easier for those seasonings to stick for the duration of the cooking process.
 If desired, sprinkle the lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste over the broccolini on the baking sheet. Toss well once more to coat again., Roast the broccolini in the preheated oven, uncovered, for about 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the broccolini occasionally as it cooks to ensure that all sides and stems get evenly cooked.
 Transfer the finished broccolini to individual serving plates and enjoy.

 In doing so, gravity will help to reduce the inflammation of the ankle as the blood slowly drains from the inflamed area. The minimum elevation needed is 30 degrees over a period of one hour, so that all the blood will circulate back towards the heart.;
, The patient should try to keep their feet off the ground for as long as possible, until the pain and swelling subsides.
 Gout causes inflammation and redness around the affected joint. Inflammation then leads to swelling which makes the pain worse.


Aspirin and Ibuprofen are highly recommended anti-inflammatories that can offer relief by reducing the inflammation and blocking the pain.
500 mg of ibuprofen or paracetamol can be taken 3 to 4 times a day, but only after checking with your physician for any possible adverse reactions to these reactions in FSGS patients.
 The aching joint should be immobilized for greater relief. A crepe bandage may be useful for this. It should be tied starting from the toes, then wrapped upwards gradually towards the ankle joint.


This will give the joint support, reduce swelling and pain and keep it immobilized, allowing for faster recovery.
 In patients with FSGS, doctors suggest prednisone (steroid) to be given for a period of 6 months. This will reduce the load of the kidneys as well as reduce the pain caused by gout. The exact dosage will be decided by the physician as steroids need to be monitored closely.


Colchicine (Colcrys) is suggested by many doctors in order to reduce the initial attack of gout. Colchicine causes inhibition of mitosis (inhibition of microtubule) and neutrophil activity leading to an anti-inflammatory effect.
This medication may be continued for life as it helps in controlling uric acid levels in the body.

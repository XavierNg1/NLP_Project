 No one likes getting blindsided with new requests, and your parents are no different. By giving them a heads-up about your request, you have a better chance of getting their approval for your dreads.


Say something like, "Mom, I'd like to try a new hairstyle called dreadlocks, and I would like your permission." Never forget to say please!
Be prepared for their initial reaction. Remain calm if they immediately react poorly to your suggestion. Say, “I understand your concerns, but I would like to calmly discuss this with you.”
Be respectful and ask that you get together soon to talk about your request.;
, Once your parents are prepared for the dreadlocks talk, finding a good setting and proper time can really work to your advantage.


Pick a time that is low-stress for everyone involved. Don’t try to have the discussion on a Monday morning when everyone is struggling to get to school and work on time.
If your parents are usually in a good mood during the weekend, or after a special meal, that would be a good time to plan to talk.
A neutral location, like a park or quiet restaurant, could be a good choice for having the discussion. If everyone is calmed by the setting, your parents may be more open to your request.
 In the time leading up to your discussion, demonstrate to your parents that you are the same dependable, bright kid you’ve always been. This will help reassure them that your choice of hairstyle does not impact your behavior or otherwise define you.


Maintain your grades, or even study a little more if possible.
Complete all of your household jobs in a timely manner, without complaining.
Take on additional responsibility within your family.

 Starting from the original color picture, open the Adjustments window and click on the Hue/Saturation button to create a new adjustment layer.
 Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left, and your picture will now be in black and white.









While this lacks the fine tuning of the Black & White adjustment layer, it does offer an opportunity to see what your photo would look like if you left just a little bit of color in, which is sometimes quite nice.

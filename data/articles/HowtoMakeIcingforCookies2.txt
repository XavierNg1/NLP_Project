 Royal icing is one of the most popular sugar cookie icings. This simple recipe only calls for three ingredients and takes 7 minutes to make. The recipe yields 3 ½ cups (455 grams) of icing.


Only use fresh, refrigerated egg whites with fully intact shells to prevent the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness.
 Combine the pasteurized egg whites and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat the ingredients together with a mixer on low to medium speed. Continue to beat until the mixture appears frothy and light.
 Measure out the sugar and add it to the bowl gradually, 1 cup at a time. Use the mixer’s lowest setting. Continue to mix until the sugar is fully combined. The mixture should look shiny. Set your mixer to its highest setting and continue to beat for about 5 to 7 minutes. The mixture will become stiff and glossy.
 If you want icing in colors other than white, divide small amounts of it into separate bowls, then add the food coloring of your choice to each. Add a few drops and stir well. If you want the color darker, add a few more drops.
 Make sure you put icing on cookies that have completed cooled first. Transfer the icing to a pastry bag and pipe it on as desired. A heavy duty storage bag will also work great for piping, simply clip the corner and proceed.


Place any leftovers in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator. Use within 3 days.

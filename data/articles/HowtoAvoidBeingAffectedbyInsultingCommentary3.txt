 Maybe the critique has a worthy point you can learn from.If the critique is straightforward, maybe it's something that can help you grow. For example, maybe a person who is called smelly can learn to wear deodorant before exercising.
 Look who is doing the insulting and what their motive is. Are they just giving a silly opinion? Or is the person a loving relative who just wants to help? Think about what the person is saying. Your mom probably wants what's best for you. If she hurts you, tell her, but know she is trying to help.
 Even if things don't end well, when you get home, think about what you got out of the encounter. Perhaps the person taught you how not to behave or you'll learn something about a particular person's personality.


In the future consider whether or not you want to hang out with someone who hurt you. Perhaps you learned that this is not the sort of person you would like to be around.

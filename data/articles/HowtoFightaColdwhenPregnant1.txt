 Rest is a great way to allow your body to recover from any illness like a cold. So, listen to your body. If you feel tired, then you should rest and relax. Make sure to sleep through the night, take naps, and sit down to relax when you are feeling tired.Even sitting down or lying in bed while reading a book or watching TV will allow your body to rest.
Sleep the recommended seven to nine hours per night. Also, minimize your activities during the day so your body can reserve its energy to fight the cold.If sleeping is uncomfortable, use a foam wedge or layer your pillows into a triangle shape to prop your upper body.;
, Even if you arenâ€™t pregnant, staying hydrated is crucial to getting over a cold. Therefore, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Drink water, broth, and juice frequently throughout the day to stay hydrated.It is recommended that pregnant women drink 10 glasses of water per day. Up your intake to 12 or 13 glasses per day to make up for the fluids you lose due to symptoms such as sweating and a runny nose.

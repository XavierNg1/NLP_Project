 If you feel sick during or after travel and are worried you were exposed to malaria, see a doctor right away. It's important to get treatment as soon as possible. Early malaria symptoms are generally non-specific,but may include the following:High fever
Shaking chills
Profuse sweating
Headache
Vomiting
Diarrhea

, The medication your doctor prescribes will depend on where you contracted the disease. Other factors, like pregnancy, are also important. Treatment usually means a strict course of medication for an extended period of time.Drugs used to treat malaria include the following:Chloroquine phosphate is the first-line medication for malaria unless there is resistance to the drug. This issue has become common, so your doctor may prescribe something else.
Doctors prescribe quinine sulfate and tetracycline in areas with high chloroquine phosphate resistance. Alternatively, your doctor may prescribe atovaquone-proguanil and mefloquine.
Sometimes, the infection may require an infusion of medication intravenously. If infected with the parasite P. falciparum, you may take IV quinidine and doxycycline.
If the malaria is caused by either the parasite P. vivax or P. ovale, your doctor may prescribe a two-week regimen of primaquine phosphate.
Again, early prevention is the best way to protect yourself before arriving in high-risk areas. If your doctor knows you are traveling to a chloroquine-resistant region, he or she may prescribe mefloquine.
 See a doctor right away if you experience flu-like symptoms that could be symptoms of malaria. Even if it’s been awhile since you’ve returned, you could still be at risk.


Most cases of malaria become obvious within about two weeks of contracting the disease. But, in some cases symptoms show up much later. The parasite that causes malaria can lie dormant in the body for weeks, months, even up to a year.

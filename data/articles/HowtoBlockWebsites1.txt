, Most monitoring programs require an initial purchase or a subscription to use. You will need a license for each computer that you want to protect. When you purchase a web filtering product online, you will be given links to download the program onto your computer.


These programs generally need to be installed on each computer that you want to protect.
 Most programs offer a list of categories that you can check and uncheck to customize what you allow through. You can also designate specific sites that you don’t want to be accessible, or that you always want to be accessible.


You will need to set these filters on each computer that you install the software on.






Filters are updated constantly by the companies that run these programs. Many use automated systems that browse new pages and block automatically, even if the site isn’t in the database yet.
 Some programs will allow you to set specific times that content can be accessed. For example, you could disable all access to social networks during homework hours so that children can’t be wasting time on Facebook instead of studying.
 Most programs will provide logs and alerts that show when inappropriate content is trying to be accessed. Some programs even allow you to see your child’s Facebook profile and all of their pictures and messages.

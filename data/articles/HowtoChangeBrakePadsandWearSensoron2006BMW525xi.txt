This moves the calipers piston, which is the component which physically pushes the pad into the rotor, slightly into the caliper., Hang the caliper with a wire from the springs, so it's not hanging by the brake line to prevent a brake fluid leak. Let's just say you don't want that., If you don't do this you won't be able to reinstall the caliper with the new pads in., The brake pad wear sensor attaches to the inner pad on the passenger side (pay attention to how it is installed and clip the new one back in the same way).

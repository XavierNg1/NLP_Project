 Keep an open mind. This is crucial to avoid unnecessary early judgement of a religion, be it bad or good. Broaden your perspective.;
, It doesn't matter which one you choose first, since you can always try a different one if it doesn't work out.
 They do not have to be thick or expensive. Instead, look at one important thing: the author. The author should be an influential stature in the religion, like Yusuf Al-Qaradawi for Islamic books, because they are the believer and know the ins and outs of the religion. Avoid books written by a practitioner of religion about another religion, because they will only express an outsider's opinion.
 Try to chat with him or her about their religion. Is it hard to follow the teachings? Are there any misconceptions about the religion? Why do they celebrate certain days? What is it like in heaven and hell? This can give you a taste of what it is like to follow that religion, although one person's experiences probably will not be enough for you to form a conclusion.
 This way, you can judge it from your own perspective. Try to imitate their culture: learn about their clothes, language, and foods.
 While you are there, find information of the religion. When did the religion started? How did it was spread to other places? How can you prove this religion is true? People will help you if you asked them nicely. Visit a place of worship and ask any questions you need answered.
 You can try out as many as you need to find which is right for you.
 This step is your biggest step towards getting a life filled with contentment. Think about all you have learned to help you choose. You can ask your family members for opinions, but in the end, the decision is up to you.
 Have a happy and blessed life!

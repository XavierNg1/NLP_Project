 Do this by browsing by category through the list of existing wikis, or by going to Category:Wikis.


If the wiki you were going to create already exists, just contribute to it instead of creating a new one.



Once you get to that page, you'll see the ShoutWiki terms of use. They explain what ShoutWiki is, have some guidelines about advertising, and cover lots of other concepts. Read them before creating your new wiki, so you'll know how things work on ShoutWiki.

When you're done with that, check the box "I have read and agree to the Terms of Use stated above." Then, click the button "Start the Wiki Creation Wizard!"



, The following will be needed to create your new wiki:


Subdomain of the wiki (20 characters or less)
Site name
Language of the wiki

Check the box "Include language prefix (for example, en or fr) in URL" if you want the language prefix to be included


Type of the wiki (Public, Private or School-based)
Category of the wiki
Wiki's description (describe your wiki in as much info as possible)

, A skin is used to customize the wiki's look and feel, and there are a few different skins that you can choose from.


The skins are as follows:

Monaco
Nimbus
MonoBook
Modern
CologneBlue
Vector



, The licenses include Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0, GFDL (version 1.3 or 1.2) and Public Domain, but there are more to come.
 This will determine who can read pages and who can't. You can choose one of the following:


Everyone (this makes the wiki visible to the public, and pages can be read by anyone)
Registered users only (only users that create an account and are logged in can view pages)
Invited users only (only users that are invited to read pages, can read them)

, This will determine who can edit (modify) pages and who can't. You can choose one of the following:


Everyone (anyone, even anonymous users, can edit pages)
Registered users only (only users that create an account, and are logged in, can view pages)
Invited users only (only users that are invited to edit pages, have permission to edit them)

If the wiki is public, the viewing and editing restrictions won't show up, since the wiki is meant to be 'open' to viewing and editing by anyone.
, If something is not correct, you'll need to click "start over" to start the process over again, because there's no way to correct a small mistake without starting over (sorry!)


If all the information is correct, click on "Create my wiki!" to create the wiki.
 to access your new wiki. This should take you to the main page of the wiki.

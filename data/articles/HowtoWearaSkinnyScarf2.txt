 One classic combination you can create with a skinny scarf is the sharp, attractive contrast between black and white. Pair a black scarf with a white shirt or dress, or vice versa, for an attractive color combination that's appropriate for a variety of occasions.This look can be used to add a splash of style to an otherwise dull outfit. A plain white t-shirt paired with a black scarf can add a little extra to the played down look.
 Many people tie scarves down the front to imitate a necktie. If you're going for a necktie look, stripes can really solidify the aesthetic. As many neckties are striped, opt for a skinny scarf with an attractive striped pattern.A striped scarf is usually best worn with solid-colored clothing to avoid creating an overwhelming effect with too many patterns.
Account for color. Make sure your striped scarf matches your outfit. When wearing a blue top, for example, wear a blue and white striped skinny scarf.
 Skinny scarves come in a wide variety of colors. If you're wearing an outfit that's in neutral shades, try adding a skinny scarf for a fun burst of color. For example, if you're wearing a black dress, pair it with a bright red skinny scarf., Skinny scarves are never particularly thick, but some are a bit chunkier than others. A slightly chunkier skinny scarf can be paired with a crew neck knit. This gives off the appearance of a shirt with a roll neck style., Skinny scarves come in a wide variety of fabrics and textures, like any other brand of scarf. Try out a variety of textures/fabrics to find the right look for you. For warmer months, for example, a light cotton scarf can be a good look. As things get cooler out, you may prefer a fabric like wool.

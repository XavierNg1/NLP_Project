 The more, the better. You'll usually need a group of at least four, but ten or more is preferred. The more the merrier!;
, You don't want your game spilling across the street and through the neighborhood. Set clear boundaries about how far players can run and hide. You'll want to give players room to run, but not too much space that the game gets boring.


Be careful to avoid trespassing on other people's property.
You may want to make certain potentially dangerous areas off-limits.
 This person will be your first Infected. You can either randomly select a person to be "It", or a fast and skilled player can volunteer or be nominated. Don't force a slow or unskilled player to be "It". This can be mean and wouldn't be fun for anyone.
 While closing their eyes, the person who is "It" will count to 30 and give the rest of the players time to run and hide., The person who is it will tag and infect other players. When another player is tagged, they are also infected. Once this occurs, they switch sides and begin to try to tag others. Uninfected players can ask if any other player is infected. If a player is infected, they must declare that they are.
 Keep playing until everyone is infected. The last person tagged is declared the winner. Then the game starts over, usually with the last person being the new Infected.

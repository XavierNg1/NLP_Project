 Sometimes, the best way to deal with someone messing with you is to ignore it. Your dad may thrive off the response he gets from you. He may think it's amusing to see you annoyed, so try to not indulge him.When your dad starts picking on you, just pretend you do not hear him. If he persists in picking on you, simply walk away.
Acting like you don't care may bore your dad. If he thinks it's funny to see you get mad, he'll lose interest if you just ignore his behavior. This can be a good way to get him to stop in the moment.;
, You can also try telling your dad to stop. It's possible your dad does not realize he's bothering you. It's also possible your dad has never been confronted about his behavior before, so he doesn't think he needs to stop. Try standing up for yourself in the moment and see if your dad stops picking on you.Be assertive without being aggressive. Do not raise your voice, but simply say in a stern manner, "Stop talking to me like that."
After you ask your dad to stop, walk away from the situation.
While this can be a good technique, if your dad has a temper, you may want to take a different route. You do not want to escalate the situation.
 You can also try thinking of a comeback to the teasing to make it clear you cannot be intimidated. If your dad makes fun of your hair, for example, say something like, "Thanks for sharing" and then walk away. Try to look relaxed when the teasing occurs, so you appear unbothered by your dad picking on you.As with confronting your dad, however, be careful. If your dad has a temper, you do not want to risk making him angry and potentially escalating the situation.
 If you have siblings, strength in numbers can help you stop getting picked on. Try to stick around your siblings when your dad is around. You and your sibling can work on ignoring or standing up to your dad together. He may feel uncomfortable if he's outnumbered.

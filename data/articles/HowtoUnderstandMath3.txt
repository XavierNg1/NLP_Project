 You'll never learn mathematics if you don't know the basics. Make sure you pay particular attention at the start of each new unit as things are explained. Math is generally taught as a series of building blocks and if you miss a block it could be very difficult to catch up.
 If you take notes in class you'll be able to look back on what you did in class that day. When you go to do your homework you’ll be able to refer back to the examples that you wrote down from class. Writing as you learn also helps you learn and remember better. , Studying before the test is always going to be necessary, but there’s nothing wrong with taking fifteen or twenty minutes every night to study the lesson that you learned that day. You’ll find that you feel much more prepared for the following day of class and you will do less cramming the day before the test.
 It doesn't matter if you get the answer wrong, at least you tried and don't feel ashamed by asking questions. How do you know you might ask somebody else's question, they might be thankful and probably help you out on bits you don't understand.
 Working on math everyday is the real key to understanding it. The more time you spend around the number and concepts the more comfortable you will be with them. Homework might seem like a drag but the daily repetition will really help you.

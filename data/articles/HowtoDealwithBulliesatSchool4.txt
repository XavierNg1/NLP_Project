 This means getting the entire school -- teachers, administrators, and the students -- to agree to make your school a bully-free zone.Even those indirectly involved in the school, such as bus drivers, need to support and receive training on anti-bullying measures., It takes more than an assembly or a bunch of signs pronouncing a bully-free zone to truly create a bully-free environment for students.


Change how kids think about other kids. For example, creating an anti-bullying program may involve creating lesson plans whereby children learn more about other kids, especially those who come from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures, or different learning styles or abilities.Or, teachers might teach cooperation by assigning group projects, which help students learn how to compromise and assert themselves without being too demanding.Rules about bullying and its consequences should be discussed and posted publicly in the school, sent home to parents, and put in community newspapers to create a universal awareness of the issue. This will begin the process of large-scale transformation., Most bullying in schools occurs in areas that have less supervision by adults, like school buses, cafeterias, restrooms, hallways, and locker rooms.Schools need to address these areas by enhancing the monitoring of these spaces by additional adults or using enhanced security techniques including closed circuit cameras.Schools can also establish anonymous reporting tools like suggestion boxes or hotlines where students can send text messages or leave voicemails.

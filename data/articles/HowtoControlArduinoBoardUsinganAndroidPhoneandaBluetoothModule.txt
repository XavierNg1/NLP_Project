 Feel free to modify it. The important aspect here is the baud rate - make sure it matches the baud rate of your module - check the datasheet or use AT commands to do it.


const int ledPin = 2;  0) {serialA = Serial.read();Serial.println(serialA);} switch (serialA) { case 1: digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); break; case 2: digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); break; case 3:digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); delay(100); digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); delay(100); default: break; } }

 Once you have it running, do at least one or two of their basic tutorials. Below is the source of the app used here. You can upload it to the app inventor and then upload to your phone or modify it. https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_PfPoEotOF8N2JwT3RSX011SjQ&usp=sharing

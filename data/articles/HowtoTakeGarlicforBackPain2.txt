 Dr. Andrew Weill created this diet in order to maximize the number of foods in a person's diet that are known to help the body repair and thrive. Garlic is a component of this diet, as are the following:


Eat plenty of phytonutrients per day. This means consuming 4 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 3 to 4 servings of fruit. The eating plan emphasizes eating foods of different colors to maximize your vitamin and mineral intake. You should eat dark green, leafy vegetables every day.
Eat 40 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is provided by vegetables and fruits, but also through whole and cracked grains, beans and legumes.
Protein should be from eggs, lean meats, yogurt and soy.
Modify your beverage choices. Choose tea over coffee. Choose red wine if you drink alcoholic beverages. Drink plenty of purified water throughout the day.
Dr. Weill suggests that if you do not eat 2 to 3 cloves and turmeric every day, you should consider taking them in supplemental form. You can find dietary supplements on the Internet or in natural food stores. Visit drweil.com/drw/u/ART02012/anti-inflammatory-diet to read more about this diet plan's specifications.

 Crackle painting can be done on wood, ceramic, and canvas as well as various other surfaces.


If you are using wood, make sure it is treated as untreated wood may discolor the faux finish.

, It does not matter which color you lay down first. Crackle paint will show up with a dark on light contrast as well as a light on dark.


You can also use metallic paints to give the object an added shine.
Note: if colors are too similar, the crackling effect may not show up as well.
 Use a paintbrush or small paint roller to coat the object with a layer of latex or acrylic paint.


Paint any edges that may be visible, like on a picture frame or piece of wall art.
Let the first coat dry completely before proceeding.
 Crackling glue can be bought at your local craft supply store. You can use generic glue as well. The thicker the coat of glue the larger the crackling effect you will achieve.


For fine crackle lines, apply a thin layer of glue.
 The crackling medium will dry fast so you must get the second color on before it dries or the crackling effect will not work. Lightly apply the paint with a soft paintbrush.


You do not want to be heavy handed with the brush or you will run the paint through the glue, which will distort the faux finish. You can also spray on the top color with a paint sprayer for a faster application.
 As the paint dries, the cracks will appear.


If you want to speed up the process, you may wish to use a heat gun.
Finish the project by putting on a clear coat of polyurethane.

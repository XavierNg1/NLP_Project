 Thickening by reduction intensifies your sauce and also thickens it. This method works well for soups, sauces, and alcohols. It is the best way to thicken naturally without any additives.When you make a reduction, the sauce thickens as water evaporates into steam.


Keep your pot uncovered so the steam can escape.
Stir occasionally to make sure that your sauce doesnâ€™t boil over the pan.
 After large bubbles form in your sauce, you want to reduce the heat and continue to let it simmer until it reaches the desired thickness.


Stir occasionally and taste to see if you want to continue cooking your sauce.
A thicker sauce can take a long time to achieve but will have intense flavor.
 Once your sauce has achieved the thickness you desire, turn off the heat and serve.

Once it stops cooking, a reduction will not thicken as much as sauces that were cooked with starches or flour.

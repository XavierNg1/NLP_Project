 Mix one tablespoon of white vinegar with three cups of water. Take a shower, shampooing your hair as normal. The vinegar can remove built-up minerals from hard water, as well increasing shine and body.When it is time to rinse the shampoo from your hair, use the water and vinegar mixture you created.


Carefully pour the concoction over your head, being sure to soak all strands of hair.Rinse it off after a couple of minutes.
Some people prefer to use apple cider vinegar., An alternative to vinegar, is a lemon or lime rinse. It works in a similar way to vinegar by breaking down residual salts and minerals in your hair. Lemon and lime juice also strips off excess oil, which makes it an especially good choice for those with greasier hair.Mix with the same measurements as the vinegar method, one tablespoon of lemon or lime juice to three cups of water.
After shampooing, massage this solution into your hair and your scalp.
Rinse it off after a couple of minutes., To cut down on your use of hard water, you could use some filtered water for the last rinse when you are washing your hair. You will need about a litre of water for this. Simply pour it over your head a little at a time to wash out the shampoo and conditioner.For a short-term option you could use bottled mineral or spring water.
Using bottled water regularly would get expensive and wouldn't be environmentally friendly.
 Rainwater is also a good substitute to hard water when washing your hair, as it very soft and largely free of salts and minerals. Place a large bucket outside during rainfalls, collecting as much of the liquid as possible.When it is time to take a bath or shower, heat the water in batches in a large pot on the stove to medium heat, and use while bathing.


If you don't use the water straight away, it needs to be kept properly, with a secure lid.You shouldn't assume rainwater is safe to drink.

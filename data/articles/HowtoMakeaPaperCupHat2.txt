 The holes will be for the string or elastic so that you can wear the hat without it falling off. The holes need to be facing each other. You can make them with a hole puncher or a thick needle.
 You can wear the hat in two ways: with an elastic strap under your chin, or by tying two pieces of ribbon under your chin. Here is what you need to do depending on the method you choose:


Cut a piece of elastic and poke each end through each hole. Secure the ends with tight knots.
Cut two pieces of 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) long ribbon. Thread the end of each ribbon through each hole, and tie it in place.
 You will be gluing some tinsel to the hat, so keep this in mind. A glossy black is classic, but you can also paint the hat with glue, then cover it with glitter for something even more blingy.
 Since this will be a wacky party hat, you can go a step further, and decorate it some more. Add some glittery, sparkly stickers. If you painted the hat a solid color, you can draw designs on it using glitter glue.


This can make a great New Years hat. Consider sticking some number stickers onto the front of the hat to honor the new year!

, The tinsel should be wide enough to wrap around the rim of the cup. The fluffier the tinsel, the better!

, Draw a line of glue around the cup's rim, then press the tinsel down onto it. Consider working 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) at a time so that the glue doesn't harden too fast., The tinsel makes it perfect for parties, such as New Years.

 You will begin on the green map screen. In the bottom center of this screen you should see a red and white Poké Ball.
 You will see a green menu screen with Pokémon, Shop, Pokédex, Items, Settings, Tips, and “X” buttons.
 You will see all of the items that you have in the game. You will see Poké Balls (if you have them), your Camera, and your Egg Incubator.
 It should be in the list of Items.


If you do not have Incense, click the “X” button, which will bring you to the map screen. Tap the red and white Poké Ball and then the Shop button to visit the Shop. If you have PokéCoins, you can buy Incense at the Shop. You can also purchase PokéCoins here.
 You will be taken to another screen, where the Incense will be shown spinning. There will also be an “X” button.


If you want to move forward and release the Incense, tap the picture of the Incense. The game should take you back to the map screen, where you should see your avatar as normal, but with a purple cloud circling you.
If you do not want to use your Incense at this moment, tap the “X” button.
 Feel free to move around. Incense will bring more wild Pokémon to your location. Keep the app open, look for them, and catch them!

 This method of glass dyeing is faster and less expensive; however, it should not be used with glass that will get wet or serve food.
, Adding your food coloring to glue is similar to adding food coloring to frosting. The Food Network has a guide for achieving vibrant shades, at http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-cooking/frost-by-numbers-how-to-make-frosting-colors/index.html.


Remember that your shade will dry to a lighter tint than it first appears.
 (4.9 ml) of white glue or Mod Podge with 3 drops of food coloring and 1.5 tsp. (7.4 ml) of water. Use a disposable bowl and spoon to mix the dye.
 Your glass dye will go further if you paint the surface with a broad brush. However, you can also pour the glue mixture into a jar and swirl it around.


The swirl method may result in more dripping and drip marks.
 Allow it to rest for 6 hours, or until it stops dripping. Excess dye will accumulate at the mouth of a jar.


If you are dyeing a flat surface, simply lay it face up.
 Once the glass appears tinted, rather than painted, it is ready to use for decoration.

 Your feelings won't go away instantly. There will be bad days, when you feel low, and there will be days when you feel more hopeful. But, as clich√© as it sounds, time heals. The intense, painful feelings you feel will become dull, and eventually fade.If it has been months and months and you feel no change, you may need a little extra help.
 If you have tried to move on or ignore your feelings and nothing has changed, you may need to talk to someone. Reach out to a mental health professional or a trusted friend and ask for support. A therapist may be able to give you more coping strategies to deal with your feelings.
 When you feel ready, you can start looking for someone who is more compatible and returns your feelings. You don't need to rush into anything right away--rebounding is not always a good idea, and can cause someone else pain if you're not up-front about it. Look at your list of positive traits and remind yourself that you're an amazing human being and you deserve love just as anyone else!


When you feel better, you won't feel anxiety or longing when you hear her name.You will think about him less and less.You will start to truly see and understand that she was not the right person for you.

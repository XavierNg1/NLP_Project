 The first and foremost thing you should do before advertising yourself is to turn off any "obstacles" that may interfere with requests. If you want people to add you, you'll need to disable your "Require last name or email address" and "Require CAPTCHA" from your Spam settings.

If you have last name/email required, the person requesting will need that information.
If you have CAPTCHA enabled, the person will need to enter a "wavy" code of mixed numbers and letters in order for the friend's request to go through. Many people do not like CAPTCHA especially if they're wanting to do "quick adds".;
, Many games will have forums, whether it's hosted on Myspace or an outside host provider. There's two common types of "Add Me" forum sections:

Forum section: A lot of forums that are hosted off Myspace will have an entire section dedicated to "Add Me" threads. Some threads can be about "trains", quick adds, individual adds, or dedicated "No CAPTCHA" threads.
Specific threads: Most Myspace-based forums won't have the advantage of space, so usually there will be a "dedicated sticky thread" on the top labeled, "Official Add Me Thread". These kinds of forums will be strict on people spamming their URLs in other places, such as help or FAQ threads. If you advertise yourself in the wrong thread that has rules, you may have things be taken away from you in that specific game, for example money or points.
 When you request to be someone's friend for a game application, it is in good faith and respect to put down the specific games in the summary box. The word "apps" is not sufficient enough, especially when the requester has 8 or more games on their profile, certain games aren't on the profile, or the profile is private before accepting the friend's request.
 It is very, very annoying when the person who accepts your request has to rummage through their friend's list on the game just to find out that you have disabled invitations.

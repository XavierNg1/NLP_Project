 A really messy car can be an overwhelming sight, which might discourage you from giving it the attention it needs. Try dividing and conquering a messy car by attacking the mess section by section.Break the car up into four quadrants. Start by collecting the trash and clutter around the area around the driver’s seat. Take a break if you need to, then move on to the passenger side, then to each side of the backseat.
 If you’re car is due for some decluttering, grab a few trash bags so you can collect items and separate them by type. Use one bag for non-recyclable trash and another for bottles and other recyclables. Use a third to collect toys, pens, and other items that you want to save., A closet shoe organizer will help you keep clutter from piling up, whether you have kids or need to keep work-related items in your car. Hang it over the back of the passenger or driver’s seat. Use the pockets to store toys, snacks, sunscreen, office supplies, sanitary wipes, garbage bags, or any other necessities., After you’ve collected trash from the car’s main interior, make sure not to put off cleaning out the trunk. Follow the same steps to collect non-recyclable trash, recyclables, and items you want to save. When you’ve finished decluttering the car, you’ll be ready to give a good wipe down and vacuuming.

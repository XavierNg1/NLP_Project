 Instead of three large meals that can fill your belly and tax your digestive system, eat small, frequent meals or snacks. Eat your meals about two to three hours apart; they'll take up less space in your stomach, cause less expansion, keep your metabolism up and keep you feeling full.
 Many high fiber foods, such as broccoli, beans, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, cause gas and bloating. Eliminate them from your diet during this week. When the week is over, gradually add them back one at a time. You might find that some bother your stomach more than others, and you can adjust your diet accordingly to get your fiber and keep your stomach flat.


Fight back against gas-producing foods by using Beano, which contains an enzyme that helps to break down complex sugars found in beans and cruciferous vegetables so that they can be digested more easily.
 While raw vegetables and fruits are great choices for overall health, they cause your stomach to stretch, so it's best to eat them in smaller portions spread throughout the day.
 If dairy products cause uncomfortable gas and bloating, you may have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar found in dairy. Try eating low-lactose foods such as yogurt, consume only small amounts of milk products at one time and eat them with other foods. You can also buy lactose-free products or take a digestive aid such as Lactaid to help break down the lactose in your digestive tract.
 Eat high potassium foods including avocado, mini bananas, papaya, mango, cantaloupe and nonfat yogurt (made without artificial sweeteners). Potassium is a natural diuretic, so it will help reduce water retention and puffiness.

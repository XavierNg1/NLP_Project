 Choose whatever kind of bread you prefer. A grainy bread is a good choice. Toast a slice lightly, then spread it with almond butter. Sprinkle chopped chocolate or mini chocolate chips on top. Stick it back in the toaster or oven under the broiler for a few minutes until the chocolate just begins to melt. Use a knife to smooth out the melted chocolate into the almond butter.Make sure you don't cook the bread too long, as the chocolate can easily go past melting to burning.
 Toast the bread of your choice. Try rye bread or a whole-grain bread. Spread a layer of almond butter on top, then add slices of bananas on top of that. This snack pairs slow-burning carbohydrates with protein, a good combination.You can also try sliced peaches on top., Use two plain (or whatever flavor) rice cakes. Spread almond butter on top of them. Next, drizzle on some sriracha. Make sure to not add too much if you're new to sriracha: it can get very spicy very quickly!, Another easy snack with almond butter is to add it to your oatmeal or other hot cereal. Cook your cereal like you normally would, then stir in some almond butter at the end. You can also add a drizzle of honey.

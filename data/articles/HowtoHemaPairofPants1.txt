 Use a seam-ripper to take out the stitching that holds the old hem in place. Insert the seam ripper under the stitches and break the thread, pulling it out as you go. Continue until the hem is completely ripped out from both pant legs.









If you don't have a seam ripper you can use a small, sharp knife or a pair of nail scissors to do the job.
Be careful not to catch the fabric of your pants as you rip the stitches out.;
, To find the right length for your pants, try them on with the shoes you will most likely wear them with. Even flat shoes have a little more height than your bare feet, so it's important to try on your pants with shoes.









Try on jeans with sneakers or flats if that's what you plan to wear with them.
Dress pants should be worn with heels of the appropriate height.
 Fold the edges of the pant legs under to the length that falls at the right place over the top of your shoes. The cuffs should lightly graze your shoes, rather than hovering above them or bunching up around them.









Place several straight pins around the cuffs to secure them in place.
Walk around the room to determine whether the pants seem like they are cuffed at the right length. Check yourself out in the mirror. Do they ride up and swing? Do they catch on the back of your heels? Make adjustments as necessary.
 Make sure the pins stay in place so you know exactly how short to hem the pants. They are now ready to be sewed.

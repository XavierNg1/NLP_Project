 The actuator orifice is the hole from which WD-40 leaves the WD-40 cannister. If you WD-40 canister is equipped with a smart straw (a long movable red tube), the actuator orifice will be a round yellow circle on the top of the cannister’s actuator (the button you press down to utilize the WD-40). In other WD-40 canisters, however, the actuator orifice is a round black dot on the top of the cannister’s actuator., Point the WD-40’s actuator orifice toward your automobile’s door hinge. The actuator orifice should be about one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge., When you’re ready, place your index finger over the actuator. Squeeze the actuator in a series of quick bursts across the surface of the vehicle’s door hinge. You can move from left to right, or from right to left across the hinge.If you have access to two door hinges, be sure to coat them both.
 In order to adequately coat the internal portion of the hinge with WD-40, you’ll need to open and then close the door a few times. This ensures that it will lubricate the entire hinge mechanism.

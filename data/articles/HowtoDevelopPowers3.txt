 It is possible to train your eyes to adjust more quickly to poorly lit (or unlit) areas. Dedicate 30 minutes each day to training your eyes. Spend time in the darkness so that your eyes become accustomed to making out details in the dark.

Over time, your eyes will acclimate more quickly to darker surroundings.
 To gain physical powers, you’ll need to be dedicated to staying fit. This is an ongoing process in which you are constantly evolving and becoming better. Lift weights to increase your strength. Run often to increase your speed and stamina. Practice yoga to relieve stress and open your mind. Try hiking and rock climbing to train yourself to scale objects.


Don’t start off by overextending yourself. Only do what you are capable of and work up to the harder stuff.
Superhero-like physical abilities will not be developed overnight.
Break yourself of unhealthy habits. For example, if you're a smoker, increasing your stamina, endurance, and overall fitness is going to be a lot more difficult.
 Parkour is an urban sport.Parkourists move about their environment as quickly and efficiently as possible, regardless of obstacles that normal humans would deem unpassable. They propel themselves using only their bodies and surroundings, negotiating obstacles in seconds. They must keep up momentum (to retain efficacy and strength) by running, climbing, jumping, swinging, vaulting, and more.


Parkour is a non-competitive sport.
It teaches you to navigate any environment by being able to see how you can use it to move through it.

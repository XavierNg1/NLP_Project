 If you have a 750 ml bottle, just empty out about 1 to 2 ounces from it, so that there is a good space to add the ingredients.;
, Remove 1 oz of it and taste it to see whether it is already strong.
 Depending on the strength according to your taste, select the amount of ingredients, then add the ingredients in increments.
 Pop in 10 to 12 sticks and leave to infuse for 3 days.


As the bottle is infusing, shake it every 12 hours, for a duration of about 2 minutes.
The best time to make this vodka is at 7pm to 10 pm, so that you may shake it after 12 hours at 7am to 10 am morning.
 Remove all the cinnamon sticks. Have a small taste to determine how many cloves you'll add.
 Add the amounts as follows:


If you think the cinnamon flavor is strong, then do not exceed 5 to 6 cloves.
Otherwise, add about 20 to 25 cloves.
 As with the cinnamon stick infusion, shake the vodka after every 12 hours has passed.
 Distill it well through a sieve or similar item so that not a single piece of cinnamon sticks or cloves can be seen in the drink.
 (Make sure you've cleaned it well before using again.) Add the lid for storage. The vodka is now ready for serving. It will have a strong, spicy flavor that you should find very pleasing.

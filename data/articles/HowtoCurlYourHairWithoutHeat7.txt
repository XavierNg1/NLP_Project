 If you have just washed you hair, then towel dry your hair and let it air dry., Separate the two sides.
 Use a small clip to pin the twist on top of your head. If you don't have pins, hair ties may work. Repeat to the same side.


You can also tuck the twist into a wraparound cloth headband to secure it., This will take anywhere between 4 to 6 hours, or even overnight.
 Remove the clips and/or headband and shake out your curls.Enjoy your messy, spiral curls.

 Swimming is a great way to relieve stress. It is a full body workout and a great low-impact option for those suffering from joint issues. If you live in a warm climate, try locating an outdoor pool which has time allotted for open swim or lap swimming. If you live in a colder climate, opt for an indoor pool with a flexible schedule., Many public pools and gym pools have kickboards available for use. Place your arms over the kickboard, allowing it to provide flotation for your body. Then gently kick to begin warming up. Do 4 laps with the kickboard to warm up your muscles, resting 20 seconds between laps., After you’ve warmed up with the kickboard, take your swimming routine up a notch with 6 freestyle laps. Be sure to take a 20 second rest between each lap. If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed, it is okay to take a longer break between laps.
 Once you’ve completed ten laps, be sure you cool down with at least two freestyle laps at a reduced speed. Alternatively, you can pick the kickboard back up and complete your cool down with two laps on the kickboard.

 To ensure that the glazed carrots don’t stick to your slow cooker, it’s important to grease it. Spray the interior with a nonstick cooking spray before preparing the carrots.For the brown sugar glazed carrots, you should use a slow cooker that holds at least 3 ½ quarts (3.3 l).
You can use a slow cooker liner if you don’t want to grease the slow cooker.;
, Once the slow cooker is greased, add 32 ounces (950 g) of ready-to-eat baby-cut carrots to it. Next, sprinkle ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ½ cup (100 g) of packed brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter that’s been cut into pieces over the carrots.You don’t need to mix the ingredients together. They will blend as they cook.
 When all of the ingredients are in the slow cooker, cover it. Allow the carrots to cook on high heat for 4 to 5 hours, or until they are as tender as you’d like.Stir the carrots after two hours to ensure that they’re cooking evenly.
 Once the carrots are tender, use a spoon to place them in a serving bowl. Season them with additional salt and pepper if you like, and sprinkle 1 tablespoon (4 g) of chopped fresh parsley over them before serving.If there is any sauce left behind in the slow cooker when you take out the carrots, you can spoon it over them in the serving dish.

 Choose any size box that you desire. Boxes made with plain cardboard are easiest to convert into a manger, but you could also use a box that has a printed pattern.
 Use markers to draw wood grain on the outside of the cardboard box. Draw slightly curved lines across the box to resemble wood planks. Add details like wood swirls, knots and cracks to resemble wood. Consider drawing nails at each end of the box as a finishing touch.


If you're using a box that has a design printed on it, cover it first with brown paper or cut up paper bags. Use double-sided tape or glue to secure the plain brown paper to the box and completely obscure the pattern underneath. When the glue is dry, use markers to create the wood grain pattern.
Your manger doesn't have to be brown. You could cover the box with clay-colored paper, festive red and green Christmas colors, or any other colors you desire. If you're making the manger with kids, let them decide how to decorate it in honor of Christmas.
 Arrange hay or straw along the inside and outside of the box. The hay will help disguise the box and create the appearance of a manger.

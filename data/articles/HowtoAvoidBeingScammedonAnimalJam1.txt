 Deception is when a Jammer gives you an item for your item that isn't what they told you it would be. Scamming is when a Jammer wants to get something from you and give nothing back.


Agreeing (even if accidentally) to a trade through the trade system is not a scam. It's just a bad decision (or an accident).
If you accept a trade that you thought was a good idea at the time, but now regret, you weren't scammed. That's trader's remorse.;
, If something about a specific Jammer's offer or request seems off, don't take them up on it.


Exercise caution. Don't trust just anyone in the chat. People can scam you easily if you accept whatever people ask for in the chat. Keep your precious and hard-earned items to yourself.
 It's easy to get tricked into one of them.


The "Trial Run" Scam is when a Jammer asks if they can try out your item before they decide if they'll trade you for it. Don't fall for it! If they insist, request that they trade you your items first, and if they aren't happy with the trade, you can always trade back. Just be sure you don't turn into the scammer and refuse their trade-back.
The "Gift Exchange" Scam is when a Jammer asks that you perform a trade through the mail. That should be a huge red flag to you! Always, always, always use the trading system. It's the safest way to ensure you don't get scammed.
The "Birthday" Scam is when a Jammer demands a gift from another because it's supposedly their birthday. This isn't a scam!!! its just saying that you need to give them something! (if you agree, you're accepting that you're giving a gift and probably will get something back!), it's annoying and often deceptive, since who knows when their birthday truly is? In this situation, don't report, just ignore unless they begin to harass you.

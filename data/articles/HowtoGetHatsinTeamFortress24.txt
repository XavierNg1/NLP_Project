 Supply crates drop randomly depending on time spent playing Team Fortress 2. They contain a random item from a small set of hats, weapons etc.
 Click on 'Shop' from the main menu to open the store. The Key can be found under the 'Items' tab.
,, You'll be prompted to confirm that you do want to open the crate after all. Click 'Yes, I'm sure.' and, with any luck, you'll receive a new hat!

 Keeping the milk on or near the door will expose it to more heat or temperature fluctuations from the opening and closing of the refrigerator. In the back the milk will be colder and more likely to keep., Glass, disposable bottle liners, or “mother’s milk” bags are best. Polypropylene or polybutylene hard plastics are preferable to soft plastic polyethylene bags.


It is also important to ensure that other containers in the fridge are closed tightly so that that the milk does not absorb these other odors.
A box of baking soda in the refrigerator can help absorb other smells., Writing the date you expressed the milk on the container can help you make sure you use the older milk first and before it spoils. You can label each container or put all milk from the same week or month together in a bag or box that is labeled.
 If you do not plan to use the milk in five to eight days, you should freeze it. Place it in a tightly sealed container in the back of the freezer. Use within 24 hours after thawing.Depending upon how frequently you open the freezer, your milk can last for anywhere from three months to a year.Do not use a microwave to thaw the milk. Thaw it under warm, running water. Do not bring to boil.
It is natural for it to separate into milk and cream while frozen. Swirl it gently to mix these together., If you find that your milk has a soapy flavor and that this is a problem for your baby, you should scald it. Heat to about 180 °F (82.2 °C) (it should show signs of a full bubble, but not a rolling boil). Immediately afterward cool and store the milk.


If this flavor does not bother your child, do not scald it. The milk will lose some of its nutrients in the process.

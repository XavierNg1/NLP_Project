 With the turkey lying on its back, take the tip of one wing and tuck it under the shoulder of the turkey. Do the same with the other wing. If the neck flap is long enough, pull it tight under the turkey and use the wing tips to hold it in place.Having the wings tucked under the turkey also helps balance and stabilize the turkey in the pan.
 Cross one leg over the other at the ankles. Be sure to cover the cavity at the tail of the bird with the legs. While holding the legs in place, pull some kitchen twine under the ankles, then back over the top., Cross the ends of the twine over each other. Pull the ends to tighten the twine so the legs are secure. Cross the ends of the twine again and pull to secure your knot.This is the simplest way to keep your turkey in a compact shape and keep the skin flaps closed. It is important to secure the skin flaps, which will otherwise shrink back while the turkey is cooking and leave the meat underneath exposed to direct heat, which will result in overcooked, dry meat.
Tie a double knot for more security.
Trim any excess twine using kitchen sheers.

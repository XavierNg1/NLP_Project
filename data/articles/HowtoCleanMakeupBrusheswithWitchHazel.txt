 Places such as the living room floor or the kitchen counter usually aren't acceptable if you live with others or have pets. If your bathroom is clean, putting them on the counter is a good idea, so long as you avoid chemicals or other things such as makeup and water.;
, Get as much makeup as you can out of the brush before you apply the witch hazel.
 A good technique is to mix water and witch hazel in a spray bottle. Try to make it 3 parts water and one or two parts witch hazel.â™¥

, Spray the brush with the bottle, and don't be heavy handed. Use your fingers to work it into the centre of the brush, or spread open the brushes and clear out the inside.
 Do not soak them in the witch hazel.
 Make sure to get in all the crevices and bristles.
, Try to fluff up the bristles every few minutes while they are still wet.
 You have nice clean brushes! It's like you just bought them.

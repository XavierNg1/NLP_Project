 One symptom of keratitis is red, swollen eyes. Swollen eyes may be accompanied by a discharge from the eye.The discharge from the eye may be clear and watery, making the fur beneath look wet. It may also take on a yellow-green color if it is infected.
Swollen eyes may be a symptom of a generalized infection from the herpes virus.
 Cats with keratitis may display symptoms of eye discomfort. This means the cat may favor the eye.Your cat may rub the eye with his paw or rub his eye on the ground.
The eye may be closed, or your cat may start squinting. Additionally, he may be sensitive to light, so he may spend time in dark places or have trouble keeping his eyes open in bright lights.
 If your cat has keratitis, there may be some discoloration in the eye. The surface in the center of the eye should be clear so you can see the black pupil. If keratitis is present, you may see abnormalities there.


The surface of the eye may have inflamed patches with blood vessels threading over the surface.Sometimes, due to extra cells in the eye area, the eye may take on a whitish appearance that looks like white-pink lace., With severe keratitis that becomes well-established due to lack of treatment, sometimes the area slowly becomes pigmented and brown staining covers the surface. This change may be permanent and the pigment prevents light entering the eye and interferes with the cat's sight.


In severe cases, the cat may become blind in that eye as a result. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment is desirable.Tests may be done to rule out other possible causes of the eye symptoms to make a more definitive diagnosis, especially in the case of herpes., Cats who have keratitis may display signs pointing to problems with their upper respiratory system. This might include sneezing, nasal discharge, or even discharge from the ears.If the keratitis occurs because of the herpes virus, respiratory symptoms may show earlier than or at the same time as eye symptoms.

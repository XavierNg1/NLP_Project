 While instinct may tell you to kill the ants as fast as you see them, following their trail may be easier if you let the infesting bunch roam for a while so you can find where they are coming from.;
, If you don't have any caulk on hand, spread some petroleum jelly on the area to prevent the ants from entering.
 If ants are still getting through you can try a natural repellent.

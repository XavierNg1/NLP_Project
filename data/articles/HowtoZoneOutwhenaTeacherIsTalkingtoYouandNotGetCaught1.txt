 If you zone out during a presentation or a time when you’re expected to speak in class, your cover will be blown. If, on the other hand, you zone out during someone else’s presentation, or on a day when the class sees a film, you’ll be far more likely to successfully zone out without getting caught.;
, A seat far from the teacher is a good place to zone out for two reasons. First, it will provide crucial distance between you and anything which might disrupt your thought vacation. Second, it will reduce the chances of you being discovered for zoning out. If you’re using an electronic device to block out the teacher’s lecture, you’re less likely to be caught when you’re not sitting front and center in the teacher’s line of sight.
 When you show that you are engaged, the teacher will be less likely to call on you again. Asking or answering a question before you zone out will ensure you earn your requisite participation points with the teacher while limiting the likelihood he or she will expect more of you later.
 This seems counterintuitive: how can you zone out when you’re paying attention? But if the class is so boring that you’d dig up an article online about how to zone out and get away with it, chances are that you’re stuck in a truly boring class. Listening to a few minutes of your teacher drone on about binomial fractions or Wuthering Heights is sure to numb your brain enough to allow the zoning-out process to spontaneously take over.

 Talk to them about your child but don't be too intrusive. There's a fine line between being helpful and being controlling.
 Arrange a playdate, or introduce them to your friends' children.
 There are tons of other places to get help and make up for any lost social interaction, like becoming a voracious reader, or pursuing their passions

, Find examples in your life and in your child's life. You can find good friends in TV shows, books, and everyday life. Explain to your child WHY that figure is a good friend.
 Don't discourage him from meeting people you don't like. Most social interaction is helpful in building confidence.

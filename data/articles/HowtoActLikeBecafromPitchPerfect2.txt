 As you know, Beca has no blemishes on her face. Be sure to use the correct foundation and concealer that matches your skin tone and type to hide any blemishes or zits that you might have. Also, she is very pale. To achieve that pale skin, be sure not to go out into the hot sun without the correct amount of sunscreen protecting your skin.


Don't tan. Although you might be tempted to, tanning is not good for your skin and will cause you to get wrinkles earlier in your life than you should. Also, the wrinkles will be more obvious.
 Beca has very dark eyes. Consider applying your eye makeup to represent a smokey eye. Also, add plenty of eyeliner and volumized lashes, but be careful about adding too much. Remember that less is more.
 Beca does not have very large lips. Therefore, it's perfectly fine if your lips are small, but it's also acceptable if they're plump. All you need for your lips is a nude lipstick or chapstick.
 Beca's style is pretty simple. Her summer look consists of a tank top, a sleeveless and flowing vest, skinny jeans, and sandals. Her winter look is a dark green, black, or brown scoop neck sweater, skinny jeans, and lace up boots.
 All you need are some rubber and jelly bracelets, a chunky necklace, hoop earrings, a few ear cuffs, and a couple of rings on your fingers.

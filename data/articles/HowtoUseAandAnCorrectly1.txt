 In English, nearly all words that begin with consonants will be preceded by the article "A."For example: a pet, a door, a green onion, a cat, a hysterical joke.;
, Some words may be spelled beginning with vowels but be pronounced with initial consonant sounds. Words that begin in h, y, u, and eu or "e" are common words that can cause confusion.


Use "A" when u makes the same sound as the y in you: a union, a unicorn, a used napkin, a usability study.
Use "A" when o makes the same sound as w in won: a one-legged man.
Use "A" when eu or "e" makes the same sound as y: a European trip, a ewe lamb
Do not use "A" when the h is silent.
 Sometimes, the way the word looks on the page is not enough to tell you which article to use. Read the word aloud in the way it sounds appropriate to you, and then base your article use on that.

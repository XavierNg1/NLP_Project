 Before adding pasta water to something like bread or soup, allow it to cool enough that you can taste it. You may find the flavor of the water would not go well with your recipe. In this case, try to use the pasta water for something other than cooking., Pasta water should not be used for cleaning purposes. It is very starchy and, if you boiled something like vegetables in the water, it may be discolored. This can stain surfaces, so do not use pasta water to clean., Pasta water can only be re-used so many times. If you cook pasta in the same water twice, it will become increasingly starchy as it draws more water from the pasta. Eventually, it will become too thick to use. If you reuse the same water to boil pasta over and over again, discard the water after it gets thick and cloudy.,

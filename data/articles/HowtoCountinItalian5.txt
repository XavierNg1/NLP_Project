 Hence, we have in Italian,


Benedicto XVI as Benedicto, decimo sesto.
Carlo II as Carlo secondo (Charles, the second).
Tomo IV as Tomo quarto (volume four).
 Ordinal modifiers follow the grammar rules of other Italian modifiers, when being adverb, plural, and so on. Hence,


primi anni (first years, contrasted with English).
prima donna (first woman, contrasted with English).
primo uomo (first man, contrasted with English).

 Assess a studentâ€™s level of understanding of a given subject by evaluating the level of competency that they demonstrate over several situations. Methods of determining comprehension include one-on-one instruction, pop quizzes, participation in class discussions, and written or oral reports. Based on these results, gauge and record what content a student still needs to master., Based on your understanding of what a student has absorbed from the material taught, plan a specific, personalized learning plan with the goal of providing the knowledge that they are lacking. This plan should exclude the content that the student has already mastered, and be tailored specifically to their weaknesses. Write out this plan and share it with the student so that they clearly understand their learning goals.For example, if a student shows an overall improvement in math but still struggles consistently with assignments and test questions dealing with the Pythagorean Theorum, make a lesson plan focusing on that concept.
 Knowing what a child has already learned and anticipating free time, make a specific plan for accelerated studies of the subject at hand. This plan should be established beforehand to minimize distractions for other students. For instance, if a student has mastered a theory and lab experiment in Chemistry class, have them move on to a second experiment to expand on the theory.

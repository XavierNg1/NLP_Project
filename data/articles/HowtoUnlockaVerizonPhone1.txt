, Each Verizon Global Ready 3G phone has its own unique instructions for accessing the programming menu.


If the user guide for your phone does not provide instructions for accessing the programming menu, contact Verizon Wireless directly by dialing *611 from your Verizon phone, or by dialing 1-800-922-0204 from another phone.
 One of these universal codes will unlock your Verizon Global Ready 3G phone. After your phone has been unlocked, you can use your phone on any other compatible wireless network.


To use Verizonâ€™s Global Ready SIM card on another network, call Verizon Wireless using the contact information provided in step #2 to request a SIM unlock. At this time, Verizon requires you to speak to a live representative to have the SIM card itself unlocked.

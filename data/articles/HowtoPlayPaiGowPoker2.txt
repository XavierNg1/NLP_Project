 Divide the cards into a group of 5 cards, which forms a regular 5-card poker hand, and a group of 2 cards, which either makes a pair or doesn't. The 5-card hand is the high hand, and the 2-card hand is the low hand. The goal is to have both hands beat those held by the banker.
 High hands of 5 cards are ranked from high to low as in most poker games, allowing for the joker serving as a bug. The hands are as follows:


Five aces (using the joker as the fifth ace).
Royal flush (ace, king, queen, jack, and 10 of the same suit).
Straight flush (5 cards in sequence of the same suit) � Deviates from regular poker in that A-2-3-4-5 beats a king-high straight flush.
Four of a kind (4 cards of the same rank).
Full house (3 cards of the same rank and a pair of a different rank).
Flush (5 cards of the same suit).
Straight (5 cards in sequence) � Ranks A-2-3-4-5 above a king-high straight but below an ace straight with face cards.
Three of a kind (3 cards of the same rank).
Two pair.
One pair.
 Low hands of 2 cards rank pairs over unpaired cards, and rank high cards over low cards. Pairs rank aces high, deuces low and unpaired cards rank ace-king high to 3-2 low.


A low hand cannot be higher than a low hand. If it is, the hand is declared "foul" and the player forfeits the bet. A player with only a single pair out of the 7 cards dealt, and no straights or flushes, must play it in the high hand. A player with 2 pairs may choose to play both pairs in the high hand or the higher pair in the high hand and the lower pair in the low hand. A player with 3 pairs may assign the pairs to the high and low hand however he or she wishes, as two pair beat a single pair.
As noted previously, the banker's hand is formed according to house rules, as is the dealer's hand. Any players playing dragon hands in addition to their own must play from the dragon hand according to the house way.

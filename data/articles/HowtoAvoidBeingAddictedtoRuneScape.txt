 Do you feel like you get on RuneScape far more than the average player? Is your 'addiction' to RuneScape messing with your life, or causing you to become a procrastinator or someone that is constantly late? Are you getting tired of RuneScape, but are putting off quitting for a reason you can't understand?;
, Motivate yourself. Repeat, "I can and will quit RuneScape!" to yourself whenever possible.


Avoid making new RuneScape accounts. It really isn't worth it. Although starting over is a good thing sometimes, this only tests your addiction.
Prevent yourself from playing RuneScape again. Give away your RuneScape possessions. Change your password to 20 characters of gibberish. Uninstall RuneScape and Java, clear your history, and take all RuneScape-related links out of your favorites. If necessary, disable Internet connectivity. Roughing it without Internet is a small price to pay for getting your life back.
 If your friends are interested in RuneScape, and want to talk about it, either keep them quiet about it or get new friends. Don't bring it up on a date. Avoid conflict regarding RuneScape with those close to you.
 Find other activities outside of the house that may suit your talents, and play RuneScape whenever you get bored with them. Do not time yourself or attempt to set up a schedule for playing unless you are absolutely sure it will work. If you have a weak willpower, you may find yourself getting stressed about passing time, or may even disregard your schedule and play RuneScape like you have before.
 Get involved in social and athletic activities. Convince your parents to get you into an after school sport. Remember how easy it was to play RuneScape, even while being away from the computer/keyboard? People tend to watch TV at the same time or fix up a snack while their character is active. Do more of those "tasks" and wean yourself off the game as much as possible.

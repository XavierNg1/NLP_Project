 For this experiment, you will need to collect some rain water and get some strips of pH paper. pH paper is a special type of paper that changes color based on how acidic or basic a solution is. The paper comes with a separate color chart that allows you to identify the pH according to the color.pH paper can be purchased at gardening or pool stores.;
, To test the acidity of your rain water, you want to obtain a sample that is free from contaminants. Place a clean jar or bucket outside while it is raining. Make sure the bucket is at least two meters (six-and-a-half feet) above the ground to prevent contamination from dirt and dust.Place the bucket on a table or hang it above the ground.
Contaminants can alter the pH of the collected rain.
 Take a single strip of pH paper from the stack and dip it into the rainwater for about two seconds. The color should change immediately and then you should proceed to the next step.If you let the strip sit for too long without looking at the chart, the color might change.
Try the test at least three times and see if they all come out the same color. If the strips do not come out the same color, the strips may be expired and youâ€™ll need to buy new, fresh strips.
 As soon as the color changes on the strip, compare it to the associated chart. Find the color that is the closest match to what you see on the strip. The pH written next to that color is the pH of the collected rain water.The color comparison must happen immediately because the color will fade with time.
Normal rainwater is slightly acidic with a pH between 5.0 and 5.5. Acid rain usually has a pH of around 4.0 but anything in the range of 4.2-4.4 is considered acidic.

 Light is a stimulant. On the other hand, darkness triggers your body to produce more sleep-inducing melatonin. Avoid reaching for the lamp on the nightstand. If you wear a sleep mask, keep it on. If not, simply close your eyes., Place your phone beyond arm's reach. Looking at the clock will make you realize how much sleep you've lost and increase your stress levels. Turn your alarm clock toward the wall. The blue or green light from your phone could make you feel more alert.Avoid watching TV, as well. Like your phone, the TV emits light that can trigger activity in your brain. Furthermore, the activity on the TV and the storylines attached to it could further engage your brain into a fully conscious state., Don't think of anything at all. Close your eyes and lie as still as possible. Try to be present in the moment and not worry about finding a solution that you can't achieve now. These actions will reduce the activity in your heart and brain, allowing you to get into a more relaxed state., Focus on one muscle group at a time, trying to isolate each group. Flex your muscles to about three-quarters strength. Hold each flex for five seconds and slowly release the tension. As you transition between muscle groups, take slow, deep breaths.

If any muscle group causes you pain, skip it and move on to another group that doesn't cause discomfort., Everything from an approaching deadline to a sudden realization that you're out of bread can charge your brain. Use any distracting tricks you can to allow yourself to calm down and go to sleep. Count sheep. Think of the lyrics of your favorite song., Don't try to force yourself back to sleep if you can't unwind. Turn on the light at the dimmest setting you can stand without straining your eyes. Do some reading. Turn on some soft music and practice yoga or meditation. Go back to bed when you start to feel tired.

Stick to calming activities. Avoid anything stressful like paying bills or working on something with a deadline.

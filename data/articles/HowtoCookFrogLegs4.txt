 Meanwhile, grease a baking dish with nonstick cooking spray or shortening.


Alternatively, you could line the bottom of the dish with aluminum foil or parchment paper. The important thing is simply to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
 Mix together the Parmesan cheese, egg, butter, onion, garlic, cumin, rosemary, and tarragon in a small to medium mixing bowl until well combined.


Make sure that the dish has a fairly wide mouth so that you will be able to easily dunk the frog legs in and out of it.
 Dip each frog leg in the cheese and egg mixture, coating both sides. Let the excess drip off before dredging all sides of each frog leg in bread crumbs.


The bread crumbs should be spread out on a wide plate or in a large bowl with shallow sides.
 Spoon any remaining mixture over the frogs' legs once all have been coated and placed in the dish.


The frog legs should be spread out in an even, single layer. Do not stack the legs into multiple layers, since doing so could lead to uneven cooking.
 Cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour in your preheated oven.


You should not need to stir or toss the frog legs as they cook, but if the top appears to be browning well before the end of the full cooking time, you can carefully reach in with a pair of tongs and turn the pieces over to expose the other side.
 Sprinkle with salt, to taste, and serve immediately.

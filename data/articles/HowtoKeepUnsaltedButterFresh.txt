 Aim to buy one with a good amount of time before it reaches this date. Choose a smaller stick or block (they usually come in small sticks anyway) so that you can use it faster and replenish as needed with a freshly purchased one.;
, If you plan to use the butter within two weeks, store it in the refrigerator.Keep it wrapped to prevent other fridge flavors from reaching it. Once opened, the two week timeline begins.
 Wrap the butter well in foil to avoid other flavors from mingling with it. Before wrapping, consider cutting the butter into smaller chunks that you can remove for use as needed. Place a resealable freezer bag over the butter to prevent odor penetration. Place in the freezer.
 When you need to use the frozen butter, remove a portion from the freezer the day before. Allow it to thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

 Bootlegs have messy paint. For example, paint on a coat button might drift onto the rest of the coat. Also, on bootleg EVA pinkies, as well as Animate Tenchos, the bootleg's pants button is not painted.;
, Bootlegs are usually shorter than legit Pinkies.
 Most Pinkies come in a pink blister package with the VANCE PROJECT and BABYsue logos in the bottom corner. There are some exceptions to this. All three Animate Tenchos have flames on their back cards, and some Pinkies have the blisters inside of a larger box, as is the case for Achi Kochi Pinky:st, In Town, and others.
 Some bootlegs have all the wrong items in them, such as an Ayanami Rei wearing a T-shirt and pleated skirt. In other cases, as shown in the picture, the set contains a Hana head, wears a Reina outfit, and comes with accessories from a variety of sets.
 Although there have never been any Tenjho Tenge Pinky bootlegs, you can usually find a bootleg Animate Tencho Yoshiko version. 1.

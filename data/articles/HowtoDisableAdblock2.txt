 To completely stop AdBlock from running, you must disable it on each browser you use. Luckily, the process is very similar for each browser., AdBlock is not part of the normal browser software; it is an extension. This means it can be toggled on and off through a specific menu, easily found in every major browser:


Safari: Click on "Safari" (Mac) or "Edit" (Windows) → "Preferences" → "Extensions"

Chrome: Click the three gray bars in the top-right corner, then "Tools" → "Extensions"

Opera: Click on "Tools" → "Extensions"

Firefox: Click on "Tools" → "Add-Ons".

Microsoft Edge: Click on the "More" (...) button → "Extensions.", The icon is a red stop sign with a white hand in the middle. If doesn't appear, be sure to click "Show all Extensions/Add-Ons" from the bottom of the page., Pausing AdBlock will prevent it from running altogether on the browser you're using (but not on other browsers). The option to pause AdBlock will display differently depending on the browser you're on.Google Chrome: Click on the check box next to "Enabled" so that no check displays next to it.

Safari: Click on the box next to "Enable "AdBlock"" so that no check displays next to it.

Firefox: Click "Disable" next to AdBlock.

Opera: Click "Disable" in the window that displays AdBlock.

Microsoft Edge: Right-click on the "AdBlock" option and click "Disable."

, If you want to permanently delete AdBlock, click the "Remove," or the Trash Can icon on the menu from the previous step. This will completely remove it from your browser. Because Adblock is free, you can always download it again if you want it back. Generally, however, you only delete extensions if you have problems with them and need to reinstall (immediately). Otherwise, temporary disabling is usually the easiest thing to do..

 and have everything you need on hand. Once you start making your bun, it will be difficult to open boxes and drawers. Keep a bunch of bobby pins handy, and your hair tie around your wrist. Try to use a hair tie that matches your hair color. You can find them in black, dark brown, and light brown/beige.


If you have red hair, use either a dark brown or purple hair tie, depending on how colored/dark your hair is.;
, Lean forward, like you are about to pick something up off the floor, so that your hair hangs straight down. This will make grabbing your hair easier, and ensure that all of those curly locks lay smooth.
 The hand that has the hair tie around it should by holding the hair; your other hand should be free.
 Grip the hair tie with your free hand, slide it over your wrist, and onto your hair.
 The ends should still caught under the hair tie, and the rest of your hair should be sticking out of it in a loop.
 Keep wrapping it until it is snug around your hair, and holding it securely. You'll end up with a fluffy fan on top of your head, and a bunch of loose ends sticking out from under the hair tie.









If you find that your hair is getting snagged, pull your hair all the way through the hair tie, and wrap the hair tie around it once (like making a pony tail). Then, pull your hair half-way through the hair tie, and let go.
 You can leave your bun as is, or you make it messier. To do this, gently pull on each side of the bun until you get the fluffiness you want. You can also move the loose ends around so that they face different directions.
 You can even leave a few sticking out for a messier look.
 Take a loose strand, and wrap it around the base of your bun a few times, then pin it in place with a bobby pin. If you can still see the hair tie, repeat this step with another loose strand.

 To make some lip balm, you will need a double-boiler, some small containers, and the following ingredients:2 tablespoons beeswax
2 tablespoons shea butter
2 tablespoons coconut oil
6 â€“ 12 drops essential oil (optional)

, If you do not have one, fill a large pot with a few inches of water, then place a large bowl on top of the pot. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water.
 If you cannot see the water, then just watch for the steam.
 Be sure to stir your ingredients often so that they melt evenly and become mixed.
 You can leave your lip balm plain, or you can add some flavor to it with 6 to 12 drops of essential oil. Oils that would work well with shea butter include vanilla, lavender, and rose. After you have added the oils, give the mixture another stir to blend everything together.
 Work quickly before the mixture hardens. You can use anything to store your lip balm, so long as it has a tight-fitting lid. If you are having difficulties pouring the mixture in, then you can use a spoon or eyedropper to transfer the mixture from the pot to the containers.

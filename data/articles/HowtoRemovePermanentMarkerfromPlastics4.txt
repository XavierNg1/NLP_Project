 You will need one part baking soda and one part white toothpaste.How much you use will depend on the size of the stain. Be sure that the toothpaste is white (or a pale mint color) and not the gel kind; white toothpaste is more abrasive than gel toothpaste and thus more effective. Because this method uses abrasive materials, it is not recommended for painted surfaces, as it may scratch the paint. Consider testing the paste in an out-of-sight area first.


For very small stains, you will probably need a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and baking soda. For larger stains, you will need up to a teaspoon or tablespoon of each.
You will also need something to mix the toothpaste and baking soda in, such as a small bow, dish, or cup.
 Measure out some baking soda and toothpaste. Make sure that you are using equal amounts, and mix them together using a fork or spoon. You can also use a toothpick or popsicle stick.
 Do not spread the paste too thinly, but also don't spread it too thick. If you can see the stain through the paste, you may want to consider using a little bit more.
 If the surface is very textured, consider using a toothbrush; the bristles will help you get into all of the little nooks and crannies. If the surface is very smooth, consider using a towel or your finger, and don't scrub too hard or you will risk scratching the surface.
 The baking soda and toothpaste should have removed most of the stain, however, you may want to consider following up with some rubbing alcohol to get rid of any residue.

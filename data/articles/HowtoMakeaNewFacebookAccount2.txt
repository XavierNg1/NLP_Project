You will see this signup form:
Fill it out completely, make sure all the information is accurate, then click the Sign Up button.
 Facebook will next ask you to search your various email accounts for friends. You are welcome to do this at this time, or click on Skip this step at the bottom, and continue with the sign-up process.
 Step 2 of the sign-up process is filling out basic profile info: High school, college, and employer. Again, you may choose to fill this out, or skip this step.
 Now's your chance to shine to the world! Upload a photo from your computer, or take a photo with your web cam. However you do it, Facebook will take it. Of course, like the other steps, you can choose to skip this as well.

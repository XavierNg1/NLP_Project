 Your surgeon will remove any scar tissue and damaged areas, as well as any other debris found in your joint. She will then reconstruct or replace the worn out surfaces in your joint as needed.


Surgery on a joint can most often be done laparoscopically. What this means is that only a few small incisions will be made, and the surgeon will then use cameras inside your joint and small tools to clean the joint and to make repairs and replacements as needed.
 However, these complications are very rare, and the benefits of surgery tend to far exceed the risks.
 Most people experience a reduction in pain, and perhaps even complete resolution of their pain. However, it usually takes a few months to completely recover from surgery and to regain function in the affected joint. You will need to be persistent and dedicated throughout the recovery process.


There will be discomfort initially following surgery.
You can ask your physician about which pain medications to use to help control the post-surgical pain in the initial stages following the procedure.
Some people need to use crutches, a cane, a walker, or a sling temporarily while the affected joint heals.
You will likely be referred to a physiotherapist for a formal rehabilitation program following surgery on your injured joint.

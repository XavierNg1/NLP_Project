 Pick a nice, bright color for the base. Then, once you have smoothed the lipstick over 2-3 times, and defined your Cupid's bow, you can put on some glittery lip gloss.;
, You'll want a nice, light color for highlighting, and maybe a lighter pink for the actual blush. Don't overdo it- you don't want to look like you are in Clown City!

, Pick a color that maybe is in your outfit, but doesn't stand out too much. That will make the color in your dress pop out more. The reason why we want you doing eyeliner first is because if you do mascara first, you may not be able to line the waterline too well, or above. That is because the mascara may smudge, and who knows- it may look like you have overlapped and maybe will look like you were too lazy to correct it.
 Don't go for a colorful shade if you already have quite a few colors going on near your waterline. It may look like you are trying too hard. So, go for a black, duo mascara and do about 3-4 coats of it. Try to use water-proofed mascara as well; they have less clumps.
 Pick only one color for the lid, and only one color for the crease. Try to match these colors with small accessories such as bracelets, shoes or earrings. Do this carefully, and try to limit the number of sweeping motions you do on the lid unless you are going for more of a smokey eyed looks than a regular flash-the-lid look. Instead, do the dabbing motion gently. This may take a while, but it is really worth it. For the crease, to the opposite. Some people prefer to use liner if they want a black crease, as in, pencil liner, but I prefer not to. Your choice!

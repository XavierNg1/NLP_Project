 Before moving an object like a basketball, you first need to select it. Select it using the first four tools in your tool panel from the top down. The select tool looks like a simple mouse hand.


The rectangular icon includes tools for selecting large, not as precise areas of your image. Use this tool by clicking and dragging over the desired area. The tool will either select portions of the image as a square, a circle, a single row, or a single column.
The lasso icon is useful for selecting parts of your image with well-defined edges. Well defined edges mean a strong difference in lighting, color, or hue.
The brush icon is the quick selection tool. This is arguably the most useful tool in Photoshop. It allows you to make relatively accurate outlines of objects with well-defined edges. "Paint" inside an object in order to select it using this tool.
 Do this by using the move tool or copy the selection using Ctrl+c or âŒ˜ Command+c. You can move the image around using the tool with the cursor icon. If copied, you can move the image by pasting it in a different section of the image.


Once the image is moved, there will be a blank space in the image. Since you are moving the pixels from one area to another, there will no longer be any pixels in the original place of the image.
 A common way to fill in the space is to try to simulate what was behind the selected area in the original image. For example, if you selected a person standing in front of a wall, you could try to continue the wall design in the blank space.


One way to do this is by using the Clone Stamp Tool. This is the stamp icon in your tool bar. It will copy a section of an image and paste it wherever you click.

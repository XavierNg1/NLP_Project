 Do not approach the dog from the front, which could be interpreted as a threat. Instead, sidle up to the dog, mimicking animal behavior. Dogs feel more comfortable and understood with this sort of careful approach., To avoid looking confrontational, get down to the dogâ€™s level and face the same direction as them. Be sure to kneel in an upward position as opposed to leaning over the dog, which will be seen as a threatening move on your part. Stay in this position for a few moments and let the dog get comfortable with having you in its space., To allow the dog to feel safe, wait for it to approach you. Stay kneeling and avoid eye contact, which can be seen as a threat by dogs. Allow the dog to sniff you until it feels more comfortable near you., If the dog seems comfortable with you after a few minutes of sniffing you (i.e. if it wags its tail and seems at ease) offer it your closed hand to sniff. While a closed fist might seem aggressive, it is actually less threatening to a dog than your open hand, which is larger and more imposing. Hold your hand near its snout and stay calm and still., Once the dog seems comfortable with you, gently pet its chest. Avoid petting the dog from above its head; this will likely be seen as a threatening gesture and may result in an aggressive reaction. Be soft and gentle while petting, and continue to avoid direct eye contact.

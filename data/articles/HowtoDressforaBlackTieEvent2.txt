 A tuxedo is usually made of black wool, and includes, first, a jacket and matching pants. The jacket can be single or double-breasted, but the most traditional style is single-breasted with only one button.The pockets on the jacket should not have flaps over them.
The pants should match the color and material of the jacket, should not have cuffs, and should have a stripe on the outside that matches the lapel of the jacket.
You might be able to wear a dark blue tuxedo instead of black. White tuxedos are also considered formal, but are more common for daytime events., In addition to your tuxedo jacket and pants, you will need a white shirt and a waist covering.Traditional waist coverings call for a cummerbund or low waistcoat. However, vests are becoming more popular in less formal settings.
 If you do not own a tuxedo, you can rent one from a wedding or prom shop. Many shops offer tuxedos for reasonable rates. The shop employees will also be able to guide you towards the appropriate level of formality for the event.
 Official black tie events call for black bow ties.If the event was billed as black tie optional, preferred, or creative, you may be able to get away with another color bow tie, but traditionally you’ll still be limited to white or a solid color, like red. Alternately, you may be allowed to wear a bowtie color that matches your date’s dress.
 Your shoes should have been shined recently, and they should not appear to be dirty or scuffed. You may need to rent shoes if you do not have appropriate shoes.
 Fortunately, many black tie events take place at night and in the winter. You will likely be comfortable in your attire with no overcoat.


If you do need a coat, a dark dressy coat such as a chesterfield coat is appropriate, and a white dress scarf is traditional.In warm weather, be prepared by choosing a lighter fabric tuxedo if possible and carrying a handkerchief to discreetly remove sweat if necessary.

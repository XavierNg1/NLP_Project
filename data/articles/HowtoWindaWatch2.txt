 Sometimes manual movement watches can last up to five days with one wind. This doesn’t mean your watch operates on automatic movement. Check the packaging details or research the serial code online to find out more info. You can always wait to see how long your watch lasts from one wind.


If it is an automatic movement watch, the watch will operate for a long time. The automatic movement will lose wind if it is not worn regularly., Take the watch off your wrist to properly set the wind. It is important that you be cautious when handling the stem of the watch. The stem is connected to several important mechanisms inside your watch that you don't want to break.









Fiddling with the stem of your watch while it's attached to your arm could bend or damage it.
 Automatic movement is similar to a manual movement watch, except that it is powered by a rotor which maintains the watches energy. The crown should also set the time, date, or other function on your watch. Like a manual movement watch, you’ll need to pull the crown out to expose the stem.









A good way to test what each level of the stem does is to test each one. The level that winds the watch shouldn’t appear differently on the outside.
 Once you’ve determined which level of the stem affects the wind, you’re ready to set your watch. Twist the crown clockwise until you feel resistance. It’s important not to go past the point of resistance on your stem.








You can break mechanical bits in your watch if you twist too far. Go to a watch specialist if you’ve twisted the stem too far.
 Once you’ve wound the watch, you can set the time and other functions. Check the face of your watch to be certain which components you’re affecting. Use a digital watch to set an accurate time and date.

 When you find the heat capacity of one unit of something (1 gram, 1 ounce, 1 kilogram, etc), you've found this object's specific heat. Specific heat tells you the amount of energy needed to raise each unit one degree. For example, it takes .417 Joules to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. So, water's specific heat is .417 J/C per gram.


The specific heat of a material is constant. That means that all pure water has the same specific heat-- .417 J/C.
 Finding it is easy, simply divide your final answer by the mass of the object. This tells you how much energy was need for each bit of the object, like how many joules changes the temperature in just one gram of ice.


Example: "I have 100 grams of ice. It takes 406 Joules to raise the temperature of ice 2 degree Celsius-- what is the specific heat of ice?"'
Heat Capacity for 100g Ice = 406J / 2C
Heat Capacity for 100g Ice = 203 J/C
Heat Capacity for 1g Ice = 2.03 J/C per gram
If you are confused, think of it this way -- it takes 2.03 Joules to raise every single gram of ice one degree. So, if we have 100 grams of ice we need 100 times as many Joules to heat it all.
 A material's specific heat is tells you how much energy is needed to raise one unit (usually 1 gram) a single degree. To find the heat needed to raise any object to any temperature, we simply multiply all of the parts together. Energy Needed = Mass x Specific Heat x Temperature Change. The answer is always in your unit of energy such as Joules.


Example:" If the specific heat of aluminum is .902 Joules per gram, how many Joules does it take to raise 5 grams of aluminum 2 degrees Celsius?
Energy Needed = 5g x .902J/C x 2C
Energy Needed = 9.2 J

, To help practice, learn the common specific heats that you might see on a test or encounter in real life. What can you learn from them? Notice, for example, that the specific heat of metals is much lower than wood -- this is why a metal spoon heats up quicker than wood if left in a hot cup of chocolate. Lower specific heats mean an object gets hot faster.


Water: 4.179 J/C
Air: 1.01 J/C
Wood: 1.76
Aluminum: .902 J/C
Gold: .129 J/C
Iron: .450

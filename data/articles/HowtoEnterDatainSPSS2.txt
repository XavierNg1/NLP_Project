 When you import your data from an Excel file, you will be automatically creating variables based on the first row of the spreadsheet. The values of this row will become the variable names. You can also choose to enter your variables manually.


Click File → Open → Data...
Select the .xls format for the "Files of type"
Browse for and open the Excel file.
Check the "Read variable names from the first row of the data" box if you want the variable names to be created automatically.
 This is a plain text file format (.csv) with each entry being separated by a comma. You can set the variables to be created automatically based on the first line of the .csv file.


Click File → Read Text Data...
Select "All Files (*.*)" for the "Files of type"
Browse for and open the .csv file
Follow the prompts to import the file. Make sure that you tell SPSS that the variable names are at the top of the file when asked, and that the first case is on line 2.

Plastic (polyester) balls are often cheaper. These balls are perfectly acceptable for beginning or casual bowlers. This was the first type of coverstock introduced. The balls are easily handled but do not have much potential for spins or hooks.
Urethane balls have a better spin and more hook potential than polyester balls. They are still reasonably priced. However, they are more expensive than the plastic covered balls.
Reactive resin balls offer more control when it comes to spins and hooks. They are not as durable as urethane and plastic balls, but are better when it comes to power for strikes.
Particle coverstock bowling balls give you the most friction and reaction than any other coverstock. These balls are great for tournament bowlers who work with high-speed balls.



Bowling ball sizes range from 6 (2.72kg) to 16 (7.26kg) pounds.






Pro bowlers often use a ball that is just under 10 percent of their body weight.
Try different size balls until you find the right size. Begin with a smaller size and go up a pound until you find the highest weight can handle.



Your fingers should fit properly and comfortably in the holes.






It is recommended that you have your bowling ball holes custom drilled in order to acquire a perfect fit.

 Philosophers have disagreed for millenia of God's existence so it is unlikely to find proof on the internet.;
, GodlessGeeks.com/InternetInfidels goes through many of the proofs in a satirical article entitled Hundreds of Proofs of Godâ€™s Existence.


Cosmological argument aka First Cause argument. The universe must have a cause so God exists.
Miracles argument. A miracle happened so God exists.
Moral argument. A specific atheist was morally inferior therefore God exists.
Biblical argument. Quote biblical passage therefore God exists.
Intelligence argument. You wouldn't understand even I tried to explain to you, therefore God exists.
Fallibility argument. Human reasoning is fallible, therefore there is no reasonable way to challenge a proposition so if I propose God exists then God exists.
 Explain that simpler explanations of the universe are preferable. Richard Dawkins explains this in The God Delusion.
 Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion asks, "would you commit murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no God existed?".


Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss.
,,, There are many problems with omnipotence, omnibenevolence, omniscience and omnipresence.
 Understand the theory of Russell's teapot. Bertrand Russell posited there is a tiny teapot orbiting the sun to demonstrate the burden of proof is with the theist not the atheist. And one last thing: if God existed, we would be in a much better place by now.

 The diagram shows you an example.
 You should now have an integer and an infinite number of square roots that come after it.
  This should be true, since x{\displaystyle x} itself represents the infinite square root. You can prove this by looking at step 1.
 By doing so, you are forming a quadratic equation.
 The positive solution is the value of the nested square root. The negative solution is considered to be extraneous.

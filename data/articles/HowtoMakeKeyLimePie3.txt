 This takes a bit of arm muscle and perseverance -- keep at it if it doesn't happen as quickly as you think it will.
 Be careful not to get too aggressive. Overworking the meringue makes it lose its body, too.
 Take care to spread to the edge of the crust to prevent shrinkage during baking. Creatively swoop your spatula around to create peaks and valleys.
 It should be set but still wiggle a bit when shaken if done. Let cool before serving -- it'll be easier to slice the pie and create cleaner cuts if the pan isn't warm.

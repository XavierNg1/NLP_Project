 As quickly as possible, remove the sauce from the surface of the fabric without pushing it further in. You can use a paper towel or a rag to remove the excess sauce.
 Run the water on the back of the stain. You want to push the stain out of the clothing. Do not run water on top of the stain because you don’t want to push the stain deeper in. 







, Because tomato sauce has oil in it, dish soap like Dawn or Palmolive will work to remove the stain. Rub enough dish soap on the stain to cover it completely and rub in circular motions from the inside of the stain out.








If your material is dry clean only, do not do this step. Take your fabric to your local dry cleaners and show them the stain, and let them remove it.
Apply dish soap to a small hidden section of the fabric to make sure it doesn’t harm the fabric. If the fabric is harmed by the soap, you can use your regular laundry detergent in place of the dish soap.
 Rinse from the back of the fabric pushing the stain out.
 Using a sponge or absorbent material like a paper towel, blot the stain out with cold water to lift the stain. If you have a white fabric, you can apply a mild bleach, white vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide with your sponge to bleach the stain. 







, Hold the stain to light and see if it is still there. If the stain still remains, use a stain removing stick, gel, or spray on the stain. While the shirt is still wet, apply the stain remover and let it set for at least 5 minutes, and then wash it again. 







, Put the fabric in the sun, stain side up, and let the fabric dry completely. The UV rays should help break down any of the remaining stain.

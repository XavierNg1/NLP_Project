 Filling out your FASFA every year is the first step for obtaining financial aid. You can complete the FAFSA online or download a printable version. After completing the FAFSA, you will receive a report describing what types of federal financial aid are available to you. You may then accept or reject each loan or grant offer individually.
 Once you are accepted at a school, you will receive an acceptance letter in the mail and possibly via e-mail. Follow any instructions included in the letter or any informational packet.

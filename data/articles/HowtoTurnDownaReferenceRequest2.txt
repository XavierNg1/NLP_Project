 People tend to apologize excessively when they feel uncomfortable. Apologizing once is acceptable, but saying you are sorry again and again does not help the person. It only makes the situation more awkward.Remember you are not doing anything wrong.
 If you feel comfortable doing so, you can suggest that the person ask someone else. Recommending someone else works best if you are turning down the request because you don’t know the person well enough. This also helps to make it clear that your decision is final.You might say, “Try asking Jill. She’s worked with you for much longer than I have.”
If you can’t recommend the person based on his or her performance, try suggesting alternatives. Turn down the request and follow up with “Perhaps Amy might be able to help.”

, Once you have turned someone down for a reference, do not reconsider just because the person begs, argues, or otherwise attempts to change your mind. If you give in, you’ll only wind up in a trickier situation: providing a difficult reference that compromises your integrity. Stay strong!

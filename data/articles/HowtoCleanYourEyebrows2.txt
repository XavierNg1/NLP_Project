 Your eyebrows usually do not need more than a basic wash every now and then. But if you notice your eyebrows feel grimy or oily to the touch, you can do a deep clean of them with tea tree oil. Apply a small drop of tea tree oil on a disposable mascara wand or an eyebrow brush. Then, run the wand through your eyebrows in small circles.








Wash the oil off with warm water and pat your eyebrows dry.
Do not deep clean your eyebrows every day as this can cause product to build up, leading to irritation and ingrown hairs. Try deep cleaning your eyebrows once every few months or whenever they appear oily or dirty.
 Coconut oil is a great natural oil for cleaning your eyebrows and encouraging good eyebrow hair growth. Simply apply a small dab of coconut oil on a cotton pad. Then, run it through one eyebrow. Use a clean pad with a dab of coconut oil for the other eyebrow.








If you tend to use an eyebrow pencil or other products on your eyebrows, coconut oil is also a great way to clean off any makeup on your brows.
 Professional eyebrow serums are formulated to remove oil and encourage hair growth. You can find them online or at your local drugstore. Follow the application instructions on the label.








Make sure you do a spot test of the eyebrow serum on a patch of skin, such as behind your ear or on the inside of your wrist. Doing a spot test before you apply the product to your eyebrows will ensure you do not react badly to the product.

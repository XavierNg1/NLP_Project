 If you have a legitimate complaint against the carrier, and you’ve had no success dealing with the various levels of customer service, you can always take your gripe online. Obviously, the more Facebook or Twitter followers you have, the better. And don’t hesitate to encourage your readers to re-post what you’ve written.
 Mention the carrier in the hashtag to your posts. You want to make sure that the carrier is specifically referenced, so that other dissatisfied customers of the company can find your posts more easily.
 If you find that your posts are getting a lot of views, you might want to consider contacting your carrier’s customer service department again, to let them know of the success of your campaign. They’d really prefer not to have their company’s public relations crisis management team get involved in the dispute if at all possible. That might be enough for them to let you go without a fight.

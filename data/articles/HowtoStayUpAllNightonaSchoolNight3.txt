 If you aren't supposed to be awake—say, if your parents won't let you stay up all night—you'll need to keep your activities quiet, keep the lights low, and be prepared to pretend like you're sleeping. Always have a plan for what to do if an adult comes to check on you.


If you hear a sound, turn the lights off. Stop moving, and don't make a sound.
Be careful not to rustle your packets of sweets/candy. It will sound suspicious and your parents (or your friend's parents) may come in to check on you.
 If your parents/guardians are home, it's best to wait till they're asleep. Until then, stay away from whichever room they're sleeping in. When they're finally asleep, you may move about more freely, but still be wary of making noise near your parents' room.
 If you do happen to be caught sneaking about past your bedtime, you need to have a good excuse on hand. Try to keep it simple. Consider these excuses:


"I was just going to the bathroom. I'm on my way back to my room right now."
"I couldn't sleep, so I was getting a snack to help me sleep."
"I thought I heard something moving around outside my window."

 People will put you down at first, but never take them to heart. If you're unfortunate enough to meet a cocky guitarist who thinks they are better than you, then you can use this to your advantage and practice that extra bit harder and prove to them you're worth their respect.;
, Even if you only know one chord. The whole point is to start somewhere. You can't expect to be Gus. G in a week, but you can in the long run. Every time you learn something new (Harmonics, hammer on, vibrato, etc.) take it in your stride, you are an extra step towards your goal.
 It's even better if you have a few friends to do it with. If you get into the group environment early, you'll feel more confident performing around people. This also helps with your timing in group. But don't fret if you don't have a group, practicing solo can let you concentrate on one subject at a time.
 You decide what you learn and how you learn. There's never a wrong way to play guitar!

 Freaking out is a sign of weakness, showing that you cannot handle the pressure of being involved in an accusation. Practice techniques with them, like breathing and thinking before they begin.
 If they're going to be leaders, they can't drop issues and walk away. Guide them in practicing social problem solving through role play and examples. A leader needs to tell the person assertively how they feel without being completely and straight-out rude. It shows that they can be in control of what's happening, and take the other person's valid impressions and feelings into account, too.
 Teach your students, that, if somebody is (per say) refusing to speak with them for any reason whatsoever, they can be silent as well. This can turn the tables on the situation and result in more compromise and communication.

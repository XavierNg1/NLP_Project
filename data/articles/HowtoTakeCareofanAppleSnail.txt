 Before getting your snail, make sure you have the right setup.


The optimal temperature is between 64-84°F (18-29°c).
PH should be between 7-8.;
, It's good to have an aquarium of at least 5 gallons, but if you have a good filter and do regular water changes, you can fit as many as 1 snail per gallon.
 Make sure your fish (if any) cannot fit the snail in its mouth, or it will eat it.
 Put your snails in a bag (if there not in one already) and float it on the top of the tank for a few minutes.
, Your snails may become inactive from the stress of moving, but once they get used to it they will come out.
 Remember they are omnivores. They eat both plant and animal


They eat any type of wafer or pellets and veggies, such as zucchini, cucumber, spinach, or romaine lettuce.
They can eat floating foods.
 Remember that a male and a female are needed to lay eggs.


Females may lay fertile and un-fertile eggs. They lay 100 - 500 eggs per clutch, though there is a high mortality rate.
The eggs will drown.
Baby snails eat the same and have the same requirements. The most important thing is keep the lid on the tank.
 Your snail will not float if it's dead; however snails do it to travel, or for fun. When your snail is dead, you will get a funky smell  and he will not move.

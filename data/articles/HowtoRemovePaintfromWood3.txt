 Wear safety goggles and a face mask to protect yourself from paint and wood dust as you sand, regardless of the sanding method you use.
 When removing paint from a crack or crevice or stripping it from a small, delicate wooden object, you should sand the paint off by hand.


Mechanical sanders use considerable force and can damage delicate pieces. Moreover, they can be difficult to use on small, confined spaces.
Use coarse, open-coat sandpaper since other types may clog with paint and wood dust too quickly.
Sand with the grain of the wood instead of against it.
Decrease to a medium grit paper once you can see the grain of the wood peeking through the paint.
Decrease to a fine grit when small bits of paint are all that remain.
 For larger areas of painted wood, including large pieces of wood furniture, large wooden chests, or wood trim, rely on a mechanical sander to save time.


Choose between a mechanical hand sander and a power sander. A hand sander will be a little gentler and makes a good option if you want to preserve more of the wood beneath the paint. A power sander will finish the job faster, though, making it a good choice for especially large projects.
Belt, disk, and drum sanders are all good options worth considering when picking a power sander.
Use coarse, open-coat sandpaper on your mechanical sander since less coarse options tend to clog up with paint and wood dust too easily.
Always sand with the grain of the wood rather than against it to minimize the amount of damage to the wood.
Switch to a fine grain sandpaper, if desired, once the majority of the paint has been sanded off and only a few small specks remain.

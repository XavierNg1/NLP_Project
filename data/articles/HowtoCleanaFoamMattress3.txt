 You should take steps to dry out your mattress right away. If it is a sunny day and it isnâ€™t too hard to take the mattress out to the porch or backyard, you could let it dry out in the sun. Once the spill is dried up, you can address any stains with appropriate cleaning agents, such as baking soda., If you get a foam mattress wet, you should use a clean rag or an absorbent towel to dab the stain. Press down on the wet area with the clean rag or towel. Adjust the rag or towel so that you have a dry part to use and then repeat the dabbing motion.You should avoid scrubbing the stain with a circular or aggressive motion, since this approach could cause the stain to set.
You may need to use many rags or towels, depending on the size of the stain.
 Station a fan in front of the foam mattress. Put the fan on high and direct it towards the part of the mattress where the spill occurred., After removing as much of the stain as possible, you should leave the mattress to dry out for a few hours. Avoid putting any bedding on the mattress until it is completely dry.If there is a window in the room, you could open it up to improve air circulation and speed up the drying time.

 If your friends know that you have feelings for a certain girl, its possible that they will tell their friends, then their friends will tell their friends and so on. At some point, this knowledge will reach the very ears it was never meant to -- those of the girl you like.
 Write down all the thoughts and ideas you have about the girl you like in the diary. Write down the things you’d like to say to her but aren’t ready to yet.


Do not express your feelings on social media like Twitter or Facebook. Even if you’re vague, it’s possible that someone could piece together what and who you’re talking about, and your cover would be blown.
 The more you focus elsewhere, the less you’ll be focused on her. Your new hobbies will give you a needed distraction, and help you hide your feelings. Find something that you enjoy and that engages your attention and energy in positive ways.


Developing a skill will help you build confidence. If you feel uncomfortable revealing your feelings to a girl you like because you doubt your ability to woo her, gaining confidence by learning new abilities can potentially solve your problem.
 If you’re not around her, there’s no way to reveal your feelings. You’ll never be faced with a situation in which you inadvertently admit to your affection for her, or in which you just become so frustrated by not admitting how you feel that you spill the beans. Further, you'll never have nosy friends picking up on your potentially unusual behavior when you're in the presence of your crush. Spend time with family and friends instead of her.


Avoidance includes online interaction and texting. Do not browse her social media profiles or text her as an alternative to spending time with/around her.

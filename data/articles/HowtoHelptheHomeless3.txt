 Mental health problems can be both a cause and an effect of homelessness. One of the best ways to make a difference for homeless people is to encourage and support access to free or low-cost mental health services. Support local mental health clinics and write to politicians about their importance., Another problem that exacerbates homelessness in many cities is the lack of affordable housing. Support ballot initiatives for affordable housing and write to local housing organizations to help them understand the need. Speak out against new housing developments which are not affordable., Basic medical care is also a huge problem for homeless people. They are more prone to serious health problems but are stuck in a position where they cannot afford help. Support local free or low-cost clinics, and work on getting more free clinics in your city., Day shelters are another service which can help homeless people get back on their feet. These shelters give homeless people a safe place to stay and store their things. Day shelters are uncommon, so if your city doesn't have one, talk to your local city councilors or mayor about establishing one., Local libraries are a huge resource for homeless people. They make job searching tools, such as the internet, free and available for the homeless. They are also a source of important information, and often host programs that can help people learn the skills necessary to get a job., In many places, being homeless can get you arrested. When homeless people are arrested, it makes it even harder for them to get back on their feet. To help the homeless, vote against measures that criminalize homelessness, and against politicians that support such measures.

 If you send 100 texts to someone who has to pay by the text, they will get angry when they see their phone bill.It won't take long for it to get back to you, and then you'll be in trouble. You may have to pay off the extra charges yourself.;
, You don't want to text bomb someone who is too sensitive or might actually get angry. Choose someone that you can joke around with and who might get annoyed, but will ultimately think it's funny or forgive you quickly.
 It will be easy to trace the messages back to you and there could be some very serious consequences. A victim of text bombing could claim harassment and you could have to go to civil court.

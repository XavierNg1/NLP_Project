 If you cooked bacon, ham or sausage, place 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat in a skillet. You could also use vegetable oil. Heat the fat or oil over medium-high heat and add 1 diced onion. Cook the onion until it's soft (about 4 minutes). You should also turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C).Avoid overcooking the onion. It will continue to cook as you add the remaining vegetables.;
, Slice 1 cup (110 g) of mushrooms and dice 1 whole tomato. Add the vegetables to the skillet with the onion and cook them for 2 minutes on medium-high heat. Stir in 3 cups (675 g) of baby spinach and continue to cook the vegetables for another minute (until it wilts). Stir in these seasonings:Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder

, Wash 4 bell peppers of any color and carefully cut them in half through the stem. Cut away and discard the stems. Remove the seeds. You may need to wash the peppers again to completely wash away the seeds.Try to choose peppers that are the same size even if they are different colors. This will ensure that they cook evenly.
 Scoop the vegetable filling into each of the bell pepper halves. You should beat 8 eggs in a small bowl and pour a little of the beaten eggs on top of each filled pepper half. If you want to add cooked bacon, ham or sausage, sprinkle the meat on top of the egg. Set the filled peppers on a baking sheet and bake them for 40 minutes.If you're making these to serve to guests, consider making some with meat and some without so people have a vegetarian option. If making vegetarian ones, remember to use vegetable oil instead of the cooking fat when you saute the vegetables.

 Fire a round at your target; now, slowly release the trigger until you hear a click, and resistance on the trigger is lessened. At this point you can pull the trigger again. This not only allows you to be more accurate while doing single-shots (due to the shorter trigger pull), but when you get your finger used to the motion, it is the best way to shoot the gun quickly., You have to release the trigger completely before it can be pulled again. SA and DA/SA will be easiest for this drill, as they will have lighter trigger pulls than their DA (or DAO) counterparts., The faster you can pull the trigger, the more options it leaves for you., As the slide moves forward, the rest of the gun (frame, barrel, etc.) rises (this is called muzzle flip), as soon as the slide is back in battery (full-forward), the gun can fire again. But, the gun is ready to fire before it has gone back to its resting position in your hands., If you wait too long, the gun will actually bounce below the original position, and firing during that stage will cause the bullet to land low. You can either wait a bit longer (but that removes the word "rapid" from this drill), or, you can time the firing to when the gun is falling past the rest position.

You can also increase the cycle speed of the gun in your hands by getting a tighter/firmer grip on the gun (this will be too firm for accurate single-shot shooting). If you do this, timing is more important, but it allows you to shoot faster.
Note that each gun, and each caliber, will have totally different cycle times. Therefore, practice with a few handguns, to round out your skills. If you get the timing wrong, you will find that hitting a target consistently, even at 5 yards (4.6Â m), can become difficult.
If your bullets are hitting high after the first shot, try shooting a bit more slowly. Or, try tightening your grip on the gun. If you are shooting low, either shoot faster or loosen your grip on the gun.
 Once you are able to do that, or get close to that, you can add other drills: that is, setup two or more targets. Fire four or five rounds at one target, then turn to the next target and so on. This combines one of the earlier-mentioned shooting drills and the rapid fire drill.

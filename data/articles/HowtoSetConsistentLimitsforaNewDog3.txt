 To help reinforce the limits you have set, make sure your dog is supervised at all times during the first few weeks it is in your home. This helps you correct any behavior that you see and doesn’t let your dog get away with things when you’re not looking.When you are not around your dog, place it in a crate. This helps control your dog’s movements.
 The most important thing about setting limits for your new dog is to be consistent. This means you can’t let the dog get away with things sometimes and punish it for the same thing later. Dogs need to understand what is expected of them. If you set limits, make sure to follow through each time.For example, if you don’t want your dog on the couch or to eat from the table, don’t let it do that sometimes, but then get mad when the dog tries the same action later.
Make sure you don't give in to whining, begging, barking, or sad eyes. You must stay consistent no matter what your dog does to get you to give in.
Don’t give it a "treat” by lessening the limits. This confuses the dog.
 When correcting unwanted behavior, you should reprimand your dog in a firm voice. However, you should not treat your dog in an angry or frustrated manner. This could frighten the dog, which does not lead to a good relationship filled with respect.When the dog does something unwanted, in a firm voice say, “No!” Don’t yell or scream at the dog.
Refrain from hitting the dog or any other kind of physical violence as punishment.
 The way to enforce the limits you have set is to let your dog know when it has done what you wanted. Whenever it corrects the behavior after you tell it “No,” praise the dog somehow. You may pet it, give it verbal praise in a happy tone of voice, or give it a treat.For example, if the dog gets on the couch, you may tell it “No.” When the dog gets down, praise it for the correct behavior.

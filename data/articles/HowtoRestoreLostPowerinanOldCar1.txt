 As cars get older, lots of dirty deposits build up along the fuel lines making it harder for fuel to get to the engine. Adding a fuel cleaning additive to your car (as stated in the instructions on the bottle) will help clean these deposits out.;
, It will take a little bit of time for the fuel cleaning additive to mix with the fuel and to reach the engine.


If the car runs worse than before, change the fuel filter. This is because the deposits that the cleaner has removed from the fuel tank has clogged up the fuel filter.

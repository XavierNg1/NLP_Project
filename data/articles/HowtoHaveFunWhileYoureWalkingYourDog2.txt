 If you usually meander with your dog, that's a decent workout. However, to make it more effective, try moving a bit faster. You should start breathing a bit heavier, but not so heavy that you can't talk while you're walking. You should feel a bit warmer, but there's no need to get extra sweaty.Before starting a more strenuous program with your dog, make sure your dog is healthy enough for it. Talk to your vet about your dog's capabilities.
 If just walking bores you, consider running with your dog. Not every dog will be up to it (especially elderly dogs), but if you can get your dog in the habit of running with you, it can be fun for both of you. Plus, your dog will hold you accountable better than any other running partner.Make sure you're dog can handle running by consulting your vet.
 Another option to workout with your dog is to rollerblade. You'll be able to go faster, which your dog will enjoy. Plus, you may find it more interesting than just walking, because you'll be more fully engaged in working out. However, your dog needs to be well-trained on a leash if you are going to rollerblade with it., Your dog will love having time to play fetch, and you can use the time to workout, too. Try throwing the ball, then performing some exercise moves while your dog fetches a ball or frisbee. For example, you could try lunges, squats, or jumping jacks. Challenge yourself to see how many you can fit in before your dog returns with the ball or frisbee.

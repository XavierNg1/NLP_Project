 If you do not have one, you can ask your mom whether you may go over to your buddies house (that is in your class) and maybe play a studying game, but be sure to get the needed studying done.
 Everyone learns differently, and for some, talking out loud helps cement ideas into your head. Discuss sample test questions or homework problems with each other.
 Take turns asking each other questions, or quizzing each other on vocab words.
 Set the timer and see who can finish filling in their worksheet/writing their notes the fastest. The slowest person loses. However this method might not be the best method as it isn't always fair - some people would rather take their time.
 For example the first person to leave without finishing their assignment isn't allowed to go to the upcoming school formal.
 Pretend you're a character from TV or Broadway etc - or make up your own character. Physically turn your notes into a script and memorize your 'lines' by talking it out loud, over and over again. Then when you memorize the entire script, talk out loud as you would if you were your chosen character. You could even use funny accents if you like, you could even sing it Broadway-style. If you're really confident, you can perform the skit in front of friends, teachers, parents etc...and make them laugh! It helps if you are a tactile learner (you learn by touching) or a verbal learner (you learn by talking). It seems a bit crazy at first but when you think about it, it actually works, especially if you do it with a friend. By looking at it this way, it doesn't seem like boring study at all!

, Do something fun, such as watch TV or play video games or a board game.

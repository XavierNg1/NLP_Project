 You want your iron on and set to the highest setting. Run a face cloth or hand towel under water until it is damp, but not soaked.;
, You can either pin each side of your pants to the ironing board—stretched to the desired length. Or, you can simply slide the pants around the ironing board until they are the proper width.
 Make sure it completely covers the elastic that you’re trying to stretch out. If needed, use two cloths.
 With the damp cloth on top of your elastic band and your iron on the highest setting, iron over it. Iron for 10 seconds and then let sit for 10 seconds. Continue doing so for 5-10 minutes. This will help your pants fit because as the elastic heats, it will heightens the breaking weight. This means that it will be able to stretch more before reaching its limit., If it hasn’t’ stretch enough, try flipping your elastic band and repeat the process. Do so until you reach your desired fit.

 You probably know this, but if not, then understanding this is pretty easy in some situations. You might consider saying:


"You can come with me." -- or "I will go with you.";
, Both of these phrases refer to a person changing between locations.
 Directed to/toward the speaker's location.


"Come in first. Please, come here. Come inside the house, please -- and then we discuss what to do next.", while calling someone "to/toward" the speaker.

Thus, if the direction will be to or towards the speaker then the speaker should use "come".
 not toward the speaker. For example you can say:


"You could go over there." or "I could go to their house. Should I go pick them up or will you?", when calling a friend about a visit you both have planned and to possibly go to a third person's house to get him or her.

The direction is someplace other than either speaker's locations so use the work "go."


"Do you think we should go from there to their house to eat or not? Either way we can go to their house. But, we can eat before we go, or when we go to our homes."

The current location spoken of is neither the speaker's nor the listener's present location, use "go".
 If you do this you will find it easier each subsequent time, example:


"I'll come..." "I'll go to their house."
If you are interested in correct usage, then plan the wording a little as you speak (or before).
, Keep thinking about using these words and practicing. It will take time to change your common usage habits; so don't be impatient with yourself if you regress or seem slow to change.



When the speaker is outside and the listener is inside, ask: "May I come into your house to the bathroom?" -- to come toward the listener.
When both of you are outside, ask: "May I go inside your house to the bathroom?" -- going away from him/her.

 This will make a specific object easy to find.;
, This drainage level will prevent plants from "drowning" and will help regulate humidity in the terrarium.
 These substrates keep the terrarium humid and provide soft bedding in case the frog falls off a perch. They also help to avoid impaction (clogging of throat or stomach because of substrate swallowing) when these frogs are hunting. These frogs are lunge attackers and often get a mouthful of substrate with their prey.
 The corners of the back wall provide perfect places for these water bowls.
 You can also just set the dish on the substrate. They will find their way into the bowl. The opposite side as the water bowl is an ideal place to put this.
 These branches need to be strong enough to support White's Tree Frogs that can grow large and get heavy.


A hiding place will provide security to these shy frogs. Anything as simple as a Tupperware container can be used, but cork bark rounds make excellent naturalistic hides.
 A large Gasteria plant in the back with philodendron as ground cover is perfect for White's.


A fluorescent tube light provides bright light, but light is not necessary as these frogs are nocturnal, and a heat pad or heat emitters will provide heat. Heat is only necessary if your home temperature routinely drops below 78ยบ.

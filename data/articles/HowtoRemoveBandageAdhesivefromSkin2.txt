 Baby oil works using the same principles as cooking oils, either by dissolving the adhesive or releasing its grip upon skin. An added benefit is that most baby oils are made to be especially gentle, making this a great choice for delicate skin.


Most baby oils are simply mineral oil with a small amount of scent added. You can use pure mineral oil as an alternative to baby oil â€” often, it is slightly cheaper.
If you're removing adhesive from a child's skin, try adding a drop of food coloring to the baby oil and using it to "paint" the affected area. The oil will remove the adhesive and the coloring will provide a fun distraction., Since most lotions have an oil or lipid (fat) base, they can work for removing adhesive just like baby oil or cooking oils. Rub in a small amount of lotion, let it sit for several minutes, and rub with a gentle towel or cotton ball.


Unscented lotions are best. The chemicals used for added fragrances can sometimes cause pain and rashes on irritated skin., Since warmth loosens many of the adhesives used in bandages, you can use it to make these materials more effective. Warm water will wash off the oil or lotion, so use a warm compress instead. Our article on warm compresses details several easy ways to do this.


Try filling a tube sock most of the way with dry, uncooked rice. Tie a knot in the open end to keep the rice in. Microwave the compress in 30-second increments until it is warm, but not too hot to handle. Hold the compress over the adhesive as you let the oil or lotion soak in.
Place a rag between the compress and the skin if you are worried about getting the sock greasy.

 Before starting any new hairstyle, you should brush out all the tangles and make it malleable. Brush your hair back so that it is out of your face.
 This is a popular technique that allows people to keep their hairâ€™s personality while adapting their fringe easier. This is also easier than straightening your whole head., Figure out which side you want your part to be. Test a section of your bangs parted. Check your look in a mirror to confirm the look of the part. Now wedge a bobby pin near the bottom of the fringe together with the hair underneath it.

 This is of Course the easiest level out there. You only need to use Green, Yellow and Red in the level. This is highly recommended for first time/ new players who want to get used to the game. It is okay to fail you're first few songs. Almost everyone does.;
, Medium is more difficult than easy. In this level in addition to having to worry about red yellow and green, You must now use the blue button. Not too hard though. The speed of the game is a little faster, and there are a few more notes that easy. But you should be fine after a few tries. Not Recommended, but not impossible for first time players.
 This level is a lot more crazy that Easy and Medium. Hard introduces the orange button, witch makes you use every button at some point in every song. A pretty fast note speed, and there are even more notes to hit. With more notes to hit, the less mistakes you can make before you fail. Definitely not recommended for first time players, And would be very difficult for first timers to keep up with the pace on hard.
 The hardest of the levels. Absolutely crazy. There are no more buttons to be introduced in expert, But the notes move very fast. Also there are many notes that come so close to each other They look impossible to hit both. But it is possible. It will take you a while to get to Expert. And it feels like a long jump from Hard to expert but just keep trying. Pretty much impossible for first time players.

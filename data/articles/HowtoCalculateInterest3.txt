 As you saw in the previous example, compound interest grows faster than simple interest by adding the interest back to the principal at certain times. Compounding quarterly is more valuable than compounding annually. Compounding monthly is even more valuable than compounding quarterly. The most valuable situation would have the interest compounding continuously - that is, every instant. As quickly as interest can be calculated, it is returned to the account and adds to the principal. This is obviously only theoretical.Using some calculus, mathematicians have developed a formula that simulates interest that is compounded and added back to the account in a continuous stream. This formula, which is used to calculate continuously compounding interest, is:


A=Pert{\displaystyle A=Pe^{rt}}




, The formula for the continuously compounding interest looks similar to the early situations, with some slight differences. The variables for the formula are:A{\displaystyle A} is the future value (or Amount) of money that the loan will be worth after compounding the interest.


P{\displaystyle P} is the principal.


e{\displaystyle e}. Although this looks like a variable, it is actually a constant number. The letter e{\displaystyle e} is a special number called “Euler’s constant,” named for the mathematician Leonard  Euler who discovered its properties. 

Most advanced graphing calculators have a button for ex{\displaystyle e^{x}}. If you press this button, with the number 1, to represent e1{\displaystyle e^{1}}, you will learn that the value of e{\displaystyle e} is approximately 2.718.




r{\displaystyle r} is the interest rate per year.


t{\displaystyle t} is the term of the loan, measured in years.
 Banks typically use continuously compounding interest on home mortgage loans. Suppose you want to borrow $200,000 at a rate of 4.2% for a 30 year mortgage. The variables that you will use for the calculation are, therefore:P=200,000{\displaystyle P=200,000}


e{\displaystyle e}, again, is not a variable but is the constant 2.718.


r=0.042{\displaystyle r=0.042}


t=30{\displaystyle t=30}


, Apply the values to the formula to calculate the amount of interest that you will owe on the 30 year loan.A=Pert{\displaystyle A=Pe^{rt}}


A=200000∗2.718(0.042)(30){\displaystyle A=200000*2.718^{(0.042)(30)}}


A=200000∗2.7181.26{\displaystyle A=200000*2.718^{1.26}}


A=200000∗3.525{\displaystyle A=200000*3.525}


A=705000{\displaystyle A=705000}

Notice the enormous value of compounding interest continuously.

 This should include your phone number and email address. Include when you would prefer to be contacted and whether you'd prefer texts or calls by phone. Indicate if you'll reply faster by any method over another method, as this helps guide the potential buyer toward choosing the best method to reach you.

It’s a good idea to include your last name, though not necessary. #*Example: Joe Twig, 333-333-3333, joe@yahoo.com (I’ll respond to you quicker if you call me, but email is okay.)

 Before you get to properly repairing your jeans, you'll first need to cut the excess threads, or frayed edges caused by the tear. Take some scissors and try to cut reasonably close; you want to get rid of any protrusions, but you also don't want to lose any material you can otherwise save. , Provided you haven't lost much material, you can usually mend smaller rips without using any patches. First, turn your jeans inside out; that way, when you sew, the new seams won't be as visible. Take a sewing needle and thread, and stitch back and forth until the rip is mended. Try to make the stitches as close as possible.


If it's available, try to use thread that's the same as the seam as the rest of the jeans. In many cases, this will be a white or black thread. If the rip is in a conspicuous place far away from natural seams, it's recommended you choose a colour that best fits your jeans' regular colour (usually blue or black).
 Once you get the rip sewn up, you can proceed to cut the extra bits off. Be sure to cut the sewing thread as close to the jean material as you can. If there are any frayed edges you didn't catch the first time around, give them a cut now. , Now that you've made the repair, you'll want to seal the jeans with an iron press. This will smooth out any creases and give your pants a fresh feeling of newness.

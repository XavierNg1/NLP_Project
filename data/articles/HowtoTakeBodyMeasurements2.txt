 Measure the circumference around the thickest part of your upper arm, usually at the bicep.
 Measure the circumference around your chest at its widest point. For most men this will be at the armpits, for most women this will be at the nipple line.
 Measure the circumference around your natural waist and your lower waist (two separate measurements). The natural waist is the smallest point of your waist (unlike where clothes’ waistlines are located these days) and is usually an inch or two above your bellybutton. Your lower waist is the widest part of your waist, usually at the bellybutton or just below, where weight is generally gained first.
 Measure the circumference around your hips at the widest point. This will usually be roughly just above the crotch line.
 Measure the circumference around your upper thigh at its widest point. This is usually ½ to 3/4’s of the way up your thigh, from the knee.
 Measure the circumference around your calf at its widest point, usually roughly ¾ of the way up from the ankle.
 For weight monitoring, you may include your body weight as a body measurement. This measurement will need to be taken with a scale, either electronic or manual. You can find scales for sale at many stores, or for use at gyms and doctor’s offices.
 The easiest way to measure your height is to stand straight with no shoes on and place your back against a wall. Using a pencil, place the pencil flat against the top of your head with the writing end against the wall. Carefully mark your height against the wall. Step away and measure from the mark down to the floor using any measuring tape.
 You may wish to use the above measurements to calculate your body fat or BMI if you are intending to monitor your weight loss. Be aware that body fat calculations are frequently inaccurate or unreliable, though BMI is a fairly accurate way of measuring your weight (unless you are a fit athlete, in which case better not).

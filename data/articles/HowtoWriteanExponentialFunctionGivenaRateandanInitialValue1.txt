 Suppose a bank account is started with a $1,000 deposit and the interest rate is 3% compounded annually. Find an exponential equation modeling this function.;
, The form for an exponential equation is f(t)=P0(1+r)t/h where P0 is the initial value, t is the time variable, r is the rate and h is the number needed to ensure the units of t match up with the rate.
, Every year, the money increases by 3%, so every 12 months the money increases by 3%. Since you need to give t in months, you have to divide t by 12, so h=12. Your equation is f(t)=1,000(1.03)t/12. If the units are the same for the rate and the t increments, h is always 1.

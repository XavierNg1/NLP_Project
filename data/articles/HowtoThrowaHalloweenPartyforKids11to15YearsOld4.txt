 Have them wear creepy costumes and pose as decorations, then ambush the guests with ghastly acting in the walkway to your house, and inside the house.


Be careful not to scare the children too much; start scaring them on a mild scale and escalate as much as you feel you can get away with before the tears start.
 If the early guests are willing to scare people, jump out at them as they arrive.

 Of course, if you're going to be working on earning ribbons, you'll need to know what you have to do to get them. You can find this out easily enough by simply clicking on the ribbon icon at the bottom of your screen. This will bring up a window that will allow you to peruse the many different types of ribbons that are available and see what you have to do to earn each one.;
, For example, you can earn ribbons by harvesting a certain number of vegetable crops, and another by harvesting a certain number of fruit crops. Because you only have a limited amount of space to devote to your crops, it's best if you focus on one of these achievements first, and then shift to the other. Trying to split your resources between the two will only make it harder for you to accomplish both of them.
 For example, you can earn ribbons by spending money in the market, and you can also earn ribbons by owning a certain number of decorations. Since you have to spend money in the store to accumulate these decorations, you can work towards both of these ribbons simultaneously.
 For instance, if you know you're going after some ribbons that have to do with harvesting or planting crops, you should maximize the amount of space you devote to plowed land. Once you've taken care of these accomplishments, however, you can adjust your layout to reflect your new goals. You don't want to get rid of all of your plowed plots, however â€“ just make sure you have enough space set aside to pursue your new goals.

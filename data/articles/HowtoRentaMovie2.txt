 Network Media Players are like conduits that allow you to connect to the Internet and also interface with your television, allowing you to watch streaming video on the big screen. Roku and AppleTV are examples of these devices, but new video game consoles also come with the technology installed. Most of these devices are connected via Ethernet cables, or wirelessly. Each will involve a slightly different set up process, depending on the device. Examples of Network Media Players include:


Apple TV
X-Box 360 or higher
Playstation 3 or higher
Roku

, When you've installed your Network Media Player, use the remote that came with it to navigate to the streaming service to which you subscribe and log in. If you need to start one, you can also use the Network Player to do that, entering your billing information, or hooking it into a pre-existing account.
 Navigate around the options like usual, using your remote. It should work in almost exactly the same way, and should include the same basic content that your online account includes when you access it on your computer. If you watch half of a Netflix movie on your laptop, you can pick it up right where you left off on the TV.
 The classic way of renting movies is to rent pay-per-view directly from the cable provider, or purchase on-demand video options through your cable company. You can usually already see the movies available on your menu screen, select one to purchase, and tune in instantly, or when the allotted time arrives. This will be billed to your cable statement.

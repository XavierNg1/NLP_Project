 Once you are connected to the internet, you can use the "Wii Shop Channel" to download more channels for your Wii. These include the internet browser, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, and more.


Open the "Wii Shop Channel" and then click "Start." Select "Wii Channels" from the menu, and browse channels to download. Most are free, though some require external subscriptions to other services in order to function.
 You can use the "Internet Channel" in the "Channel" screen to open the Wiiâ€™s web browser. Use the Wiimote to navigate and enter characters.
 Many popular streaming services are available as channels for the Wii. As long as you are a subscriber, you can use the Wii to stream videos from these services. You can find them for download in the "Wii Shop Channel." Channels that you download will be added to your starting screen automatically.
 These channels are all available for free. However, starting June 28, 2013, several of these channels for the Wii will be discontinued.
 Several Wii games allow you to play with and against other players online. If you have a copy of the game and a working internet connection, you'll be able to play along too.


A "Friend Code" is generated for each Wii and Nintendo DS Wi-Fi compatible game. In order to add a friend to your "Friends Roster," you need to follow the steps outlined in the manual to the particular game you want to play, as each game is different.

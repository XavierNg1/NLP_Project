 Although duct tape is incredibly adhesive, it is still vulnerable to tears and breaks. If your hands are bound in front of you, raise them above your head, and then bring them down quickly against your abdomen, pulling your elbows apart at the same time.Unlike zip ties, breaking duct tape in this method is unlikely to cut your wrists.
 Since duct tape is not quite as sturdy as rope, it can be bent and torn more easily. Use this to your advantage. You may be able to chew through it, or use your teeth to tear the tape, and then pry the tape apart.If you can’t break the tape with your teeth, try to peel it away from your skin with your teeth or mouth. This will give your more space to wriggle out of the tape.
 Like any other type of tape, duct tape loses nearly all of its adhesive quality when it is wet. If you are near water bottles or a natural water source (even if there’s water on the floor or in a sink of the room where you’re tied), get to the water and moisten the tape.After a period of time, the tape will loosen and you’ll be able to pull your hands or feet out.


If you can lick or spit on the duct tape, even saliva from your mouth will help loosen the adhesion.

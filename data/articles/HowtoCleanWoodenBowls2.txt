 Every so often, your wooden bowls can use a deeper clean than soap and water. Pour some coarse (large grain) salt into the bowl. Cut a lemon in half, and rub the juicy pulp over the surface of the bowl. Briefly wash with hot water and mild dish soap after scrubbing.Lemon juice is commonly used as a disinfectant and the salt provides a slight abrasion to the bowl’s surface. A lime can be used, also, and regular table salt will have a similar effect.
Scrub the outside of the bowl, too.
 Mix three tablespoons (44.4 ml) of white vinegar into one cup (240 ml) of hot water. Dip a washcloth into the mixture and rub the entire surface of the bowls with the solution. Let the vinegar sit for five minutes, then follow the standard washing procedure afterward.Depending on how often you use the bowls, disinfect them after every five uses or so.
 If you have been using your bowls for years, they may develop stuck-on residue. Take fine-grit sandpaper and gently rub it with the grain of the wood. This will remove a thin layer of buildup. Sand a little bit out from the bad spot to blend it in with the rest of the bowl.You only need to sand the area that has a lot of buildup, not the entire bowl, but if the entire bowl has buildup, it’s okay to lightly sand the whole thing.
Remember, you only want to buff away the extra, non-wood layer that has developed. Don’t apply so much pressure that you start taking off wood.

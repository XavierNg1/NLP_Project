 You should not spend more than 25 percent of your total monthly income in mortgage payments. Make a substantial down payment and choose the 15-year mortgage. You will buy a more modest home than your lender will allow, but you will be able to afford to save money.
 No one will ever care more about your money than yourself. That said, read books like Early Retirement Extreme, Your Money or Your Life, and the Millionaire Next Door. Read blogs like Bogleheads, ZenHabits and Mr. Money Mustache.

 To prevent your cheese from overcooking, make sure the cheese is cold before placing it on the pizza. If not, the cheese might burn. Also, try not to use too much cheese. The proper amount of cheese for a thirteen inch pizza is four to six ounces., Oily or processed cheeses should be avoided. These include cheeses like Velveeta, cheddar, and pre-shredded cheese. For the best flavor and results, buy a block of cheese from the deli and shred it at home yourself., Hard cheeses like Parmesan, grana padano, and romano are very dry and delicate. If you put them on the pizza before it goes into the oven, they will burn and lose their flavor. Therefore, put these cheeses on the pizza only after it has come out of the oven., You can use a hand grater, rotary cheese grater, or a food processor with a shredding attachment to shred your cheese. Place soft cheeses in the freezer an hour before you begin grating it. This will make grating soft cheeses much easier.You can purchase a cheese grater from your local grocery or home goods store, or from a discount retailer like Target and Wal-Mart.

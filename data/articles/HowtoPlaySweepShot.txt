 As sweep shot is an advanced shot, you must be aware with the basics of batting. You must know how to face a bowler, how to defence etc.;
, You must know how to judge the bowler. A spinner can change the variations of his ball even at the last moment before delivery. You should be able to judge the spin and variations the ball will take after bouncing.
 Playing a Sweep Shot needs a lot of practice. It is hard to hit if you are a beginner.


Make sure to practice daily for as much as an hour. Remember, the more you practice; the better the shot is.
 Make sure not to be much on front foot as it may result in a stump out.
 Make sure not to overbend, so that you can return to the original position if you are unable to transmit

, This is the right time to judge the bounce and spin of the ball. Once you get an idea of the ball, you will be able to transmit the shot better.


It is possible that bowler had observed your footwork and would not allow you to play your shot. In such a situation, he would try to bowl short ball at a higher speed on which you would be beaten.
If you see such response from the bowler, immediately come on back foot by re-bending your knees to the original position and defense the ball.
, Timing is very essential for sweep shot. Make sure you time properly.

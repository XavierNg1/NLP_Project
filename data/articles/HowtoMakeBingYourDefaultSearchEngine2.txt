 Click the button with three horizontal bars on the upper right corner of the browser. This will bring down the main menu. Scroll down and click “Settings.” The Settings page will load in a new tab.


You can also go directly to this page by entering “chrome://settings/” on the address bar.
 You will see what the current default search engine being used by the address bar or omnibox is.
 This will open a small window listing the search engines you can use for the omnibox.


The first section of the small window is for the Default search engines. This contains the more popular search engines, namely Google, Yahoo, and Bing.
 Hover over Bing and click the “Make Default” button that will appear over it. It will say “Default” will appear beside its name.
 Bing is now your default search engine in Chrome.

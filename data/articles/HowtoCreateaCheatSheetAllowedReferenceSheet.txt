 Don't try to rely completely on "cheat sheets" as they will hinder you from actually remembering anything. Instead, revise everything first, as if you couldn't use a cheat sheet.;
, Some of these are: equations, diagrams, definitions, conversions, concepts and other hard-to-memorise facts. List them as dot points if need be.
 Ball point pens of 0.1mm are really good, but anything up to 0.5mm are fine.Â Finding small highlighters and different coloured pens can be useful, but is not necessary. Also find a pencil and a ruler, but these do not need to be so sharp.
 Since you will be writing small to fit in all the necessary information, you want to write as neat as possible so that you can read what you've got.
 Some people like to divide it into sub-topics, some people like to divide it into large concepts. Some people (I personally prefer this) like to divide every single bit of information.Box off the divisions with the pencil and ruler, or by different colour pens, highlighters or a mixture of all of the above. This comes as a personal preference.
 Re-do the whole thing on a new sheet of paper, this time eliminating things you think you can remember. If you are really desperate, you can write try a completely different method - see the tips.
 Share your notes with friends, who will have some facts that you forgot or missed out. Copy their notes into the small space you've left behind.
 Although they will be there for your exam, you really want to just memorise the whole thing off by heart. These sheets are supposed to guide you if you fall into panic!

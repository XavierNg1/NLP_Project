 Gather enough for each herb in your garden. If you do not have enough, go to a thrift store to procure inexpensive spoons.
 Allow them to dry completely.
 If you do not want to use magazine images, you can write on a small piece of paper about the size of the inside of a spoon. You can also use alphabet stamps and permanent ink on small pieces of paper.
 Place it in the location you desire on your spoon. Allow the glue to dry for 2 to 12 hours, depending upon the glue directions.
 Allow the first layer to dry and paint a second coat. Allow the second layer to dry according to package directions.

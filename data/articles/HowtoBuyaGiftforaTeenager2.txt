 Once you have determined a few of the teenâ€™s interests, and their personality and style, make a list of all the things they are interested in, as well as the things that define who they are. Spend at least two minutes writing down as many things as you can. Next, think of something to go with every item you wrote down. Pick one of the items, or combine a few.For example, if the teen loves watching movies, pay for a one-year Netflix or Hulu subscription. If they already have a subscription, then upgrade their account for a year.
 Another way to pick a great gift is to think about the types of things you were interested in as a teenager. Most teenagers are transitioning into new periods of their life where they enjoy more freedom and responsibility. Choose a gift that speaks to these newfound freedoms.A quality watch is a classic coming of age gift you can give to any teen.
A set of headphones or bluetooth speakers make great gifts for teens, as well. This way, they can take their music with them everywhere.
 There are many sites that list top gifts for teenagers, or have gift suggestions for teenagers. These lists are often based off of gifts that others are buying for teenagers, as well as contemporary teenage interests. Browse these sites to see if you can find an appropriate gift.Sites that offer great suggestions are Pinterest, GoodHousekeeping.com, GiftsforTeens.com, and Realsimple.com.
 By factoring in how much you are willing to spend, what is appropriate, what they might already have, and how much time you have to purchase the gift, you can make the process of purchasing a gift much easier.


For example, if their parents deem concert tickets as an inappropriate gift, then you can rule this out. Opt for a CD, or a subscription to Spotify or Pandora account instead.
Avoid gifts that the teen's parents might get them like clothes.

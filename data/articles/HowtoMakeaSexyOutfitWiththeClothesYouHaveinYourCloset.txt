 You can dye clothes in a deeper shade of their original color if they are faded, or a darker color.
 Dyeing cotton-based clothes in the washer is easy and reviving the colors already can make all the difference.
 Take into account the color your garment was before dyeing it. For example, a yellow dress and blue dye might come out looking either blue or green, depending on how well the fabric takes on the new shade. Synthetic fibres don't take the dye at all, so ensure that if your garment is a cotton/polyester blend, it is at least 80% cotton before you try to dye it.
 You can also gather the fabric into loose (diagonal) folds and sew them into place at the side seam to make it more fitted. This works best with slightly stretchy fabrics.
 You can go anywhere from below the knees (that length looks good with a hot pair of heels) to really short shorts. Be daring!

, If you are self-conscious about your legs, wear it with a pair of leggings. Make sure the leggings end at the slimmest part of your leg for a flattering appearance. If you want, you can pair them with heels to make your legs appear longer.
 Wear a basic white tank top (make sure it's not see-through) with dark blue jeans and some red/pink/green/turquoise heels and hoop bracelets. Ethnic ladies often look amazing with orange or yellow/gold accessories.
 Use a thin scarf in place of a belt for an eye-catcher on a simple outfit.

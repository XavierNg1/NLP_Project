 This method is cheap, simple, and sturdy. Make sure to test the grappling hook before you try to climb anything high. You will need:


Three metal hooks with a hole at the bottom (which you can find in most building supply shops)
1-2 feet of thin but strong flexi-wire
A long stretch of rope (climbing rope will be the most sturdy)
500ml of no-nail super tack (also found in building supply shops).
, Squirt the no-nail tack from the top of the three hooks between the hooks, and tie all three hooks tightly together with the strong flexi-wire. The strength of the grappling hook depends on the hooks being held together very well.
 Make sure that the hooks all face the same direction. Tie a figure-eight knot and a stop knot at the end of the rope to keep the rope from slipping back through the holes.
 You should have the three hooks tied together with the wire and the rope coming down in a single line. Test the rope out, attach it to your belt or relay, and climb!

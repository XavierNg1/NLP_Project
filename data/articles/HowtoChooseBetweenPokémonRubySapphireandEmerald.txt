, The biggest difference between Ruby and Sapphire is which of the two main Legendary Pokémon you want to get. Ruby players get Groudon, while Sapphire players get Kyogre.


Emerald allows you to get both, while also making a number of significant changes to the base game.
 All the Pokémon from both Ruby and Sapphire are available in Emerald except for the following Pokémon. These Pokémon cannot be found in the wild in Emerald. You will need to trade with another Generation III game to obtain these Pokémon.Pokedex #

Many of the Gym Leader battles are more difficult in Emerald as well.
 Pokémon Emerald makes a lot of small tweaks and changes to the base Ruby and Sapphire games.


Emerald allows you to capture both Kyogre and Groudon.

 Spray both sides of the flattened bottle top lids with gold spray paint. It is easiest to spray all on one side first, then leave to dry, then turn over and spray the other side. That way, you won't lose any of the gold paint by turning the fake coins over before they dry.


If you prefer, you can hand paint the gold paint on.

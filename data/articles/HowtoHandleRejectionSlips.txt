 It might feel that way when you open the envelope, and the words on the page may sting your ego, but you are in good company. Even the most famous authors who have gotten rich had their share of rejection.;
, There are multiple reasons why your work may have been rejected, such as a similar piece may have already been bought, the tone wasn't quite right or the editor was simply having a bad day. Whatever the reason, remember that it's all business.
 One great way to handle rejection slips is to cull everything you can from an editor or agent. If you didn't receive a form letter, take the time to re-read it, consider the suggestions and critiques, and maybe do some editing.
 Just because one editor or agent decided to pass on your work does not mean that all of them will. Check your list of publishing options and get ready to try again.
 This might sound odd, but the fact that you have received a rejection slip means that you were brave enough to take that step in sending it out in the first place. Give yourself a pat on the back because many writers never make it that far.
 Once you have picked yourself up off the floor from the last rejection slip and have found the next placement option, get back to work. Do not allow self-pity to cripple your creativity and pour your energy onto the page.

 When you purchase your boots, you need to protect them against damage from the elements. Lay out the boots on newspaper in a well ventilated area, hold the silicone polymer spray about a foot (30.48 cm) from the boots and spray evenly.You can find silicone polymer spray at department stores and some shoe stores.
This type of spray is generally safe on all leather, including suede, but check the packaging to make sure.;
, After spraying both boots, let the boots dry for about 30 minutes. Then apply another coat for extra protection and let it dry for 30 more minutes. After the second coat dries, the boots will be ready to wear.
 Itâ€™s important to apply waterproofing spray consistently, especially if you are in a wet climate. If you wear your boots in a dry climate or mostly indoors, apply spray to clean boots every few months, otherwise apply the spray every month or so to protect your boots.

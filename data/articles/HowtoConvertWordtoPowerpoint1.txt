 Start Word and open the document by clicking "File" → "Open." Any document can be converted into a PowerPoint. Know that you will need to copy and paste in pictures by hand.;
, In order for PowerPoint to know where to divide up slides, you need to divide up the information. In the line above each list, paragraph, or sentence you want as a separate slide, write a title for the slide, such as "First Quarter Numbers" or "Works Cited."


This will become the large, bolded text at the top of each PowerPoint slide.
 Click on the "Home" tab in the upper left corner of Word. Along your toolbar at the top of the screen you should see a large box labeled "Styles." In it are several formatting examples labeled "Normal," "No Spacing," "Heading 1," etc.
 You will have to format each title individually. The text will become large, bolded, and colored blue -- and PowerPoint will use this format to determine the slide titles.
 Hit the "enter" key to put a space between every block of text that you want separated. Now, highlight the text and select "Heading 2" on the "Styles" menu. Your text will turn blue. Every individual line or paragraph will be a different bullet on your final slide.


Bulleted sections will remain in the same slide if they are formatted as "Heading 2."

, If you assign something to "Heading 3," it will appear indented to the right and on a separate line. The PowerPoint slide would appear like the following:


Text formatted with "Heading 2"

Text formatted with "Heading 3"



, Hit "Enter" before each new title. This creates the outline for PowerPoint. Each large, bolded line indicates a title and the small blue text underneath is the content of your slide. If there is a space, then another title, PowerPoint will separate this into a new slide.
 Once you've set up the outline you can change the size, color, and font of your text, which will convert to PowerPoint. The text no longer needs to be blue or bolded -- it has already been coded for conversion to PowerPoint


If you delete the spaces between lines or try to add new text, it may not be formatted correctly, so always take this step last.
Don't forget to save your document!

, PowerPoint will take your document and convert it automatically into slides. If you cannot see the "Send to PowerPoint" button:


Click on "File" → "Options" to open up the Options Window.
Click "Quick Access Toolbar."
Select "All Commands" under the "Choose Commands From:" menu.
Scroll down through the alphabetically listed commands until you find "Send to Microsoft Powerpoint." Click to "Add > >" it.
Click OK in the bottom right corner. Now, a small button will appear in the upper left corner of word that lets you send the document to PowerPoint.
 Apply the finishing touches to your presentation, like slide animations, sounds, themes, or pictures.


Word will not automatically convert pictures for you -- you will have to manually copy and paste or insert them into your slides.

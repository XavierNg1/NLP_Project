 Do not attempt to capture a rabid cat on your own. If you see signs that a cat might be infected, it is best to call animal control. This way the cat can be taken to a veterinarian without putting you at risk for a bite.


You should also contact animal control if your own cat is behaving in a strange or aggressive manner., If your cat has been bit by a cat or some other animal, place him in a carrier and bring him to a veterinarian as soon as possible.The veterinarian will ask you questions about possible rabies exposure (recent smell of skunk in your yard, exposure to raccoons, any bats in the area) and examine your cat.


Keep in mind that there is no live animal test to determine whether or not an animal has rabies. The brain has to be removed from the body. To make a rabies diagnosis, small sections of the brain will be examined under a microscope to look for the presence of Negri bodies., If your cat has been previously vaccinated against rabies, he will have a booster shot of the vaccine as soon as possible after he is bit. This will help his immune system fight off the virus. He will also have to be observed for signs of rabies for 45 days. This can often be done at home as long as your cat will be confined and will not have any contact with any animals or humans outside of the household., If a cat has not been vaccinated against rabies and is bitten by a confirmed rabid animal, euthanasia is often recommended.This is because rabies is a serious threat to human health and there is a high chance that the cat will become rabid.


If the owner refuses to euthanize the cat, then it will need to be quarantined and observed for six months. This quarantine must take place at a veterinary clinic at the ownerâ€™s cost.
If the cat does not succumb to rabies during this time, then he will be allowed to come home. He will just need to have a rabies vaccine one month prior to release.

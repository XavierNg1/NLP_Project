, Make sure to clean your refrigerator and kitchen sink with bleach or an antibacterial alternative.

 Stick to what's in season, and only buy what your family will eat. Go for fruits like apples and oranges, as they are the least expensive. Veggies are good fresh, canned or frozen. Frozen veggies tend to cost less than fresh ones in many places, so be sure to compare. Stock up on bell peppers, onions, corn and broccoli/ cauliflower when in season and freeze for other months if appropriate.
 This refers to your starches. These are going to be the cheapest parts of your meal and are there to help fill you and your family up along with the nutritious meats and fruits/veggies. You can buy bulk bags of potatoes, rice, and beans (dry or canned,) and only cook what is needed per meal.
 You can buy bulk pounds of most spices for only pennies at bulk food stores or online. You can look into "foodservice" spices, as they typically cost significantly less and can be delivered to you in their own labeled containers. Another option is to browse the spices in the ethnic food aisle, as they could be half to a third of the price of the tiny jarred spices. Buy your salt and pepper in bulk, too. You don't have to have everything all at once.

 Add water as it evaporates. Remove all of the bones and save the stock. Add in any leftovers diced small into the stock pot, add in the bags of frozen veggies, and more water and salt/pepper to taste. Add in rice or already cooked pasta, even if there is sauce on it. Once everything has boiled together for an hour or so, add seasonings to fix the taste. This should be enough soup for two meals. Serve with fruit on the side.


The second tine your family eats the soup, boil again with more water and a roux (equal parts oil or butter with flour, must boil into the soup) to thicken and make a creamy texture. Add in any cheeses if you have them.
 Believe it or not, you've probably got leftovers in your fridge still. If you don't, this is why you keep PB&J on hand.

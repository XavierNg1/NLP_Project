 To make a frisbee you will need two paper plates, packing tape, scissors, and markers for decoration., Use markers to draw designs on the bottom of the plates. You donâ€™t need to decorate the side of the plate you put food on because it will become the inside of the frisbee.
 Cover the side of the plate that you would place food on with clear packing or shipping tape. Cover the entire surface of the plate and trim the excess tape from around the edges of the plate.


You can use decorative duct tape to tape the plates and decorate your frisbee at the same time.
 Cut out the center of the flat portion of the plate. Your circle should be about 3 inches in diameter. Trace a circle using a large cup. Stab scissors through the center of the plate and cut out the circle leaving the edges of the plate intact., Attach the plates together with the packing tape around all the edges. Cover the entire decorated surface of the plate with the tape. Tuck the excess ends of the tape around the hole in the center of the plates., Hold the frisbee parallel to the ground and throw it by snapping your wrist as you release.

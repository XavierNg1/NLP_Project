 Whether you like to save your essays locally, on a flash drive for your computer, or through a cloud service like Google Drive, iCloud Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive, set up a filing system for your classes ahead of time. Make one folder for each of your classes and subfolders for any recurring type of assignment, like a weekly writing exercise.You can even color code your digital folders to match your real life color-coding system for even more precise organization.
 You can set up filters to funnel messages from your professors into individual class folders as they come in. This way, you’ll never have to dig through your email trying to find that one special email your professor sent with an important addendum or due date change., Whether it’s an orientation meeting for freshmen or a one-on-one with a teacher, it can be helpful to schedule digital reminders for one-off events that might disrupt your normal schedule. Most phones have calendar features that will remind you of an upcoming event 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 30 minutes beforehand. Use these to help yourself keep on top of new or last-minute meetings you might forget to consult your regular calendar about.

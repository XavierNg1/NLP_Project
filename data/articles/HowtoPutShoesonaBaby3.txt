Your child will be born with flat feet and will not develop an arch until later on. It is important to make sure that your child has developed a proper arch by the time he reaches the age of three.
Some children also turn their feet inward or outward when first learning to walk. Your child will most likely correct this on his own as walking becomes more second nature to him. However, if this condition does not correct itself, you may need to take your child to a foot specialist.
 It is important to check your baby’s foot often for minor foot problems such as blisters and athlete’s foot. Blisters and athlete’s foot can occur if your baby’s shoes do not fit properly. This is true even in young babies who are not yet walking.


Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that can cause a rash and is most likely to occur if your baby’s foot is too damp because of sweating.
Blisters are usually caused by your baby’s shoes continuously rubbing against his foot. If your baby does develop blisters, it may be a good idea to have them checked out by your pediatrician, as blisters can also be caused by hand, foot and mouth disease. This is a very common viral infection that can also cause your child to have a small fever.
Be sure to check your baby for ingrown toenails and warts that can grow on his or her feet. Warts can develop from not wearing proper footwear at swimming pools and other public places.

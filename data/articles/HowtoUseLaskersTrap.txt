 A common opening move in chess, moving the Queen Pawn two spaces forward forms the Queen's Pawn opening. It opens up the center as well as the file for the Queen and the diagonal for the Queen Bishop.



d5. Moving the Queen Pawn two spaces, for the same reasons above, is a decent reply to d4.;
, Moving the Queen Bishop Pawn two spaces forms the Queen's Gambit Opening, by offering the pawn for Black's Queen Pawn. This is perhaps the most common continuation in the Queen's Pawn opening.



e5. Declining the gambit, and offers the King pawn as a counter-gambit. This move is called the Albin Counter-gambit. It is very risky and not recommended opening for Black.
 Accepting the countergambit is a natural continuation.



d4. Pushing the Queen Pawn forward, preventing Nc3. From here, the Lasker's trap may arise.
 Moving the King pawn one space to attack Black's Queen pawn. This move looks natural, as it aims to eliminate Black's menacing Queen Pawn that is cramping White's game. However, this move is dubious, due to Black's next move. A better move here is Nf3 or e4.



Bb4+. Bishop delivers check. From here, White has two possible moves to block the check, but neither is very good.
 Black answers with 5... dxe3 taking the pawn. Then 6. fxe3 Qh4+.


If White tries to push the King Knight pawn to drive the queen away: 7. g3, Black replies with Qe4, attacking White's King Rook, pawn on e3, and pawn on e5, with a solid advantage. (Note that the Knight is pinned to the King and cannot capture the Queen on e4.)







If White move the King up: 7. Ke2 Bg4+ 8. Ngf3 Nc6 and Black has the upper hand, as White's isolated pawns on e3 and e5 are hard to defend.
 Seemingly natural, this move falls prey to Lasker's Trap. Instead of exchanging bishops, Black plays dxe3! to set Lasker's trap. There are several possible replies here by White, but none is satisfactory.


If White takes the pawn: 6. fxe3 Qh4+ 7. g3 (if 7. Ke2, Bg4+)... Qe4 (attacking King Rook, pawn on e3, and pawn on e5) 8. Qf3 Bxd2+ 9. Nxd2 Qxe5, and Black has the upper hand. White is left with an isolated King pawn.






If White moves Queen to a4 delivering check: 6. Qa4+ Nc6 7. Bxb4 Qh4, threatening Qxf2+.

If 8. g3 exf2+ 9. Kxf2 Qd4+, followed by Qxb2, and White's Queen Rook is lost.






If 8. Ne2 Qxf2+ 9. Kd1 Bg4, followed by O-O-O+, with a winning attack.








If White takes the Bishop: 6. Bxb4 exf2+ 7. Ke2 (for if 7. Kxf2, Qxd1) fxg1=N+! (not Bg4, which allows 8. Nf3, and White is up a piece; and not fxg1=Q, which is not a bad move, but allows White to play 8. Qxd8+, followed by Rxg1) 8. Ke1 (if 8. Rxg1, Bg4 wins the White Queen) Qh4+ 9. Kd2 (if 9. g3 Qe4+ wins the Rook) Nc6 10. Bc3 Bg4 (attacking the Queen) 11. Qe1 O-O-O+ 12. Ke3 Qg5+ 13. Kf2 Rd1 14. Qe4 Rxf1 15. Kxf1 Ne2, and Black has a winning material advantage.

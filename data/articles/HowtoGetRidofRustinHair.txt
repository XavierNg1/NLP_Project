 This takes about an hour to do.;
, Stir to combine into a paste.


The amounts needed depend on hair length. Obviously, longer hair will require more paste than shorter hair. Be generous, as the items used are not expensive.
Use either a glass or ceramic bowl to make this mixture.
 Allow to rest for at least 15 minutes; during this time, the paste will start to lift out the reddish colorant and remove the rust.
 Rinse out as much of the paste as you can. After this, shampoo as per usual.
 Squeeze a few lemons into a glass and coat your hair with the juice. Allow it to sit on the hair for a short time, then wash it out when done.


If lemon juice is left on too long, it can bleach (lighten) hair color, so avoid going into the sun (this will accelerate the bleaching process) and don't leave the lemon juice in for too long. On the other hand, if you do want highlights, leave in longer!
If wished, combine cream of tartar with the lemon juice. Mix enough to make a paste, then spread on the hair and let sit for 10 minutes, before rinsing out.
 A chelating or clarifying shampoo will do this but be aware that such shampoos can damage hair if over-used, so don't use this shampoo every day. Follow the instructions on the bottle and always follow it with a good conditioner.
 If the iron-filled water is your usual washing water, it can be filtered out by using a water filter. Talk to a hardware or plumbing store specialist to find out which options will work best for your bathroom.

 Place the pomegranate on a cutting board and cut off the crown. After you have removed and disposed of the crown, slice your pomegranate along its ridges. This will prevent you from slicing through the seeds.








The ridges separate the pomegranate sections. You can spot them from the top after you have removed the crown. One set of sections radiates from the top down, and a second section radiates from the side. Slice through both to open the pomegranate.;
, After you have cut through the top and side ridges, your pomegranate will fall into a star shape.Each individual slice will be attached to the center. Pull apart each side and prepare to remove the seeds.
 Use your fingers in a gentle scraping motion to dislodge the arils from the pomegranate skin.
 If you do not eat all the seeds at once, you can keep them in a sealed container for up to three days in the refrigerator.

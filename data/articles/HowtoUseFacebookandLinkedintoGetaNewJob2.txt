 Many employers will use this section to locate potential job candidates on LinkedIn.


Be sure to include a professional headline and choose an industry from within the professional summary section, as these fields are most commonly reviewed by employers when searching for potential job candidates.
 Employers will review your current job status when seeking candidates, and may contact you using the information provided on your LinkedIn profile.
 If your profile settings are set to private, employers who are not directly connected to you on LinkedIn may not be able to review your professional background and contact information.
 Making connections with a large number of users will increase your chances of being found and contacted by a hiring employer.


Search on LinkedIn for the names of people you are affiliated with, such as friends, family members, former employers and colleagues, classmates from school, and other acquaintances you have connected with on a professional level.
 Recommendations often serve as references, and can often improve your chances of securing a job interview or opportunity.


Write recommendations for your contacts on LinkedIn to indirectly encourage those members to reciprocate the favor.
 In some cases, your connections can refer you to other LinkedIn members looking for job candidates, and may even deliver your resume to these contacts personally.
 When members update their LinkedIn profiles after they have been promoted, LinkedIn can inform you directly of these profile changes.


Ask the LinkedIn members who have been promoted if they can recommend you for the open position they left behind, or if they know of any additional job openings they can refer you for.

 In order to write a solo, you need to be comfortable with the song and the chord changes. For any solo you're writing, you'll likely be in contact with the person who wrote the song, and they should tell you the key and the chords they used. If not, the key is usually the first chord played. Listen to the song 2-3 times while fooling around on your guitar to get some early ideas for scales, licks, and tones.


Don't worry about coming up with the perfect solo on the spot. Just play along, making a mental note of parts that sound good.;
, There are a lot of options out there for scales, and none of them are necessarily "right." While you can play multiple scales in one solo depending on the chords being played, beginners should get comfortable with one scale first, then move on to more complicated solos. If you don't know any of the following scales, click here to learn more about guitar scales and modes and expand your soloing range. When starting out, there are two basic scales that can be applied anywhere on the neck, for use in almost any song. The following shapes can be moved anywhere on the neck to change the key:


The Minor Pentatonic Scale is one of the most versatile scales around, used in rock, blues, pop, and some jazz music. For a song in E minor, you would play:
E|---------------------0-3-|
B|-----------------0-3-----|
G|-------------0-2---------|
D|---------0-2-------------|
A|-----0-2-----------------|
E|-0-3---------------------|
The Major Pentatonic Scale is similarly versatile, but has a happier, jauntier feel. For a song in E minor, you would play:
E|---------------------3-5-|
B|-----------------3-5-----|
G|-------------2-4---------|
D|---------2-5-------------|
A|-----2-5-----------------|
E|-3-5---------------------|The Major Pentatonic Scale is a happier, brighter version of the above scale, and can be used in similarly bright songs. For a song in E Major:
e|-------------------------------------9--12--|
B|------------------------------9--12---------|
G|-----------------------9--11----------------|
D|----------------9--11-----------------------|
A|---------9--11------------------------------|
E|--9--12-------------------------------------|

, Instead of playing as fast as you can, play one practice solo where you just play 8-10 notes total. Make these big, powerful notes -- the "islands" you can return to once you start playing quickly. These notes, which most people naturally place on or after chord changes, will form the road map for your solo.


Try a solo where you just play the root note of whatever chord is being played. This will help you find the structure of the song on the fretboard., If you don't know your way around a scale, can't think of anything to play, or simply want to give your solo some structure, try playing the same notes the singer used. Start off with a 4-5 note lick that resembles the main melody or a lick you play earlier in the song. Then play it again, this time changing 1-2 notes. Adjust this lick 2-3 more times, ending with something completely different from your original lick, to write a great, simple solo that fits in seamlessly with the rest of the song., The best solos ever written, from Clapton's searing blues in "Layla" to the single-note genius of Django Reinhardt, all have structure. They build slowly, adding complexity over time to hook the listener -- not just show off technical prowess. The best way to start is to think of your solo as having a beginning, middle, and end. A good structure to start with might be:



Beginning: start slow, with short little phrases of multiple notes, or slower repeated bits. You want to introduce the notes you'll be playing, maybe playing off an earlier melody, repeating the same phrase 2-3 times, or mimicking the vocal melody.

Middle: start exploring the fretboard as the chords start changing. You might move into higher notes, play some repeating notes, or start incorporating bends and vibrato.

End: end the solo on your best phrase or your fastest set of notes, culminating the solo in a high point or climax., Sometimes you'll find the solo instantly, but more often than not you'll need to play it several times, taking what you love and cutting what sounds bad, until you have a full solo worth playing. Stay loose and try new things. Once you have your notes down you can start spicing up the solo with added flourish and fun:


If you have some key notes that hold for a long period of time, try shaking or bending them to make them really sing.
Can you slide into notes? Hammer on or pull-off them for quicker playing?
Can you cut or add notes to make the pacing and tension build up better? Are there some odd notes outside of the scale that give the song a unique flavor?

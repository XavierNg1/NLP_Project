Unfortunately, if you don't have Cazmo Cash, or aren't a member, there isn't a great selection of fashionable clothes for you. But, you still can look amazing! Just look around, find items which are seen a lot, especially clothes and items which are worn by friends, popular people, etc.
Then, you check if you can afford what you want, and just use it with your own style! One warning, do not copy other people, just get ideas from them. If you just people instead of being yourself you will just blend in, if you want to be popular you need to stand out and be original as well as wearing what everyone else is.;

Add anyone, and everyone, you see! If you get a few friends, their friends will become friends with you, their friends will become friends with you, and eventually you end up with a bunch of friends, and a stuffed contact list on your cell phone!
Set trends with your friends, and don't follow others!
Be kind with your friends, always make time to hang out with them, and don't forget any one of them.
They are the reason you are becoming popular, but also remember that it's just nice to have friends, isn't it!

, If you click on the sunglasses at the bottom of your page it tells you some cool places. These are were other cool Camzos go, so if you want to be popular that is where you want to be seen.

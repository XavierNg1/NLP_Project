 There are some commands that can literally save your dog's life and the "stay" command is one of them. Keeping your dog out of dangerous situations, in addition to simply keeping it out of trouble, can be achieved more easily when you can train your dog to stay put.A pup has an instinctive understanding of how to stay when being threatened and the mother uses a very distinct "stay" command as well. This instinctive and early training should help you to train your dog to follow your command to stay., When your dog is sitting, stand so that he or she is on your left side facing the same direction. Later this will be referred to as the 'place' position.
 You should do this while placing your open hand in front of, but not touching, your dog's face. The tips of your fingers should be pointing up and your palm should be facing your dog. Wait two seconds. If the dog stays in place, say "Yes!" and it a reward.


If she gets up, say "Oops!" and start again. Begin with "sit" and proceed again to "stay".
Repeat this until your dog stays in place for at least ten seconds and then praise it. This means you may need to repeat this whole sequence several times.
 When your dog learns this command well, you can start to increase the length of time while gradually moving away during the stay. If your dog gets up, go all the way back to sitting and repeat the sequence, until you can move around freely during the stay.You should also have a certain command to release your dog from the stay such as "okay!" or "come". This way, your dog knows when it can move.

 Do you want a shovel to remove snow? Dig holes? Move grain?;
, Rolled edges that you can push on with your feet are a plus.
For heavy or rocky soils, you may wish to get a companion shovel for the above, basically to loosen up the soil so that you can move it with the larger shovel: a thick, heavy blade 8-12" long by about 4" wide is well suited for this task.
For moving light, granular goods, such as grain, a fairly large and well-scooped shovel is best.
For shoveling snow off of driveways, a large shovel with a flat nose is best. The size should be determined by how thick of a layer of snow you are moving: thicker snow means narrower shovel.
 Short handles tend to lead to inefficient shoveling.
Is the handle the correct thickness for your hands? Too thick will tend to give you blisters, too thin will be hard to hold on to.
Is the handle attached to the blade in a robust manner? Is it likely to break off under torsional (twisting) loads?
Is the handle robust? Will it end up breaking?

, Plastic blades, even as snow shovels, tend to end up chipping and breaking with time.


Is the blade suitably thick? Will it be damaged if it hits something, like a rock, while digging?
In the case of a shovel for soil, is the blade's steel of good quality? With permission, test this by filing the edge of the shovel a bit: soft steel with file easily. If in doubt, just don't buy the cheap shovels.

 It was shown by Jacques Charles and then later by Joseph Gay-Lussac that the temperature of a gas is directly related to the volume when pressure and mass of the gas remain constant. This means that, for a given gas, the volume of the gas divided by the temperature of the gas will yield the same number for each volume-temperature combination., Volume should be measured in liters. Temperature should be measured in Kelvin. If your values are in different units, you should use dimensional analysis to convert them to the correct units before proceeding. Otherwise, your calculations will not be correct., The initial volume (V1) of a gas divided by the initial temperature (T1) of that gas is equal to some constant, k. If the volume or temperature of that gas is altered, both values will change such that the new volume (V2) divided by the new temperature (T2) will also be equal to the same constant, k. Since V1/T1=k and V2/T2=k, V1/T1=V2/T2., When given a problem to solve, you will be provided some of the measurements and asked to calculate a missing piece of the equation. Scan the problem for all given values and place them in the appropriate part of the equation. Once you have all known values in your equation, just rearrange the equation so that your unknown value is alone, and then do the arithmetic. You will have used Charlesâ€™s Law to solve your problem.

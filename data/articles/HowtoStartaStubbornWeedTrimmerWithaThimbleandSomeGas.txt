If so, this could mean the carb is blocked, because gas is not getting from the carb to the cylinder, and the only thing that's making it run for a bit, is the little gas you put in the cylinder. If it does not run at all, it is usually because the spark plug is either spent or dirty., Press primer bulb a few times forcing excess gas in line to run into carb, and then pull starter rope a few times forcing all the gas out. Excess gas sitting in the line and in carb over the winter causes blockage, so always empty and clean when not in use for extended periods.

 Use one hand to hold it firmly in place while you work the spoon with your other hand.
 The lid of the can will have a small, raised lip that has been crimped to seal the can closed. You want to position the spoon in a spot along the inside of this lip.


Hold the spoon so that the inside of its bowl is facing the lid of the can.
You need a metal spoon for this method. Any other material won't work.
 Work it over the same small area right where the edge of the lid is crimped. The friction from rubbing the spoon back and forth will begin to thin the can lid. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid., Rub the spot next to the first area you rubbed. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid. The hole you have made in the lid is now slightly bigger.
 Keep scooting the spoon over and rubbing through the lid until you have circled the entire can lid. The lid should now be loose. Don't tip it upside down, or your food will spill out.
 Dig the spoon under the edge of the lid. Pry the lid upward until it pops out of place. Carefully lift it away to reveal the food inside.


If you find it difficult to pry off the lid with the spoon, try using a knife instead. You can use the knife to saw through any small parts of the lid that remain connected to the can.
The lid will be sharp, so be careful not to cut your finger on its edge when you pry it off. Use your sleeve or a towel to protect yourself if necessary.

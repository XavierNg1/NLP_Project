 It should measure about 4cm/1.5 inches across.


Cut the design out from the paper.
 For a full headband coverage, you'll need about 24-30 butterflies. For a half or smaller amount of butterflies, aim for about 12-16.


Pin the template to the first felt color. Cut out one third of the amount of butterflies needed in this color.
Repeat for the other two colors.
 Add a few stitches in each to keep the wings sitting upward.
 Alternate the colors as you place the butterflies in place. Or, follow whatever pattern you have in mind for adding the butterflies and embellishments.


Add any other embellishments. These might include sequins, glitter glue, beads, rhinestones, etc.
 This headband is nice paired with butterfly wings and a butterfly fairy theme.

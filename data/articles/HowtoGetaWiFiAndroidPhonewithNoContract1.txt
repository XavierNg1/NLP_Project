 Before choosing a new Android phone, you should first determine how much you are willing to spend on the device. It is just good form to set up a price range for yourself before setting out to buy a new device of any kind.;
, Once you have decided on the make and model, and if you already have a contract with a cell phone carrier, you can go on to their website and see if they have the one you chose in stock. Normally, when an existing client wants to purchase a new device, carriers will have a special price for them.


If you don’t have an existing phone carrier, you might want to do some research online to check out prices from the different carriers in your city/country. Since you are only going to use the device with WiFi, the service the carrier provides shouldn’t matter in your decision.
 If you are trying to find a good device and don’t want to pay a lot of money for it, this is a good way to go. People sometimes sell their used phones on the internet after they get a brand new one, and usually they’re in pretty good shape. You do want to be sure you are getting a phone that is in good condition, so check the ratings for the seller (usually this websites have a rating system), and ask about the return policy, if you are not happy with your purchase.
 Nowadays, cellphones are sold in a lot of different places, not only by phone carriers. A good option are the discount department stores. These stores usually have a technology department where, among other things, they sell smartphones with and without contracts. You can go on their website or just head to the nearest store near you to check out their prices.
 Sometimes, someone close to you is about to get a new phone and they don’t know what to do with their old one. Offer to buy it from them as soon as they get it deactivated. This is probably the easiest way to do this, with the obstacle that you have to find someone that is willing to sell you their old phone.

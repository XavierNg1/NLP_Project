 If you're not sure what pronoun a person would prefer, it's fine to ask. Most people appreciate being asked because it shows you care enough to find out their personal preferences. Just be polite when you do it.For example, you could say, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but do you have a preferred pronoun you'd like me to use?"
Once they tell you what they prefer, be sure to use it.
 When you're in a classroom or giving a speech, it's not necessary to address the group with gendered words. For example, you may be tempted to say "boys and girls" or "ladies and gentlemen." Instead, pick a plural noun that works for everyone, such as "students," "peers," "colleagues," or "folks."In addition, try not to break into groups based on gender. Use other tactics, such as dividing by location in the room or numbering off.
 Not every woman you see has a period. Not every man you see is incapable of getting pregnant. This is dependent on how strongly a man identifies with being a woman or a woman being a man. In addition, many transgender people, who are living as the opposite sex, still experience the biological functions of the sex they were born with.For example, any discussion of abortion rights should not just be limited to women, as many transgender men are affected by the legislation, as well.

 Green, leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, bok choy, and collard greens are excellent sources of calcium. Broccoli is also packed with calcium.


Keep in mind that your body doesn't absorb all this calcium the same way, though. It is much harder to get calcium from spinach because of the oxalic acid that interferes with the absorption of calcium ions. However, arugula has good amount of calcium and pretty good absorption.
 Beans of all kinds offer calcium as well as essential fiber, antioxidants, and other nutrients essential to a balanced diet.

 Liquid detergent requires the exact same ingredients as powdered detergent, only this time, water is added to liquefy the powder. The supplies you'll need are listed here:


A bar of castile soap, scented or unscented
A box of washing soda
A box of borax
Several gallons of water
A 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket

, Use a cheese grater or a food processor to grate the soap until it's a fine powder, and no large chunks remain.
 Place the soap flakes and 2 quarts of water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir the mixture as it heats, and keep mixing it until the soap completely dissolves in the water.
 Pour the water into a large pot and heat it up until it's almost boiling. Pour the water into the 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket when you're finished.
 Keep stirring until the powders are dissolved.
, The ingredients need to meld overnight.
 Keep a measuring cup nearby. For a large load, use a cup of liquid detergent; for a smaller load, use 1/2 cup.

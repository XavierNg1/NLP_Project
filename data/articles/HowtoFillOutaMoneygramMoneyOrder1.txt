 Money orders are a method of payment that gives the recipient a guarantee that they will receive payment.Because you pay for the money order up front when purchasing it, you cannot void the payment like you could with a credit card charge, and the amount cannot bounce like a bad check. Though it’s a very secure method of payment, not all companies or people will accept money orders as a form of payment. Before securing your money order, ask the person you’re paying to whether or not it’s an acceptable form of payment.


Money orders are commonly required for governmental agencies — for example, if you’re paying a speeding ticket or a court processing fee.;
, Money orders can be purchased from many different locations, including post office locations, banks, local businesses like grocery stores, Western Union branches, and MoneyGram branches. If you don’t have a MoneyGram branch nearby, be aware that you can likely purchase a money order from many other locations in your area.
 If you don’t know where to find one in your area, you can use the search option on the company’s website.Just enter your address and check the box that matches your service needs to find a branch that can give you what you need. Depending on why you need your money order, you should check either “Send Money” or “Pay a Bill.”


The website will provide you with a list of MoneyGram locations nearby. You can see the location on a map or even follow the directions the website provides to reach your nearest MoneyGram branch.
 If you can’t find a convenient location, or if you just don’t have time to visit the branch in person, MoneyGram offers an online money order option.Again, you should check with the recipient to make sure they will accept this form of payment instead of a physical money order.

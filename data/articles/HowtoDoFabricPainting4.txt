 Simply sprinkle the glitter of your choice on top of the paint while it is still wet. Allow the paint to dry fully.
 Adhere to the fabric using a small dollop of fabric paint that matches the color of the embellishment. If the fabric paint does not seem strong enough, try fabric glue.
 Be sure to press down firm and straight.

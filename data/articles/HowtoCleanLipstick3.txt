 If you’re out and notice a lipstick stain on your clothing, don’t rub at the stain with a napkin or paper towel. Instead, blot the spot with water to help remove the top layer of pigment.If you’re out a restaurant and can ask for seltzer, use that to blot the lipstick stain. If you don’t have access to seltzer, use cold water.
Never blot a lipstick stain with warm or hot water. That will set the stain.
 When you’re ready to clean your clothing, start by applying a pre-wash stain remover to the spot. Allow the stain remover to sit on the stain for 1 to 3 minutes, or according to the product’s label.You can use a dry cleaning spotter in place of the pre-wash stain remover. They’re available in home dry cleaning kits. If you use the spotter, though, make sure that it evaporates completely before washing your clothing.
 After you’ve let the stain remover sit on the lipstick stain for several minutes, clean the clothing in a washing machine. Make sure to follow the recommendations on the clothing label as to what temperature and cycle you should use.In some cases, you may need to handwash the item., Once you’ve finished washing the clothing, remove it from the machine and check the stain. If it’s gone, you can dry the item according to the label instructions. If the stain lingers, apply more of the stain remover and re-wash the item until the stain is gone.If you’ve tried using the pre-wash stain treatment to remove the stain and your clothing hasn’t come clean, you may want to try the dry cleaning spotter. It is more concentrated, so it may be more effective on a stubborn lipstick stain.

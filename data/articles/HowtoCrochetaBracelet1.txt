 Attach the thread to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches long enough to wrap around your wrist three times.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your wrist.
This pattern is easy to alter. Size 10 crochet thread will create a relatively sleek bracelet, but you could use thicker cotton yarn if you would prefer a chunkier chain. Similarly, you can create fewer or more wrap-arounds by crocheting a shorter or longer chain, respectively.;
, At the end of your foundation chain, work one notably loose, large chain stitch.

This extra large chain stitch will turn into a button hole. Make sure that it is large enough for the button to fit through but tight enough to prevent the button from easily slipping out.
 Work one more chain stitch beyond the button hole to secure the loop.

Note that you may need to hold the button hole chain while working on this final chain stitch. If you don't hold the button loop, it may shrink as you work the final chain.
 Work one slip stitch into the last chain of the previous row, then work one slip stitch into each of the remaining chains across the foundation., Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off., Using a yarn needle, thread both the beginning tail and end tail through the button. Tie two square knots behind the button to secure it to the end of the bracelet.

Weave the remaining excess into the stitches to secure the ends.
Alternatively, you can trim the ends and glue them down to secure the bracelet. Use fabric seam sealant if adhering the yarn to itself, or hot glue if adhering it to the back of the button.
 The bracelet should be done and ready to show off. Wrap it around your wrist three times, then slip the button through the button hole at the opposite end to hold it around your wrist.

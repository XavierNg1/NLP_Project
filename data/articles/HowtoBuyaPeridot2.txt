 Hold the peridot up to a light source. Note how clear the body of the gem appears as light passes through it. Discard any that appear cloudy.Quality gems may have very small lines or marks running through them, but this is common.
Although there are gems out there that are completely free of any blemishes, these are very rare.
 Expect peridot to come in a variety of shapes, from round to oval to square and beyond. Whatever shape it has been cut in, inspect the surface for imperfections in its symmetry or design. Discard any that appear to be cut irregularly.Peridot is not a rare stone, so a poorly cut one has far less value than another with more precise cuts.
One exception might be a gem that is totally transparent under a microscope, without any of fine lines that run through most specimens. Such stones are very rare.
Alternately, if you can afford it, you could purchase a large, roughly shaped stone and hire a jeweler to recut it more precisely., Check the gem’s weight, or “carat.” Expect most to range from 0.5 to 4 CTW (carat total weight). Expect the price to rise along with its weight, so for a stone with a higher value, go with a higher carat.Remember, though, that peridot is a very common stone. Because of this, more emphasis is placed on a perfect cut.
Therefore, a misshapen peridot with 1.0 CTW isn’t necessarily worth more than a perfectly symmetrical one at 0.5 CTW.

 It's especially effective if it's long hair, and any color works. If you want,you could sprinkle some talcum powder on your head but that probably wouldn't give off the air of a haunted, good-looking vamp.;
,, You can have a long dress or a mini-dress, either works. For the black dress, wear hot-pink punky opaque tights that will look awesome, and black heels. For the red dress, black opaque tights and red heels work. Get novelty fangs from Tesco, Co-Op or Asda.
 Paint on two fang marks to create that just-bitten look. Rim your eyes with black kohl whatever your hair colour, and black mascara, and perhaps black eyeliner too. Either choose pink or red lip-gloss/lipstick for your lips.
 Carry around a plastic bottle of cranberry juice (that's a better option than wine) and beforehand rip off the label, or buy some liquid cherry candy.

 Now you are going to become a chef.;
, Look up a foods guide list by age on the computer. It will tell you what foods you can feed your child must according to a child’s age. This is a very important step.
 Cooking fresh foods provides more nutrients then foods in bottles or cans. Cook fresh vegetables like spinach, green beans and carrots and use the blender to puree them.
  Depending on the child’s age, you can feed them off the table. If you had mashed potatoes and green beans for dinner you may have a perfect dinner for your child.
, Store enough in the containers for tomorrow’s lunch. Just keep an eye on leftovers as you would any leftovers for spoilage.
 You will not only save money but you will have the healthiest kid you ever saw. What you feed them in the first five years will help establish them for the rest of their life.
 20 percent of all preschoolers are obese. So watch what you add to the foods. Get them used to the taste of natural foods without added sugar and salt or fats.
 Juice is high in calories and sugar. Puree fruits for them but again check on charts for what age they can be given different fruits.
 There is not a lot of food value and there may be a lot of fat. Provide more mini meals with good food to fill the stomach like fruits and vegetables.
 Don’t be like some parents that are filling bottles with cola or using French fries as a finger food.  If your child wants to have a cookie, give them one made of natural foods like oats. Avoid raisins until they are older because of choking and digestion.

Decide on what should be sold at the bazaar and who should help. Once these details have been figured out, then you can schedule the bazaar at any time you want. Usually, the best season is during summer and it should not conflict with anything else that is important to your church family.;
, If you can't find things in the church to sell, you can ask families to donate their items. Also, ask the Youth Group if they would donate their time to helping sort the items and mark them with prices tags.

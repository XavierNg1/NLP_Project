 Stopper your kitchen sink and fill it with very hot water – as hot as you can tolerate. Pour in a few drops of anti-grease dish soap and mix it in so that the water suds up. The grease-cutting dish soap is designed to tackle hard to clean stains like the ones famously acquired by silicone bakeware.


Make sure you use very hot water. Lukewarm or cold water will not be quite as effective at cleaning your silicone bakeware.;
, Place the silicone bakeware in the hot, soapy water and let it soak. Leave the bakeware in the sink for at least thirty minutes, though you may need to leave it for a bit longer (one hour) for really tough stains.While your preference might be to use a more natural dish soap, those ingredients won’t be nearly as effective for the tough stains you’ll find on your silicone bakeware.
 Apply some more of the grease-cutting dish soap and scrub the silicone bakeware with a nonabrasive sponge. Really get in there and scrub hard to remove the stains.You may have to spend quite a bit of time and energy getting rid of these stains.
 To get the stains out, you may need to repeat the process several times. It will take some real elbow grease to get some of these stains out of your silicone bakeware. Try using the grease-cutting dish soap again and scrubbing it over and over.Try to use even hotter water the second time. If you use rubber gloves, you’ll be able to use hotter water while cleaning your silicone bakeware.
 When you have finished scrubbing the stains on your silicone bakeware, you should rinse off any remaining soapy residue in the sink. Then place the bakeware upside down on a towel or drying rack to let the water run off.


Make sure you allow the silicone to dry completely before you begin using it again. This usually takes at least an hour or two.

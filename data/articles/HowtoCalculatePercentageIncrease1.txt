 For example, let's say your auto insurance premium just went up. Write down these values:


Your car insurance premium was $400 before the increase. This is the starting value.
After the increase, it costs $450. This is the end value.;
, Subtract the starting value from the end value to find the out how much it increased.We're still working with ordinary numbers at this point, not percentages.


In our example, $450 - $400 = a $50 increase.
 A percentage is just a special kind of fraction. For example, "5% of doctors" is quick way to write "5 out of 100 doctors." By dividing the answer by the starting value, we turn it into a fraction that compares the two values.


In our example, $50 / $400 = 0.125.
 This converts your last result into a percentage.


The final answer to our example is 0.125 x 100 = 12.5% increase in auto insurance premiums.

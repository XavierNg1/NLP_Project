 Grommets used for this purpose are typically made of rubber or plastic and are used to protect against the sharp edge of a hole in a panel that wires need to pass through. Is it to provide a finished appearance on a desk? Does it need to provide some strain relief (protection against sharp bends) to the object passing through it? Select one that's right for the job.


Typically, the holes and grommets are larger for these purposes, which serve to reinforce the edge of the hole and protect the objects (usually wires) that pass through.
 Measure the object that will pass through the grommet, as well as the diameter of the tube, wire, or bundle that you wish to protect. If you're putting a fitting or connector through the grommet, make sure to take that into account.

Measure the hole that the grommet will fill or, if possible, drill or punch correct the hole according to the recommended size for the grommet. Smooth the edge of the hole as much as possible.
 Work all the way around the opening, bending the grommet as required. If you have access to the opposite side of the material, it may help to pull the grommet through or simply to hold it in place.


A soft object, such as this plastic soldering aid, can assist in pushing the grommet to fit the hole.






A dab of personal lube (K-Y for example) around the outside and slot of the grommet is very helpful, it's oil free, inert, and dries clear with no residue. Wipe off excess.
 Typically, a small plastic covering will be used to finish the edge. Choose the correct thickness of grommet edging for your edge and push it over the edge you wish to protect. You may have to pull the sides open a little bit with your fingers as you go.


Depending on the application, a bit of appropriate adhesive can help to hold the edging in place.
 When you've installed your grommet, you're ready to feed the wires through the hole, confident that they're protected.

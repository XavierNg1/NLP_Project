 If it is really hot, like above 95 degrees, you most likely should not have to check. If it is hot, but you are unsure if the pavement will be hot, then you should check.
 Place your hand down on to the sidewalk/road for 10 seconds. If you cannot handle that for 10 seconds, your dog will burn their paws., Sometimes the shade is not the best way to avoid burning their paws. If you cannot handle touching shaded areas of the pavement for 10 seconds, it is too hot., If you really want to walk your dog, wait until it gets cooler, like in the evening or later. Or, you can find a grassy area, as they are usually cooler., Another suggestion is to put your dog on a cool towel on the pavement if you have to bring them outside.

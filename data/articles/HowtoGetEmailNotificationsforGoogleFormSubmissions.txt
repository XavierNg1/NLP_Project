 If you're starting from the Google Form in editing view, click on View Responses to get to the spreadsheet where the responses are being logged. Otherwise, just select the responses spreadsheet straight from its location in your Google Drive.;
,, Depending on the complexity of the spreadsheet, you may have a variety of options to select:


You always have the option to get notifications either when "any changes are made" (including form submissions and changes by collaborators, directly in the spreadsheet) or when "a user submits a form" (only through the form page itself). Depending on the form's complexity and whether or not you created it, you can also set notifications for when any particular sheets or particular cells on the spreadsheet are changed, or for when collaborators are added or removed from the form.
You can also opt to get notifications once a day, in a "daily digest," or "right away," every time the change is made.
 If you change your mind, you can select Cancel.
 If you want to add another rule, select Add another notification rule and repeat the process.
 Check your Gmail inbox associated with the Google Form for any updates as they roll in!

 Compared to the recipe above, this face paint is much thicker. This means that if we wait until the end to add the color, it can be difficult to distribute it throughout the paint. Instead, this time, we'll add it first with the "wet" ingredients. Mix to combine until the mixture has a smooth, consistent color.

, Next, add your powdered ingredients a little bit at a time. Stir as you go to ensure the color combines evenly. When you're finished, if you find that your color is too faint, feel free to add more and continue stirring.

After mixing your shortening and your powdered ingredients, the texture should be chunky or even chalky. This is good — like a clown's greasepaint, this recipe should be solid enough to handle.
Note that the recipe calls for a teaspoon of flour — not a tablespoon

, When this recipe is done, you can handle and store it exactly as you would with the liquid face paint above. Once again, egg cartons and baby food containers work well for keeping each color separate from the others.


Apply the finished face paint with an old makeup applicator, a Q-tip, or a light, clean sponge.

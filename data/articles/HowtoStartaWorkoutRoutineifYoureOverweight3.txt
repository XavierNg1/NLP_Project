 It may seem counterintuitive, but before you even begin your fitness routine, cut yourself some slack. If you start your fitness routine from a place of guilt, you are more likely to fail. So instead of beating yourself up, start from a place of self-compassion. Every time you show up for a workout (even just walking for 15 minutes) be grateful and proud of yourself for taking baby steps toward change. If you make a mistake or skip a day, donâ€™t sweat it. Just try to start again., Perhaps you are embarking on this fitness journey because you want to change the way you look. However, focusing on your clothing size, weight, or reflection are short-term, temporary motivators.Instead, focus on creating a lifestyle change that will bring you better health in the long-term. Avoid weighing or measuring for the first few weeks. Instead, try to focus only on how you feel.It may help to keep a health/exercise log.
Each day, write down what activity you did.
Also, write down how you slept, your mood, and how you felt physically.
 Doing easy-to-moderate exercise every day will bring better, longer-lasting results that doing high-intensity exercise once in a while. Start a fitness routine that is easy enough for you to stick to! Establish fitness as part of your daily life. Eventually, you can push yourself harder to reach your goals, but for now, just work on getting into the groove.

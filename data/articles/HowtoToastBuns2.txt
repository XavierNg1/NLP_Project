 Place a skillet, griddle, or grill pan onto a stove burner set to medium heat. Allow the pan to heat for approximately 30 seconds.


Any pan should work as long as it has a large enough base to hold the bun halves.
Avoid using higher heat settings. High heat can cause the bun to brown—and burn—too quickly.
This method can be used for hamburger-style sandwich buns, sub-style sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.
 Open the bun and brush melted butter over the cut sides of both halves.Spread the butter over the entire cut side, paying special attention to the edges. Dry edges can burn quickly when exposed to heat.
Note that you do not need to brush any melted butter over the crust of the bun.
 Place the bun halves cut-side down into the hot pan. Toast, without moving, until both cut surfaces turn light golden brown.


Check the buns after 10 seconds or so. If they still look too light, you can return them to the hot pan and toast them for a little longer. Progress slowly, though, since the buns can burn quickly if left unattended.
Only the cut sides need to be toasted, so you do not need to flip the bun halves during the toasting process.
 Remove the bun from the pan and use it immediately to enjoy the best texture.

 Petting D-rex encourages him to wag his tail and make happy sounds like one might expect from a dog. The petting sensors are on the top and back of his head. Do not pet the front of his nose, which he interprets as aggression.;
, He will chew contently on the bone till he is full at which point he will make spitting sounds.
 Press attack mode once to get D-Rex ready. Then press the button a second time to launch the attack. As you continue pressing the attack button, D-Rex will continue moving forward, roaring and chomping his mouth.
Guard mode. Pressing guard mode will prompt D-Rex to back up a few steps and start looking around the room and sniffing. Once he is done scanning the room he will sit and watch for an "intruder" to walk by. Every few minutes he will do another scan and sniff of the room. Once he senses movement in front of him he will automatically launch into attack mode by roaring and moving forward. If he doesn't see anything in 30 minutes, he will go to sleep.
Seek mode. D-rex will chirp to signal that he is ready for seek mode. Then you can call him with your voice and he will start walking towards you. Continue calling and he will get close enough so you can pet him. If he fails to find you, he will tire and start panting. Eventually he will whine and give up the search if he doesn't find you.
Prank mode. The prank button triggers a variety of humorous sounds such as the dinosaur fart, burp, yawn or roar. If you respond with your own sound, he will respond by moving his head, eyes and flaring his nostrils.
Question mode. Pressing this button will trigger D-rex to nod his head in agreement or shake it in disapproval. It essentially provides a random response to a yes or no question.
 After a few minutes of inactivity, D-rex will automatically "take a nap". You can wake him up by pressing his nose.

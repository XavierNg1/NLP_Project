 Play a song like 'Hot Cross Buns', raising the volume to its full dynamic level with clarity, and then bringing the sound back down to the softest possible. Do this on some notes without the register key down, then some notes with it down, and finally some of the harder altissimo notes. Time yourself to make it more interesting- aim for holding the note at least 25 seconds.;

 The bacteria in your cat’s bladder produces waste products and chemicals that can irritate the lining of your cat's bladder. When the bladder becomes irritated, it can become inflamed and prone to infection. If you give your cat plenty of water, you can help to dilute your cat’s urine, thereby limiting the amount of time the bacteria’s waste material spends in the bladder.


To increase your cat's water intake, switch her from dry food to a wet food diet. This automatically increases the amount of fluid she gets each day. You should also provide your cat with plenty of wide-lipped water bowls.
You can also try giving your cat purified water, rather than tap water. Some cats are very sensitive to the taste of chlorine that can be found in tap water.
 Overweight cats are more likely to get UTIs than their less heavy counterparts. This is because overweight cats tend to move around less and hold in their urine, rather than rousing themselves to go to the litter box. Urine retention can irritate the bladder lining.


Putting your cat on a diet and helping her to get to a normal weight may help to clear up your cat’s recurrent UTIs.
 The bladder produces a layer of mucus-like material that acts like a bandage that protects the bladder’s lining from harmful substances in the urine. When a cat has a UTI, this glycosaminoglycan, or "GAG" layer, becomes thinner, exposing the bladder lining to irritation. There is some anecdotal evidence that nutraceuticals such as glucosamine, help to replenish this GAG layer and make the cat more comfortable.Talk to your vet about giving your cat "Feliway Cystease". Cystease contains glucosamine and tryptophan; the latter may help to decrease stress in anxious cats, and stress can cause bladder inflammation.
Talk to your vet about pentosan sulphate injection if your cat won’t take pills. If your cat won't take capsules, then an injection containing acetyl glucosamine is available through your veterinarian.

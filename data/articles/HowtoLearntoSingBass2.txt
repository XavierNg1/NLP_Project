 Have your vocal instructor play a range of notes on the piano in ascending and descending order. Try and mimic the notes until you reach a note that's beyond your range. This will allow you to identify your range. Alternatively, you can download an application that can help determine your range.When you are first learning to sing bass, your range is typically low. For instance, you may only be able to sing a middle range octave with a few notes on either side.
 A bass vocalist should be able to comfortably sing the notes C4 to E4. Work with your vocal teacher to expand your range so that you can sing these notes. Focus particularly on creating an even tone for each note.Try singing scales at the lower end of your range that you are comfortable with and then gradually go lower. Practice these scales daily., Bass singers typically sing with a chest voice instead of a head voice. This means that the sound resonates lower in the mouth and chest. The sound is often deeper and less breathy than your head voice. In order to practice chest voice singing, try talking first and then transition into singing.For example, try repeating the words uh-oh while singing a variety of different notes.
You can also place your hand on your chest while singing in order to feel the vibrations. This will help you determine when you are singing from the chest.
 Some bass singers will develop a vocal wobble. This is a result of singing wide open and not rounding the vowels. In order to prevent vocal wobbles, you should practice creating rounded vowels. Keep your mouth round while singing a variety of different vowels.For example, sing the word "more" while completing a scale of notes. You can also try singing "me" while keeping a rounded mouth., When you are learning to sing bass, it is important that you listen to other bass singers. This will help you develop an ear for bass vocals and can help to inspire your own voice. For example, try listening to Barry White or Isaac Hayes.

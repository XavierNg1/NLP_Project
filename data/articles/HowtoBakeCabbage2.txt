 Set your oven to 425°F (218°C). While it heats up, make the most of your time by preparing the ingredients for the recipe. Preheating usually takes about 15 minutes, though this may vary depending on your oven., Add the salt, pepper, and sugar to a small mixing bowl. Use a utensil or your clean, dry hands to thoroughly mix these seasonings. Brush your rimmed baking sheet with 1 tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil using a pastry brush.If you don’t have a pastry brush, take a small, clean piece of paper towel and use it to spread the oil over the bottom of the baking sheet.
Alternatively, you can use a cooking spray to coat the sheet with oil. Be sure you are thorough. Missed spots could result in your cabbage sticking to the bottom.
 Place the wedged cabbage onto the baking sheet in a single layer. Use your pastry brush to cover the cabbage with the 2 tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil remaining. Sprinkle the wedges with your mixed seasonings., Insert your cabbage into the oven. Roast the cabbage in the oven until it is tender and begins to turn gold around the edges. This should take between 25 and 35 minutes.


Check tenderness by gently prodding the cabbage with a utensil, like a wooden spoon or fork., Remove your cabbage from the oven. While it’s still hot, drizzle balsamic vinegar over it, if desired. Add seasonings, like salt and pepper, to individual preference, and enjoy your roasted cabbage. Always use proper safety implements, like oven mitts and potholders, when handling hot items, like pans removed fresh from the oven.

 While any type of hair can be made into most styles with enough products and techniques, your natural hair type will determine how easy a style is to create and maintain.


If your hair is naturally straight and fine, it can be difficult to keep long hair looking volumized. You will need to invest in a curling iron if you want to add some waves or curls to your look.
If your hair is curly or frizzy but you want your hair to fall straight and look longer, you will have to straighten it using a flat iron or chemical relaxers.
If you are considering box braids, keep in mind that your hair's thickness will likewise determine the type of braid that works best. Thick hair can be much more difficult to braid into small strands. Likewise, thinner hair can be damaged if made into too-thick braids.;
, If your hair is very dry, this can be remedied with hair oils and other hair treatments. However, hair that is naturally very oily must be washed more often to look clean and stay hygienic. If you have oily hair, consider avoiding hairstyles that can come apart with frequent washings, such as box braids and dreadlocks., A major aspect of choosing a hairstyle is what you will be doing while wearing that style.


Long hair can be difficult for athletes to keep. If you have long hair and are about to engage in sports, wear a style that will keep your hair out of your face and prevent it from hindering your movements. Good choices are tied-back ponytails, secure buns, and braids.While most long hair styles are appropriate for women to wear in formal or business occasions, long hair for men can be more difficult to pull off. You will most likely need to tie your hair back in some way, either as a simple ponytail or as the currently trendy "man bun."

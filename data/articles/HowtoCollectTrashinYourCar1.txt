 Keeping trash bags in your car will help you collect trash as necessary instead of just tossing it onto the floor. Among the most inexpensive options is to use an empty tissue box. Fill it with plastic bags saved from trips to the grocery or convenience store, and grab a bag whenever you need one., If you’re not a fan of using disposable plastic bags, you can use a plastic or glass sealable food storage container. Typically used for storing cereal, you can find a storage container at a grocery or home goods store.Try sticking velcro strips to the bottom so you can secure the storage container to the floor.
You always can line it with a trash bag to easily dispose of the trash you’ve collected. To cut down on disposable plastic, just throw your trash in it, empty it out into your home trash receptacle, then wash it. Try using a container for recyclables and one for non-recyclable trash.
 Instead of using empty tissue boxes or cereal storage containers, you could always buy a trash can designed specifically for cars. Many models come with either strips that secure it to the car floor or straps that hang it from one of the front seats.You can buy one online or find one at an auto or home improvement store.

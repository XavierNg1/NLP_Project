 Alcohol can drain you off your energy reserves. Avoid drinking alcohol before bed-time as it can affect the quality of sleep—you might sleep the whole night through, but your body is not really resting when it is trying to process alcohol.If you are drinking alcohol, try to have your last drink at least two hours before you go to bed so that your body can process it before you lie down for the night.
 Tobacco is a stimulating agent which increases your heart rate, elevates your blood pressure and intensifies brain activity. These changes can lead to a lack of sleep and feelings of stress that can drain you of energy. Smoking, tobacco chewing etc are also addictive habits and can cause chronic fatigue.


If you don’t smoke, but spend time with smokers, try to remove yourself from the area when they light up. Second hand smoke can affect your health and energy levels too.
 When you drink sodas or other sugary drinks, your blood sugar levels spike and can give you energy. However, this energy is short lived and you will soon experience a ‘crash’ that saps you of energy and leaves you feeling fatigued.
 We have all had them—midnight cravings that leave your stomach rumbling as the clock strikes 12. While it can be a serious challenge, try to hold off on your midnight snacking and save the food for morning. When you snack in the middle of the night, you are much more likely to choose foods that are high in calories. Eating right before bed also causes your body to have to work to process the food while you sleep.When you wake up in the morning, you will most likely still feel really tired because while your brain was asleep, your body was processing your midnight snack.

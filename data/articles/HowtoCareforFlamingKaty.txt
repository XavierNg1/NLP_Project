 This is a plant that is happy to sit on the windowsill provided it doesn't get too hot. The preferred temperature is average warmth, although the cooler the room, the happier the plant will be.;
, It doesn't need a lot of watering. Too much watering can bring about root rot but too dry and the leaves will shrivel and turn yellow.
 However, if you don't remember, it'll still thrive. A standard liquid fertiliser is appropriate.
 Otherwise, don't worry about it. It's really only an aesthetics issue.
 Rather than trying to keep the plant flourishing after flowering, it's recommended that you take cuttings from it and grow new ones for the next year. And so on, for as long as you like. Cuttings should be placed in a soil-based compost.

 You don't want to sell something for too much, or people won't want to buy it. For example, you could sell bows for $2 and wallets for $5.;
, You can sell the crafts at school (kids). People will think they are REALLY cool. Be sure to tell them that you will be selling them. You can even take orders and you can make them a wallet in the colors of their choice!

, You can use a card table, maybe with a tablecloth over it. You might want to make a sign that says "DUCT TAPE CRAFTS" and another that has prices on it.
 You can sell your duct tape things at a festival, or at a big event when people rent booths to sell their things. If you don't have enough money to rent a booth, a family friend might be selling things and willing to share or just see what you can sell are school.

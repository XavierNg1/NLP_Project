 This point cannot be stressed enough. If your dog has a tendency to act aggressively toward other people or animals, he has no place in a restaurant. Bringing an aggressive dog to dinner can be a recipe for disaster. Do your fellow diners a favor and leave Killer at home.
 Even if your dog is an angel, she still needs to be on a leash when you hit up a restaurant. You might be able to control your dog, but you will have no control over distractions, unexpected incidents, or other people’s pets. Make sure Susie-Q is properly collared and leashed before you enter the restaurant., It’s important that you keep your dog close to you while dining out. Don’t leash Fluffy to the table, as this will give him the opportunity to socialize with other diners or even trip your waitress! Instead, tie his leash to your chair. This will limit his range and give you direct control over his movements.Don’t attach the leash to a table! This can result in spilled drinks and destroyed dinners if Rufus decides to run.
 If possible, you should aim to keep your pooch under the table while you are dining out. It’s safe under there. Curly won’t get kicked, tripped, or trampled by passersby and he’ll feel more secure while you’re enjoying your escargot.
 While you might think it’s cute that Beethoven eats dinner on your lap, it’s likely that your fellow diners do not. Moreover, in many restaurants it is against regulation to have a pet on a table or chair. This prohibition includes a purse placed on the table with Beethoven inside it., If you are dining out with your dog and a conflict with another pet arises, exit the restaurant. Ask your server for a doggy bag and leave. The last thing you or your fellow diners want to witness is a dogfight or a dog bite.

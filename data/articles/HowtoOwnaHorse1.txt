 Be sure you know that you will be spending at least £2,000/$1,835 at first, then roughly £120/$184 a month after that (per horse), depending on livery costs and how much you want to spend pampering them. Horses are living creatures and need a lot of care and attention. Make sure you're responsible enough and have the time to take care of one.;
, Buy some land near to where you live or rent a place for your future friend at some nearby livery stables. Remember, always check out the place before you finalise any details. Broken fence posts, rusty nails and steep ditches that are partial to getting waterlogged can be hazards to not only your horse but you as well.
 Some of the horses may have been mistreated so they may react badly or dangerously to certain things or need special care. Though, if you are experienced, it is better to buy a rescued horse than one in advertisements. Make sure you know what breed and type of horse you want and what event you want to ride in. You might not want to ride lots of events, maybe you're getting a horse for a pet to just take out on trails and the like. Also, pick a breed that is capable of what skills you need them to learn.

 Know that this is just a video game. It's not like in real life, there are bigger things than the video game.;
, Remember exactly what you did so you can get to the same point in the game again. It's likely that you'll be able to get back to that same point much faster than the first time.
 That will only get you angrier and unable to begin playing again.
 It won't help anyone and its likely the accused will be mad at you.
 Play another game for a little while. It might get your mind off of the lost progress on the other game.
 Take deep breaths, close your eyes, remember the happier times in your life.
 Such as a board game or doing something outside.
 Make sure your console is charged, that you have enough lives and that nobody will turn it off while you're in the bathroom.

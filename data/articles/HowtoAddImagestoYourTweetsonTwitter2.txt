 Depending on your phone, just search for the app either at the Google Play Store if you’re an Android user, or at the App Store if you’re using an iPhone. Once you find it, tap on the Twitter icon to view the app details, and then tap Install to download and install the app to your smartphone.
 Once you have the app installed, open it from your apps list. When the Twitter page opens, click on the “Sign In” button on the bottom right side, and log into your account with your username and password.
 Once your main feed is up, at the bottom of the screen you will notice a small white box where you type in your posts, and beside it is a small box with a mountain range icon on it. Tap on this to open your image library.
 Scroll through your phone images until you find it. Click on the image or images—you can select multiple pictures. Afterwards, tap the “Done” button on the top right side of the screen.
 After hitting “Done,” you will see the white box with your image in it. To post the picture, click on the “Tweet” button on the top of the screen to uploaded the picture to Twitter.

 Be sure that you have the bus to suit the controller. If you're using a fairly recent computer and are trying to install an early model serial port joystick, you may not be successful.;
, If your controller came with a disk, insert the disk and install it. If you did not receive a disk, plug in the device and install it from the control panel or allow Windows to install the controller itself.

 You should be able to find the herbs at a natural health foods store or a bulk foods store. They should be ground or in powder form:1/2 teaspoon Marshmallow root powder (soothing on inflamed tissues)
1/2 cup Slippery Elm Bark powder (reduces inflamed membranes)
1/4 cup of hot water
2 tablespoons of honey

, Put the 2 tablespoons of honey into a glass measuring cup and add enough of the hot marshmallow liquid to have a total of 1/2 cup. Pour this into a mixing bowl and discard the rest., Hollow out a well or a depression in the middle of the powder. Pour the honey/marshmallow solution into the well of the Slippery Elm Bark powder and, using clean hands, mix the ingredients together. Form small oblong shapes about the size of a grape (think lozenge size). You should get about 20 lozenges., This well help to reduce their “stickiness”. Place lozenges on a plate to let them dry for at least 24 hours.
 Once dry, wrap lozenges in waxed or parchment paper. Store in a cool, dry, and dark place. They should stay good for about 6 months., Just unwrap and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve in your mouth.


These lozenges are for adults but can be for children who are old enough for lozenges to be safe, usually over the age of 5. For children younger than 5 years, lozenges can be a choking hazard.

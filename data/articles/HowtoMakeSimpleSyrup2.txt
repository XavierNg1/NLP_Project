 Start with 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Stir the two together.
 This will take about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir the mixture occasionally.
 You can use crushed, dried herbs, but avoid using ground spices; they will be too hard to filter out. If you'd like to make several different flavors, pour the simple syrup into jars first, then add your desired herbs or spices. Here are some ideas to get you started:


4 cinnamon sticks, broken in half.1 tablespoon lemon, lime, grapefruit, or orange zest.1 tablespoon dried herbs, such as thyme, lavender, or rose petals.3 to 4 fresh rosemary, thyme, or lavender sprigs.1 cup (25 grams) fresh mint or basil leaves.Â½ vanilla bean pod, seeds scraped and added in., During this time, the herbs, spices, or flowers you added will steep and release their flavors into the simple syrup., They may look pretty in the jar, but they will shorten the shelf life of the syrup.Place a fine, mesh strainer or sieve over a glass jar or bottle, and pour the simple syrup through it. Discard the herbs, spices, or flowers that get caught in the strainer.


If you are filling a bottle, you might want to stick a funnel down the neck of the bottle first.
 Use it to sweeten or flavor iced teas, coffees, lemonades, and cocktails. It will last about 1 to 2 weeks.

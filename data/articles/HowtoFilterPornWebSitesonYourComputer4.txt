 If you want to filter what can and cannot be seen on the Internet, you can use OpenDNS. Schools and government offices use it, and free options are available.
 Once your account is created, set your internet settings to use the OpenDNS IP addresses as your domain name servers. You will then be able to customize your filter preferences.

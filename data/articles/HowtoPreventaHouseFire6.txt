 Use the crates when you are not home and when you're not awake, to prevent new dogs or puppies from chewing on electrical cords. This will also prevent pets from urinating on electrical objects and starting a fire.
 Use the safe room until the cat is calm and no longer hiding. Provide cats with edible oat or wheat grass, to prevent them from chewing on electrical cords.


Confine rabbits, chinchillas, and other pets when not supervising them, to prevent them from chewing on electrical cords, causing burns or electrical fires.

 Look up the words to the song if you have any confusion about what you're hearing. Keep singing along with the lyrics in front of you until you feel like you have them memorized, likely five or six times depending on the song.


As you get comfortable, close your eyes and sing sections to see if you have them down.
 While everyone is born with a set vocal "range," taking care of your voice and practicing vocal exercises can make the difference between nailing a song and struggling. And, though everyone has a set range, you need to practice in order to reach that range. to hit every note.


Always warm up your voice before singing.Try not to scream or yell during the day, as it strains your vocal chords.
Have a reference note on hand if you are having trouble staying in tune.
 Practice each verse on it's own, perfecting one before moving on to the next. Mastering the hard parts instead of trying to sing the entire song every time will highlight and eliminate mistakes faster.
 Keep singing the song until you feel comfortable, and don't be afraid to "make it your own" with little changes and personality. try to find an instrumental version of the song so that you can focus solely on your own vocals.


If you can, record yourself singing and listen in to find any mistakes.
Play a melody instrument, like a guitar or piano, so you can sing without the backing track to guide you.
 To make a song truly good you need to dive into why the song is important to you. Why did you choose to learn this song, and how do the lyrics affect you? By tapping into these feelings you'll start singing the song with a passion and uniqueness that will make the song shine.


Don't over think this -- just keep practicing until you concentrate less on the notes and more on the feelings behind them.

 Most people who want to write a book say they can’t find time to do it. If you’re bored at work, you probably have lots of time to get started on your masterpiece. Writing a book will help you feel productive and give you something to look forward to.Plus, if you force yourself to write every day, you’ll be finished with it in no time!


If you work in an office, you’ll look more productive while writing a book than you would surfing the internet or playing on your phone.
 There’s nothing more entertaining than going on your dream vacation. The second best activity is planning it. Use your phone or your computer to research the different places you’d like to visit and how much it will cost. Once you’ve planned out the logistics, create your savings goals to help you realize your dreams. Make sure no one catches you googling “beach vacations” while you’re on the clock.
 If you’re forced to be at work all day, you might as well squeeze a good workout in. If you work in an office, swivel from left to right in your desk chair to exercise your stomach muscles. If you walk a lot for your job, choose the stairs instead of the elevator.Some other examples include:

Doing squats in the break room to build your leg muscles
Sitting on an exercise ball instead of a chair to improve your balance

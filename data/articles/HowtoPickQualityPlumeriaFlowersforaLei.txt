 Flowers begin to bloom again about late November and will take time to see a good amount of bloomed flowers on a tree. The best times to do plumeria picking are the months of March and April.
 Flowers that resemble buds should be left on the tree so that they can bloom. Don't pick these off and toss it on the ground. You'll see many buds/unopened flowers around post-winter season., Try look for plumerias that just blossomed. These are the ones that are vibrant in color and have curls in the petals. If you are looking at white plumerias, good flowers have that "splash" of yellow in the center., Plumerias that are fully blossomed or have petals that "stretch" out may be more fragile than others. Especially the white ones, the petal may part away from the stem while making the lei. They're also fragile where the petal may come off by itself if the flower is not properly taken care of., This is the number one rule of picking flowers. Plumerias that have fallen off from the tree may be an invitation to bugs and other creatures that are attracted to the individual flower., Wilt is when the flower, usually happens faster with white ones, starts to turn brown. The edges will shrivel up first, then the coloring happens., During "May Day" and graduation ceremonies, people flock in yards to gather flowers. The flowers that rarely get touched are the ones at the very top or out of a person's arm reach. Grabbing and pulling down branches may help you get good flowers. Be careful not to snap the branch, since they are delicate and fragile themselves.

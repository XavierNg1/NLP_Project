 The navigation of your site is possibly the most important part of any given page. So it should be as accessible as you can make it. This means avoiding special effects like Flash, Java,or JavaScript as your only navigation method.;
, Keep your navigation meaningful. Make the links clear - don't try to get cute or use terms that are internal to your organization. Someone who has never been to your site before should know immediately where the link will take them.
 If you want to use images for your navigation, make sure that there is some text associated with them." Mystery Meat Navigation" is the use of non-descriptive images as navigation, and it's much more common than you might think.
 Your navigation should appear on every page of your site. While you don't need to have identical navigation, the basic structure should be the same throughout the site, with changes used only to indicate location within the hierarchy.

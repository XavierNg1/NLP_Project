 Chill for about half an hour or so. Chilled ingredients plus chilling the mix helps you to speed up the ice cream freezing really consistently/evenly.



Pour in the chilled ice cream mix.
Assemble churn and start: the hand cranking/or electric motor.
 The ice cream may be quite soft, if you like that. Keep churning for a firmer texture, for 35 to 45 minutes.



Or, instantly put it in a container and in your refrigerator-freezer, or as quickly as possible.

 Hair comes in a variety of textures—from limp and silky thin hair to frizzy and bouncy coarse hair—and you should style yours accordingly.


For instance, a short and choppy fast cut that works on straight, thin hair may not look good on someone with thick and curly hair.
 If you have thin hair with a silky texture, avoid wearing it in a long, blunt style that can make you look childish. Instead, favor volume-creating layers and try a shorter cut that hits at your shoulders or above.


Try to avoid blunt cut bangs; opt instead for a side swept look.
 If you have thick, coarse hair with natural curl or wave, don't cut it too short—you'll end up with "Christmas tree" hair that's full and bushy at the bottom before tapering up to your head. Hair that's prone to frizz usually needs a little length to weigh it down.


Consider cuts that start at the chin or below, and go longer if your hair is frizzier.
 If your hair is of medium thickness with a "normal" texture, you can use a short or long style. Play around with your hair and keep your face shape in mind.

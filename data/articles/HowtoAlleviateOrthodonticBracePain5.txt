 There is not a lot of leeway in when you might be able to schedule an appointment for a readjustment of your braces. But if you can, plan for a day when you do not have major deadlines or other activities that demand concentration and focus. Try to schedule an appointment towards the end of the day so you can go home immediately after the appointment and rest.
 Your mouth will be sensitive again for a couple of days after you get your braces readjusted and/or tightened. You should plan to eat soft foods like mashed potatoes, pudding, soups and similar foods for a couple of days

, Take an acetaminophen tablet before your appointment so that it will go into effect when during your appointment. This way, the pain and discomfort will be lessened immediately. Take another pain reliever 4-6 hours after the first one to continue to manage your pain!

, Now is the time to tell your orthodontist if you are having any issues with your braces or if you are noticing problems such as headaches or mouth sores that are not healing. There may be other adjustments that can be made to help alleviate or address these problems.

 Do the most important homework first, followed by the homework that isn't so important (etc. homework that has to be handed in tomorrow should be done first, followed by homework that's supposed to be handed in next week.);
, The best planner is a notebook, but it is fine if you prefer to do it on a computer using Microsoft Powerpoint or Microsoft Task Launcher as you can save your planner on the computer.
 Note that this does not work for everyone. Choose friends who want to study or do their homework, and do not want to meet up just to chit chat. Then, get down to business and finish it together. Do not copy homework. Just work in a group and ask if you do not know.
 If you manage to finish all your homework before you go home, you have the whole afternoon, evening and night free. You can also do it during free period, or in some occasions, when the teacher gives you free time to do it. Do not use this time to talk to your friends.
 It is best that you talk to a teacher or your parents for advice on how to do homework. They were students so they should know how to cope.
 If the homework given is too much, you can ask for an extension. However, if you feel that you can do it on time, then there is no need to do such a thing.
 Take a shower and do it immediately so that you won't have to suffer when it's nighttime, and you can't focus if you're doing your homework at 12AM.
 They are distracting. Also, do not surf the Internet. Steer clear of all these when doing your homework so you can finish it earlier. Remember, you can always do all of it after your homework is done.

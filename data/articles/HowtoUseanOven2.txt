 Make sure you read your oven's manual for the basics of using an electric oven. This should show you how to turn the oven on and off and how to do things like move the racks up and down in the oven.Make sure you know how to set the temperature. Electronic ovens usually allow you to punch in the temperature electronically and will then give an indication when the oven is ready. A light on your oven may go on or off or it may make a noise to indicate it's heated.
 Start preheating your oven while you begin preparing foods and baked goods if you're using an electronic oven. Gas ovens tend to heat quickly, but electric ovens need more time to reach the proper temperature.You should use an oven thermometer to make sure your electric oven is at the right temperature.
 Unless a recipe specifies an item should be placed on the upper or lower oven rack, always use the middle rack with an electric oven. This is the spot where the heat will be least likely to fluctuate during the cooking process. This will make your food cook more evenly throughout., Electric ovens tend to be fairly dry. Oftentimes, this can delay bread and other similar foods from rising. If you're struggling to make something like a pizza crust or loaf of bread rise, try adding a little steam to your electronic oven. You can pour a cup of hot water into a pan and then set it at the bottom of the oven. You can also open the oven a crack and use a spray bottle to spritz some water into the oven., You can use a diverse range of bakeware in an electric oven. However, different bakeware will yield different results. Make sure to use the right bakeware for what you're cooking.If you want browning around the sides and bottoms of your foods, go for metal bakeware.
If you want to decrease browning, go for glass or silicone products.

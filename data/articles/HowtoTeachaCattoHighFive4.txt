 Place ten dabs of tuna or your cat’s preferred reward around the rim of a saucer or small dish. Find a quiet spot and sit facing your cat.Place a chair or small table nearby, to the cat’s paw-side you want to use for the “high five” — that is, to your left and the cat’s right for the right paw.
Please note: This is the most involved method described in the article, and is a simplified version of one described by “clicker training” pioneer Karen Pryor.
 If the cat makes any type of movement toward the saucer, immediately “click + treat” by returning the saucer to the floor.If, however, the cat leaps onto the table after the treats, calmly return the cat to the floor and present the saucer for a treat.
If the cat makes no movement, lure it to move by sliding your hand toward the treat table. Immediately “click + treat” any movement.
 Take it up again in a few hours or the next day. Training before mealtime is often most effective., “Click + treat” only when the cat lifts its paw deliberately, then only clearly towards the treat.Become increasingly particular about the movements that you reward. Eventually make only an upward-lifted and extended paw worth a treat.
 Place your palm up, so that the cat’s paw brushes it on the way back down. Immediately “click + treat” contact with your hand., Keep going until your hand is at the cat’s shoulder height.Slowly but surely, you are making your hand, not the saucer, the cat’s focus.
 Make your cat reach ever further to contact your hand. Reward only deliberate, forceful contact.Remove the reward saucer from the process over time. Provide small hand-held treats as needed to keep the training going.
 Presenting your hand in this manner will become the cue for the action by the cat., Practice in different rooms and different environments. Let other people try by offering the cue. Add a verbal cue such as “high five” into the mix.

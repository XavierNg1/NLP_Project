 Just go down to a beach and if you find holes in the ground,you can wait till the crabs come out. If you scared them into their holes,you can wait till they come out(if you're one of those patient people) or if you see their legs inside the hole, go about 1/2 an inch away, and scoop the sand(you have to be really fast).;
, Get at least a 5 gallon (18.9Â L) tank and put down rocks( as an aquifer) then put down some sand or mud. If you get sand or mud from your backyard, make sure that it has gardening stuff in it.
,, they also enjoy hermit crab food and dried shrimp.
 Some fighting will go on, but don't be afraid, it's natural for them to fight for females, territory, holes, and food.

 This step may not seem intuitive to most new boxer owners. However, this step generally makes dogs less aggressive, so it should be your first step when trying to teach your dog not to bite., Boxers are highly social animals, and they enjoy being around other dogs, especially boxers.Dogs teach other dogs how much biting is appropriate; when a dog stops playing and bites too hard, that dog is ostracized for a bit.In addition, try letting your dog get to know other people. The more people your dog knows, the calmer he'll be when he meets new people.Therefore, try taking your dog out to socialize. A dog park is a good place to provide socialization.
 Boxers usually bite when they are stressed or frightened. If you know a particular situation is going to stress your boxer out, don't take him. For instance, if he's not used to social situations, don't take him to a big crowd on his first outing. Work up to crowds gradually. Though your dog may be able to work up to these situations when properly trained, when he's first starting out, try to keep his stress down., When your dog bites, yelp and walk away. Go to another room if possible. Stay away for at least a minute. That teaches the dog that this type of behavior results in the end of your attention., If your dog is too aggressive and has a history of biting, use a muzzle to keep people safe and to seek professional help at the earliest possible time. Some signs that the dog is behaving aggressively and more likely to bite are:


Protecting toys or food
Weight forward, head lowered, raised lips, ears back, direct stare

, Contact a dog trainer or animal behaviorist in your area. These professionals can help you get your dog under control. They may be able to see the key to why your dog is biting when you can't because they know more about dog behavior than you do; they can read a dog's body language without anthropomorphizing it, meaning they won't interpret dog behavior through the lens of human body language.

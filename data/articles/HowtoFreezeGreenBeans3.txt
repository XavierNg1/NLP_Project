 Allow the oil to heat up.
 Stir them around using a wooden spoon until they are evenly coated in oil. They will start to thaw and release water. Cook the green beans until the water has evaporated.

 Serve hot as a side dish, or place over spinach and other salad greens for a great textural contrast.

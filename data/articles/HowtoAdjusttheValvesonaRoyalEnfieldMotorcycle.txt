 Notice as you do whether the kicker just goes down without encountering very hard compression. If so, the valves may be too tight. If, part way down, the kicker comes to a point it takes effort to push past, the valves are not too tight. Now we have to find out if they are too loose.
 If the valves do not clatter more than seems reasonable, they are fine. If there's a racket, they're too loose. Now that the motor is warmed up, we're ready to adjust them., Watching for the instant the amp meter flicks back to center is a good way to do this (remember, the ignition switch and the kill switch have to be "on" for the amp meter to work)., That will give you more room to swing wrenches., You should be able to just make them turn. If you can not make them move they are too tight. If you can make them spin freely, they are too loose., You have to hold the top adjustment nut while you do this., Put another wrench on the bottom adjustment nut. Turn the bottom nut counter-clockwise as viewed from above to loosen the valve. To tighten the valve, turn the bottom adjustment nut clockwise as viewed from above. Simple. When satisfied, tighten the lock nut., Sorry, that's just the way it is, we're not dealing with computer chips here. Getting the adjusters to just the right point where snugging up the lock night brings them to perfection takes even an expert a few tries., This is a matter of error and trial. Don't set the valves the night before and wait to test them until your mates arrive for the big ride the next morning!

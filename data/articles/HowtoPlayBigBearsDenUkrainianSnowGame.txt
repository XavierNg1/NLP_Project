 Use a large stick or the end of a shovel. See note under "Tips" for square size needs.;
, The inner square is the Big Bear's den.
 This player must stand in Big Bear's den.
 Big Bear must yell "Big Bear is coming!". Big Bear must hold his/her hands together and dash out of the den into the larger square, chasing the other players. The aim is to touch another player.
 Once Big Bear has touched another player, the two of them must return to the den, holding hands.
 This time, both players yell out "The bears are coming!". Again, they both dash out of the den into the larger square chasing the other players. They must keep holding hands and tag another player together. The newly tagged player returns to the den with the other two and joins hands.
 Each time, players must keep holding one another's hands as they run out of the den. This gets very challenging for the remaining players to dodge!

, The last player left becomes Big Bear for the next game. If you decide not to play again, that player is the winner.

 If your trunk is unlocked by any chance, but the cab is locked with your keys inside, open it and look around inside for the emergency open trunk cord that opens into the car. It is often in the trunk "door" or the roof of the trunk.
 Once you find the cord, pull it. This will unlock the back passenger seats allowing them to fall forward in some models of car. This is a common feature in some sedans.
 Once the passenger seats are unlocked, push them forward. Now you can climb into the car through this new entry, and unlock a back passenger door yourself manually.

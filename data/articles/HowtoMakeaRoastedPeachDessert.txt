 Once thawed, cut into 2x2 inch squares, wash eggs and sprinkle granulated sugar. Bake in a pre-heated 400 °F (204 °C) oven for 30-40 minutes until golden brown.;
, After boiling, reduce to low heat and add 3-4 strips of zest from the lemon and lime, and half of the basil and mint leaves. Let simmer for another 5 minutes on low heat.
 Mix the herbs and zest with 400g of sour cream in a small bowl and keep refrigerated.
 Blend until smooth, and adjust to taste with lemon juice and icing sugar. Run the sauce through a fine strainer by using the back of a spoon or a ladle to push in a circular motion.
 Add them to the syrup and poach at a low heat for about 5 minutes. Then remove them from syrup and allow them to cool enough to handle by hand to remove the skin. Once the skin is removed, lay them into an oven-proof pan half-side down with ½ cup of syrup (optional: add 2 tbsp of rum to the pan). Dust the peaches with icing sugar and roast in a pre-heated 400 °F (204 °C) oven for 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
 With a knife, carefully slice the puff pastry sideways in half so that there is a top and bottom slice. Place a tablespoon of sour cream mix on the center of the plate. Place a tablespoon of sour cream mix on the top of the bottom slice of puff pastry, and place it on top of sour cream on the plate. Place one peach, half-side up, on top of the puff pastry and add a second peach, half-side down, on top of the other peach. Place the top slice of puff pastry on top of the peach. Finally, drizzle the strawberry coulis around the plate. Enjoy!!

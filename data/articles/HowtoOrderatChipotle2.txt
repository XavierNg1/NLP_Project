 As with most standard quesadillas, it includes cheese on a large flour tortilla. It is not on the menu, but your friend behind the glass will know how to make it.
 You will receive burrito ingredients wrapped in a cheesy quesadilla.Order half the ingredients of a burrito with this option, and they might call it a “burritodilla,” because it’s flatter, like a quesadilla., For a small additional charge, you can get cheese, beans, meat and salsa on top of fresh tortilla chips., You can ask for extra rice or an extra tortilla for free. One “hack” includes ordering a burrito bowl and asking for a free tortilla. You can even get the tortilla draped inside of the bowl under all the toppings. It's the best of both worlds: the amount of food in the bowl and the soft, warmness of a burrito-sized tortilla.
 You can fit more food when it comes with a bowl. Ask for the free tortilla to make your own mini burrito., Order both black and pinto beans, or half one type of meat and half of another type of meat.

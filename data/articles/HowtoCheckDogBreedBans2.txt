 When traveling with your pet, you may find that certain airlines and certain hotels will ban specific breeds. It's always best to check with the specific company you're traveling with before trying to bring your dog. You don't want to be stuck somewhere with no place to spend the night because your dog can't come in.You also need to check local laws when bringing your pet somewhere. If the city you're traveling in has a ban on your dog, it's obviously not a good idea to bring it with you. Look on the city's website, as well as the state's website, to see if your dog is welcome in that area., Some businesses are dog-friendly. However, even among dog-friendly businesses, many do not allow certain dogs. Always call and check with the business before turning up with your dog, so you don't waste a trip.


Note there are exceptions for service dogs. Under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), service dogs are excluded from breed bans. However, if it's determined that a specific dog poses a direct threat to others, it can be included in the ban.

 There should be one less coin/token than the number of players. (if there are 5 players, place 4 coins/tokens)

, You can use coins/tokens both with or without the deck.
 Then the other players must also take one coin/token each. Once all the coins/tokens have been taken, the player without one has to leave the game.

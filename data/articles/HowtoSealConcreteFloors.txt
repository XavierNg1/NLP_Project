 Dirt, dust, dead bugs, nails and other materials need to be completely removed in order to prep the concrete floors for sealing.
, The degreasing product will lift any oils that have soaked into the concrete floor over time. Simply mix the solution as instructed on the package (usually by diluting in a bucket of water) and spreading across the concrete floor using a brush or mop.
, Simply use clean water and mop and squeeze repeatedly until the degreasing product and any dirt and debris has been removed.
 This process may take up to 24 hours. You may accelerate this process by placing dehumidifiers and fans blowing onto the concrete surface.
 This will ensure that you have created a completely level surface before sealing. Simple squeeze the filler into the cracks and smooth with a putty knife.

Use a paint brush to first seal around the edges of the room.






Use a paint roller with an extension pole to apply the sealer over the rest of the floor. Work from one corner of the room toward an exit so that you do not box yourself in.
 Usually about 12 to 24 hours. Again, this process can be aided by fans or dehumidifiers.

 Though there are some blogs that run a multi-fandom blog, it tends to be less confusing for everyone if you stick to one, maybe two at the max. Remember, you can always make another blog for your other fandom.;
, If someone is unsure what your blog is going to post about, they may not follow it. Don't be a name hoarder, who takes great usernames without using them, and don't beg someone for a username either.
 Either you make it yourself or use one someone else created, it should stand out and be beautiful. I don't advise using the free ones Tumblr already has. If you have good HTML skills, you can personalize it and add little graphics to make it more like your fandom.
 If you run a Supernatural blog, for example, try following blogs that have many followers and post Supernatural things you like and could reblog to get more followers.
 If you reblog or do something that relates to your fandom, always add a lot, almost excessive amount of tags. If someone is scrolling through those tags, they might see your post and follow you!

, Draw things, write fanfiction, or even join a roleplaying ring if that's something you're into. You do not have to post just things from your fandom. In fact, it's better if you don't, or someone may get bored and unfollow.

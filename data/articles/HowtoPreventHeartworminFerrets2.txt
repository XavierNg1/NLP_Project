 Heartworm medication can help kill larvae that are transmitted to your ferret and help prevent infection. These drugs, however, usually cannot kill adult heartworms. They are administered either daily or monthly depending on the drug your vet recommends. Your vet will need to examine your ferret in order to make the best assessment of what drug is best for your ferret.Your vet will likely prescribe the long-time preventative drug ivermectin, or a new, but highly favorable combination of imidacloprid and moxidectin. Go with whatever they recommend.Preventative medications are most often prescribed as monthly oral tablets. Your vet may even prescribe a medication designed for cats and direct you to break tablets into portions based on your ferret's weight.
 Ask your vet about testing your ferret for heartworm before administering preventative medication. Taking preventative medication can be dangerous if your ferret is already infected with developing heartworms. Most of the time, an infection will be apparent, but it may be worth having your vet do a blood test before beginning a preventative medication routine., Preventative heartworm medication regimens sometimes need to be administered year-round. Depending on where you live, a shorter mosquito season may allow you to administer preventative heartworm medication for only part of the years. Warm, humid climates have the longest and most dangerous mosquito seasons.Provide ongoing preventative heartworm medication to your ferret if you live in an area that is hospitable to mosquitos year-round, such as the Southeastern U.S.
If your ferret does not like to eat their medication, try crushing it up and mixing into something you know they life to eat.

 If you're going to just clean things up a bit, now is the time to do it.


If you have hair clippers, set it to a depth that suits you—1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) suits a lot of people. Trim carefully for a clean look.
No clippers? Use a pair of sharp scissors, and snip away evenly to a length that suits you.
If you're going under the blade, soak in the bath for a bit to soften the skin and hair up. Things will go a lot more smoothly, and you will have a much more pleasant experience.
Some people have taken to shaving their pubic hair into a variety of interesting shapes and patterns. If you and your partner favor this look, go for it!

Note that when you shave, within a couple days it could get really itchy. Apply moisturizing lotion to minimize discomfort.
 Cleanse and rinse the pubic region thoroughly, taking care to wash the outside of your pubic mound with soap.


Don't use soap on your labia or in your vagina—this can lead to irritation and infections

, You want to wash away soapy residue, both to get rid of the perfumed scent, and to inhibit bacterial growth of the unpleasant kind.
 Clean and rinse your pubic area after removal, and before replacement.



Keep your clean, unused undergarments in a cool, dry place, and care for them well—make sure you dry them as soon as you wash them. Otherwise, you risk your clothes smelling worse than you did.

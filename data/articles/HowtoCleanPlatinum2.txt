 A cookie sheet should work as long as it is deep enough to fit your platinum and have it completely covered in the solution. Make sure the foil has the shiny side facing up. Wrap the foil all the way around the edges of the pan to secure it. Spread your platinum pieces on the foil., Combine one cup of boiling water with one tablespoon of salt and one tablespoon of baking soda. Stir the ingredients together until they are thoroughly mixed.
 Carefully pour the the baking soda, salt and water solution into the pan. If your platinum moves when you pour over it, you can use a spoon to reposition the jewelry so it is flat., Pour half a cup of white vinegar to into the pan. The vinegar will activate the base solution and cause the it to begin bubbling. Leave the platinum in the bubbling solution for five to ten minutes., Remove your jewelry from the pan. Run some lukewarm water and rinse each item until the solution and tarnish has been completely removed. Dry each piece with a lint-free towel for a nice shine.

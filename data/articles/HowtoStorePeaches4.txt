 If you've already cut open a ripe peach, brush lemon juice over all cut surfaces of the fruit.


The acidic lemon juice should help prevent the cut flesh from browning too quickly. If you don't have lemon juice, orange juice or a solution made from concentrated citric acid would work just as well.
 Arrange the peach halves, quarters, or slices in a plastic container or thick plastic bag. Firmly seal the container to block out excess air.


If using plastic bags, seal the majority of the opening, leaving only a small gap. Squeeze as much air out of this gap as possible or use a straw to suck the air out. Afterward, finish sealing the bag
You can place multiple peaches in the same bag or container, but avoid stuffing the container since doing so could damage the fruit.
 Place the sealed peaches in the refrigerator and use them within one or two days.


Note that cut peaches do not last as long as whole peaches, so you should only use this method if you've already cut the peaches and need to save the leftovers.
While peaches generally taste best when served at room temperature, allowing cut peaches to sit out at room temperature is not recommended since it may speed up the browning of cut surfaces. Enjoy these peaches directly from the refrigerator, if possible.

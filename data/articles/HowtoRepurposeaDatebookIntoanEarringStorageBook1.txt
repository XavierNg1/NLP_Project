 You need to be certain that your earring supply will fit inside the book you choose.

Assess your collection and consider both how many earring pairs you have and how you will categorize your earrings (studs on one or two pages, hoops on another, etc.).

;
, Once you're certain of the size required, choose a book that meets this need. The book must be in good condition and needs to be one that you can re-use.


Look for a sturdy cover and binding. An old organizer that is worn or misshapen wonâ€™t work very well for this project.






Make sure you are truly finished using the planner before transforming it into your earring storage case.

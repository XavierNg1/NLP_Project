 Chicago's Union Station, along with holding many trains arriving there, also houses a train that takes you directly to a station in Los Angeles. Whether it's the 24 hour trip directly from New York to Chicago on the Lake Shore Limited (pricey but most direct), or it's one of several routes south to Washington, D.C. and which lead you later northwest to Chicago can also get you to this city's Amtrak station.


Your other choices include a Northeast Regional train to a Capital Limited line at Washington D.C., or a Cardinal Line directly to Chicago from Washington to Chicago.;
, This train will take 4 days to get from one end to the other, but it's well worth it. And besides, it's the only train that Amtrak runs that runs between these two cities.


Realize that you have another choice of path that can take an adjusted route through the northern section of Texas called the "Texas Eagle" line of Amtrak.
 The train duration of travel takes about 45 minutes. This station is less than one block from Anaheim Stadium and is about a fifteen minute from Disneyland.

 Do not perform any unnecessary movement of the affected shoulder for at least two weeks after reduction (putting the shoulder back into the socket). During this time, the joint is at its most unstable and is highly susceptible to further dislocation.


Keep the arm in a sling whenever possible and apply ice to help with the swelling. A doctor may prescribe medication for pain, as well as anti-inflammatory drugs; use these as directed.
It is important to keep your injured shoulder within a 90-degree movement plane from your body (90 degrees in front and to the sides). Moving beyond this point increases the likelihood of further injuring your shoulder.
 While your shoulder is healing, it is important to learn proper positioning for maximum stabilization and health. The position recommended is called the “packed” position.


This involves the shoulders being pulled down and backward, as well as rotated outward. A good way to think about this is to pretend you have a tennis ball between your shoulders that you are trying to hold in place.
Another way to get into this position is to hold your arms at your sides and bend your elbows into a 90-degree angle. Once in this position and without moving your elbows, move your hands away from each other until you feel your shoulder and back muscles lightly contract. This will be called the standard position and is how each of the following exercises begins.

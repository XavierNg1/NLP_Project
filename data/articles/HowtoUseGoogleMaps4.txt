 When you're planning an outing, it can be helpful to know ahead of time where restaurants, shopping centers, and so on are relative to the place you're visiting. Finding businesses near a given location on Google Maps is easy. To start, just find this location with the search bar with its name or address.
 When you find your location, the standard information panel should appear. Look for the small link that says "Search nearby" in this panel (it's underneath text that says "Explore this area.")



Mobile: On mobile, instead of using a "Search nearby" feature, you can just click once on the map to de-select your location. Any searches you make after this will be in the area surrounding the part of the map you're viewing.
 Now, you just need to describe what you're looking for to get a list of relevant results. When possible, your query should be written in the plural (e.g., "restaurants," "barbers," etc.)



Mobile: With your location centered in the map, clear the search bar and type in your query.

 A small pothole, less than two feet square can be repaired with about 50 pounds of cold mix asphalt filler.;
, Cold asphalt filler (a mixture of asphalt tar and rocks) is sold in plastic bags similar in size to cement bags weighing 50 pounds, and buckets ranging from one gallon to five gallons.
 If the material in the hole is dry soil, you may want to use a garden hose to dampen it because the tar will not stick to dry dirt.
 You can also use a fan or blow dryer if you are in a hurry.
 For repairs where the material underneath the patch is not capable of being compacted with normal methods, you may want to over-excavate the hole and pour concrete to about two inches below the finished pavement grade to stabilize the area.
 This will leave the finished patch level with the pavement after it is packed.
 Make sure the cold asphalt mix is packed firmly into the hole or you will find the patch will fail quickly when it is exposed to traffic.
 You can put a board or piece of plywood over the fix for a few days to ensure that it hardens more but this is optional. If you packed it down tightly, it can be driven over immediately.

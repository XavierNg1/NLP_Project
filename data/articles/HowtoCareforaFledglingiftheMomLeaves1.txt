 This is a normal phase of bird life that humans often misunderstand, as most fledglings that humans come across don't actually need our help.


A nestling, on the other hand, should not be out of the nest yet. A nestling does not have all of its feathers and can't stand up or perch yet. If you have found a nestling, instead of a fledgling, it is more likely to need your help.;
, It's normal for fledglings to be out of the nest and on the ground. In fact, the parents will still feed it when it is on the ground. If the bird is in danger on the ground, however, place it in a tree and out of harms way. At the fledgling developmental stage it should be able to perch, so place it on the branch of a bush a bit off the ground.


If the bird is in your backyard, keep your cats or dogs inside.
Be aware that if the bird is very young and has no feathers, it is a nestling and it probably won't survive out of the nest.
 Pay attention to bird noises and other birds around. Chances are that the fledglings parents will return to it within the hour.

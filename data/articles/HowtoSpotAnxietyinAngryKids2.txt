 All children will get angry from time to time. Your child may also express irritability or have tantrums. If your child gets angry multiple times every day, if it causes problems at school or with family, or if the angry behavior is putting your child in danger, it is not a normal amount of anger.


If you start to notice too many anger issues from your child, start keeping a log of how frequently they happen. This will help you look at the big picture and determine if your child may be suffering from a greater anxiety problem., As children get older, they should grow developmentally out of tantrums and angry outbursts. Generally, tantrums and other angry behavior stops around the age of seven or eight.If your child is still displaying anger beyond this age, the anger may be related to anxiety.
 Often, anger is the way a child reacts due to their severe anxiety. They are unable to cope with situations in any way other than lashing out. Many times, the source of this anger is the trigger for the anxiety, like school.To identify the source of the anxiety, pay close attention to when your child gets angry. Is it at school? If so, the stress of school or their peers may cause them anxiety. Other sources may be interacting with people, going to a place different than home, or being forced to do an activity that causes them anxiety and stress.

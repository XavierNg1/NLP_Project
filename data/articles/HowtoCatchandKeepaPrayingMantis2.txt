 Buy a small aquarium or terrarium at any pet store, or use any plastic container about the size of a shoebox. Make sure the container has a lid that will stay firmly on.
 Wash it with soap and water, making sure to rinse all the soap out properly. Make sure there are no harmful chemicals or anything else that could poison your mantis.
 If you're buying a cage from a pet store, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you're making your own from a box or other container, you may have to poke small air holes so that your mantis can breathe. Make sure the holes are large enough to let air in but small enough that your mantis won't be able to escape through them.
 Add a small layer of dirt at the bottom of the container. You can also add pebbles, sticks, or leaves. Then add plants and branches that your mantis can climb on. Make sure there are plenty of fresh leaves and sticks big enough to hold or hide your mantis.


Make sure to change the leaves in the cage often. When they start to wilt, go limp, or turn brown, remove the old leaves from the cage and replace them with new, fresh ones. This will help make sure your cage is always a nice, happy place for your pet mantis.

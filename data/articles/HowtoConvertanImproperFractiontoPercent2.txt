 To multiply a fraction by 100, multiply the numerator by 100. Keep the same denominator.You can also think of multiplying the fraction by 1001{\displaystyle {\frac {100}{1}}}. Note that 100÷1=100{\displaystyle 100\div 1=100}, so 1001=100{\displaystyle {\frac {100}{1}}=100}. It doesn’t matter if you multiply by the whole number or the fraction, since they mean the same thing.

For example:1310×100{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{10}}\times 100}13×10010{\displaystyle {\frac {13\times 100}{10}}}130010{\displaystyle {\frac {1300}{10}}}


, The numerator is the top number, the denominator is the bottom number. You will likely need a calculator to do this, or you can do it manually.

For example, 1300÷10=130{\displaystyle 1300\div 10=130}.
 The percent sign goes after the number, and helps avoid confusion. Remember that a percent is not the same thing as a decimal or whole number, so you need to denote a percent with the appropriate sign.

For example, 130%{\displaystyle 130\%}

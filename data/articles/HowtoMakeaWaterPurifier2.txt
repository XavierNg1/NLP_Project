 Boiling is widely viewed as the safest way to purify water. Pre-filter cloudy water with a coffee filter or folded cloth.


Boil the water for one full minute, then let cool and drink. If you are above 2,000 feet (609.6 m) altitude, boil for three minutes.
Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it’s boiling.
Make a cotton and charcoal filter. Crushed charcoal in a cotton trap will work well in removing the impurities and some of the bad taste from the boiled water when you filter through it. Charcoal will also help in capturing some of the toxins that other methods will not catch.
 Using bleach should not be attempted unless boiling water is not possible. Make sure that it is unscented and soap-free bleach. Household bleach should contain between 5-6% bleach.For two liters of water, you will need to add 5 drops of bleach. Mix vigorously and let stand for at least 30 minutes. If the water is particularly cloudy, double the bleach and let stand for at least 60 minutes.
 SODIS stands for solar water disinfection. Fill transparent PET bottles half full with water. Shake them repeatedly to mix oxygen into the water, then fill the bottles to the top and cap them. Place the bottles in a location that will receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.


This method works best if the bottles are angled towards the sun and are resting on a conducive material such as a corrugated tin roof.
Glass bottles are ineffective for this method, as they block crucial UV rays.

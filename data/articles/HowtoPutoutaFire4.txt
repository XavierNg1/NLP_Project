 Consider having a few in easy to reach locations and make sure everyone in your household knows how to use them. Keep one in the basement, one in the kitchen, and one elsewhere in the house, like near the sleeping quarters. They're good for several years, but get them tested out regularly and recharged to make sure they'll be ready when you need them.
 Check your fire alarms every month to make sure the batteries are in good condition and change them out regularly. Having the right warning system in place can give important extra minutes that can be the difference between an inconvenience and a disaster.
 Never overload outlets or power strips with chords. Avoid plugging in more chords than an outlet can handle to eliminate the possibility of dangerous electrical fires. Regularly unplug unused appliances to avoid needless circuits.


Use space heaters wisely. Keep flammable clothing and other substances clear of space heaters and other devices that might catch things on fire.
 More than one-third of home fires begin with candles. Please remember not to leave candles unattended and make sure they're far enough from drapes and other cloth that could start a fire. Always put them out safely and make sure candles are entirely out before you leave them unattended.


Consider using battery or electric-operated heaters in lieu of open flame candles. You can get all the aromatic benefits of burning candles without the risk of fire.

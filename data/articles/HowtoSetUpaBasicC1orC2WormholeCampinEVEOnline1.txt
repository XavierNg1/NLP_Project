, High security systems tend to have a lot of traffic, and can have unwanted visitors and/or inhabitants in their wormholes. Look at the color of the wormhole on the inside. If it's red, leave it behind, but if it's a blue-green, then it may be a C1 or C2.
 This is very important! After bookmarking the wormhole, warp to a planet (do not warp to a moon because an inhabitant may have a POS located on it) and drop a bookmark halfway. Warp to the bookmark, launch probes, and cloak; remember to run d-scans as you travel through the system.
 Watch out for ships and POS modules. If you locate a POS, check if it is online or not by turning force fields on on your overview and running a d-scan within range of the tower. There should be no force field and no inhabitants. If there is someone living inside, then quickly hop out and find another hole.

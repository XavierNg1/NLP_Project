 White, French, or sourdough sandwich bread will work great for this, but you can also use other types as well, such as wheat. Do not use baguette for this.


For a tasty twist, use mayonnaise instead of butter., Place one of the bread slices, buttered-side-down on the cutting board. Layer the ham and cheese on top, then press the final bread slice on top. Make sure that the buttered side is facing up. When you grill the sandwich, the butter will help make the bread nice and crispy.The number of slices of ham and cheese does not have to be exact. You can use more/less of ham or cheese depending on your personal taste.
Cheddar is the most popular choice, but you can also use other cheeses as well, such as Comt√©, Gouda, Gruyere, Monterey Jack, or Swiss.
For an added punch of flavor, add some ranch dressing on top of the ham and cheese before you put the final slice of bread down., Place a skillet on the stove and let it get hot; you do not need to add any butter on it. Once the skillet is hot enough, place the sandwich on it and let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
 The sandwich is ready when the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown.Use a heavy pot to press the sandwich down before you flip it and just before you take it off the skillet. This will flatten the sandwich and make it easier to eat., You can serve it as it is, or add a side, such as chips or fries.

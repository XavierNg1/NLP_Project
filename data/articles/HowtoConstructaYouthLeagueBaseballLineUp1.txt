 The first step to putting together a batting order and defense lineup is to know who your players are, and what they do or don’t do well. This discovery process is a crucial first step to balancing your lineup and improving your baseball team’s offense. There are a few major categories that every offensive player will fall into, and some of the batters in your lineup might fall into more than one category.


If a player on your team does more than one thing well, it is important to determine which of those strengths will benefit the team the most.Conduct a series of scrimmages to determine each player's strengths and weaknesses.;
, Power hitters generally have higher strikeout totals or at least more swings and misses. They have the ability to hit the ball a long ways but it doesn’t always equate to speed which can turn into a liability., Contact hitters typically have very low strikeout counts along with low power hits. Contact hitters are very good at putting the bat to the ball. Their lack of strikeouts is a benefit in some regards, but putting a contact hitter in the wrong spot could have a negative effect on your team’s offense., There is typically a lot of overlap between a speedsters and the contact hitters. There is enough distinction between the two to treat them separately. Speedsters are important to have on the bases. They pose as a threat to steal a base which can distract opposing pitchers. Again, speedsters must be strategically placed in your team’s lineup or they will have little to no effect., There are some players who are in the lineup because they have a defensive skill that you need. These players, when they come up to bat, can be a risk. They can be used properly and a useful asset to scoring more runs.

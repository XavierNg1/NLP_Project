 Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit (176° Celsius). Grease and flour three 8 x 2 inch round cake pans., In a small bowl beat the eggs, strawberry puree, vanilla extract, an strawberry extract using a fork. Mix until the egg yolks break and the wet ingredients are well-combined., In a large bowl whisk the cake flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir until the dry ingredients are properly combined and folded in., Add the butter into the flour mixture, only adding a couple tablespoons at a time. Pour in the vegetable oil and blend on low speed for about a minute until the cake batter is crumbly., Slowly pour in only half of the wet ingredients. Blend on high speed for about three minutes and then add the rest of the wet ingredients. Mix until the cake batter resembles a bright pink color and is creamy. There should be no more flour streaks., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the strawberry cake batter and pour it into both cake pans. Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides., Place both cake pans in the oven and have the cake bake for about 30-35 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat., Flip both cake pans on a wire rack. Leave the cakes to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost., Stack both cakes together with frosting to form a bigger strawberry cake. Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers., Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

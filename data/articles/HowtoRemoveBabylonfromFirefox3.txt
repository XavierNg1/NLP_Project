 You can get to this menu a few different ways:


Type "about:addons" into the address bar.
Click the menu button (it looks like three horizontal lines in the top right of the Firefox window). Select "Add-ons" from the menu. Its icon looks like a jigsaw piece., On the next screen, you'll see the various add-ons you have installed for Firefox. The "Remove" buttons will allow you to get rid of each one individually. Remove every Babylon extension you see.


Be sure you're under the "Extensions" tab â€” not "Appearance" or "Plugins."

, If you see a "Restart now" notice while you are removing the Babylon add-ons, take the opportunity to restart Firefox. The browser will close and re-open. This allows Firefox to make the internal changes to completely remove the extensions.

 Around 80 feet (24.4 m) deep is a good place to start. It is a smart idea to fish an area with a fairly flat bottom with no obstructions (such as trees, rocks).
 Switch your reel to “free-spin” (allows to reel to spin freely, releasing line) by releasing the drag clicker. Put your lure into the water and allow it to feed out about twenty feet. Lock the drag clicker to stop your line and put your rod in the holder.
 Clip the line release clip onto the line (there should be a mark on the clip to show where to clip it on) then lower the cannonball into the water.

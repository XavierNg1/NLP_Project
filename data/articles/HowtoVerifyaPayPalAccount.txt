Verified PayPal users pay fewer fees and have fewer restrictions, like lower limits, on the amount of money you can send, receive, or withdraw.
 To become verified in the United States, you must complete two of the following three steps:


Provide and link a bank account and routing number, then, if instant linking is not available, verify the amounts of small deposits that PayPal will make in two to three business days;
Provide and link a debit or credit card number, along with the expiration date, billing address, and card security code, then verify a code contained in the description of a transaction that PayPal will initiate in one to two business days; or
Provide your Social Security Number.
The requirements for verification differ from country to country. Follow the onscreen steps for verification to learn what you need to do to verify your account.

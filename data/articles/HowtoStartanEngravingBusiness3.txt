 Engraving is a visual business, and people need to see examples of your work. You may have a signature item such as business cards. This is something that you can mass produce and send to prospective customers.


Send a letter introducing your business and samples of your work. Send this to your family, friends, or companies that you would like to get business from.
 Network with your local chamber of commerce, small business association, or engraving professionals. Many of these groups have regular meetings. Advertise your engraving business in local publications and at trade shows.Craft shows, wedding shows, and home and garden shows are ideal for an engraving business. Sing up to be a vendor at these shows.
You may also join a professional organization such as the Awards and Recognition Association (ARA) that works to promote the engraving industry.
Read engraving industry magazines like Awards & Engraving, Recognition Review Magazine, and Custom Gift Retailer Magazine.
 Build a website and make flyers and business cards. Your website should have information about your business, photos of your work, pricing information, and an online order form. Distribute your flyers at trade shows, local commerce meetings, and to your friends and family.



Direct mailing to potential customers is also a great way to gain new customers. Make sure that any advertisement that you develop has examples of your work.

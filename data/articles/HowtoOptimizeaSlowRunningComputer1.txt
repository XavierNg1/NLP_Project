 If you are noticing your computer running a little slower than usual, you may want to simply restart your machine. When you restart your computer you are not only closing out of old programs but you are allowing your PC or Mac to check for new updates.;
, Another way to improve the speed of your computer quickly and easily is by closing out of applications that you are not currently using. By having a ton of applications and programs open at once, you are putting unnecessary strain on the speed and performance of your device.
 Always check for the latest updates to your operating system. These are usually free and can be found by going to the App Store on your Mac or your operating system's webpage. Once the update has completed, restart your computer in order for the changes to take place.
 While it may seem unnecessary, making sure that your recycling or trash bin is empty is essential for optimizing your computer's performance. Simply double-click on your trash or recycling bin and then select "Empty All."

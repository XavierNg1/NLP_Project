 If you register for infant formula for your baby shower and make it clear that you would really appreciate gifts of formula, you may be able to get several months’ worth of infant formula without spending a dime.
 If you need free infant formula, ask that your friends and family give you formula on Mother’s Day, your birthday, as a new baby gift, or for whatever gift-giving holiday is coming next.

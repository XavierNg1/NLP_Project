 Another easy way to finish serger thread tails is to unravel the tail and tie the ends of the thread together. Use a pin or needle to unravel the serger tail, starting near the end of the tail and working downwards as you unravel the thread.Think of the tail like a braid. You need to start at the bottom of the braid to undo it. Starting too far up may result in knots and pulling.
Keep unraveling until you have reached the edge of the fabric and the tail is divided into four separate threads.
 Once you have unraveled the tail, divide the threads according to length. You should have two short ends and two long ends. Pair the ends according to length and then tie them together.Tie the two short ends to the two long ends.
Double knot the ends for extra security.
 After you have secured the ends into a knot, cut off the excess thread. Donâ€™t cut too close to the knot or the knot may come undone.If desired, you can also add a dab of stitch sealant or fabric glue to the knot to make it more secure.

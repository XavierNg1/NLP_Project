 When you’ve decided to write a government official a letter, you want to choose paper and an envelope that look professional. The paper should be good quality, and a light easy-to-read color, like white or beige.


If you are part of an organization, like a nonprofit group or local organization, you may want to write your letter with their official letterhead.
 You can either type your letter and print it onto the paper that you’ve selected, or you can handwrite it. Typed letters look more professional, but handwritten letters can also appear more personal. You should avoid handwriting your letter unless you have very clear and legible handwriting. If you do end up handwriting your letter, you should use a black or blue ink. If you type your letter, you should use a simple font, like Times New Roman or Garamond, and an appropriate font size, like 12 or 10.


Regardless of whether you type or handwrite your letter, you should always handwrite your signature at the end of the letter. Remember to use a blue or black ink.
 The last thing you want is for your carefully written letter to be returned to you because you forgot to attach the correct postage. First class stamps are a little more expensive than regular stamps, but they will be processed and delivered in one to two days rather than four.You can purchase stamps at United States Postal Service offices in your area or from authorized retailers.
 In the center of the envelope, you should write the full address of your representative. You should address them by their full name and official title, like “Senator Tammy Duckworth” or “Representative Paul Ryan.” Double check that you have correctly copied down their address. In the top left corner of the envelope, write down your full name and address..


The representative’s office will need your full name and address to send you a reply.

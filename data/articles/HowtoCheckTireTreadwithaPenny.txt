 It will be easier to read when you perform the test. Very dark pennies or pennies with Abe’s face obscured will not work nearly as well as a new penny.;
, Make sure Abe’s body is in your grasp; don’t hold the penny in such a way that you obscure Abe’s head.
 Insert the penny into the grooves on the thread with Lincoln’s head pointed down.
 If any part of Lincoln’s head is obscured by the tire tread, your tires are fine. Otherwise, your treads are too shallow and you should replace them.
 Continue the penny test around the tire about every 15”. Check the central grooves and the inner and outer grooves. This will tell you if your tire has uneven wear.
 Tires do not wear evenly so be sure to check the tread on each tire to determine that the tread depth for each is safe.

 Here's what you'll need:


15-30 drops of essential oils (a couple of drops of fruit or other oils, like olive or almond, can work too)
2 cups of bath salt
1/4 cup sea salt (optional, if you'd like the water to be silky)
Food coloring (optional)
Two containers, a strainer, and a whisk or spoon;
, Whatever combination speaks to you is the right one! Peppermint, vanilla, maybe eucalyptus? How about grapefruit, sandalwood, mint, or lavender?


You can also use oils like almond, olive, walnut, jojoba, grapeseed, apricot -- the list goes on and on. Just a few drops of these will be good to make your skin smooth.
 Sea salt is good, too, but if you don't have it, that's fine; it just softens the water.


If you'd like, add a few drops of food coloring right now Take your spoon or whisk and mix it up until the salt is all evenly colored.
 It needs time to absorb the oils and the scent.
 Using your strainer, pour the salt over an empty container. What's left should be your newly-scented bath salts! Allow them to dry for about 5 minutes.
 About 1/3 of a cup in every bath will leave you feeling soothed and relaxed.

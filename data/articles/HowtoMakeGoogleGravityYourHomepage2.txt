 Look for Internet Explorer on your computer and click to open.
 Locate the gear icon on the toolbar, and click it. This will bring down the Tools in a submenu. Locate “Internet options” from here and click on it. This will open a small window for Internet Options. This is where you set up or configure your browser and its parameters.
 Click the General tab to go to the General view of the Internet Options. The first section of the General tab is for Homepage. It has a text field where you can input the URL or address of your home page.
 Click on the text field and remove the existing home page. Type in Google Gravity’s URL or address: http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/.
 Click the “Apply” button, then on “OK” to save your changes and exit Internet Options.


The next time you launch Internet Explorer, Google Gravity will automatically load.

 You will need Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of vegetable glycerin and 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of liquid Castile soap. This will serve as the base of your cleanser. The glycerin will help moisturize your skin, while the Castile soap will act as a gentle cleanser.Make sure that you are using plain, unscented Castile soap.
 You will need 3 tablespoons (67.5 grams) of honey and 3 to 5 drops of lemon essential oil. Honey is naturally antibacterial and moisturizing. It is good for dry skin and acne. Lemon essential oil will act as a natural toner and brightener for your skin.Do not use lemon fragrance oil or lemon extract. It is not the same thing.
 Keep stirring until the color and texture are consistent, and no streaks remain. Be careful not to over-stir, however, or the soap will start to lather., Place a funnel into the neck of a clean, glass soap dispenser. Pour the face wash into the funnel. Remove the funnel, then screw in the pump.

Avoid using plastic soap dispensers. The essential oil in the soap will weaken the plastic over time.
 Massage the face wash onto your face and neck for at least 30 seconds. Rinse it off with warm water, then splash your face with cool water. Pat your face dry with a towel when you are done.Avoid your eyes when applying the face wash.
You can store the face wash on the counter. It should last a few months, but if it starts to smell rancid before then, discard it.

 Unlike English, the basic future tense in French doesn't have a helper verb â€“ you just conjugate the verb with a different ending. If you want to say "I will hold" in French, you would say "je tiendrai.", When speaking to a younger person or a friend, if you want to say "you will hold" in French, you would say "tu tiendras." Remember to use the vous form in circumstances where you need to be more polite or formal in addressing someone.In future tense you use a different ending for the second person "tu" than for the first person "je" verb form. This is unlike in past and present tenses, where these two endings were the same.
 If you are talking about a third person or an object and want to say "he or she will hold" in French, you would say either "il tiendra" or "elle tiendra" depending on the gender of the person or thing., The first person plural conjugation of tenir is tiendrons. Say "nous tiendrons" if you want to say "we will hold." Note that unlike in present tense, in future tense this form still includes the i., The French pronoun vous is used when you're talking to several people at once, or to a single person who you want to address more politely or respectfully. To conjugate tenir in future tense, say "vous tiendrez.", When you're talking about a group of people or objects, say "ils tiendront" for a masculine or mixed-gender group, and "elles tiendront" for a feminine group.

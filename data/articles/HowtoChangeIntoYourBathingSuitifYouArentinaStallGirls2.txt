 Carefully slip on your bathing suit bottoms one foot at a time. Make sure the towel around your waist is secure and covering you while you do this. Then, gingerly, pull your bathing suit bottoms up to your waist.
 Again, pull your arms through your shirtsleeves. Secure the bathing suit underneath your shirt as you normally would. For example, if your suit top clips, then clip it underneath your shirt first, and pull it up. If it ties, then tie the strings around your torso first. Then twist the tied strings around toward your back so the front of the bathing suit is on your torso, and pull up. Pull your arms back through your shirtsleeves and finish securing the bathing suit top, i.e., tie the strings around your neck, or make any adjustments before taking off your shirt.


Alternatively, you can put your bathing suit top on over your shirt. Secure your top as you normally would over your shirt. Then pull your arms through your shirtsleeves and carefully take off your shirt so that your bathing suit top does not move and expose you.
 While your shirt is still on and the towel is around your waist, adjust the bathing suit to make sure all the pieces are in the correct position. Once everything is positioned correctly, you can remove the towel around your waist and take off your shirt.

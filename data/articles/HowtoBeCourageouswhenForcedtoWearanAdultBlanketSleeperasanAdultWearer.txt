 Unless you choose to tell your friends, your friends will never find out that you wear one when away from the public's eye. Most people change into a blanket sleeper or nightwear at night, and so after others could potentially find out their dark secret.


If you are able to overcome the fear and become courageous enough to wear blanket sleepers, don't brag about your experiences later to your friends both online and off, as these events may come back to haunt you later, causing you to no longer be courageous and you'll be back to square one (where you once started)!;
, Comfort in wearing them is your key to wearing one with courage. Whether it is for luxury or warmth (or for both reasons), let them say what they want about your choice in nightwear. Realize that when they come to their senses and find out that they themselves have fought the courage to ward off evil and/or have even forced themselves to wear a blanket sleeper too, they'll eventually see why you wear one and may very well stop pestering you with these child-like taunts the next time.


If they get physical or begin to bully you into wearing one with the blanket sleeper, you may need to stop them from bullying you. You shouldn't have to deal with the fighting, or ever feel courageous enough to wear one ever again if put under these conditions.
 Be civilized when you argue the comfort and courageousness inside of the blanket sleeper with them., Though many adults want to be courageous enough to wear one but feel timid to wear one are often pressured to wear one, when they realize the values they are getting themselves into when wearing one when are forced, are more likely to withstand consistent wearing later on. Ask yourself if you would like to return to those comforting days and feeling youthful again! Not having a care in the world during the night shouldn't stop you from being courageous when wearing these pair of nightwear. Feel free to choose whatever style you should want...now who wouldn't want that? So, don't stop yourself from wearing them.
 Though few offline retailers sell blanket sleepers for adults (especially of the zip-up kind), there are a few during the winter that sell ones that will fit most who come to have to wear them. You might see the comfort in wearing one when you actually try them on. Try and determine their plushiness and coziness level when you move around in them.


Make sure the blanket sleeper fits properly; there is nothing worse than being squished up like an infant or toddler would be while wearing the blanket sleeper. Be sure that the feet are comfortable too; are not too loose or not too tight. Even if the sleeper feels tight, sometimes you may just need to try on a different size to really determine their coziness on you. Just the feeling alone should be enough persuasion to wear one when forced to. Bigger sizes are more comfortable and better for you.
 At times when you are feeling down and you are feeling like someone is forcing you to wear something you don't want to wear, think happy thoughts and put a smile on your face as you get to recognize that you'll get through this crisis soon enough. Once you can look back and beginlaughing at these times, you'll be just about ready to wear one. Happy times can turn into smiling times in a flash. Go for the good ol' days of yesteryear and wear one.
 However, if you are still being forced to wear one in the fall and winter months and have to continue during the spring and summer months too, you'll have to adjust the room to more-suitable temperatures to effectively feel just as courageous and cozy when wearing them with that same "zest". You won't see it as grand as wearing one when it is cooler or more adequately-seasonal to the suitable temperatures, and you'll potentially give up rather quickly., If you don't feel the results of being courageous by the end of at least the fifth night, you'll be likely to realize the blanket sleeper's benefits, and so you probably won't give the sleeper up. This is just the same feeling as allowing your children to break one in when they first wear a new garment they haven't liked but you had forced them into without their opinion being heard one., You might be thinking that you are the only one who is being forced into wearing one, or being put into an uncomfortable situation, but when you find out that there are others out there that can help you embrace this change, you'll soon think differently. Let your inner child out, so it can embrace the blanket sleeper again.

 Building your child’s self-esteem will help your child to feel accepted and valued, which may help her become more comfortable around others. Make sure you praise your child when you notice she is practicing healthy social skills and interacting with others in a proactive way.For example, you may compliment her on her conversation with a family member at a big family dinner. You may say, “Aunt Jane was telling me how much she enjoyed talking with you.”

, Doing this will show her that she is capable and build up her self-esteem. This could be a simple comment like, “How nice of you to ask how Grandma is doing”, or an encouraging statement like, “Tell your Dad what you told me today.” Positive reinforcement will also let her know that you support her and are an ally for her., Get your child to focus on personal self-development and encourage her to take up swimming if she seems to enjoy the water or to take up painting if she seems to enjoy sketching and drawing. Finding something she is good at will make she feel less self-conscious and help to boost her confidence.If your child is struggling to identify a passion or hobby she might enjoy, you can help her by suggesting that she think about a skill she is good at or enjoys. This could be watching basketball games on television or baking at home. You may then suggest that she try to play basketball or take a baking class. Throw out suggestions and see if she responds to any of them.
You can also have a conversation with your child where you ask her what she likes doing the most or what skill she would like to learn. You may then be able to work together to find a hobby or passion she can pursue.

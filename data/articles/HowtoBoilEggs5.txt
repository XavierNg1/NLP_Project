 Bring the water to the boil.
 Start timing from this point.
 The hard boiled stage is reached at:









8 minutes for a lightly hard boiled egg
10 minutes for a dark yellow moist dry yolk and a set white
15 minutes for a light yellow, dry, and granular yolk.
 Doing this stops any further cooking and stops the development of a gray line between the yolk and the egg white.Peeling is easier under cold water, or cold running water (see next).

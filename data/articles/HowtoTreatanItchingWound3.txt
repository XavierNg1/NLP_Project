 Scratching can reopen the wound, which in turn can delay the healing process. If you cannot help but scratch, rub the wound using minimal pressure, but do not use your nails, as they will irritate the wound., You may unconsciously scratch at the wound during the night. To limit the amount of damage this unconscious scratching can do, trim your nails so they are as short as possible.
 Using products with strong chemicals can delay wound healing as the soap may alter the skinâ€™s production of new cells and tissues.


Mild soap products are recommended such as Dove, Neutrogena, and Cetaphil; these products are mild cleansers and good for the skin.
 When you moisturize, you can prevent dryness, which can limit how much itchiness you feel. Dry skin is more prone to breakdown and irritation than well moisturized skin is.


Moisturize your skin after taking a bath or washing your hands to help your skin stay silky smooth.
 If the itchiness you are experiencing has become constant and more severe, your wound may be infected. If this is the case, you should give your doctor a call. Symptoms of an infected wound include:


Inflammation around the sides of the scabs.
Increasing pain.
Abnormal wound discharges with an unpleasant odor.
Fever

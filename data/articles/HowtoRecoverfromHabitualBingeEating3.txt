 Any person can be guilty of eating too much food for the day, or overdoing it at holidays or special events, but BED is chronic and causes significant distress. BED is characterized by:Rapid eating (finishing a lot of food in just two hours or less).
The urge to keep on eating until feeling uncomfortable or sick.
The urge to eat even if the feeling of hunger is not there.
The preference to eat alone because of embarrassment from eating abnormally large amounts of food.
Feeling of shame, guilt, or disgust after the binge eating episode.
 Binge eating is often done in secret and will cause shame and guilt.To cope with these negative emotions, the sufferer may engage in further binging. This starts a vicious cycle that will continue until healthier coping strategies are developed.Eating may distract from or reduce negative emotions, but these benefits are temporary.
 Many people believe BED is a simple behavioral problem, but the causes are complex. Biology, culture and psychology all contribute to the development of BED.Critical comments about one's body and eating habits while young can set the stage for the onset of BED. People who struggle with bouts of depression may be more prone to developing BED. Self-esteem issues and loneliness can also be contributing factors.

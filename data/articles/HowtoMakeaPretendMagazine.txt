 Should it have the same name as a different magazine, or do you want to create your own title? Make sure the name is good, because if your title is something like, "What the Cat Coughed Up" or "Local Stuff", no one will give it a second thought because it will sound boring and uninteresting. Try things like, "Gossip Central", or "All Stars".;
, You need papers that are double-sized (A4 if it's going to be an A5 magazine, or A3 if you want it to be an A4 magazine), so you can write two pages per paper. The first and last page will be on the same paper, and second and second to last page will be on the same paper, so keep this in mind while numbering your articles.
 No one likes it if you just describe how stupid Britney Spears looked when she shaved her head, you need a picture! And don't think you can just take pictures from random magazine sites, because they are most likely copyrighted, and they will probably sue you, no matter how unpopular of a company they are.
 Continue until all pages are laid out. Now staple the middle of your layout together, and bend the papers together so you can see the cover. If you turn over the magazine and see the back, you've stapled it correctly.
 They would love to read what you've written!

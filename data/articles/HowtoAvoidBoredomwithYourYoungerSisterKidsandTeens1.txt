 Yep, those are oldies. For these games, if you have a younger sister who is a lot younger than you, you might need to slow down a little with the running, or she may get discouraged. You can also make up rules like there is no "goo" for you.;
, Warning - a very young child might not be able to do this one, or might be easily scared by games like this. You can use sticks as the "weapons" but be careful not to actually hurt your sis. You can decide how many hearts to have, and each touch of the other person's "weapon" eliminates a heart. You can find little white stones to act as the medicine. Each stone retrieves a heart for you. Put all the stones and sticks in the middle, start counting, and run!

, This is a fun game that only needs a few hula hoops and maybe some jump ropes. You can take turns making the obstacle race, for example, you can put a jump rope in front and then a hula hoop, then have the other person jump over the jump rope and walk around the hula hoop. The possibilities are endless! Make sure to compliment your younger sister's obstacle race.
 This is only if you have some rocks worthy of climbing or pretend climbing. You can bring a "lunch" with you, like a few bars or a water bottle. Of you go! Pretend that it's a great challenge and sometimes you might even fall! (pretend) If you have a big rock that you actually can climb, make sure you stay safe and keep your sis safe.
 Everyone loves winning. You can make races, see who can roll the hula hoop the farthest, have a hula hoop contest, a cannonball contest if you have a pool, the possibilities are really endless! Be sure to let your sister win some of the games.

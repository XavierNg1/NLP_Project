 This might just make you sweat more, but many men find that an undershirt (particularly under dress shirts) is a good option. This allows your outer shirt to stay dry, while the undershirt will catch the sweat. Make sure your overshirt is big enough that the sweat does not transfer from the inner to the outer shirt. , Choose shirts that are cut lower under the armpits so that your skin and the shirt touch less. Different brands and cuts fit differently, so do some experimenting. , These will cover the underarm area that you are worried about. Even though the extra layer might make you warmer, wear a lighter shirt underneath so that the combination of the two garments is not too hot. , Tank tops and sleeveless clothing reduce the amount of fabric near the armpit that might get sweaty. Without that fabric, air also circulates in the armpit, cooling your skin and preventing as much sweat from forming.

 Unroll dough and separate croissant pieces (there should be perforated edges to use as a guide). Lay croissant pieces on a clean, flat surface.;
, of Nutella to the middle of the croissant piece. Use the spoon to spread the Nutella out into a small square (leaving approximately 1 or 2‚Äù from the edge).
 Cover the square with marshmallows without overwhelming it.
 Make sure none of the Nutella or marshmallows ooze from the sides. If they do, remove some of the filling until you have a comfortable fit.
 Work your way around the folded edges by gently pressing down with the fork tongs to create a crimping pattern.
 Marshmallows should melt into the Nutella to create a creamy, chocolaty filling.

 In order to create a smooth braid, you will need to have tangle-free hair. Freshly washed hair is the most difficult to braid because it is so slick, so use one day old (or several days old) dirty hair for your headband. You can use wet or dry hair, although if you begin with wet hair it will be wavy when you remove it from your braid at the end of the day.;
, Your braid will be giving the illusion of a headband, so it needs to cross from ear to ear. Use a comb to create a smooth, even part running horizontally across your head from behind one ear to the back of another. Try to avoid any jagged lines or waves in your part; the straighter the line the better it will look. Pull back the rest of your hair into a ponytail.
 Comb your hair horizontally across your head, starting at the base of one ear. When it is smooth, section your hair into three even pieces at the base of your hair.
 Use the three pieces of hair to start a traditional braid. Take the section on the right, and cross it over the middle section of hair. Then, do the same with the left section, crossing it over the middle piece.
 As you braid, pick up small pieces of hair from your parted section in addition to your regular three sections. Pick up a piece on the right, add it to the right strand, and cross it over the center. Pick up a piece on the left, add it to the left strand, and cross it over the center.
 Work your way across your head above your hairline, adding in more strands of hair as you go. Your braid may have been thin to start, but will begin gathering size as you add more strands.
 As you get close to your ear, finish the braid by tying it off with a small clear elastic. The loose ends of the braid will blend in with your hair down, or can be incorporated into an updo. You can also choose to braid your hair in a regular braid to the very ends, and then tie the tips off with a ponytail.

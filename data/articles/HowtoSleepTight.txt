 Look for patterns. Say you have nightmares before an exam, then take extra care to get relaxed before bed on those nights. You can also use your dream journal to rewrite the ending of bad dreams to something less frightening.;
, Try to go to bed at the same time every night, and get up at the same time--even on weekends.
 You're more likely to sleep soundly if you are physically tired. Make sure you get in some good--preferably outdoor--activity every day.
 If something is on your mind that's bothering you, discuss it with a friend or grown-up. Unhappy feelings or anxieties usually don't just go away. They pop up again in different ways--like in your nightmares.
 Even just a crack. This will help you remember that you family is close by. If you are scared, get up and find someone for reassurance, or a hug.
 Sometimes, images from scary stories pop up in dreams--even two or three days after you've seen them.
 Relax and soak rather than doing something like playing a really exciting video game that will wind you up.
 Both these activities stimulate your system and make it tougher to get to sleep. Tossing and turning in a light doze might give you uneasy feelings that lead to nightmares.

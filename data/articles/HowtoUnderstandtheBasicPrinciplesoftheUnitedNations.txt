 This Article contains the basic principles that guide the United Nations.;
, This means that every country is sovereign and independent, which ensures that every country has an equal say in the UN. There are some notable exceptions to this, namely the formation of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice, but every country who is a member of the UN has equal voting power in the General Assembly.
 These two Articles concern the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the fundamental obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. These two rules are very important foundational rules that have directed international relations since 1945.
,, This is noted by Article 2 (7). The role of the United Nations is to facilitate and promote relations between countries that are members of the UN rather than to tell them what to do on their own territory. Exceptions to this, however, include human rights law and international environmental law but even then, it is often very hard for the United Nations to intervene where the issue is solely internal, such as civil war. In recent years, the UN has become more reliant on insisting that the violation of human rights within a country can give rise to a threat to international peace and security and thereby trigger UN intervention.

 You should have an 80 centimeter (31.5 in) dish without multi feed adaptor.;
, It's very important that you mount the left device on the dish, if you stand behind the dish an look into the sky. The left eye should now be in the center of the dish. This points to HotBird 13°E

, Most Monolock LNBs use DiEqC A/1 for Hotbird and DiEqC B/2 for Astra.
, There are several websites to find out the proper elevation for your location. Then move the dish slightly from south to south-east until you have signal strength and signal quality on your receiver. You should find signal indicator in the same menu as you can set the DiEqC settings.
 You should reach at least 80% signal strength and quality to get a good signal.

 To treat a fever, put a cool, damp washcloth on your forehead. Wash your body with cool water; this will help lower your body temperature and make you feel better. You can also take 650 mg of acetaminophen every six to eight hours (not to exceed 3000 mg in 24 hours) or 400â€“600 mg of ibuprofen (not to exceed 3200 mg in 24 hours).If your child is under three years old and has a fever, you should take her to the doctor.
If your kidneys or liver are compromised, speak with your doctor before taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

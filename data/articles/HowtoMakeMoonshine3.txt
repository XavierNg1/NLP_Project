 Place the cloth over the bucket, then tip the bucket over a clean bucket or pot. You may also use a screen wire or a clean white t-shirt to strain the mash.
 Clamp down the lid and place it on a stovetop burner. You may discard the solids that you strained out with the cheesecloth.
 Run the copper tubing run from the lid (or vent) of the pressure cooker to a sink filled with cold water. Coil the middle of the copper tubing in the cold water, then run the other end of the tube over the edge of the sink to a clean container on the floor.
 Let the contents heat to exactly 177 °F (80 °C) and no more. This is the approximate boiling point of grain alcohol. As the pressure cooker heats, the alcohol turns into ethanol steam, travels through the condensing tube to cool. The resulting liquid drips into the container on the floor. That's the moonshine.


The liquid that comes out of the copper tube before the cooker reaches 177 °F (80 °C) contains methanol, which becomes steam at a lower temperature than ethanol. This low-boiling liquid must be discarded. Methanol attacks the optic nerves when consumed. You'll probably have to discard at least two ounces of liquid before the ethanol, which can actually be consumed, begins to emerge.
Keep monitoring the temperature and collecting alcohol until the temperature rises above or drops below 177 °F (80 °C). You should be able to collect about 2 gallons (7.6 L) of liquid.
 Finished moonshine is between 180 and 190 proof (90 to 95%) - practically pure grain alcohol. To make this product drinkable, responsible brewers cut it to half strength by mixing with pure spring water.

, There is no easy or reliable test for ovarian cancer in the absence of symptoms or warning signs. If you are experiencing unusual symptoms or at an increased risk for ovarian cancer, talk to your doctor to see if further screening would be helpful.


Know what is natural for you. Understand your body and how it functions. Advise your doctor of any changes in your body, especially if the changes involve pelvic pain or an unusual vaginal discharge.
 If you are at risk, and especially if you have developed symptoms that are unusual for your body, ask your gynecologist whether you should be screened for ovarian cancer. The sooner ovarian cancer is detected, the more likely you are to be able to treat it.


Your doctor may recommend a rectovaginal pelvic exam, a transvaginal ultrasound, or a CA-125 blood test.
Screening can be hard, especially in women who are overweight. It is hard to feel for ovarian enlargement on physical examination and ultrasound has difficulty with the increased body mass. If you are overweight and considering evaluation, you may want to consider a CT of the pelvis.

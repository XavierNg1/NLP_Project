 Many of the symptoms of Hepatitis C can mimic other liver ailments; however, some may not appear at all. You can gain a better understanding of your risks by evaluating behaviors that may have increased the likelihood of you contracting the disease.


Actions that involve the transference and exchange of blood put you at risk to contract Hepatitis C, particularly if it's done carelessly. Sharing drugs or needles and being stuck with an infected needle are two particularly risky behaviors.
Using shared tattoo needles is a sometimes the cause of Hepatitis C infection, particularly in the prison population.
If you have a disease that requires the legitimate use of needles, always take the utmost care to use sanitized, new needles. Make sure to only use needles once and dispose of them properly. Never share needles, even for medication.
 Blood transfusions and organ transplants done before 1992 did not adhere to standards that screened Hepatitis C. If you received a transplant or blood transfusion before this date, you should get tested if symptoms appear.People with HIV can also have a greater chance of contracting Hepatitis C. Since their disease was likely contracted due to bodily fluid exchange — in some cases blood — the risk is higher.
Those who routinely receive long-term kidney dialysis are more susceptible than others.
Hepatitis C can be passed from women to their children during childbirth. If you are a woman and your child has symptoms of Hepatitis C, it may be a good idea for both of you to be checked. Similarly, if you later find out your mother had Hepatitis C you will want to get checked if the timeframe is possible.
 Hepatitis C can be contracted through unprotected sex with a carrier of the disease. Avoid having unprotected sex with multiple partners, particularly if you do not know whether they may carry the disease.

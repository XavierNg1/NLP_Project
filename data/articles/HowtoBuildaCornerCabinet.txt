The dimensions of the two side pieces should be: 84 inches (213.36 cm) high by 22 inches (55.88 cm) wide and 84 inches (213.36 cm) high by 21.25 inches (53.98 cm) wide. The dimensions of the triangular top and bottom pieces are (side by side by hypotenuse) 22 inches (55.88 cm) by 22 inches (55.88 cm) by 31.11 inches (79.02 cm). The dimensions of the triangular shelves are 21 inches (53.34 cm) by 21 inches (53.34 cm) by 29.70 inches (75.44 cm).;
, Cut out the pieces, then trace them onto your sheets of wood.
, Lay the smaller side piece that is 21.25 inches (53.98 cm) wide on the floor. Stand the wider side on its edge right next to the smaller side piece. Make sure that the edges match up for a tight fit.


Nail through the face of the wider side piece into the edge of the smaller piece. Make sure that the nail goes in perfectly straight so there is no damage to either piece of wood. Your side pieces should now make a "V" shape.
 Stand the side pieces up on end. Take the triangular top piece and lay it on the top of the side pieces. Make sure that the edges are perfectly aligned for a clean finish.


Nail the pieces together making sure that the nail goes in perfectly straight so there is no damage to either piece of wood. Repeat this process for attaching the bottom piece.
 The spacing between the shelves should be 16.5 inches (41.91 cm). From the bottom, measure up 16.5 inches (41.91 cm), and mark the spot on the back of the cabinet. From that first mark, measure up another 16.5 inches (41.91 cm) and mark that spot. Follow that process 3 more times, for a total of 5 times.
 Using a level, make sure that the shelves are level. Nail through the pre-drilled holes in order to attach each shelf to the cabinet. Again, make sure that you nail with precision.
 Repeat with a finer grit of sandpaper to get a smooth surface.
 Make sure that the stain is applied evenly and that there are no drip marks. Apply as many coats of stain as needed, letting each coat dry completely each time.
 This will prevent the cabinet from moving and shifting. Try to attach the cabinet to the studs in the wall.

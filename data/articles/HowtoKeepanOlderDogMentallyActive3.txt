 If your dog is lethargic and unmotivated to play, you can use food to change that. Most dogs will do just about anything to get a treat, including playing or exercising with you.Be careful that you don't give your dog too many treats. Giving treats constantly will not be good for your dog's health, so when you give healthy treats or pieces of kibble you should keep that in mind at meal time. A dog that has gotten a lot of treats should get fewer calories at meal time.
 Giving your dog a diet high in antioxidants can help its brain activity over the course of its life.Just as in humans, antioxidants given to dogs increase their ability to learn and hold information.


Dog foods that are high quality and balanced should have a good amount of antioxidants. If you are feeding a low quality food, however, it may not be high in antioxidants.
Consult with a veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist to make sure that your dog's food has enough antioxidants. If it does not, you should switch foods.
 There are some dietary supplements that can help your dog's mental acuity.For example, adding vitamin E, vitamin C, Vitamin A, and carotenoids to your dog's diet can improve your dog's mental acuity.


You should consult with a veterinarian before giving your dog any supplements. This is especially true if your dog is on any kind of medication.

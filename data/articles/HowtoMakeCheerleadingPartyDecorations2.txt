 Either use all the same color, or a variety of colors, as preferred.


These are available from party stores. They're not the real thing, just inexpensive copies.
 Use stickers, paper labels, etc., as you prefer. If you want to, you can use the same method as for decoupage to add letter cut-outs using magazine paper, etc.


Add other decorative elements as wished, such as star or heart stickers, etc.
 Attach a piece of wrapped candy or candy bar to a pipe cleaner. Glue or tape the candy to one end of the pipe cleaner, leaving the rest of the pipe cleaner free. Repeat with different candies; you'll need around five to ten candy sticks per megaphone.



Place the megaphone large end facing down on a flat surface.
Thread the candy sticks, pipe cleaner end down first, into the hole at the top of the megaphone.
Continue until there are enough forming a pretty bundle. Push down firmly so that they sit tight.
If you want to ensure that the candy sticks remain in place, attach a rubber band to the sticks from the other end of the megaphone (the large opening end). Hold the megaphone to the side, roll a rubber band as high as it will go, then fasten it with several loops until it's secure and the candy sticks don't move in and out of the top hole.
Tie some curly ribbon around the base of the candies topside of the megaphone, and let the curls dangle down.
Repeat for the remaining megaphones.
 They look lovely as decorations and when guests leave, they can simply find the one with their name on it, pick it up and take it home with them.

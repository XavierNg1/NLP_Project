 Head over to the Kodi download page, and download the latest stable Kodi apk available for Android ARM architecture.;
, The first thing that needs to be done is to enable ADB Debugging on Amazon Fire TV. This will allow you to connect and make modifications or sideload XBMC on Amazon Fire TV. To this go to Settings -> Developer Options and turn ADB Debugging to ON. Then go to Settings -> About – Network and note down the IP address of your Fire TV.
 There are currently two major tools that allow rooting and sideloading apps on Amazon Fire TV:Amazon Fire TV Utility App and the adbFire app. The ADB Fire app is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux while the Amazon Fire TV Utility apps works only on Windows. You may use either one depending on your situation. I use both as the both have certain unique features. On Windows, download one of the apps and extract it to a separate folder on C Drive. Here, I'll show how to use Fire TV Utility App.
 With the Amazon Fire TV Utility app on Windows, first connect to your Fire TV by going to File ->Connect. Enter the IP address and choose Normal Debug mode and click Save and Close. A command prompt should popup (shown below) indicating a successful connection. Then, 1) ensure that the Fire TV Utility app says Connected to 192.168.1.187 (of course, with your IP address) at the bottom, 2) browse and select the downloaded Kodi ARM apk, and 3) click on “Side Load 3rd Party Application” button to install Kodi on Amazon Fire TV. You should a message as shown below, indicating successful Kodi installation. That’s is all there is to side-loading Kodi on Amazon Fire TV using the Fire TV utility app.

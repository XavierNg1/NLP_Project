 Surgery is usually the treatment of choice for OCD in dogs.It can also be used if medical therapy does not work.Several types of surgical procedures are available to treat OCD in Rottweilers. Your vet will determine which of the following procedures will be best for your Rottweiler:Removal of the cartilage flap: Removing the flap will allow scar cartilage to develop and reduce some of the joint inflammation. However, the joint will still be abnormal, and your Rottweiler could eventually develop arthritis.
Arthrodesis: This is the fusion of two bones to prevent painful joint movement.
Total joint replacement: This is a ‘last resort’ procedure for cases of chronic or extensive OCD, when there isn’t much healthy articular cartilage left.
 After you and your vet have agreed on a surgical procedure for your Rottweiler, you will schedule an appointment for the surgery. To prepare your Rottweiler for surgery, do not feed it 12 hours before surgery or allow it to drink water 8 hours before surgery. This will prevent your dog from vomiting during surgery and having the vomit enter its lungs.You will probably bring your Rottweiler home on the same day of surgery. Either the vet or the vet's staff will call you to let you know when you can pick up your Rottweiler.
 Surgery will help relieve a lot of your Rottweiler’s pain. When you pick up your Rottweiler after surgery, your vet will give you specific at-home care instructions so your Rottweiler can have a full recovery. Your vet will also prescribe at least several days' worth of pain medication for your Rottweiler.Other at-home instructions may include:Short leash walks and passive range-of-motion exercises for two to three weeks after surgery
Increased amount of exercise and physical therapy after three weeks

 If you're using wooden skewers, then soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes.
 Place the squash onto the skewers and brush the cubes with oil or melted butter.
 Place the squash directly on the rack and cook the pieces over medium-heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove the squash when the exterior begins to blacken and the flesh is tender.

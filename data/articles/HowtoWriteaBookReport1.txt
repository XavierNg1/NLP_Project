 Ask questions until you understand it completely. Can you read any book? Must it be a specific length? A specific genre or subject? Should you simply summarize the book or should you give your opinion, too?


Figure out what your teacher is looking for in a book report. How many words should it be? When is the deadline?
If you have not yet chosen a book, ask friends if they have any good suggestions. It's a good idea to check a very quick summary online to make sure it's your type of book. Be sure to stick to any lists or limits you have been given.;
, Keep a pencil and paper by you as you read, writing down points and page numbers. Take notes, mark important parts, underline enthralling lines (if you are allowed). Try to appreciate the book: It will teach you something if you are open to learning. Keep these things in mind:


Characters: Who are the main characters? What happens to them? Did you like them? Were there good and bad characters? Did they all have good traits and bad traits? Did they seem like real life people or animals, or did they seem fake?
Main ideas and themes: What is the main idea of the book? What happens? What did you learn that you did not know before?
Quotes: What parts did you like best? Are there parts that you could quote to make your report more enjoyable?, Do this while the story is still fresh in your head. It will help you organize your thoughts for your report.


Who were the main characters? Why did they do what they did? How did they change throughout the book, if at all? What made you like or dislike them as you read?
What were the turning points in the story? What big, important events happened in the story? How did the resolution of the story come about? Was it a satisfying ending?

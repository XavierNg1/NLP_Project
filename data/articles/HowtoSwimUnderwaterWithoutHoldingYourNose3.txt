 Without overthinking it, begin swimming across the pool. Using all of the steps above, you should now be able to swim the entire length of the pool without holding your nose!


Be confident in yourself and your ability as a swimmer, but don't forget that your comfort and feeling of safety while swimming is the most important thing. Use the edge of the pool as needed until you feel that you can swim the entire length of the pool without using it.
As you swim more, you will find it easier to go farther without feeling that you need to hold your nose. Your body will acclimate to this process over time.
Also, as you begin swimming faster, water will be less likely to go into your nose.
 Once you can swim an entire lap without holding your nose, you have achieved your goal!

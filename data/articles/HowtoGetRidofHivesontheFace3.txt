For example, if you react to pollens, avoid being outside in the morning and in the evening when pollen levels are at their highest. If you are allergic to the sun, wear a hat or protective coverings.
Avoid common irritants such as insect sprays, tobacco and wood smoke, and fresh tar or paint as much as possible.

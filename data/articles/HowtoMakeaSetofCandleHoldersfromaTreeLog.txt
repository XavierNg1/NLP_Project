 Pick out a stack of logs that have a diameter of roughly 4 inches. Clean each log with a damp rag or napkin to remove any dirt or dust.
 Using the hand saw, cut off any protruding branches each one of the logs. The logs should not have any extra branches, but instead be smooth and even.

You can also use a jig saw to make the process easier, but a hand saw will work fine too.
 Ensure that each cut is perpendicular to the length of the log so the surface is even. You don't want the candle to lean when standing upright.

For easier sawing, consider using a miter saw.
 Using the hand saw, cut a different length for each log, such as 3, 5, 7, and 9 inches. That way when you arrange the candles together, the differing heights will make the candles more unique and appealing., Place the 1-1/2-inch woodboring drill bit into the drill. Drill approximately 1/2-inch holes onto the the tops of each log. The holes should be big enough to fit in the tea light candles, but also not too large, so the candles can fit in snugly.,, You may wish to place the tree trunk candles around the house, for example on the dinner table or in your bedroom. You can bunch them together or separate them. Light the candles and enjoy their beauty!

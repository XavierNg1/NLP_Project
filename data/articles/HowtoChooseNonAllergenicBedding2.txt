 A good-quality dust mite-resistant mattress cover might be sufficient, but if not, or if you're planning to purchase a new mattress for other reasons, consider a latex mattress which is so impervious to dust mites that you probably won't need a dust mite-resistant mattress cover. Latex mattresses are also resistant to mildew, mold, and bacteria. Mattresses made from organic wool are also considered by some to be a good choice because organic wool is naturally resistant to fire and mold, in addition to dust mites.Avoid chemicals as much as possible when selecting allergy-free bedding items. Try to avoid flame retardants, pesticides, and synthetic fibers that are usually found in conventional mattresses.
 Coil and spring mattresses are the worst choice for an allergy sufferer. These inside spaces create fertile ground for allergen inducing creatures like dust mites to live and reproduce. Also avoid fluffy pillow top mattresses as these create fertile ground for allergens to be stored and reproduce. Instead choose memory foam or latex mattresses.
 The encasings, which resemble standard zippered pillow and mattress covers, will trap any dust mites inside.Look for brands made of fabric with a pore size of less than 100 microns, which is the average size of a dust mite.To be an effective barrier against dust mites, the encasings should have an average pore size of 6 microns or smaller. The dust mites themselves are typically no smaller than 100 microns, but their feces can be much smaller.

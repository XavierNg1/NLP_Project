 At first glance, table salt and granulated sugar look very similar, including in size. The minute differences in the average grain sizes of the two, however, does provide an option for attempting separation.


Regular table salt has an average grain size of 100 microns, or 0.01 mm.Note that other types of household salt, such as kosher or pickling salt, will have widely divergent average grain sizes.
Regular granulated sugar has an average grain size of 500 microns (0.5 mm), or five times larger than table salt.Again, other sugars, like powdered or brown sugar, will have very different average sizes.;
, Laboratory-style sieves (or strainers) are sized according to the spaces between the mesh. You want to find one that is large enough to let the salt through, but small enough to stop the sugar.


Since salt is 100 microns across and sugar is 500, a 250 micron (0.25 mm) sieve would make a good in-between choice., This method is a simple as it seems. Add small amounts of the salt-sugar mixture at a time to the sieve (with a bowl underneath), and shake, shimmy, and rattle it to slowly but surely send much of the salt through the mesh openings and into the bowl.Because this method relies on the difference in average grain sizes, it is never going to be entirely successful, There will be some smaller sugar grains that slip through and some larger salt grains that stay put, not to mention those that might stick together — at least until the point when you’re tired of sifting.
Despite its limitations, however, sieving is a legitimate scientific means of separation.Just don’t expect to use the separated sugar in your coffee, unless you like a salty kick!

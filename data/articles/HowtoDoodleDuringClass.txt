 You can even doodle during the entire school day if you're lucky.;
, A few class notes from previous classes in the front works best. It makes it more believable that you weren't doodling.
 Don't overdo this if you usually space out or are the "average" student, it'll make your teacher suspicious. When you arrive at your desk (preferably one near the back of the classroom), open your notebook to a clean page and have your pencil/pen in hand as if you are ready to take notes.
 Answer a few questions or add on to the lecture the teacher's giving. Appear attentive for the first five minutes, then take your pencil and move slowly towards the clean page. Doodle, but don't overdo it. Every few minutes or however often you would like look up and nod as though you are understanding the lesson or let your eyes widen as though you were realizing that "that is how it worked". Then look down, pretend you are taking detailed notes, and continue.
 The teacher is usually more focused on keeping an eye on them, and you do NOT want him/her to watch you so closely. You may want to get them to do something during class (if they don't already do things like throwing pencils at each other) and wait. The teacher will notice and maybe move the kids, but you'll be safe as you are far away from the direction of the teacher's attentive eyes. Experiment a bit. Try sitting close to your friends and doodle during class or sitting next to a complete stranger and doodle.
 This may seem sad but it's actually quite fun if you're young at heart.

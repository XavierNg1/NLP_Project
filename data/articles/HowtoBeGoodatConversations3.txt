 For example they might ask you a question. Or, the offer to speak might be made through a gesture, non-verbally.


Invite yourself to take a speaking turn. There are always small pauses in the conversation as the current speaker reaches the end of her point. Take advantage of the pause to launch into your contribution. However, someone else might try to start talking at the same moment. There is usually a little friendly rivalry before the group decides who should continue the turn. It might be you!

, As we listen to the ebb and flow of conversation, we find ourselves stirred with feelings, ideas and reactions. Respond to these inner promptings but, at the same time, relate to what has gone before - blend in and blend out.
 Conversation is very different to written language because it’s like music. It has rhythm, melody, harmony, spontaneity and movement. Qualities that are just as important as the lyrics. Orchestrate your powers of evocation by variations of voice-tone, face expressions and hand gestures.
 But if they don’t, use conversation moves that let you hold the floor whilst you catch up with what you want to say, for instance: stock phrases, repetitions, "um"s, "ah"s, and other exclamations, hesitations and questions out loud to yourself. Certain teachers used to admonish us about these things (think before you speak); but they were misguided. If your having fun, it doesn’t matter whether it always makes sense. In fact it’s even sometimes necessary to pass through phases of non-sense in order to reach higher levels of sense.

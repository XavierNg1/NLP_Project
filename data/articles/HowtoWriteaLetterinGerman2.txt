 When writing an informal letter in German, as in English, you have more freedom in terms of starting your letter. It’s not necessary to write the date or address, though you can if you want. Give your letter an informal salutation that suits who you are writing to. Pay special attention to the spelling. For example, write “Liebe” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a woman, but “Lieber” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a man. Try one of these greetings:Guten Tag, Frau Müller (Good day, Ms. Müller)
Liebe Frau Müller (Dear Ms. Müller)
Lieber Heinrich (Dear Heinrich)
Hallo, Andreas (Hi Andreas)
Mein lieber Schatz (My dear honey)
Hallo mein Liebling (Hello my darling)
Hallo meine Süße (Hello sweetie - female)
Hallo mein Süßer (Hello sweetie - male)

, Since you are writing an informal letter, you have plenty of freedom for choosing what to say and how to structure it. In general, try to keep your ideas grouped together, and separate paragraphs with line breaks to make your letter easy to read.


Remember that you do not need to capitalize the first word of the body of your letter.
 Even for letters to friends or family, it’s courteous to include an clear closing in your letter. You can be more casual or even intimate, depending on who you are writing to. Try one of these common closings:Herzlichst (Cordially)
Viele Grüße (Lots of regards)
Liebe Grüße (Lots of love)
Alles Liebe (Lots of love)
Dein (Yours - male)
Deine (Yours - female)
In Liebe (With love - for romantic relationships)

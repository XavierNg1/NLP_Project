 Choose a catchy name that is memorable, easy to spell, and includes the name of your business or a popular keyword within your blog's niche.
 If people come to your blog called "How to be healthy" and your blog is really based on "Men's Health," you might have better success utilizing a more detailed name.
 Sometimes an outside opinion is needed to help you choose the best name for your blog.
 This way you can make sure that the name is yours and that no one else can use it.
 Just make sure that the name you choose is related to you niche blog.

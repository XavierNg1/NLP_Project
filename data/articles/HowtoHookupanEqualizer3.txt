 Most receivers have either preamp-in and preamp-out connections or tape monitor connections. In most cases, these are the best way to connect an equalizer to your stereo. However, if your receiver does not have these channels then some amplifiers allow you to connect the equalizer directly.


Connecting to the amplifier directly will require preamp-in and preamp-out channels on your amplifier.
 To run a signal from your equalizer to the amplifier and back again, you'll need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).


The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer.
 Connect one pair of cables to the pre-amp output channels on the amplifier and the other end of the cable to the pre-amp input channels on the equalizer.


You will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer.
Right channel jacks will usually take the red colored RCA plug while left channel should take white or black RCA plugs.
Sometimes the amplifier channels will say tape monitor output rather than pre-amp output so you can also use these.
 Connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the pre-amp input channels on the amplifier.


Right channel jacks will usually take the red colored RCA plug while left channel should take white or black RCA plugs.
Some amplifiers might have tape monitor input rather than pre-amp input channels so you can also use these.
 Some amplifiers will have a switch to turn on the pre-amp connections. If you are using tape monitor channels then you will also need to switch on the tape monitor switch. Depress the button to turn on this connection.
 Turn on all three components and adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences. You should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music.

 You want molding with ridges and/or texture. Envision setting a taco on the crown molding before you purchase it so you obtain the right one.


Consider getting pre-stained or painted molding so you can omit having to paint it.






Pick up paint, gloss or stain if the molding you choose is still “naked.”






Get enough molding to hold 6 or more tacos at one time. Make this serving tray worth you while so you aren’t constantly restocking.





;
, The box should be the same width and length of the crown molding, so it may be in your best interest to make your own.


Take measurements of the box width and length before purchasing enough plywood to create the box.
Have the hardware store pre-cut pieces so all you will need to do is assemble it.
Take into consideration how you’d like to assemble the box and pick up necessary supplies. You will need enough material to form the box but you won’t need a top (you can turn the box upside down). In some cases you could use wood glue and glue the box together. However, nailing it together, using small nails might be your best bet.
 You’ll want to have options in the event one method does not work very well.


Purchase stain or paint for the box. You may want to select a color to compliment the crown molding.

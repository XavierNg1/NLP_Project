 Some people don’t put up with the "do they like you" game, and go straight for the punch. Some people just aren't shy at all! This type might be the “player” who is just good at saying things you want to hear.Be suspicious of this type if they pull out a stock of pick up lines and you feel them trying to manipulate you.
 Whether or not you want them to like you, you need to handle it with respect. Nobody likes a jerk. Here are some signals that they like you:


They constantly talk to you to the point where it's on the border of being annoying.
They blush at the smallest things you do or say to her.
You catch them staring at you and then smiling or making a funny face when you notice.
They show no fear of starting a conversation.
They might ask you to hang out and give you their number., Never feel the need to wait around if you like someone. Waiting for the other person to ask you out is overrated. Take advantage of the life you’re given. Invite them out for coffee or to go catch a movie.


If you’re not interested and you know they like you, do not ignore them! Be open and honest about your feelings. Treat them with respect and don’t lead them on.

 For the record, Hi-Lo is the most popular for a reason -- it yields good results and it's simple to master. However, there are a number of varieties.


In KO, the difference is that 7s are worth +1.
In Omega II, 4, 5, and 6 are worth +2. 10, J, Q, and K are worth -2 and Aces are worth 0.
In halves, 2 and 7 are worth +.5. 5 is worth +1.5. 9 is worth -.5.
 Statistical analysts have these numbers all figured out and it's not a simple, "Does it work or not?" There are a number of factors to take into account:


When it comes to betting correlation (BC), Halves has the highest correlation. This is used to predict betting situations.
Hi-Opt II and Omega II have the highest playing efficiency (PE). This determines decisions and deviations (when you change from basic strategy) in play.
Hi-Opt II has the highest insurance correlation (IC). This tells you when it's best to buy insurance (because Hi-Opt II has an additional Ace count).

As you can see, Hi-Lo is not mentioned. This is because it falls in the middle of the pack for every factor. Hi-Opt II has an additional Ace count and Halves is just tedious (adding further distraction) and Omega IIs playing efficiency doesn't match the betting correlation. Unless you're the best blackjack player this side of the Mississippi, stick to Hi-Lo., It is called "wonging in" when you stay away from a table until it's hot enough to warrant joining. When the table grows cold, you "wong out." It's typically done on bigger decks, otherwise you'd be getting up as soon as you sat down.


Lots of casinos have banned mid-shoe entry for this purpose. If you do consider doing this, know that it looks fishy to even untrained eyes. How else would you know when to swoop in for the kill if you weren't counting cards?

The suspicions you do avoid, however, are changing your bets. When you're wonging, you bet the same exorbitant amount every time.

 Take the label off the bottle. Let the bottle soak in hot water and dish soap for ten minutes. This will make it easier to remove any residue left on the bottle as well as cleaning off any bacteria.

, These holes will be where the axles will go. The holes should be parallel with each other.
 You can use a variety of objects for your axles: straws, sticks, toothpicks, or wire (like that from a wire hanger), etc. If the object is long, like a pencil, then you will only need two pieces. If it is short, like a toothpick, then you will need four pieces.
 You will use these caps as your wheels.
 You can paint the outside of the bottle and the wheels. It’s easier to paint bottle and bottle caps before you fully assemble the car.
 Depending on the material you chose, this might be two or four axles. For a longer object, run the axle all the way through the set of holes on the other side. For a shorter object, like a toothpick, place one in each hole.
 Knot a string and then thread it through the lid. Make sure the knot is on the inside of the lid. Screw the lid onto the plastic bottle.
 Using a sharp object like a box cutter, cut a rectangle or square into the top of the bottle. Only cut three sides of the shape so that you can fold it up. Cut it so that when you flip it up the windshield faces the lid of the bottle.
 Using a drill or sharp object, create a hole in the center of the lids.
 Run the axles through the holes you drilled in the bottle caps. See how the car sits. If the lids are too big or too small, then the car may not move. Have the top of the lids face the car so that it has more stability.
 If you don’t want to use the string, then you can push the car to make it move.

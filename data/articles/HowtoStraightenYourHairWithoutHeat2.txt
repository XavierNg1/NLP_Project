 Create a milk and honey mask by mixing 1 cup (236.58 ml) of whole milk or coconut milk with 1 tablespoon (14.78 ml) of honey. Apply the mask by using your hands scoop up the mask and work it through the strands of your hair. Let it soak into your hair for one hour, then wash it out of your hair with water.Hair masks work best if you use them once or twice a week.
This mask may be drippy, so itâ€™s a good idea to apply it over the sink.
 Another variation on a milk mask is a milk and egg mask. Mix two cups (480 ml) of whole or coconut milk along with one egg in a large bowl, whisking to completely break up the yolk. Place the bowl in the sink or on a table and sit directly in front of it, then lean back and soak your hair in the bowl for 10 minutes. After ten minutes, take your hair out of the bowl without squeezing out the excess moisture from the mask and put your hair up in a bun if you have long hair. Wrap plastic wrap around your head and let the mask soak in for another 30 minutes, then unwrap and wash out the mask with water.Wrapping your head with plastic wrap retains the moisture of the mask and the warmth encourages the mask to soak in.
 To create a smoothing coconut milk and lemon juice mask, combine 1 cup (236.58 ml) coconut milk, 6 tablespoons (88.72 ml) of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of olive oil and 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of cornstarch in a microwaveable bowl and mix. Microwave the mixture for about 20 seconds and stir. Repeat until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Let the mask cool, then use your fingers to apply it evenly throughout out hair. Let the mask sit for an hour, then wash it out with water.

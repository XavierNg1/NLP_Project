 As you sit down, place your arms, slightly bent, on either side of you, with your palms flat against the floor. They should be directly below your shoulders. Your legs should be stretched out in front of you, with your heels pressing into the ground.If you are experiencing knee or back pain in this position, you might try bending your knees instead of keeping them straight.Make sure that your hands are facing forward. This will help prevent injury to your wrists.;
, Push up your body off the ground by straightening out your arms. As you do so, retract your shoulders to engage them as stabilizers. Hold this position for about 30 seconds before slowly lowering your body to the floor.


As you raise your body, you should keep your hands planted on the ground directly below your shoulders.
 For this exercise to be done safely and effectively, you want to do a few slow repetitions. Aim for one to three sets with eight to 12 repetitions in each set. Move slowly and with purpose â€” trying to do many repetitions as quickly as possible will not engage your triceps effectively and could lead to shoulder injury. Maintain proper form throughout, keeping your spine straight and your hands positioned beneath your shoulders.


If you are just starting out, you can start with four or five repetitions. Try one to three sets, and take 45- to 60-second breaks between sets. As you get better, you can do fewer sets with more reps.

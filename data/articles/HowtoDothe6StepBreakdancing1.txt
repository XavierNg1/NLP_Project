 Run through the footwork for the routine to a song with a slower tempo at first. Oftentimes, you can listen to jazz, funk, hip-hop, or sampled break beats from a number of different or combined sources (soul, electronic, disco). When in doubt, practice to some of the original artists breakdancers used in their routines such as Al Green, The Meters, Funkadelic, Skull Snaps, Instant Funk, and Taana Gardner., As you become more comfortable with the 6-Step, you will begin to develop your muscle memory. This in turn will allow you to take your conscious attention away from the basic steps and work on ways in which to polish the move as a whole. By varying the music that you use, you will become adaptive and adept at dancing within a wide range of styles and moods. The hallmark of a dynamic dancer is looseness and confidence.

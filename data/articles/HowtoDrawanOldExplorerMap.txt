 A brown paper bag with crinkling is ideal for creating a weathered or parched look for your ancient explorer's map.;
, If you are trying to make the map look tattered and worn, distressed edging would be best, with a few holes, gashes and tears here and there. Perhaps considering burning the edges in the way of the treasure maps. Or, you could cut it nice and straight into a rectangle or square, common map shapes. Consider how the map will end up being mounted as you make the shape tooâ€“the framing or board for mounting might determine some of the sizing.
 Work out the key places in the world or area that they visited, as well as some important features of their exploration.
 It is important to try to make the map as they would have know it in their time, most certainly this will not be a modern day map. Look online or visit the library to find old maps. Map shop staff might be able to help you out with older map versions if you're having trouble finding them.
 This line should represent the voyage that the explorers have taken, from start to finish. Along this line, place stars, or some other clear symbol, to highlight points of great interest in the exploration.
 Write down the names of the areas, and add any facts in speech bubbles or similar externally stuck on notes. Use arrows if needed to make it clear. Alternately, you might like to use pictorial representations of what the explorers discovered, such as pictures of fur, coal, gold, local people, pastures, housing etc. Look online for good photos and print off high quality versions. Photoshop anything that needs to be made to fit or to stand out in a certain way etc.
 Add your signature or a mock explorer's signature if wished. If you are using the map for promotional purposes, add any extra details to promote your business, product, hobby, display, etc.
 Once you are satisfied with its contents, frame or mount it as you wish.

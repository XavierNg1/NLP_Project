 Persuasion is generally forming sentences to be structured in an appealing manner. Think of who you want to influence and why. Think of how you want to influence them and form your thoughts into engaging sentences.


Word-play is a strong skill and can be extremely beneficial in trying to gain a client or sale. For example say: "You're not spending money on a new logo, you're investing in a marketing solution."
Don't confuse persuasion with manipulation; You want to keep their trust and can do so by reinforcing important features of facts.
 The general population tends to conform to what society, at large, agrees on. People think that by following the majority they will be accepted and liked and will go to great lengths to change their opinion just for that purpose.Use conformity in influencing a person that what you are attempting to sell is greatly accepted in your general region.


Include yourself as part of the population that has conformed.
Use examples of how your product is or how it can be popular and why (using actual facts, of course). "The majority of Palo Alto residents are buying Teslas because their supercharger only takes about 20 minutes to fill halfway, saving both time and money!", If you can convince yourself that the product you are selling is the way to go, then you can definitely convince others!

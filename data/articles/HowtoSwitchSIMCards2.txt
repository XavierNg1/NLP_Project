 It is always a good idea to turn off your device properly before making any hardware changes.


On iPhones power off your phone by holding the “Power” button until you get a screen that asks you to slide to power off. Follow the directions on the screen to power off your device and then wait a few seconds while it shuts down.



For the iPhone 4, 5, and 6 series, the SIM card tray is located on the right edge of the device.



Once you push the pin in enough the tray will pop out far enough for you to grab it with your fingers.
Note the orientation of the card you ejected, as you will have to insert your new card the same way (it will only fit one way).
 Simply put the new SIM card in the tray the same way that the old one was situated. Then push the tray back into its slot.


You should hear a clicking sound when the SIM tray is properly back in place.
Try not to touch the gold part of the SIM card too much with your fingers to ensure that it goes in cleanly and can be read.
 It’s easiest to contact your carrier before installing your SIM card. You may have to enter your password to complete activation once the SIM card is in place and you power your phone back on.Power on your phone and check your cellular networks when you are done.


iPhone keeps a record of previously inserted SIM cards, but if the carrier name of your SIM does not show up in the status bar after you changed the SIM you will need to reconnect iPhone through Wi-Fi or USB to iTunes.If iPhone does not work with the SIM card after connecting to iTunes, you might need to restore your iPhone.It’s always a good idea to do a full backup of your phone before changing the SIM card in case you lose any data.

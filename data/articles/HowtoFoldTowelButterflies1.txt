 Take a square washcloth and fold all four corners in towards the center. The point of each corner should meet in the middle.The washcloth can have sharp or rounded corners; the corners won’t be seen.;
, Bunch up the middle of the folded washcloth with one hand, keeping the folded-in corners together in the middle where you’ve placed them. With your other hand, wrap a rubber band a couple of times around the middle to secure the bunch in place.This should leave you with a bow tie shape.
How many times you wrap the rubber band depends on how big of a rubber band you have. Wrap it until it is no longer loose – but not so tight that it might snap.
 Pinch the outside edges of the “wings” in the middle, and push them inwards towards the first rubber band. Hold the new bunch in place with one hand as you secure a rubber band around it with your other hand., Now you should see butterfly really taking shape. Use your fingers to lightly push and tug the wings to fluff and shape them to your liking., Place the washcloth on top of the middle of the pipe cleaner, so that the butterfly’s antennae will be even. Twist the ends of the pipe cleaner twice at what is now the “head” of the butterfly. Bend each antenna down a bit., If you don’t intend for the washcloth to be used, you can add stickers or decorations with glue. For example, cut off bits of pipe cleaner and glue them onto the wings like polka dots. You can use fabric glue or a hot glue gun.


For example, try gluing jeweled stickers or craft puff balls onto the wings!
If you decorate the butterfly with pieces of pipe cleaner, make sure you turn any sharp ends inwards and downwards before gluing so that they don’t stick out.
Make sure to follow all instructions and safety precautions when using hot glue.

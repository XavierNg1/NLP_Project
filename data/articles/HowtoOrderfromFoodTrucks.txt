 The number of them will vary from city to city, and each one of the trucks will have their own food cuisine or "style". Know that some to most food trucks reach out to the public through social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook. If you want to get the most out of food trucks for the first time, ask yourself a few questions:


What types of food do they offer/serve? Is it vegetarian/vegan friendly? Is it seafood or meat sandwiches? Do they offer drinks and/or side meals? Check out their website (if applicable) or other websites that offer reviews to see if anything fancies you.
Is it a specific mealtime, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a combination?
What are their hours of operation? Are they open strictly between 11 am and 2 pm?
Where are they specifically located? You'll need to find out the street name, nearest intersection, etc of where they are parked.
Do they accept cash, credit/debit cards, or both?;
, Depending on the popularity of the truck, there are people that tend to dip out of work to wait. Have patience, as it might take the workers time to prep the food before opening. This also might be a good time to look at their menu, as they will post it on the outside of the truck.
 You will need to provide your name so that they can identify you when your food is ready.
 Unless the food is a "ready made" item, such as packaged food, you will need to wait until everything is fully made. The amount of waiting time also depends how long the line is (how many people are in front of you).
 Double check on the food order, especially if it's for a large group. Be sure that it's your order, since people with very common names, such as John or Linda, might be mixed up with someone else.

 Gloominess is not the same thing as depression, but they can be linked to each another. Make sure you're staying in touch with other people and doing things. However, don't try to be positive if it doesn't feel natural.Don’t isolate yourself from others. If you are feeling particularly down, it helps to talk to other people.
Stay busy with productive activities. Don’t sit around too much thinking about your feelings, but instead do things that make you feel fulfilled.
 Negative emotions or gloominess make people uncomfortable. People may try to “cheer you up”. While they may mean well, don’t let their positivity make you feel pressure to “act” like you feel better.


Embrace uncertainty. Don’t worry about controlling everything in your life. People who are worried about being positive are often trying to control their lives too much.Positive thinking comes from labeling things that happens as good and bad. Avoid this trap by just taking things as they come without trying to always put a positive spin on everything.Thank people for trying to make you feel better. Even if their help is misguided, they are concerned about you.
 Sometimes, you may be not just gloomy, but actually depressed. If you need outside help, don’t feel ashamed to admit it. It does not mean that you’ll become a person obsessed with happiness and positivity.Talk to a friend. Let others know that you’re struggling. They will want to help you out.
Seek out professional treatment. It may be good to see a therapist if you’re feeling especially bad. There’s no reason to not get help if you need it.
Stay true to yourself. Don’t try to become a relentlessly positive person if you’re not one. Being gloomy is a good idea if it’s true to who you are as long as you stay healthy.
Know that being mentally healthy and being gloomy are not exclusive. You can be a healthy person who is gloomy. There’s no total link between gloominess and mental illness.

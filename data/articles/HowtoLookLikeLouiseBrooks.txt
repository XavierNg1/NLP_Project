 Louise was one of the women in the 20s who cut her hair short "a la gar√ßonne" in a bob style.


The easiest option is a sleek and straight bob with front bangs, the length being just at the end of the cheekbone but there are two other options.
*The other option is one Louise herself sported in her later days in hollywood, soft finger waves (which is easier for wavy and curly hair).
*The third, for people who don't want to cut their long hair is a low bun covered with hair folded over it. Louise didn't wear it, but it is a good alternative.
Pair your 'dos with flower crowns, cloche hats, drapey scarves, feathered headbands and berets.;
, Makeup is very simple, as few makeup products were available in the 20s.


Matte Powder. Louise had light skin, so if you have dark skin use a shade lighter than usual. If you want to feel really 20s use a powder puff.
Louise had her eyebrows plucked and drawn on, but a modern girl who wants to keep her eyebrows could simply cover them and draw on her shape. Use a dark eyebrow pencil in either case.
Black kohl around the eyes to get a piercing gaze.
A light puff of red blush, barely noticeable was Louise's signature look.
Dark red lipstick, extending the cupids bow a bit onto the skin. Don't forget the lipliner!

, Wear knee length undefined waistline, sleeveless, boat and scoop neck dresses, loose swing coats, tutus, sheer brown stockings and even occasionally a tuxedo! For colors wear white, black, silver and jewel tones. Don't forget leather french heel shoes!

, Make your expressions a bit emphasized, not as much as a film star, just more than your girl on the street. Remember, Louise was a movie star and she presented herself like one.

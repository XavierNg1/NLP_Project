 Spread the coals in a half circle on one side of the charcoal grate.;
, This maintains the temperature of the fire.
 Keep all the vents open. If you are using a gas grill, preheat the grill on high until the temperature hits 500 °F (260 °C). Then turn the burners down to indirect low heat (300 to 350 deg F)

, Remove the giblets, neck, etc. from the bird. Lightly coat the bird with some of the melted butter, and season with pepper.
 Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Place the turkey breast side down in the roasting pan.
 If you’re using a charcoal grill, place the pan so that the turkey legs face the charcoal. Add half of your applewood to the charcoal or put them in the smoker box of your gas grill.
 Position it between the lit charcoal using long-handled tongs. Add the remaining applewood. Also, turn the turkey over in the pan so the breast faces up. Continue grilling over indirect low heat with the lid closed for another hour.
 If any parts are getting too dark, wrap them with aluminum foil. Once again add 10-12 charcoal briquettes to the lit charcoal to maintain the heat of your charcoal grill. Continue cooking over indirect low heat. The total cooking time will be 2.5 to 3.5 hours. The bird is done when the internal temp reaches 175 °F (79 °C) in the thick part of the thigh and 165 in the breast.
 While it’s resting, make the gravy.

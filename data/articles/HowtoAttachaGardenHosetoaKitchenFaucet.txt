 This is a small adapter that screws onto the faucet and converts the end of the faucet into a male garden hose fitting.;
, Take care not to drop pieces that are contained within the tip. A good idea is to put a towel in the sink to catch anything you may drop; the towel will prevent things from going down the drain.
 Make sure that it forms a good seal with the faucet, but there is no need to use tools to tighten it.









If a vacuum breaker is not integrated into your plumbing system, screw a hose-type vacuum breaker on the hose threads before you connect the garden hose. Hose-type vacuum breakers are available at hardware stores. This prevents a siphon from developing and drawing chemicals or waste into the drinking water supply if the hose gets accidentally left in (submerged in) a container with cleaning chemicals or contaminated, un-potable water.
 Make sure that the gasket is in the hose before attaching the hose to the faucet, or you will have a soggy mess on your hands.
 The hose screws onto the faucet adapter. Make sure it is screwed on tightly enough so that it forms a watertight seal.
 Remove the hose and faucet adapter, then screw the faucet tip back on relatively tightly so that it forms a good seal.









Check for leaks. The faucet may leak from the replaced faucet tip if the seal is not as good as it originally was.
 To prevent or stop leaks from the faucet tip, first remove the faucet tip, then apply two or three turns of Teflon tape clockwise to the threaded area of the faucet.









Pull the tape tightly around the threaded area of the faucet, being careful not to let extra tape overhang the area where the water exits the faucet, as it may impede the flow of the water.
 Excess tape may be visible, but this is not a problem.
 Cut the excess tape gently with a knife, and peel away the scraps.

There is a rectangle called ABCD in a fourth of a circle.
Point B is the center of the circle.
From Point B to Point C is 5 inches (12.7 cm). From Point C to the circle's edge is 5 inches (12.7 cm).
What is the distance of AC?;
,, You'll see that BD equals AC.
 Adding the distance of BC and C & the edge gives you 10 inches (25.4 cm)., If BD equals AC, and if BD is the radius, how long is AC?

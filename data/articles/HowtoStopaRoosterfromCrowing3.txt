 A Rooster collar limits the airflow to a rooster’s voice box, which reduces the volume of his crows.

Adhere the back sides of the velcro to each other., Place the rooster in your lap—his head should face away from you. Circle your thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand around his neck. Lift his feathers by moving your hands up his neck., Use your dominant hand to grab the collar. Lay one end of the collar on the back of the rooster’s neck. Use the thumb encircling the rooster’s neck to hold the collar in place.Position the collar low on the rooster’s neck.
 As you continue to hold the collar with your thumb, use your dominant hand to wrap the collar around the rooster’s next. Overlap the collar and secure the velcro.

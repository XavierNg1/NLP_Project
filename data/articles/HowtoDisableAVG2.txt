 If AVG is taking too many resources or conflicting with your programs, you can uninstall it and replace it with Windows Defender.


You can open the Control Panel from the Start menu, or by right-clicking the Windows button and selecting Control Panel (Windows 10 and 8).
 If you're in category view, click "Uninstall a program." A list of installed programs will appear.
 You'll need to uninstall AVG's additional services before you can uninstall AVG itself. The most common of these is AVG Protection.
 This button appears at the top of the list after you select a program. This will launch the AVG uninstaller.
 You'll be prompted to restart your computer, which you can skip at the moment.
 Once you've removed all of the programs that AVG installed along with it, you can uninstall AVG itself. Select "AVG," click "Uninstall," then follow the prompts in the uninstaller.
 This will finalize the removal process.
 If you encounter errors during the uninstallation process, or AVG otherwise refuses to uninstall, you can use a utility from the AVG developers to completely remove it from your system:


Visit avg.com/utilities in your browser.
Download the "AVG Remover" program. You may be prompted by your browser to download the file since it is in EXE format.
Run the EXE file after downloading it and click "Continue" to remove all traces of AVG.
 It is not recommended that you use your computer online without virus protection of some kind enabled. Windows comes with Windows Defender, which can protect from most of the same attacks that AVG protected against.Open the Start menu or screen and type "Windows Defender."
Click the link to enable Windows Defender if prompted.
Click the "Check for updates now" button to download any available Windows Defender updates.

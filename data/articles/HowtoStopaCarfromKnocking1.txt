 In order for the fuel to ignite at the proper time during the combustion cycle, you have to use at least the recommended minimum octane level. In the US this, is usually 87, but there are some higher end performance cars that require higher.Check your owner’s manual if you are unsure what octane rating your car uses.;
, If you discover that you have been using the wrong fuel, you can add an octane booster to your tank. It doesn’t matter much which brand you choose as they are designed to simply increase the octane level of your fuel, allowing you to use the gas in your tank.Adding the booster is quite simple ― you just pour it into your gas tank.
 Using an octane booster to get through your last tank of low octane fuel is fine, but from now, on you want to buy the right kind of fuel. You should also keep in mind that whatever low octane fuel is left in your tank when you fill up will mix with your new fuel, so if knocking continues, go ahead and use the octane booster for another fill-up or two until most of the low octane fuel is gone.


It is also thought that using a "top-tier" gasoline such as Shell or Chevron will decrease engine deposits that can cause knocking.

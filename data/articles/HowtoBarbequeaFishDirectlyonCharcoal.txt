 Use branches from trees that are used for firewood. Do not use lumber because they might be chemically treated.;
,, Save your prized catch for home cooking and pick a fish that is average to good in taste because there will be some wastage. Do not pick a fish with thin skin and small scales like a mackerel. An average tasting fish will taste good when cooked on charcoal and outdoors.
 The scale or thick skin will protect the meat from burning. After a while, the aroma of wood burning and fish cooking will be quite appealing.
 After turning the fish over, do not cook it too long. Like cooking in a pan, the first side takes longer to cook. Poke at the fish with a fork to test if it its cooked, if the fork does not go in - let it cook longer.
 Discard the charred exterior.

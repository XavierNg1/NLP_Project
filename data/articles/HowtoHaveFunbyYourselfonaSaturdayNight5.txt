 There are many ways to stream movies on demand nowadays, and it's pretty inexpensive: try Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Media. If you don't have the internet, make a trip to a Redbox or rewatch a movie you've already seen. If you've got a long night alone, watch more than one movie.Make some popcorn or other snacks for extra fun. Movie night isn't the same without some popcorn and movie theater candy, so make a trip to the grocery store for some inexpensive snacks.
Watch a classic. If you've got a list of movies you've been meaning to watch, check a couple off of your list. Watch an old Marilyn Monroe movie, or watch back to back John Wayne westerns.
Watch a series. Watching all three original Star Wars movies or all three Lord of the Rings films might take a while, but you'll be able to fully immerse yourself in the story. Check out other series like Star Trek, The Hunger Games, or Indiana Jones.
 If you understand another language, it can be fun to watch a foreign film without subtitles. If you don't understand any other languages, make up your own comical dialog for the film. Try the foreign film sections of your local film rental shop or Netflix to find an interesting foreign movie.
 Using a video camera, a Webcam, or even your phone, make your own movie. Write a simple script and then ad lib your lines to make a comedy, a drama, or a horror film. At the end of the night, make popcorn and hold a "screening" of your film.

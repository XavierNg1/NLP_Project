 You are adding the extra inches/centimeters so that you can overlap the ends of the crown and close it.;
, Find a large sheet of paper and cut it down to fit your measurement. Draw a horizontal line across the paper, 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the bottom. This is the band part. Draw your crown shape right above the band. It can be anything you want, such as a large zigzag, waves, or even a triangle in the center. When you are done, cut the template out.


To make your design symmetrical, fold the paper in half, vertically. Draw your design, with the center of your design touching the fold, and then cut it out.
 The paper can be any color you want. You can even use gold or silver poster paper. Try to use a pencil to do the tracing; that way, you can erase any marks later on. If you paper is colored on one side, the trace the design onto the back of the paper.


If you can't find any poster paper, you can use cardstock, provided that it is long enough. You can also use craft foam.
 If you used a pencil to do the tracing, carefully erase any marks.


Consider saving the template so that you can use it later on to make more princess crowns.
 You can paint it all one color, or you can paint designs onto it. If you want to make a traditional princess crown, then consider using silver or gold paint.


You can use acrylic paint and paintbrushes to paint the crown all one color. You can also use it to paint pretty designs onto it.
You can use spray paint to paint your crown all one color. Do this outside or in a well-ventilated area. Be sure to protect your work surface with lots of newspaper.
 You can decorate your crown however you want, using glue, sequins, rhinestones, glitter, and so forth. Once you finish decorating your crown, set it in a safe place and let it dry completely. Here are some decorating ideas to get you started:


Outline the crown using glitter. You can draw the designs first using white school glue, and then shake glitter onto the glue. You can also use glitter glue.
Use tacky glue or hot glue to stick on pretty beads, gems, pearls, sequins, or rhinestones.
Draw designs onto the crown using markers.
Add a feather boa. Draw a line of glue along the bottom of your crown. Start at the left edge, and stop 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the right edge. Press a thin, feather (Marabou) boa into the glue and trim off the excess. You are leaving 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) uncovered so that you can glue your crown shut.
 You can use hot glue, glue dots, tacky glue, or even a stapler. If you are using tacky glue, you might want to pinch the ends shut with a paper clip or a binder clip until the glue dries.
 Even though your crown is made out of poster paper, it is still fragile. It can tear easily if you are not gentle with it. When you are done playing with your crown, keep it on a shelf so that it does not get bent.

 Get out a small prep bowl and pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cold water into it. Sprinkle 1 scant tablespoon of gelatin (or 1 packet) over the cold water. Set the gelatin mixture aside for 5 to 10 minutes.Avoid stirring the gelatin while it hydrates. This could make it clump.
 Transfer the gelatin mixture into a medium mixing bowl. Slowly whisk 1/4 cup (60 ml) of hot (but not boiling) water into the gelatin. Keep whisking until the gelatin dissolves completely., Wash and trim the stems from 2 pints (680 g) of strawberries. Place these into a blender or food processor along with 1/4 to 1/2 cup (50 to 100 g) of sugar. For a tangier jello, you can also juice 1/2 of a lime and pour the juice in. Puree the ingredients until they're smooth.You can also use frozen strawberries. Defrost them before putting them in the blender.
 Place a metal strainer over the bowl and pour the strawberry puree into it. The strainer will catch most of the pulp and seeds. You may need to use a rubber spatula to gently press the puree against the strainer. This will push the juice through the strainer into the bowl.You can discard the seeds and strawberry pulp in the strainer.
 Pour the jello mixture into a jello mold, baking dish, or individual serving bowls. Put the jello in the refrigerator and chill the jello for 4 hours or until it's set. Serve the jello once it's firm.You can slice the jello or scoop it out of the bowl. Consider serving the jello with fresh whipped cream.

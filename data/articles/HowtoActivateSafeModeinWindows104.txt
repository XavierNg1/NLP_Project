 In Windows 7, it is possible to interrupt the boot process by pressing F8 or Shift + F8 before Windows is loaded. This is still possible in Windows 10 but rather difficult because Windows 10 loads very fast. Warning: This method does not work with new PCs with a UEFI BIOS and a fast SSD drive.
 You have to be able to press F8 or Shift + F8 before the Windows logo appears. This is the tricky part since Windows 10 loads very fast. You may have to try this a couple of times, and this is not possible with newer computers. If you are successful, pressing F8 or Shift+F8 will load the Recovery screen.
 In the Recovery screen, click the button labeled “See advanced repair options.” This will take you to the next screen which is labeled “Choose an option”.
, At the Windows Startup Settings, click the “Restart” button at the bottom right side of the window. Your computer will reboot and open the Advanced Boot Options screen.
 At the Advanced Boot Options screen, you will see several boot options, three of which are safe boot options—Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, and Safe Mode with Command Prompt.


Note that the interface of the Advanced Boot Option is not a graphical interface. You navigate to the various options using the Up or Down arrow key. Your choice will be highlighted as you move the arrow key up or down. Highlight your choice and press “Enter.” This will boot your computer in safe mode.

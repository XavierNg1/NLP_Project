,, You can choose to mix it in a standing mixer (which will take about 6-7 minutes), or to knead the dough by hand on a floured surface.
 Place your dough in the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let stand for about an hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.
 Divide the dough into two halves, then shape each half into an oval, punching it down to flatten it.
 Place the two ovals on an oiled baking sheet. Cover a sheet of plastic wrap in oil, cover the ovals with the plastic wrap, and let it rise for 1 hour, or until they have doubled in size again.
 While you're waiting for your dough to rise, combine flour, oil, sugar, and water in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking it until it has thickened (approximately 2 minutes). After it has thickened, remove it from heat and let it cool.
 While waiting for the dough to rise, pre-heat the oven to 450F.
 Use your fingers to make 5 deep ridges running lengthwise through your dough.
 Divide the roomal in half and cover each half of dough with the roomal. If you would like to use the sesame and/or nigella seeds, sprinkle them on top of the dough as well.

 Find a way to sweat — yes, really sweat — for 30 minutes at least 3 to 5 times every week. Take a dance class; go jogging or biking; join a hiking club; play tennis, racket ball, soccer, or basketball; walk laps around the block. Do something. It will improve not only your fitness, but also your outlook on life and the world.


Being fit is always more attractive than not being fit. And don't think you have to be a skinny model to be fit; fitness is about being able to move, breathe, and keep up during a physical activity.
Exercise is also a secret potion for happiness and well-being, and being happy always makes you more attractive.
 No one likes to be around someone who looks or smells bad. Every morning and night, brush your teeth for 2 minutes. Don't forget to floss; most cavities occur between teeth that are hard to clean with a brush. Wash your hands after using the bathroom, keep your nails clean, shower with soap, and wear antiperspirant.


A lack of hygiene is a huge red flag for interpersonal relationships; after, if you aren’t willing to take care of yourself, why should anyone else be?

 This involves the use of expensive equipment, and is time consuming. Unless your lab is stocked with the right equipment, consider trying a different method. However, if you can, measuring wet and dry mass gives you more consistent readings. You will need:Hydraulic gravity convection oven
Aluminum weighing pan
Set of flasks
Centrifuge or laboratory filtration system

, If not, pour it into one. It should be in broth at this stage, though it will be separated out again later.
 An alternative is a cellulose acetate filter membrane, 47mm in diameter, 0.45µm in pore size.Whichever you use, weigh it now so you know how much to subtract from your measurement later when you have the bacteria cells on it.
 The cells will naturally sink due to gravity. Give them a stir to make sure they are evenly spread out in the flask. This way you will get a more representative sample.
 This tool spins the flask and a counterweight rapidly, draining the broth and leaving the culture. See this guide for a more detailed description of the process.
 Discard the broth. You won't need it any more, but you will need the flask, so hold onto it.
 Add the flask of rinse water to the bacteria cells. This gives you wet weight.
 To measure dry weight, place the pan in the oven and dry at 100ºC for 6 to 24 hours, following the instructions of your specific oven and/or weighing pan. Make sure you are not over this temperature so the bacteria don't burn. Weigh the bacteria after this time, and remember to subtract the weight of the weighing pan.

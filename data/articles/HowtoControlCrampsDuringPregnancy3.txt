 Cramps are defined as acute pain for a short period of time; they might appear in both normal and pathological situations. They do not appear in all pregnancies but many of pregnant women experience them.
 Cramps that occur in pregnancy are often linked with:


Nutrient deficiency, specifically calcium, potassium and magnesium. These essential minerals help your muscles, bones, and nerves to function properly. If you do not have enough of these nutrients, your muscles may cramp up.
Prolonged standing. When you stand still for a long time, blood can pool in your lower extremities, causing cramps.
Dehydration can also cause cramps. Insufficient amounts of water in the body will result in muscle tightening and painful spasms in order to compensate for the amount of fluid loss.
 It is very important to keep in mind that any abdominal cramp during pregnancy must be discussed with your obstetrician or gynecologist , especially if it appears in the late stages of the pregnancy.


If you experience an acute, severe pain in your abdomen with possible extension to your groin area, accompanied by weakness, pale skin and a generally altered state you must immediately call the Emergency Services or go to the nearest Emergency Center because you might be having a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
It is also important to seek immediate medical attention if the cramping is accompanied by any vaginal bleeding.

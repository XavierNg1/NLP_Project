 Some people claim to have had success in healing piercing bumps with tea tree oil, which is a common ingredient in many home remedies due to its antibacterial properties.


Make sure to buy 100% pure tea tree oil, as this is the least likely to cause irritation.
If your skin is not sensitive, just apply a drop or two of the tea tree oil onto a cotton swab and apply directly to the bump. Do this twice a day until the bump disappears.
If you do have sensitive skin, it's a good idea to dilute the tea tree oil (which is very strong) with a drop or two of water before applying it to the ear.
 Aspirin is believed to be effective in the treatment of cartilage piercing bumps as it opens up the blood vessels beneath the skin, thereby speeding up the healing process.


Place an aspirin tablet in a small bowl and crush it with the back of a spoon. Add a couple of drops of water and mix until it forms a paste.
Apply the paste directly onto the piercing bump then leave it to dry for ten minutes. Rinse off the hardened paste with some warm water.
Repeat this process two or three times a day for best results., Lemon juice is another home remedy some people have found effective in the treatment of cartilage bumps.


Squeeze the juice from half a lemon, then mix to half strength with water. Dip a q-tip in the lemon water and apply to the bump.
Repeat two or three times a day until you see an improvement in the size off the bump.
 Honey contains natural healing properties and is often used in home remedies for the treatment of scars and burns.


Therefore, it could potentially help with the treatment of cartilage piercing bumps. Try applying a dab of honey to the bump, two or three times a day.

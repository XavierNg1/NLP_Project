 It may sound harsh, but you must bring boundaries into the house and do it early, because then they will be less upset when you punish them. Physical punishments are illegal in some locations and many people, including child care experts, don't believe in slapping children. Look into punishments and behaviour adjustment techniques such as the naughty-steps method, scoldings and the warning-warning-punishment technique.;
, Read to your children and with your children. Do not let them get used to watching TV all day. Read them to sleep, and also give them educational books that teach them to read and write themselves.
 Whilst your offspring are obviously not simian in nature, to a greater or lesser degree, monkey see-monkey do. You should not do something that you wish your children not to do, even when they are not in your presence.
 Feed your children with fruit and vegetables, of as many different varieties as you can. This will, possibly, help to make them good children. Teach them to brush. Good children have brushed teeth, brushed hair and brushed other things. You should widen their taste to different foods but don't force your child to eat things they don't enjoy the taste off.
 As your child gets older they want more respect and privacy but at the same time they deep-down want your love. Learn to respect and give them a more mature love that doesn't involve kissing.
 It doesn't work and only ends up with older children getting angrier.
 You should be asking them what they did in school today, what they enjoy and don't and especially what they find difficult.
 Don't choose their bedroom layout for them, or tell them what jobs they can't and can do, it makes them feel useless and annoyed, and they may also be afraid they will upset you.
 Older siblings should not be left out or be made to feel like they must be an example. Let older siblings feel involved in younger siblings being brought up- but don't shove the responsibility of being a parent on them.

 Grab a thick section of hair from your hair line. Divide that section into four smaller strands. For the sake of this tutorial, think of them as strands: A, B, C, and D.
 Take strand A. Cross it over strand B, then under strand C. Finally, bring it over strand D. You are working from right to left.








For the rest of this tutorial, you will be weaving the middle two strands, and ignoring the other two strands.
 Now, you are working from left to right. Ignoring strand A, weave strand D over strand C and under strand B.
 Ignore strand D. Take strand B. Weave it under strand C and over strand A on the far left side.
 Always ignore the first and last strands on the far left and right. Weave them over and under across the other strands, like a basket, until you reach the bottom.Keep braiding until the braid is the length you want.
 Use a thin hair tie that matches your hair color, or a clear one.
 For a simple look, let dangle down the length of your hair. You can also tuck it behind your ear and secure it with a bobby pin. Here are some other styling ideas:









Make a second braid on the other side of your head. Bring both braids around to the back of your head. Secure them with bobby pins, then cover them with strands of hair.Make a second braid on the other side of your head. Gather all of your hair into a low bun at the nap of your head.Fluff up the braid for a fuller look. Grab the bottom of the braid with one hand, and the elastic with the other. Slide the elastic upwards, then gently tug on the outer strands on the braid.

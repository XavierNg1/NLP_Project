Orange roughy is growing in popularity, and now can be found at most grocery stores or fish markets. When choosing orange roughy, look for a fish that has moist skin, clear eyes, and does not present a fishy odor.
While orange roughy is most commonly sold in fillets, some locations may still sell the whole fish. If this is a problem, ask the fishmonger to clean the fish for you before you purchase it. Most grocery store or fish market experts will be willing to do this free of charge.


Orange roughy, which is to be grilled, should be seasoned with a small amount of salt and pepper on both sides before starting the cooking process. Drizzling the fish with a small amount of freshly squeezed lemon juice is also a good choice.


A grill that is being used to cook orange roughy should be quite hot. Start the grill at least 20 minutes before applying the fish for best cooking results.


Orange roughy has a relatively delicate texture. Because of this, grilling can be quite hard on the fish physically. To prevent tearing or damaging the flesh of the fish, consider placing it in a grilling basket. These are small "cages" which can be placed directly on top of a grill, and are effective at cooking a variety of foods which otherwise might not fare well on a grill.


In general, 4 minutes per side on the grill for the orange roughy is plenty of time to ensure complete cooking.

 Pots can be any containers that will hold the plants while they grow.









Make sure there is at least 1 hole at the bottom of the pot. This will allow water to move and drain through the soil freely. Include a saucer or dish under the pot to prevent leaking.
Choose any pots that you find appealing. They can be simple or decorative, and they come in all sizes. Lightweight pots such as plastic and resin are easy to move around. For sturdier pots, choose those made from wood or clay.;
, Soil from your yard or garden will not work for potted plants. You need something loose and light.


Buy a soil mixture from your local garden or home improvement store. Make sure it includes peat moss and other organic matter.
Look for a potting mix that include fertilizers. Some soil comes with time-release fertilizers, which will cut down on your plant maintenance by fertilizing the soil when it is needed.



Consider the space that you will keep your potted plants in. Choose plants that will do well in sun or shade, depending on where you plan to keep them.
Check the tags on the plants in the garden center for tips on how much sunlight and water each type of plant requires.
Assign one plant per pot. Even if you have a large pot, use only one kind of flower or plant in it. This will prevent overcrowding.
 Fill the pot up to about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) from the top of the pot, and pat the soil down lightly with your fingers to push out any pockets of air.
 Fill in the pot with additional soil.
 Keep the soil moist, but not saturated with water. Pay attention to any watering instructions that come with the plant.
, Instead of placing the plant in the soil, sprinkle the seeds onto the soil and cover with additional soil.

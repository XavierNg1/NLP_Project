 If you want to save your project's .sb2 file on the local hard-drive/computer for now, you don't have to log on to Scratch.;
, Click this button to start a new project and continue on with the steps. If you already have the offline editor, instead you launch the application. Your project should be created instantly.
 Click on the Control section and there will be a "when green flag clicked" cap, also is known as the "flag cap" or the "project started" block. This block is the base block which is used by dragging it into the empty space on the right side of the website.
 Any blocks will work together unless they don't have bumps that go together, like a cap block, having round tops and bumps on their bottom, under a stack block which have holes on top and bumps below them.
 Clicking the green flag is like a start button and runs scripts with the Green Flag clicked cap block. Testing your project is a way to look at how your blocks work together.
 To download the project, you click on File in the left corner of the gray bar and then click "Download to your Computer". Select a place to save your file and then you can close out of the Scratch website or program. To share it with others, you click Share on the other side of the gray bar. If you are using the program or not signed in yet, you will be asked to login or signup for your own Scratch account.
 Keep all of your Scratch projects recent and update them about every week or so, or about every month if you don't really use them that much. You can edit any of your projects by clicking their name in your My Stuff folder or by clicking See Inside on the project's page. This process can help get your project more popular.

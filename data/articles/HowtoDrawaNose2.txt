 A normal circle is your guide, once again, for forming the nose.









Almost all of the steps are nearly identical to those outlined in "Front-Facing Nose," but they are slid to the left or right to put the nose in profile.
 The first one will be about dead center, the second almost on the far right edge of the circle. Note that, if you want to draw the nose from the other side, you simply flip these lines. Both lines should continue a bit into the circle.
 This line should be the length of your circle, but shifted over so that it doesn't fit. The left side of the line will leave the circle, the right side won't touch the right edge.
 Put your left nostril at the end of your horizontal line, then draw a concave line for the top of the nostril right where your horizontal line ends. When the nose is turned, you barely see the far nostril, so a little backward "J" pressed close to the circle should be enough for the right nostril.
 This line will be the underside of your exposed nostril. The line extends diagonally from the horizontal line you drew to the left, towards the bottom of the left nostril. It will create a little triangle on the left side of your circle.
 Again-- anything near the lines is shaded in heavier than anything far away. Start with light, easy shading around the lines, filling in the blocks of shading and the general contours of the nose. Then use a thicker, harder pencil to add in your blacks and darkest patches along your guidelines, paying particular attention to the nostrils and the long vertical lines forming the bridge of the nose.









Keep the space between the two vertical lines and the space above your horizontal guideline mostly white.

 Start Thunderbird, and then download and install the plugin "ImportExportTools" from this site.;
, The Import guide will tell you to either "Import everything" or only e-mail, e-mail addresses, settings or filters. Click "Next" to continue, and choose the e-mail client you are currently using (Outlook Express, Microsoft Outlook, or Seamonkey). To import from a web mail account, add an account by going to the account settings, and insert name, mail address and password belonging to the webmail ID.
 You will then be prompted to choose a directory for your e-mail folders. Make sure the mail lands on a removable flash drive. Alternatively you can click "copy folder path on disk" on the drop - down menu once you have selected "import/export". Then paste in the folder path in the "Run" application and copy the folder with your e-mail over to the removable drive.
 Run Thunderbird and install ImportExportTools. Plug in the flash drive with the e-mail folders, right click somewhere on the empty space in the mail browser, choose "import/export", "import all eml files from directory" and click "also from its subdirectories". Now you should be able to see your mail in Thunderbird.

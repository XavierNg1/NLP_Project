 Turn the broiler on and allow it to warm up for about 3 to 5 minutes.


Most broilers only have an “ON” and “OFF” setting, but some also have “LOW” and “HIGH” settings. For the latter, preheat the broiler on “LOW.”

, Arrange the sausages in a single layer on a broiler pan. Place the pan in the preheated broiler, 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) away from the top heating element.If you do not have a broiler pan, place a metal cooling/cooking rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and use that instead. You need to use something that allows the fat to drain as the sausages cook, so you should avoid using a flat baking sheet on its own.
Both sausage links and sausage patties can be cooked using this method. For sausage links, place the rack 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) away from the heating element. For sausage patties, keep the rack 6 inches (15 cm) away from the same element.
For roll breakfast sausage, slice the roll into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick portions and treat each portion as though it were a pre-formed patty.
 Broil the sausages for 3 minutes, then turn them over to the other side. Continue cooking for another 3 minutes, or until the juices run clear and the centers are no longer pink.


This amount of time should work for both breakfast patties and breakfast links, but links may benefit from more frequent cooking and, in some instances, may cook a little faster than patties.
The internal temperature of both links and patties should reach at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) before you remove the sausages from the broiler.
 Remove the sausages from the broiler and transfer them to individual serving plates. Enjoy them while they're still hot.


If you do not eat the sausages immediately, refrigerate them for 1 or 2 days, or freeze them for as long as 1 month.

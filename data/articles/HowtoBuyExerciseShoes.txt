Consider a track and field shoe if your exercise includes running on a track or performing field events such as long jump.
Purchase a cross-country or trail shoe if you plan on walking or running through more rugged terrain than concrete or pavement.
Select a walking shoe for low-intensity exercise. These shoes can usually be worn for everyday activities to promote good posture and provide good support.
Decide on a running shoe if your primary exercise focus is running, either on a treadmill or outdoors.
Opt for other specialty exercise shoes, such as lacrosse, wrestling, hiking, cleats or water shoes as needed.;

Place a piece of cardboard on the floor and dip your foot in water.
Walk on the cardboard and study the shape your foot made. Decide if you have high arches, flat feet or neutral feet.
If you have high arches, your footprint will show a thin connection between your heel and toes. High-arched feet require flexible shoes with extra cushioning in the mid-sole.
If you have flat feet, your footprint will show a complete connection between your heel and toes. Flat feet require extra support in shoes.

Test multiple shoes. Some brands run more narrow or wider than others. Finding the right brand might mean finding the perfect fit.

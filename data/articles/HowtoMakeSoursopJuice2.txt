 The strainer should be small enough to fit over the bowl without any overlap, and the bowl should be large enough to contain all the liquid from your soursop. The strainer should also have fairly small gaps. The larger the gaps are, the more likely that pulp will get through.
 This process may take a while, depending on the size of your strainer.
 Typically, lime juice, ginger, and sugar make a good, authentic combination, as does a mix of nutmeg and vanilla.
 Serve it chilled or over ice.

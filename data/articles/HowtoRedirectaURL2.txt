 If you're unsure of your own coding ability or just want to redirect a URL without digging into the code, there are several redirection services available and your current web host may be one of them. Many popular web hosts offer redirection services and the accompanying support to help you achieve your goals. Check on the features your current host/plan offers or contact them directly about what your options are.
 If your web host doesn't offer redirection, there are many other options out there. Depending on what your redirection needs are you may be able to do this for free.Many services allow you to configure options for your redirect such as the type (permanent or temporary) or whether query parameters are passed along.
Very few redirection services will allow you to forward HTTPS (secure) links.
 Typically these services are extremely user-friendly and can help walk you through the process, prompting you at each step for the correct information.


Note: in some cases you'll still need to be able to edit the DNS (domain name server) records for the domain names you'd like to redirect. These are accessible through your web host.
 Your 3rd party redirection provider will let you know if this is necessary and you can access and edit these records from your web hosting account.


The instructions to edit DNS records this step will vary by the service used, but typically both the redirection service provider and your web host will have easy-to-follow instructions.

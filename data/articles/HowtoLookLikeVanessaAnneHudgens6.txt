 Vanessa is hardly seen frowning- she always looks friendly and warm. Use whitening toothpaste for pearly whites that never stop shining. Don't skip the floss and the mouthwash!

, For example, instead of covering your face with thick makeup, opt for a light brush of bronzer on your nose, forehead and cheekbones, a bit of tinted moisturizer to even out skin tone, a coat of brown mascara (brown looks natural) and a slick of clear lip gloss. Teamed with care-free tousled locks, and a killer smile, you'll look hot without looking plastic!

 If you own the thermal carafe Bunn model, you will need to take apart the decanter periodically in order to thoroughly clean the lid. You can remove the lid by rotating it counterclockwise., While cleaning, pay particular attention to the valve in the center of the lid. Do not use an abrasive sponge because this could scratch the surface.The lid must be washed by hand and is not dishwasher safe.
 In order to remove the valve, you need to pull up at the edges. Then, clean the valve with warm water and a mild soap. Alternatively, you could place the valve in the dishwasher. To replace the valve, align it with the slot on the lid of the pot and press the valve into the hole.This type of thorough cleaning should be done once a month.
 In order to give your Bunn decanter a more thorough clean, you should begin by placing a paper filter into the funnel of the coffee maker., Then pour two teaspoons of dishwashing detergent into the filter. Slide the filter funnel into place., This can be done by filling the Bunn coffee pot with water and then pouring the water into the back of the coffee maker. Return the coffee pot to the base and start the brewer.
 Once the brewing is complete, remove the brew funnel and dispose of the coffee filter. Rinse the funnel thoroughly in warm to remove any soap that may have been left behind., Allowing water to soak in the pot will help to loosen any stains that may develop on the sides of the pot.
 Using a soft bristled brush with a long handle, scrub the inside of the coffee pot to remove any stains.
 Once you have thoroughly brushed the sides of the pot, you can dump the water and detergent solution down the sink. Then rinse the coffee pot with warm water to remove any residual soap.

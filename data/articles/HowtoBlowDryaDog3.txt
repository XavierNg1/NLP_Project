 As with any potentially scary object, it is best if you introduce the dryer slowly. Lay the dryer on the ground (turned off) and let your dog approach it. Give him treats and praise after each inspection. After a while, turn the dryer on and face the nozzle away from your dog. Let him approach and inspect it once more, again following with treats., Any time that the dryer is on, make sure to keep an eye on the temperature. You want to be particularly concerned about the heat and any possible burns although the cold can prove uncomfortable as well. Too high of a temp can even cause overheating or a skin rash., With a skittish or anxious dog it may be best to draw out the drying process. Try to cover about 25% of the coat at a time before taking a quick break. Use these breaks as an opportunity to praise your dog. Keep going until the process is done. Over time, hopefully, you can cut out these short breaks entirely., From start to finish make sure to give out healthy treats to your dog to encourage their continued good behavior. Recognize that it may be difficult for them to stand still to be dried. Also, provide verbal and physical praise as well.You might say, “Good job!” Or, you could occasionally pat your dog’s head too.
 It is important to place your dog’s safety and comfort over your desire to dry them perfectly. Always hand or air dry the areas directly around your dog’s eyes, nose, and mouth. Shooting a stream of air into these area may be quite painful otherwise. It is best to also let the genitals air dry as well.

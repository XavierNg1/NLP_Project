 Press the tips of your fingers into your palm so that your hand makes a fist.This will be the position that you keep your hand in for the bump., Place your fist in front of your body with your knuckles facing up. Look at the other person to see if they are going to reciprocate. If they don't notice that you want to fist bump, look down at your hand so that they realize what's going on.
 When the other person puts up their fist, push your arm forward so that your knuckles meet with their knuckles. Don't do it too hard because it could hurt them or come off as aggressive.

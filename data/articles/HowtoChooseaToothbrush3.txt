 You should see a seal from the American Dental Association (ADA) on the label of any quality toothbrush. These toothbrushes have been examined for safety and efficiency. Do not get a toothbrush without an ADA seal., While toothbrushes come in a variety of bristle strengths, you should usually opt for softer bristles. This is less taxing on your gums and tooth enamel. Go for a soft bristle brush over a hard or medium bristle brush., Some toothbrushes sell for less than a dollar. You can also sometimes find packs of toothbrushes for very cheap. These toothbrushes are not as high quality as other types of brushes, and some of them may not even have an ADA seal. It is worth paying a little extra money for a quality product., A toothbrush is just one component of oral hygiene. Make sure to also invest in quality floss and mouthwash. This is important for optimal tooth health.

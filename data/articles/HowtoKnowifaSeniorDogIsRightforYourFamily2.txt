 One of the benefits of adopting an older dog is that “what you see is what you get.” An older dog isn’t going to surprise you, the way a puppy might. You can easily get a sense of an senior dog’s temperament, which tends to be very stable., When you bring home a puppy, you are taking a gamble in terms of size, as you can never be 100% sure how big your dog will get. Senior dogs are finished growing, so you can witness their full size before you bring them home.This can be especially helpful if you have a small home or limited outdoor space.
 Although some people may not want to bring home a pet that will live less than 10 years, for other families, a pet with a slightly shorter lifespan may be ideal. If you’d rather not sign up for 15+ years of pet obligations, perhaps a senior dog is the right choice for you.If you'd rather not continue taking care of a dog after your kids have gone off to college, this could be the dog for you.

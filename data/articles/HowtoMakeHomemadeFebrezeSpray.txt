, baking soda in the small bowl. Whisk to combine and/or until the baking soda has dissolved.
 Be careful you hold the bottle in place as you pour to avoid having it shift or tip over.
 You don’t want to pour hot water into the bottle, especially if it’s a plastic container, however make sure the water is warm enough to not melt/compromise the bottle integrity but will still permeate through the fabric softener/soda mixture.
, Don’t shake too vigorously because the mixture could bubble up and expand.

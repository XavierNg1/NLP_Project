 Take a deep breath. Don’t take the other person’s anger personally. Avoid becoming agitated, raising your voice, or fighting with the person.Remember that anger is always rooted in someone’s personal pain. It’s not about you, even if the person is taking out their feelings on you.
 Even if the other person is shouting at you, respond to them as calmly as you can. If they are too worked up to communicate rationally, don’t say anything until they quiet down a little.If you raise your voice, you’ll only fuel the person’s anger. Don’t encourage them to fight.
 Saying something like “Settle down” or “Relax” will probably just make the person angrier. They may resent being told what to do and feel like you are brushing off their problem.Create a connection with the person by acknowledging their anger instead. Say something like, “It seems like this is really bothering you. Can we talk about it?”

, When the person tells you what’s wrong, empathize with them. Make them feel like you’re on their side, even if you don’t agree with them. They will be less likely to turn violent if they feel understood.For instance, you might say something like, “So you’re hurt that no one told you about the change of plans ahead of time, is that right? You feel like no one wanted to include you.”

, Maintain an open, relaxed posture. Make eye contact with the angry person, but keep your expression non-confrontational. Don’t make animated gestures, put your hands on your hips, or fold your arms. Move slowly and calmly.Give the angry person plenty of space. This also gives you some protection if they do become violent.

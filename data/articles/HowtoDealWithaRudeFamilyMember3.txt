 Family dynamics can be complex so seek out the best person suited to confront your rude family member. Use other family members as a buffer. Speak to his closest confidants so you don’t have to confront him yourself.


For example, he may have a closer relationship with his cousin than his brother or a closer relationship with his grandfather than his father. Have someone he respects speak with him.
 Make sure that her rudeness is actually a problem and not just you being overly sensitive. Ask them one-on-one and assure them that you just want to make sure that everyone in the family is treated with respect.


Some family members won’t want to create unnecessary drama. Make sure you have the approval of the majority of your family.
 Be kind and respect every family member. Just because he is rude doesn’t mean you should reciprocate. Take the higher road and keep a pleasant demeanor to diffuse any negative situations.


Don’t use up valuable emotional and mental resources by dwelling on what you can’t control. Focus on what makes you happy about your family and look to strengthen these bonds and enjoy the moments you have with them.

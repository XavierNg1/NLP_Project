 Classic water bottles have a metal tube with balls inside. The balls stay in the end of the tube until your rabbit licks the tube and causes the water to come down. These spouts are more likely to leak and your rabbit may be frustrated by the balls in the tube. A sippy spout has a wider spout and is quieter than a classic water bottle.If your rabbit will be staying in your room, a quieter sippy spout is best.
Sippy spouts are more expensive, but are easier to clean.
 Your rabbitâ€™s bottle will come with the tools necessary to attach the bottle to the cage. Keep in mind that your rabbit may chew on the bottles because it is hanging in the cage. If you do not like the attachment that comes with your bottle, you can use the water bottle holders that cyclists use.If your rabbit is hesitant about using the bottle, put some molasses or sweet jam on the end of the tube to entice him., Clean the bottle with hot, soapy water each day. Use a bottle brush for a better cleaning. You can also use sterilizing tablets that are made for cleaning baby bottles.To prevent algae from growing, place an opaque cover around the bottle.
 Water bottles may freeze in the winter. Use an insulated bottle cover to prevent this. These covers only protect the bottle, but not the spout. Check the spout to make sure that water is still coming out.If you cannot afford a bottle cover, place bubble wrap around the bottle and then place the bottle in a wooly sock.
You may need to purchase a larger holder if you are using an insulated bottle.

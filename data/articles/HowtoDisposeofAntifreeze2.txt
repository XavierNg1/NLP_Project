 When you see an antifreeze spill, ventilate the area as much as you can. Wear a mask to prevent breathing in the sweet odor. Long sleeves and protective gloves can also help avoid skin exposure., An absorbent material, such as kitty litter, sand, or baking soda, can pick up antifreeze. Treat the spill immediately by layering material over it., Paper towels will aid in absorption and protect the material from scattering. Extra layers can be added to ensure no antifreeze escapes., At the very least, wait one hour as the antifreeze is absorbed. Don’t wait too long, though. Come back within three hours to make sure the antifreeze hasn’t set in as a stain., Pick up the absorbent material and leftover antifreeze with some dry paper towels. Wash your hands with soap and water when finished so you don’t accidently ingest any fluid., The antifreeze-soaked litter and paper towels can go through regular garbage disposal. Seal the bag and keep it away from children and animals. Antifreeze is dangerous to consume, so anyone who touches the material should wash their hands immediately., An average laundry or dish detergent will also help clean your floor. For stains that have begun to set in, try powdered detergent. Pour some soap out over the stain. Let the soap settle for a minute., Spray some water onto the spill to moisten it. Use a nylon brush to scrub in the soap. Finish by flushing the area with water., Keep the spot exposed to air so it can dry. Open any nearby doors or windows. This may take a few hours but helps in removing the smell. When this isn’t possible, layer some newspaper over the wet area for at least an hour or sop up the mess with paper towels.

 Some puppies might be intimidated by a big bowl of food that they know they cannot finish. To prevent this, try feeding your puppy smaller, but more frequent meals.For example, instead of feeding your puppy one cup of dry food in the morning or at night, try feeding it ¼ cup of dry food four times a day.
 When feeding your puppy, try staying with your puppy while it eats. This might encourage it to eat. Additionally, hand-feeding your puppy or petting in conjunction with vocal reassurance might further encourage it to eat.For example, when you place the food bowl down, stay with your puppy. Pet it and encourage it to eat by saying, "You're a good girl (or boy). It's time to eat."

, If you puppy is a good eater and has suddenly lost its appetite, consult your veterinarian immediately. Inappetence is a symptom of many diseases and illnesses that afflict puppies and dogs. Therefore, you need to consult your vet to rule out the possibility that your puppy is sick or becoming ill.If your puppy refuses to eat for more than 24 hours, then contact your vet immediately. There’s a chance that your puppy is refusing to eat because of pain it’s feeling as a result of parasites, disease, or illness.

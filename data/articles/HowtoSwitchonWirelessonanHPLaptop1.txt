, Most HP laptop models are fitted with a switch on the side or front of the computer than can be used to turn on the wireless functions. If not on the side or front, the switch may be above the keyboard or on one of the function keys at the top of the keyboard.The switch is indicated by an icon that looks like a wireless tower emitting signals.
 The indicator light on the key will turn from amber to blue when wireless is enabled.

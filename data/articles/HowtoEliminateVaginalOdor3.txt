 Panty hose and any synthetic material will block some air flow to the area. Loose cotton garments will give the region more ventilation, which will help get rid of vaginal odor over time. Wearing silky, fancy knickers once in a while for a special occur is unlikely to harm you. You are not compelled to wear loose cotton knickers every day for the rest of your life.
 You can wear perfume normally to generally help reduce the smell, but if you have reason to think that someone special is going down there and you want to make sure you smell great, dab a very small amount of perfume about 4" up from your knee (on your inner thigh). Choose a perfume with a musky scent, as this will most closely resemble your natural smell.
 Mix 6 oz. (170 grams) of water with 2 drops of tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is antibacterial and anti-fungal, and will help get rid of bacteria that are contributing to your strong vaginal odor.
 (15 ml) of liquid chlorophyll mixed into 8 oz. of water twice a day. Chlorophyll comes from green plants and is a natural internal deodorizer. The chlorophyll may make your tongue turn blackish, or your urine and feces a little green. These are common side effects and should not be something to worry about.
 Apple cider vinegar is a natural anti-bacterial. Add 1 to 2 cups (240 to 470 ml) of it to your bathwater and soak for 20 minutes. The vinegar should help to get rid of toxins and bacteria that is causing your vaginal odor.

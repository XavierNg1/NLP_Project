 The first thing to do before baby is born is register baby name with local stores that sell baby products like Target, Baby Depot in Burlington Coat Factory and Babies R Us. In most cases you will receive a welcome bag with free baby products, free baby publication and/or coupons for future product purchases. You will also have your baby registered in the event friends and family want to purchase baby gifts at those particular stores, which helps reduce expenses for baby.;
, The next thing to do while still pregnant is attend local baby fairs usually held at large hospitals, convention centers and sometimes through a destination outdoor shopping mall. You might win a big prize or other smaller prizes they give out.
 After baby is born, check online or keep an eye out for baby contests and baby sweepstakes that are usually conducted by baby product vendors. These have a double benefit by potentially winning baby products as well as getting on their mailing list for future coupons and product samples.
 Provide your contact information and/or send them an email letting them know either you are a fan of their products and are open to trying future new products or are interested in samples to try out. Big national baby product companies as well as up and coming baby product companies love to get their samples into the hands of their target audience!

, Make it easy on yourself and register with online companies that focus on connecting parents with companies that provide free baby gifts and products.
 It may be worth your time to participate in baby surveys or research panels you can find online. Do your research first to make sure they are a legitimate research company with no complaints against them and if so, it can be worth your time to participate for the free baby products they give out to participants.

 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device and tap it to open.
 If you had logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in. Just enter your email address and password into the fields provided and tap “Log in” to continue.
 Tap on your name on the header toolbar, and you will be brought to your Timeline or wall. Tap the “Write Post” button at the top of your wall, and a small window for “Update Status” will appear.


You can also tap the “Status” button on the bottom toolbar of the Notification screen (default when you open the Facebook app).
 Before you enter your friend’s name, type the “at” symbol, or @, in front of it. Facebook will recognize that you want to tag someone, and it will make suggestions matching the first few letters you’ve entered.


For instance, you want to tag your friend Kristine, type “@Kr” and Facebook will start finding matches.
 A list of possible matches will appear right below where you’re typing. Tap on the name of the friend you want to tag and highlight. His/her full Facebook name will be added to your post.

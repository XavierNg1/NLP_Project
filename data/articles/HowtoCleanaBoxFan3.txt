 During the spring and summer months, your home might need the extra coolness a box fan provides. At the change of the season, maintain the fan and prepare it properly by cleaning it before you store it. Disassemble it, soak it, wipe it down, and reassemble it., Cover the box fan for the fall and/or winter season to keep it clean, pristine, and ready for use when the weather warms up again., Cut a shape that fits perfectly over the sides of the box fan covers to shield it from dust and dirt. Tape the bag into place over the fan or tie around it with a thin cord. Now put it away until spring.

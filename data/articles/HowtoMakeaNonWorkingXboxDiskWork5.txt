Get a dry cloth and add a small amount of car polish to it, such as T-cut.
Rub in circular motion for 15-20 minutes, then wipe dry. Or, use some cotton buds put a tiny drop on to the cotton bud and then wipe the disc in a circular motion.
This works for any dust scuff marks from where the disk wobbles in the tray, when the Xbox is upright or moved.

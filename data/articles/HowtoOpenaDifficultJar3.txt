 Hold your spoon at a 45-degree angle. Use it to strike the side of the jar lid hard enough to make a slight dent. Rotate the jar about an inch and strike it again. Continue to dent the lid until you've gone all around and you hear the seal pop.









Make sure you hold the jar tightly with your other hand, so the jar doesn't fall over and break when you strike it.
Be careful not to strike the jar itself, or strike too hard. The jar could shatter.
 Once you hear the seal pop, hold the jar upright in one hand. Use the other hand to turn the lid to the left and remove it. Check the jar's rim to make sure it did not get chipped before using the contents of the jar.

 Sachets can be used for adding to drawers and wardrobes to impart a delightful scent, while pillows can be used to improve sleep. Depending on the potpourri mix, you can tailor the ingredients to ward off insects, induce sleep, scent items with your favorite fragrance and enhance moods.
 Add potpourri to muslin bags. Hang the bag under the hot water tap as it runs and the fragrance will be diffused through the bathwater.
 Sprinkle potpourri between sheets of writing paper for a few months. When you go to use the paper, it will be sweetly scented.


Beware the possibility of transferring oil from the potpourri mix––it can leave marks on the paper.

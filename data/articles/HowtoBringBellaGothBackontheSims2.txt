 SimPE is free software that can be used to view the .PACKAGE files. It can be found here.;
, In the upper left corner, click on File > Open and open the N001_Neighborhood file. It is usually under Desktop > My Documents > EA Games > The Sims 2 > Neighborhoods > N001.
 Under the Resource List box right near Resource Tree, select Neighborhood/Memory.
 The families will be listed in alphabetical order; it will open by default at the Burb family. From the list of families, select Default; that's where you will find Bella.
 Near Bella's portrait, there is a tab that says "Memories". Under that tab, there is a dead token Token - I am dead. Right click on it and select Cascade Delete Selection; this will delete the "I am dead" token.
 After you leave the Neighborhood/Memory tab, you will be asked whether you want to commit your changes. Select "Yes".
 Enter the Goths' Household in Pleasantview.
 Shift-Click on Mortimer (or any other Sim), select Spawn > Tombstone of L and D. Then click on the tombstone and select Add Neighbor to Family > Bella (Bella usually appears after you click "More...").
 Although, as the warning says, there isn't much of an enjoyment... She will have no memories and she will not appear married to Mortimer.

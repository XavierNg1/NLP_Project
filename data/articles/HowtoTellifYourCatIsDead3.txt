 If your cat has stopped breathing and/or its heart has stopped beating, you can perform CPR on your cat. Doing CPR can include giving the cat rescue breaths, chest compressions, and abdominal thrusts.


If CPR is successful and you are able to revive your pet, you must still get them to a vet right away. Whatever caused your cat to stop breathing in the first place may reoccur. Additionally, performing CPR can cause injuries.
While you are performing CPR, it is best to have someone else call the vet for advice or to let them know you’re on your way.
Do not give chest compressions if your cat still has a pulse.
 If at all possible, when you believe your cat is sick or may be dying, take it to your vet immediately. This will prevent you from having to do CPR yourself, and will ensure that your cat gets the best help possible.
 Surround your sick cat or kitten with warm blankets, T-shirts, or towels. It is best to put these warm items in a box or carrier for the cat to lay in, so that it is surrounded by the warmth. If your cat is a kitten, it is very important to regulate its body temperature to keep it alive.


When surrounding the cat with blankets and towels, be sure that you don’t cover its head or wrap it up too tightly.

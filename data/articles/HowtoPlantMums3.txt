 You should add enough soil to make a layer about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. If you use any more than that, the plant will sit on top of the soil and be taller than the pot. Any less and there won’t be anything for the plant’s roots to attach to., Don’t pull your mum out of the container by the stems. Instead, place your hand over the top of the plant, with the stems between your index finger and thumb, and flip the plant upside down. Then gently tap the bottom of the container until the plant falls out., The roots on the bottom of the plant will probably be growing in a circular direction. If you leave them this way, they'll eventually choke each other and your plant will die. Break up those roots by running your hand gently down the side of the rootball and loosening up the roots and dirt., Once you’ve filled the pot with soil to the edge, gently tap the container on the table to even out the soil.You can also plant mum seeds in a pot. Once you've filled the pot with soil, sprinkle a handful of mum seeds in a pot and then fill it the rest of the way with soil.
 This can be in a very sunny window, or on your front porch if it gets a lot of sun.

 ANYTHING that is suspicious has a good chance of happening, and you're going to have to think outside the box here: This game breaks physics frequently, and you might end up breaking some keyboards in some of the later segments.;
, Many strange things happen in the game. Cherries will fall up to kill you, spikes will chase you down, and moons will fall. Be careful and watch out.
 Most bosses hold a treasure right after beating them. Some may not.
 This includes the Guy which is only fought after fighting the previous bosses.

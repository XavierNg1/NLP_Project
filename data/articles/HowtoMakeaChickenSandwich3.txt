 To make this chicken sandwich, you'll need:


1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast
1 teaspoon olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon paprika
Aluminum Foil
Hamburger Buns (whole wheat) or multigrain bread

, Brush both sides of each chicken breast with olive oil, and sprinkle with the seasonings. Line the chicken on an unlined baking sheet and preheat the oven.
 After ten minutes, flip the chicken to the other side, and bake for 8-10 more minutes, or until juices run clear when pierced with a fork. It's fine to make a small slit in the thickest part and see if it's done.


You'll need to adjust the baking time to the size of your chicken breasts. This recipe is perfect for 8 oz, but if yours are much larger, you might need to bake them for 12-15 minutes on each side, and if they're smaller, 8 minutes per side will probably be just right.
The best way to make sure they are done is to use an instant-read thermometer. It should read 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part. If you don't have a thermometer, make a small slit in the center and peek to make sure it's white and opaque, not pink.
 Loosely cover with foil and allow to rest 5 minutes before putting them in your choice of bun or multigrain bread, with the toppings of your choice.


Before you turn the oven off, try toasting the buns in the oven with sliced cheese to give your sandwiches a crispy texture. Keep a close eye on them so they don't burn.

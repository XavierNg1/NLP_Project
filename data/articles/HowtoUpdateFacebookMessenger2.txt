 You'll find this in your Apps list. The icon looks like a shopping bag with the Google Play logo on it.
,, Be aware that you may have multiple apps called Messenger installed (Google has a separate Messenger app). Look for "Facebook" underneath the app name.


If Messenger is not listed in the Updates section, there is no update available for your device.
 This will open the app's store page.
 The update will begin downloading, unless you are currently downloading other updates. If this is the case, the update will be queued to begin downloading next.


You may want to connect to a wireless network before updating, as the app can be fairly large.
, You can tap the Open button from the Messenger store page in the Play Store, or you can tap the Messenger app in your Apps list.
 If you're having problems installing the update, you may be able to fix them by uninstalling and reinstalling the Messenger app. You won't lose any conversations, as they are all stored on your Facebook account:


Open the Play Store and search for Messenger.
Tap Facebook Messenger in the list of results.
Tap Uninstall and then OK to remove the app.
Tap Install to download the app again.

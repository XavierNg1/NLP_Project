 Your pets may not hit it off right away, and thatâ€™s okay. Practice introducing your pets to each other until it becomes a routine. Eventually, your pets will get used to seeing and smelling each other.
 Just like children, you do not want to leave your pets unattended! Something may happen to trigger an aggressive instinct in your dog. Perhaps a loud noise might spook the rabbit. Keep an eye on your pets to ensure they are safe. , Animals can be territorial around feeding time or feeding areas. Feed your pets in different rooms. If either shows aggression when eating, try feeding them at different times. Other territorial places may include where the animal sleeps or relieves himself. Keep a watchful eye when the rabbit and dog interact near these places.
They may act territorial toward you. They may grow jealous of the other with your attention. Make sure you show each animal care without riling protective instincts from the other one.
 Making new friends can be challenging! Give your pets time to get used to you, your house, and each other.

 Avoid green passion fruit. Remember: the greener it is, the less ripened it is. This holds true for all varieties. Spot ripening fruit by changes in color. Look for fruit that has turned purple, red, and/or yellow.Expect some to be a uniform shade and others to be a mix between colors.Some fruit may actually ripen without changing color that much. If youâ€™re growing your own and find green fruit that has fallen from the tree, judge it by other methods before discarding.;
, Spot unripened fruit by its smooth skin. Recognize ripe fruit by its wrinkles and dimples. Favor moderately wrinkled fruit over excessively wrinkled. Expect very wrinkled fruit to have already passed the peak of freshness., Expect to find small cuts and spots, which is normal and generally okay on their own.Bruised fruit is also perfectly edible, just softer. However, do check bruised areas for any cuts through the skin, since the bruised fruit underneath is more at-risk to mold.Bruised or moldy portions can be trimmed from the rest.
Mold that appears on the outside of intact skin can be washed away since you aren't eating the skin.

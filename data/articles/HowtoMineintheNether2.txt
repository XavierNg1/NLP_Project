 Netherrack should be all around you. Start mining! Netherrack is mined quickly, and you can get around 2 to 3 blocks per second with an iron or diamond pickaxe.


Netherrack is useful in the Overworld for many reasons: When lit, the fire on it will never burn out, unless extinguished by the player. It's texture is also very unique and different from other blocks in the Overworld.
An efficient way of mining Netherrack is to create a corridor in the enormous mountains of Netherrack. You can collect the Netherrack easily, and it is very simple to go back from where you started.
Netherrack can be smelted in a furnace to become Nether Brick.;

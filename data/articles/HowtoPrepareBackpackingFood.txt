 (or 1/2 to 1 kg) of food for each day of your hike. This usually translates to roughly 3000-4000 calories per day.;

Instant oatmeal or potatoes are good choices because they cook quickly and are very light. Powdered whole milk is a good way to add more calories. Dried fruit is also an efficient breakfast addition. If you want a hot beverage, pack instant coffee or tea.



Because of the energy you will expend hiking, you need to eat lots of carbohydrates every day. Loaves of bread tend to get squished in a backpack, so try crackers, tortillas or pita bread instead. It's helpful to eat carbohydrates in the middle of the day when you need the most energy and can burn them off before going to sleep.






Pair your crackers or tortillas with foods rich in protein and fat, like nut butter, salami and cheese, to keep you feeling full longer.



Instant noodles, dried meats, and cheese are popular backpacking dinners. Do not pack anything that takes more than 10 minutes to cook so as to save fuel.



Snacks should provide extra energy during the day. Typical backpacking snacks include energy bars and trail mix (usually made with nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate).



Most store-bought food will come in cumbersome packaging that will make your backpack heavier and will be hard to dispose of on the trail. Take foods like oatmeal, noodles, and coffee out of their packaging and repack it in small, easy to seal plastic bags.



Fresh fruits and vegetables, while healthy, have a very inefficient calorie-to-weight ratio. Do not plan on packing more than one fruit or vegetable for each day of your trip. Lightweight food that has been dehydrated is best for backpacking.

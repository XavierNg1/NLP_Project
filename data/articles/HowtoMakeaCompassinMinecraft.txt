, If you're low on iron ingots and/or redstone, you can save them by simply looking at the compass pointer when the items are placed in the crafting table but then not activating the crafting.


Note that you can also see the compass on the item statistics page if you've made a compass in the past. This means you can see the direction pointer without having to even use the crafting table.
If you need a compass to make map paper, you'll need to craft it.
 Place the four iron ingots and one redstone into the crafting table as follows:


Place the redstone in the center grid spot.
Place the four iron ingots above, below and next to the redstone.
Wait for the compass to be crafted.
Shift click or drag the compass to your inventory.
 To make a map using a compass, surround the compass with paper.


Go to the crafting grid and place the compass in the center.
Place paper in all of the other empty slots.
 Shift click or drag to place the map into your inventory.

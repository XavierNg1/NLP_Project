 You will need to fix the problem first before you can move on to a soft solution. You might need some expensive hardware and tools, but it is also possible to do it sometimes with simple tricks; it depends on what happened.;
, There are four different reasons why the SA cannot be read:


The head has a problem thus cannot read anything.
The System Area is scratched so it can't be read by the head (some info about SA is available online, check deadhardrive blogger in google)
The firmware on the pcb has some damage
The preamplificator is dead (small component on the head who amplifies the signal)

,
Head swapping should be done in a white room, but if you are skilled enough you can try it in a clean environment if you don't plan to spend money anyway on your data. If you plan to spend a bit then you can try with a commercial company (Deadhardrive or any other using PC3000 tools)

, It will basically bypass the SA reading.
 This is doable by most individuals.

 Deep breathing encourages more oxygen into your lungs, slowing your heartbeat and lowering or stabilizing your blood pressure, and therefore reducing your anxiety.Many people prefer a chair with a back to support their spine. However, you can sit anywhere that is comfortable for you. You can even stand if necessary, especially if a panic attack ensues abruptly.
 The purpose of doing this is so that you know that you are inhaling properly. When you practice deep breathing, the hand on your stomach should rise higher than the hand that you have placed on your chest.Beginners typically find that using the hand placement is helpful. However, as you master the technique, you may no longer need to use your hands.
 You may want to count in your head as you inhale to keep yourself focused. Do not exceed seven before you begin to exhale.When inhaling, the air should come through your nose and travel down into your belly.
 Exhale slowly out of your mouth. You should feel the air leave your stomach, enter into your chest, and then exit your mouth.


In general, it should take you twice as long to exhale as it does for you to inhale., When you have taken five deep breaths at a rate of one breath per ten seconds, it will help you relax. When you are in a relaxed state, your anxiety level is more likely to decrease.

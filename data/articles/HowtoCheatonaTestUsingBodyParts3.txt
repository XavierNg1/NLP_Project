The ankles are good if you wear jeans and can cross your legs.
The wrists are good if you can write on your veins with blue pen.
On the inside of your thighs you can write formulas if you wear shorts.
One of the best places to put notes are on your hands, for several reasons: 1) You will be using them during the whole test, 2) It is easy to hide with another hand or a shirt sleeve. Write short notes on the lines and wrinkles of your palm, the sides of the fingers, or the little piece of skin between your fingers.

 Remember that the bedtime snack is not a full meal. Limit portion size to a small piece of fruit, a few crackers with peanut butter or cheese, or a small bowl of low-sugar, whole grain cereal with milk.Avoid feeding your child a full meal within two hours of bedtime.
 Sugar can cause spikes in blood sugar that interfere with sleep. Further, a sugary snack before bed can encourage your child to eat less at dinner.If they’re expecting a sweet snack in a couple hours, they might turn down their portion of steamed veggies at dinner.
 Avoid giving your child obvious sources of caffeine, such as coffee and colas. You should also steer clear of less obvious sources, such as hot or iced tea and chocolate.Caffeine has a long half-life, so if your child does consume any tea or chocolate, make sure it’s at least six hours before bedtime.
 Some kids go through a feigning hunger phase, which is when they say they’re hungry as a way to stay up later. If they constantly ask for one thing after another or seem to be stalling, they probably just want to stay up as late as possible.Plan on offering a snack an hour before bedtime to help make sure they stick to their bedtime routine.

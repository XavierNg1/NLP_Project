 Both YouTube and Gmail lack customer service teams because they are free services; however, the algorithms that dictate what can and can't be done on their servers allow you to submit incident reports to inform Google of malicious or inappropriate content or behavior., Your options for report filing include the following:


If you are having difficulties sending or receiving a message, fill out the Report a Problem form.
If you are being harassed by another Gmail user, use the Harassment form.
If you suspect that your Gmail account has been hijacked, use the Compromised Gmail Account form.
 Your options for incident reports include the following:


If you feel as though your privacy has been infringed upon, file a Privacy report.
If someone is using your copyrighted material without your consent, file a Copyright Infringement claim.
If you are experiencing or witnessing abuse on YouTube, file an Abuse report.
For any video abuse or issues that need reporting, use the YouTube Reporting Tool.
 Depending on your service and the form in question, this process will vary. Make sure to be descriptive.


When explaining your problem, refrain from emotional or biased language. Instead, opt for clean, concise terms and a simple explanation of the problem at hand.
 Google usually responds to incident reports in three to five business days.

 To wean the baby gradually choose a feeding that happens during a busy time of the day and replace it with your chosen substitute. Place either pumped breast milk or formula in a bottle or cup to feed the baby.

Do the feeding in a new room in the house. Weaning a baby is both a physical and psychological transition. Doing it in a new room can help the baby ease away from associating a particular atmosphere with food.






Give the baby extra comfort and hugs during the feeding to help the transition go more smoothly.
 As the baby grows used to the new style of eating, keep replacing another feeding every two or three days. Don't rush the process too much, or the baby may grow confused and the weaning plan could backfire.

Offer the baby milk or formula in a cup or bottle before every feeding, even those you don't plan to fully replace. Getting the baby used to these alternative feeding instruments is an essential transition step.Shorten the breastfeeding sessions you still have.
Continue replacing and shortening feedings over the course of a few weeks until the baby has switched almost entirely to drinking from a bottle or cup, depending on which one you have chosen to provide.
 For example, many babies breastfeed right before they go to sleep. Start putting the baby to bed without first breastfeeding so that he or she will be able to sleep without this activity.


Replacing breastfeeding with another ritual can help. For example, consider reading a story, playing a game or rocking in the rocking chair before the baby goes to sleep.
Don't replace breastfeeding with an object, like a stuffed animal or pacifier. These items will make the weaning process more difficult for the baby., Babies need the skin contact they get while breastfeeding almost as much as they need the nourishment. It's important to provide extra cuddles during the weaning process.

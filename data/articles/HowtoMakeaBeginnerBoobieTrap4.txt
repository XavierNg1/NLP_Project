 This is borderline prank, borderline booby trap. All you need to do is lift up the toilet seat and cover the inside of the toilet with saran wrap. Try to avoid leaving any creases in the saran wrap – you want it to look as see-through as possible.
 This is something you’ll probably want to do in the moment. If someone you want to prank is going to take a hot shower, you can run over and turn the hot water off. If they get out of the shower to check the hot water, quickly rush to turn it back on again. This will cause them a lot of confusion.
 Try doing this with a bottle of orange juice that is about half full. Take off the wrapper first, and then cut the bottle about an inch above wherever the juice line is. Make the cut all the way around so that you can sever the top and bottom sections. Now lightly tape the two sides back together with scotch tape. Put the wrapper back on to hide your trap. Leave the juice on the table and it will fall apart as they go to pour themselves some juice.

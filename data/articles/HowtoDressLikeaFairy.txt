 Pick out earthy colors and pastels to represent the forest and the flowers. Shades of brown, beige, cream, white, blush, green, and sky blue are great starter points. In addition, choose fabrics with lace, ruffles, flowers, a slight glimmer, or sheer features. Anything that looks natural and dreamy will work.
 Opt for flowing blouses, lacy tops, fitted sweaters, and loose button up tops. Other than the fitted sweaters, everything should be loose and comfortable so you can easily transition from walking the streets to exploring the woods. Also, choose quality materials that will take quite a bit of wear and tear to ruin. It all should appear elegant, earthy, romantically bohemian, and retro., Sailor shorts, high waisted shorts, high waisted jeans, and cutoff jeans are retro enough to complement the tops whilst being functional and modern enough to keep the style wearable. For skirts, wear bohemian maxi skirts, lace skirts of any length, and floral skirts. Keep in mind a romantic, natural, earthy look that is comfortable yet fashionable., Favor baby dolls, shirt dresses, and maxi dresses. Of course, earthy toned lace, ruffles, flowers, and delicate patterns are welcome. Keep a large supply of dresses on hand - they are so simply elegant and underused, instantly romanticizing a look and keeping the fairy aesthetic., Oxfords, ballet flats, combat boots, and riding boots are great for everyday wear, with wedged heels being preferable for more upscale events. Faux leather sandals can work, though closed toe shoes are a better idea for exploring. If you must wear socks, keep them white or off white, lacy, and sheer., Flower crowns and bracelets are nice, as well as vintage rings, lockets, charms, and earrings from the thrift shop or your grandmother. Modern gold jewelry, such as dangling hoops, chains, and bangles when paired with an especially fairy outfit will modernize the look enough for everyday wear.

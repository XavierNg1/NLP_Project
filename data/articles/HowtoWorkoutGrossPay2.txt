 Salaried employees work under a contract for a set amount of pay over a set period of time, without factoring in the number of hours worked (unless, possibly, overtime is involved). Typically, your salary refers to your base pay amount for a year.


As an example, let’s say you earn a $30,000 base annual salary.
 Do this only if calculating your gross pay for a time period shorter than a year, though.


For instance, your $30,000 base annual salary is $577 per week ($30,000 / 52 = $577).
 Remember, gross pay includes everything you earn for your work and subtracts nothing.


For simplicity’s sake, let’s say you’re an amazingly consistent salesperson and have earned a $120 commission each week for the past year. Added to your weekly base salary plus overtime of $577, your weekly total is now $697. This is your weekly gross pay.
For the year, $697 x 52 = $36,244. This is your annual gross pay.
 As a salaried employee, you will receive a pay stub (paper or electronic), typically at intervals of one or two weeks, or monthly. This will list your gross pay, along with your net pay and the taxes and other deductions.


In the U.S., your federal W-2 form will arrive for tax season, and will list your gross pay for the past calendar year.

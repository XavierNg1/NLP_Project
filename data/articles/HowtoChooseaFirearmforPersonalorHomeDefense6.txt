 If you are not willing to devote time and effort to learn the skills, don't endanger others by trying to use one under stress. Handgun marksmanship is considered a sport because it takes training and skill.
 Typically they hold 5-6 rounds which is enough so that you will not have to reload during most home defense incidents.
 Operation takes a bit more learning and practice, but the positives are why the majority of law enforcement and military personnel carry semi-automatic handguns.
 A firearm that "fits" my hand perfectly will not feel right to you. Most firearm owners are happy to allow a novice to try a couple of shots. Do your research, test fire a few weapons before you invest.
 Many lower-power cartridges may not penetrate deeply enough to cause incapacitating damage.

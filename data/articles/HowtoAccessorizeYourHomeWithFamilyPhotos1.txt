 You can make one arrangement with only black and white pictures and another arrangement with only sepia toned photographs. Groupings like these create a gallery look, especially if you hang them in a hallway.;
, You could try placing a large photograph of your favorite vacation scene in the center of your arrangement and encircle that one with smaller photographs that complement the primary picture.
 You may want to select sepia or black and white photos of your ancestors and group all of those photographs together

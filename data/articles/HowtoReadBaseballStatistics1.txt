 Box scores are statistical representations of how players performed in specific games and you can find them in the Sports section of a newspaper or on a sports website. Standard box scores list, in a table format, 4 offensive statistics and 6 pitching categories.
 The entire lineup is listed in the offensive, or batting, section of the box score. Players are listed in batting order with the positions they played during the game following their names. Substitutes' names are indented in the box score and are listed under the player they replaced. The 4 categories listed in the offensive table are:

AB: at-bats






R: runs scored






H: base hits






RBI: runs batted in







, Individual accomplishments are singled out in this section. For example, if a player named Smith hit his 6th home run of the season, the box score would read, HR: Smith (6). Other statistical categories in this section of the box score would include:


E: errors, LOB: left on base (team statistic), and DP: double plays (team statistic).
2B: doubles, 3B: triples, and HR: home runs (with season total).
SB: stolen bases, SF: sacrifice flies, and S: sacrifices.

 Don’t ever throw away documents with your financial information on them without first shredding them. You can use an automatic shredder, scissors, or your hands for this. Make sure you shred bank and ATM receipts, credit card statements, or bank statements before disposing of them. , Never tell anyone your credit card number unless you know that person is a legitimate representative of a financial institution or real business. Banks and businesses generally refrain from requesting credit card numbers through emails and will not call you out of the blue asking for your credit card number. Never tell someone who called or emailed you your credit card information. , Banks and credit cards will send you monthly statements that will show where and what you spent your money on. Always review these documents carefully and notify your bank immediately if you notice a discrepancy on the statements. You should keep a readily accessible list of numbers to call in the event that you lose your credit cards or your wallet. , In the case that your identity has been stolen, you will want to notify your bank, credit card company and the credit bureau. Ask the credit bureau to make a note in their files that your identity has been stolen so that you have proof of the incident. , If you know of anyone who may be committing identity fraud or is receiving someone else’s bank or credit statements, report them to the FBI or local law enforcement immediately.

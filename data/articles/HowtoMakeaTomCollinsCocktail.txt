,,,, Muddling is done using a muddle, which is like a pestle; it is done to release flavor of fruits and herbs in cocktails. Hold you hand over the top of the glass as you use the muddle in a grinding type of motion to crush the lemon.
,,, Shake the mixture over your shoulder for about 20 seconds or until the mixture feels very cold. You will feel the coldness coming through the shaker.


Open the shaker by removing the top of the shaker.
 Do not fill to the top of the glass but about 1/3 of the glass should have ice cubes.
,, Strain the mixture into the cocktail glass.
 You can also add a splash of lemonade to make it a longer drink, or to make it more refreshing for summer.
 Garnishes may included sliced lemons and maraschino cherries, if desired.

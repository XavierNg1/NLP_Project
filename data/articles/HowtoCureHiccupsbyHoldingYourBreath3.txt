 Fill up your lungs with air. Close your mouth and keep the air inside your lungs.


Even with your mouth closed, make sure you’re not breathing in and out through your nose.
Feel your stomach with your hands. You should feel it expand like a balloon as you breathe in.
 Count the number of seconds that you hold your breath for. Aim for holding your breath longer than is comfortable, but not so long that it’s unsafe. Most people should be able to hold their breath for at least 10 seconds.


If you can't hold your breath for 10 seconds, simply hold it as long as you can.
If your face changes color or you start to feel dizzy, let your breath go.
 Exhale all of the air out of your lungs. Resume breathing normally. Don’t attempt to continue holding your breath.


If you hold your breath too long and too frequently, you can make yourself lightheaded.
Make sure your breathing has returned to normal before you hold your breath again.
 While you wait, you can do any regular activities. Set a timer so that you don’t forget how long you’ve been waiting. Meanwhile, try to take your mind off the hiccups.


You can watch TV, go for a drive, or chat with a friend to help distract yourself from your hiccups.
 Take another deep breath, and go through the same process. By now, your hiccups may have gone away. However, you can still repeat the process if you think your hiccups may come back.If your hiccups won't go away after an hour, try another method. If you get hiccups frequently, you may want to see a doctor.

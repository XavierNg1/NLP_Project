 Sewing a lettuce edge hem works very well for knits or lingerie. You can either turn up a small (3/8-inch) hem and sew a zigzag stitch or use the zigzag stitch as the only hem. The sleeve will be edge finished with the zigzag stitch. When the hem is finished it will be wavy and look like a frilly lettuce leaf. This hem is good for feminine clothing and is a quick hemming finish. You could also serge edge the hem and, in fact, the serger does a better job than the sewing machine when sewing this hem.

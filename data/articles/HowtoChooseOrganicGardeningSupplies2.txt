 While most basic gardening tools are not labeled as "organic," some gardening tools are made from natural materials using low-impact production practices.


Look for gardening tools made with wood materials, rather than plastic.
Consider bamboo brooms, rather than commercially produced brooms.
Select gardening materials that do not require gas or electricity. Choose manual pruning saws, trimmers and shears, rather than electric or gas versions.
Use wood baskets for collecting produce, rather than plastic bins.

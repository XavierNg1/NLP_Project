 There are many great benefits to meditation, from improved memory to reduced anxiety. Spending time thinking about why you would like to meditate and what you would like to gain from meditation will help keep you focused and determined. No reason is too small or insignificant to start meditating. Whatever your reason or intention is, stick to it and stay committed., Meditation, especially for those who are beginners or have not meditated for some time, can be difficult. Many of the effects of meditation only come after significant time and work is spent meditating. The more frequently and consistently you can meditate the better and more developed your results will be. Try to schedule at least some time each day to sit and meditate, even if it is only for two minutes.A consistent schedule does not mean a demanding schedule. In other words, don’t get caught up in how you are meditating, just do!Try committing to meditating first thing in the morning, every morning, no matter how long you can meditate for.
 It can be difficult, and occasionally frustrating, to start meditating. It takes time to relax and to clear your mind. Instead of giving yourself difficult tasks up front, like sitting for 30 minutes straight, try starting small to ease into your practice. After all, it is called a practice for a reason, and it takes time to improve!Start by sitting for only a few minutes, like 2 or 3, when you first meditate. Build up minute by minute as you feel you are able. If you increase your time too quickly, don’t worry! Just reduce your meditation by a few minutes the next time you sit.
Remember, meditation, even though it can be hard work, is meant to be relaxing! Don’t insist and don’t resist!

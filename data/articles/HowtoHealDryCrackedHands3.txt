 When you wash your hands, avoid using harsh cleaning agents that contain dyes, artificial ingredients, or fragrances. Instead, go for mild soap that contain natural ingredients like olive oil, lemon, or shea butter. Use warm water, rather than hot water, as hot water can dry out your hands.If you find you have to put your hands in hot water often, such as when you wash dishes, wear rubber gloves to protect your hands.
 Cold weather can make dry, cracked hands worse. Protect your hands from cold weather by wearing leather or wool gloves that are lined with silk or synthetic materials. The soft lining will help to keep your hands soft and protected.Many glove manufacturers are aware of sensitive skin and well-known brands with a nice lining will protect your hands from the cold. Be sure to try on the gloves before purchasing to ensure they fit well and have a soft lining.
Avoid gloves that have a wool lining, as this can irritate sensitive skin.
 Get in the habit of applying hand cream to your hands throughout the day, up to six times. Carry a small jar or tube of hand cream in your bag so you can apply it to your hands as needed. Have a routine where you moisturize your hands in the morning and at night before bed so they stay soft and hydrated.Try several different varieties to find the one that works best for you.

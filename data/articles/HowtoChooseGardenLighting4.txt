 Most solar power lights just require you to stake the light into the ground or hang it up if it's a wire. You don't need to do anything fancy, as you would if you wire in electrical lights. Plus, these lights are easy to replace or fix if something goes wrong., Solar-powered lights, as the name implies, are powered by the sun. They have a battery inside that is charged during the day while the sun is out. That means they won't add cost to your electricity bill. The downside is they need to be placed where they get sunlight during the day.If you want solar-powered lights in the shade, you can have a landscaper hook them up to a solar panel that's in full sunlight.
 Solar-powered lights are great in places that receive a good deal of sunshine everyday. However, if you live somewhere that is cloudy most of the time, your lights won't be as bright. Choosing electrically powered lights may be a better option for you., While you can study up to wire your yard with electrical lights, this job is generally best left to a professional. They know how to wire your garden so the wires are hidden and the lights are laid out well.

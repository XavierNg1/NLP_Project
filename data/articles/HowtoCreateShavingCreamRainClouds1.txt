 You can use a cup, bowl, vase, or jar, but make sure that it is clear. This will allow you to see the rainstorm later on. Avoid using anything with a narrow opening, however, or you will have a hard time adding the shaving cream.This is a great project for teaching kids about rain. It's recommended for children 2 years old and up.;
, Make sure that you are using the foamy type and not the gel kind. Try to fill the entire surface of the water. You can make the cloud as puffy as you'd like, but keep in mind that the thicker it is, the longer it will take for the rain to form., Fill a small cup with 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of water. Stir in 10 drops of food coloring. This will be your rain. You can use any color you want, but blue will be the most rain-like.You can make more colors if you want. Use a new cup for each color.
As you prepare the dye, the shaving cream will start to settle, which is a good thing. The shaving cream needs to be resting on top of the water.
 Add the colored water drop-by-drop to the cloud. You don't have to use all of the colored water--a few drops will do. To make the rain happen faster, place the drops at the edges of the cloud, which are thinner.If you can't find an eye dropper, you can use a syringe or Â¼ teaspoon instead.You can help speed things up a little by sticking the dropper or pipette directly into the cloud., This will usually take a few minutes, depending on the thickness and size of the cloud. Eventually, the colored water will go through the cloud, and trickle down into the water. It won't form droplets like real rain, but something more streak-like.

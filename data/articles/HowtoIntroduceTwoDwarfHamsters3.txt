 If it doesn't work, switch to the second approach following.
 After you have put all new fresh, clean bedding in, you can either put the newest dwarf hamster in the cage first or, if you are introducing a male and a female put the male in first. Do not do this any other way.


Let the first hamster sniff around for about 45 minutes. You will need the hamster to do this so that it can explore the new cage.
, Normally they will get on as happy as can be but some hamsters are just uncooperative!

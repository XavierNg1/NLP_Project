 Aerobic exercise is best for the treatment and prevention of high blood pressure. Aerobic exercise includes anything that elevates your heart rate for 20-30 minutes or longer â€” things such as jogging, swimming, or riding a bike.


Your child may prefer more "fun sports," so consider sports that involve running and elevate your child's heart rate like soccer, basketball, or hockey.
It may also be motivational to get the whole family involved, and to all create a more active lifestyle together. Perhaps this involves weekend trips to the park to play sports, or vacations that have an active component. Having everyone on the same page can help to motivate your child to stay active.
It is also key to limit (or altogether avoid) your child's exposure to secondhand smoke, as this is an additional risk factor for childhood hypertension (high blood pressure).
 Foods to stay away from include processed foods that are high in salt, as well as sweets that are high in sugar. Explain to your child the importance of eating well, and aim for a well-balanced meal with protein, fruits and vegetables, and carbohydrates with a lower glycemic index (such as whole grains, quinoa, and brown rice).


Excess salt consumption (which is very high in processed foods) and eating bad fats (such as those present in junk food) are the two main things to stay away from if you are worried about the development of childhood high blood pressure.
 Therefore, ask your child's doctor about an ideal weight to aim for, and strategies to help you and your child achieve this goal.


It has also been noted that rapid weight gain has a higher correlation to high blood pressure than slower weight gain.
Therefore, if you notice your child gaining weight quickly over a short period of time, take steps to correct this as soon as possible.
If you need advice on how to do so, book an appointment with your child's family doctor.

 Individuals with Celiac disease have a genetic predisposition to autoimmune reactions to the ingestion of gluten.


Celiac disease involves abnormally high intestinal permeability and high levels of adaptive immunity markers such as interleukin and IL-21, unlike individuals who suffer from gluten intolerance.
Individuals with other autoimmune diseases are at a greater risk of Celiac disease.
 Individuals with diagnosed gluten intolerance have increased expression of claudin and the innate immunity marker Toll-Like Receptor (TLR).


Gluten-sensitive individuals also typically have reduced expression of the immunity marker FOXP3.
 Although symptoms vary for individuals with Celiac and gluten intolerance, most individuals with Celiac disease experience more severe reactions to the ingestion of gluten than do gluten intolerant individuals.


Gastrointestinal symptoms are common with both conditions, but malnutrition is typically associated only with Celiac disease.
More nuanced symptoms of Celiac disease may also occur, such as irritability or depression, weight loss, muscle cramps, mouth sores, osteoporosis, fatigue or weakness, tingling in the legs, and joint pain.
For both conditions, symptoms typically resolve after thoroughly ridding the diet of gluten.

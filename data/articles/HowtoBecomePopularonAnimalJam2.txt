 Go to the most popular places; Jamaa Township, would be a good idea. Try do something cute and funny; penguins are especially likely to become popular in AJ. But don't make it weird!






If you're looking for something rather than sweet and innocent, go for the bold type. Choose a wolf; that's one of the most popular animals in AJ. Wear bold colors but never wear white with any other color. Wear something "in" and flashy and do bold entrances and sayings, like-walks up majestically and eyes everyone-"Sup"Also, choose cool names like Victory or Infinity.
Non member boys: choose the cool animal, the wolf is most likely to get you noticed by the cool guys or gals. Wear black, blue, or any boyish or cool color. Wear lightning bolts or fire patterns. Do cool entrances or cool sayings. Hang out with the other boys, especially the ones who attract the girls (not saying you should get a girlfriend)
Non member girls: get a wolf or a sweet penguin. Fiery? A tiger would be best. Choose the sweet colors. More bold? Try purple and wear awesome patterns.
 For example , like trading parties, clans etc.
 Especially if they're new, you want to give them a kind mail! It will make them feel welcoming. Also do it to compliments jammers! They'll be grateful and add you.
 Try to get on Animal Jam every Monday to check out the rare items. Of course, some might be members but it's worth having a look.
 Best Dressed is a good one! So is Falling Phantoms. Try to at least get 20,000 gems.
 How? Play Sky High. Once you reach the top you will get an item. Also buy items on parties. Another way of getting good items is trading.
 If some jammer says "Party at my den!" Or "Party at Club Geoz" go there!" Not only will it be fun, but it will rise your popularity ranking.
 Be funny and crazy! Say stuff like Cookies and unicorns or Raining tacos! That will really crack the audience up.

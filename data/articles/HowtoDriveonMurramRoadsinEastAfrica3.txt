 Hopefully, if you follow the above guidelines, accidents will be avoided. However, the protocol in many countries in Africa when involved in an accident is different from what occurs in places like the USA and Europe.


If involved in an accident in one of such countries, be aware that a large crowd may quickly gather, be very noisy and intimidating with lots of blame and shouting very likely.
Do not stop. Drive immediately to a police station and report the accident/get help.
You will achieve nothing staying at the scene and could put yourself in considerable danger if the crowd believe that the accident was your fault.
If you stay to 'argue' your case or 'try' and help anyone who is injured and there is a subsequent problem, you will be deemed responsible, with possible disastrous consequences.

 If the tip phalange is longer than the second phalange, the person will act first and think later, but will also have a great drive to succeed. This person will make many mistakes along the way, but will pick him or herself up again each time and continue.


If the tip section is shorter than the second section the person will be lacking in will power. He or she may be full of wonderful ideas, but they usually stay as ideas as there is a lack of motivation and incentive to put them into practice.

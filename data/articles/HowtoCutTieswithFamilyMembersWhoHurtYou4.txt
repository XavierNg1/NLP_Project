 Doubting yourself or thinking that they might change later is natural. Do not allow yourself to sit around and feel guilty. Your self-esteem may be a little low right now, but remind yourself that it is only temporary.

Find a plaque or a symbol of your strength and take the time to look at it every day. Go onto the internet and look up inspiring quotes. Perhaps one will stick with you. Remind yourself that you are not a victim anymore. You stood up for yourself, and they cannot hurt you anymore.
 Cherish your family times with a new freedom and live your life to fullest.

 Most women who take HCG to help them get pregnant have already tried natural methods to increase fertility, and the drug clomiphene (Serophene). You may be prescribed other medications that promote fertility while taking HCG, such as menotropins and urofollitropin. When talking to your doctor about HCG as an option, be sure to discuss the following:Whether you have any allergies to medications, foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
What other medications you’re taking, if any.
If you use tobacco or drink alcohol.
If you have any other medical problems, especially unusual vaginal bleeding, asthma, seizures, heart or kidney problems, migraines, ovarian cysts, or uterine fibroids.
 The dose of HCG you take will depend on you, the levels of your other hormones, other medications you’re taking, and other factors. The average dose is 5,000-10,000 units. Your doctor will choose the right day to give you the injection based on your hormone levels, and the HCG will be injected into the muscle of your arm.HCG injections are NOT given during pregnancy for low HCG levels, because of the risk of birth defects., Once you start treatment, your doctor might ask you to keep a record of your basal body temperature. You will also need to continue to see your doctor for blood tests, and probably for ultrasounds to monitor your treatment.

 Don't get too off-topic; this risks becoming it boring and viewers will click out. Keep your video simple.


If you want to discuss a longer topic, choose wisely and only talk about the topic. Again try to keep it simple and short.
If you really want to go for a long topic, make them into smaller parts and serve them as different videos, such as "Part 1, Part 2" etc. That will make the viewers that enjoyed the first one go for the second one.
If you are planning to make parted videos, make a video that act as a hub for viewers, such as having a short video which links to the different parts.
To promote interactions on your video ask people to comment with their thoughts on the product you were reviewing.
 Create your own online persona and stick to it.
 Have a descriptive opinion on it.


Try to compare it to other similar products.
Talk about the differences and what you like about it and what you don't.
If your review videos are already getting a lot of views then consider asking brands to provide you with new or unreleased products for you to review. This will give your videos an edge.
 It may offend some people, so keep it descriptive and stick to the facts.

 It is standard practice for a buyer to shop around for the best interest rate for a mortgage, but for closing costs purposes it is also important to shop around for the lowest fees. Lenders charge a number of fees at closing, but the amount each lender charges for each item can vary.
 At the time you are qualified for a home loan (a mortgage), your lender is required to provide you with a good faith estimate of your closing costs. This estimate contains the fees that the lender will charge you at your closing. Compare different lenderâ€™s fees and choose the lender that has the right mix of a low interest rate and low fees. You can often negotiate some of the fees that the lender will charge, so be sure to ask your lender representative if you can get a better deal.

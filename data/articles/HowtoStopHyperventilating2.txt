 Breathing into a paper bag can be a useful method when managing the symptoms of a hyperventilation episode. By breathing into a paper bag you can help reuse carbon-dioxide that would normally be lost on your exhalation, maintaining proper levels in the body and avoiding the symptoms of hyperventilation.Do not use plastic bags as these can pose a choking hazard.
Make sure the paper bag is clean and there are no small items inside that could be accidentally inhaled.
Be sure that your doctor has cleared you for this technique as it can be dangerous to use when hyperventilation is caused by a physical injury or disease.
 In order to properly use the paper bag breathing method during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to make sure that it completely covers your mouth and nose. This will ensure that the carbon-dioxide is caught in the paper bag, allowing you to re-breathe it and reduce some of the effects caused by hyperventilating.Hold the bag with one hand towards the opening of the bag.
Pinching the bag slightly can help shape the opening of the bag, allowing it to fit over your mouth and nose more easily.
Place the opening of the bag directly and completely over your mouth and nose.
 Once you have placed the paper bag over your mouth and nose you can begin breathing in and out of the bag. Try to remain calm and breathe as naturally and completely as you can during an episode of hyperventilation.Take no more than six to 12 breaths using the paper bag.
Breathe as slowly and easily as you can.
After taking six to 12 breaths remove the bag from your mouth and nose and breathe without it.

 You need a good internet connection (1mb/sec) and at least a Pentium D or Core 2 processor with at least a 128 MB Graphics Card (256+ recommended). You should also have at least 1 GB RAM to minimize lag. You'll find that as your system improves, so will your score.;
, If you aren't on the winning team, disconnect and rejoin on the other team. (Note: This tactic, when the teams are unfair is called "stacking". Team stacking is not only unfair, it is considered cheap and will earn you hate of many of the decent players. Most servers these days auto team balance, so even if you team stack, you will be automatically switched to even the teams.) Team stack is also known as "Lame join".
,, Spend at least $30 on a pair of headphones ($40 if they come with a mic).


For example: You hear the footsteps of the last enemy that you need to kill. All of your teammates are dead, and so are his. You can use sound to your advantage and lay an ambush along his path, or hide and come out behind him.
 Jumping around a corner at the right second, or even better, waiting for someone to run past you will increase your odds dramatically.
 Not all guns fire in the same way. Spend some time on an empty server and shoot the wall to become more comfortable handling them. Never hold the trigger! Shoot short busts of bullets.
 The time it takes to raise your weapon is enough for someone to get a shot in at you.

 It's recommended that you beat the single player before attempting to fight online.;
, Learn how each weapon shoots and their details. For example does your weapon have a high rate of fire? What is its level of recoil? How long does it take to reload? Is it best in close quarters or at a distance? Knowing the answers to these questions can help prepare you to choose the best weapon for your particular situation.
 Stun and frag grenades are especially useful against multiple enemies in a tight, enclosed setting, such as a building in the Headquarters multiplayer mode.
 The radar is an essential tool which can show where your enemies are, and is especially useful in Free-for-All matches online. But remember the radar only shows where people are if they fire their weapons; if they have silencers on their guns they are essentially invisible to radar.
 If an enemy is rushing into a building in which you are hiding, do you start taking fire? In order to become good you need to be able to respond to these situations with split second reflexes and accurate decisions that will help save you and your teammates but will still defeat your enemies.
 Learning to take cover is one of the most important tools in the game. If you are getting shot, taking cover behind a wall can save your life. But remember that certain surfaces can be penetrated by bullets (which can be used to your advantage). For example if your enemy hides behind a thin concrete wall, you can finish him off through the wall; your bullets will give him less damage, but you should still be able to finish him off fairly quickly.
 If you're a sniper, train yourself to head to good sniper spots and be patient. If you prefer to rush straight into the battle, learn how to rush, shoot from the hip, and use grenades.

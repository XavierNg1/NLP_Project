 This will help you put the replacement wiper back in the correct position once the current wiper has been removed. Bar soap, wax, or another easy to remove mark will work fine.
 This may require that the hood be opened.
 Most designs have a plastic or metal dust cap that covers the drive post and hex nut that hold the wiper arm in place. With this dust cap removed, you will have the access you need to remove the nut.
 Now that the dust cap is removed and you can analyze the hex nut that holds the wiper arm onto the drive post you should choose a socket that fits it. Place the socket on the ratchet or, if needed, on an extension that is attached to the ratchet.
 Ratchets are designed to twist nuts and bolts on and off. You want to be sure you are set to spin in a counter clockwise direction. This will loosen the nut.
 Using your ratchet to remove this nut will allow you to remove the wiper arm from the vehicle.


Place the socket and ratchet fully over the hex nut and hold in place with one hand while Stabilizing the wiper arm by firmly gripping it with the other hand. This will prevent the linkage from exceeding the designed range of motion when twisting the ratchet.
Twist the ratchet to spin the nut counter clockwise one half to one full turn.
Once the hex nut is loosened, release your grip of the wiper arm and remove the socket and ratchet from the hex nut. Spin the hex nut completely off by hand and set aside for reuse.
 Lift the wiper blade up from the windshield with one hand and hold the point of attachment with the other. Gently "rock" the wiper blade back and forth while lifting with both hands and remove from the drive post.

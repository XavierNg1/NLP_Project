 Place the ground beef, 1 tsp (5 ml) salt, and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) black pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly blend the seasonings into the beef.


Clean hands are the best way to mix the beef and seasonings, but you may use a wooden mixing spoon instead, if desired.
 Shape the beef mixture into 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls using your hands.


You could also use a greased melon-baller or small spoon to form the meatballs.
 Place the meatballs in a large skillet and brown them over medium heat.


Make sure that the meatballs are browned on all sides. Stir them frequently as they cook.
You do not need to add oil to the skillet in order to brown the meatballs. The fat in the ground beef that renders off into liquid form should suffice, even when using lean ground beef.
Drain when finished.
 Layer the potatoes, carrots, and onions on the bottom. Place the meatballs on top.


The potatoes and carrots should be placed on the bottom of the slow cooker because they require more heat to cook. The heating element of the slow cooker is located at the bottom of the device, so the bottom is the hottest portion.
 Combine the water, ketchup, cider vinegar, basil, and remaining salt and pepper in a separate bowl. Pour the mixture over the meatballs and vegetables.


You do not need to stir the sauce into the ingredients in the crock pot. Allow the sauce to seep into the ingredients on its own.
 If you need to prepare the stew quicker, cook it on High for 4 hours.


Keep the lid on the slow cooker at all times. Removing the lid can cause heat to escape, thereby lengthening the necessary cooking time.
 Scoop the hot meatball stew into individual serving bowls.


Keep the crock pot on Low or Warm until everyone has been served.

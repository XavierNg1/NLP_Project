Observe where the sun contacts your home the most throughout the day if you are looking to reduce direct sunlight inside.
Figure out if you want an awning to cover a backyard patio or doorway.;
,


Covering a patio will require a larger awning than an awning covering a window or doorway. When making an awning above a window, you don't want to prevent all light-just the majority of the heat.
Estimate your dimensions.



Purchase 1 inch wide by 6 inches long (2.54 cm wide by 15.24 cm long) boards to create the awning frame.
Create a 2-dimensional square frame and attach an equally sized square frame to it so they share a middle spine.
Make 2 identical 2-dimensional right triangle frames attached to the ends of your square frame. This makes a 3-dimensional right triangle frame.
Attach a perpendicular board from the middle spine. This board will attach to the house for support.
Affix metal elbow joints to each angle on the frame for sturdiness.
Place 3 metal brackets on the interior side of the frame for attaching to the house.



Decide on a type and color of fabric. Common fabrics include canvas and vinyl.
Cut the fabric to fit your frame. This will include measuring the length and width of the frame and hemming the fabric as necessary.
Pull the fabric tight and nail it to the wood with short roofing nails.



Hold the frame to the house and mark the holes for drilling where you placed brackets.
Drill 3 or more holes into the house.
Affix the frame to the house and secure it with screws.

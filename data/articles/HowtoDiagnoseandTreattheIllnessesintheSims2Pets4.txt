 To diagnose this you need an x-ray machine which you buy from vets b us for 1000 simoleons. On the examination table click on the x-ray icon then using the x-ray ball swivel the x-ray picture towards the animal and when the 4 lights at the corner of the x-ray picture turn green click your L button or the tick symbol with your stylus, and hopefully you'll get an x-ray of the pet. If it's broken a bone/limb a message will come up saying so., This also gives you time to train, dress up the pet etc. However make sure you give the pet plenty of time to rest so the bone/limb will set properly.,, Then leave it on for 5 days and on the 5th day (before the pet goes home) if you're quick you can take the bandages and neck cone off and dress the pet in some nice accessories!

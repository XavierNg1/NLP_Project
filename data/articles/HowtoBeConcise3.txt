 You may use more words than necessary to explain your idea. More often than not, these words are filler, taking up valuable space in your writing. Take out redundancy and extra explanations from your writing.Some typical filler words are: “just,” “some,” “that,” “but,” and “and then.”
Rearrange phrases to the possessive form. You might use a phrase like “the leaves of the plant.” Rearrange this to the possessive form, writing “the plant’s leaves” instead. This retains the same meaning and eliminates two unnecessary words.
 Take out lengthy descriptions and replace them with more accurate words. For example, Say you wrote, "It is not the case that all historical kings, queens, and princes lived in very large and very beautiful castles." This can be shortened to: "Not all royalty lived in extravagant castles."


Use a thesaurus to find a descriptive synonym for a general term.
Don’t go overboard with choosing descriptors. In many cases, the simpler word or phrase is best. The reader will grasp your meaning more quickly. For example, replace “utilize” with “use,” or replace “terminate” with “end.”, Some modifiers, such as "very" and "really,” are overused to the point where they have become dull and add no extra feeling to sentences. Eliminate many of these without changing the meaning of the sentence.
 Go old school with your writing and work from a hard copy. It is satisfying to cross out unnecessary words with a red pen. See how much you can cut out without losing your original meaning.
 Take a few minutes to listen for unnecessary words. Does the writing flow naturally as you say it out loud?


Ask someone to listen to you reading your work. He might hear other unnecessary or redundant words that you don’t catch.

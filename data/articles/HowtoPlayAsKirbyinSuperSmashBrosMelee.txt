 By using "B", you suck in another player's character, gain a hat, and their "B" power. If needed, Suck them when you've jumped off the edge to take them with you. Chances are you'll probably be able to survive using Final Cutter, making a rather cool scene.;
, When jumping, Kirby can jump 5 times in a row. "B up" just makes you jump slightly, then fall to the ground like a rock (but you go forward a bit and it's a pretty high leap).
 "Down B" turns Kirby into a the whomp, rock, or a 100 ton weight; however, there is no difference in damage output. If you fall on someone, it does about 20 percent damage and makes you temporarily invulnerable to all attacks excluding grabs.
 Use "B Left" and "B Right". It takes time, but deals good damage if you can land a hit.

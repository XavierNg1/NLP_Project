 Open a new file in the spreadsheet application on your operating system. Type in a title over each column to stay organized. Use the first column to write the name of the activity. The second column should become the points you earned for the assignment. The third column will be the total points possible.


For example, your columns might be: Activity name, Points earned, Points possible, Weight value, Weighted scores.
Input your data. At this stage you can only enter the activity name, points earned, points possible, and weight value.
 This will give you the percentage of your total grade each score is worth. For example, if the grade of your midterm exam that was 30% of your final score was an 87, you would enter open parenthesis, select the cell with the midterm score, asterisk, and 30%. Written out, this looks like “ =(B2*30%) “, Pick a cell you want to display your final weighted score. Do the same sum function as we have before. Type equals, sum, open parenthesis, pick the range of cells with your scores, close parenthesis, and press enter. Written out, it will look somewhat like “ =sum(B2:B6) “

, Now that you know your total percentage for all the weighted activities, compare that percentage to your course grading scale to identify the letter (ex. A, B-, D+, etc…) or number grade (3.75, 2.5, 1.0, etc…) you will receive for the class.

 When around a big dog, be sure to greet and talk with the owner first. This should be done while completely ignoring the dog. Your positive interactions with the owner will signal to the dog that you have a positive, non-threatening presence., Staring directly at a dog can be seen as a challenge or a threat. Consequently, try to avoid making eye contact with the dog. Also, try not to stand facing the dog, but stand with your body sideways.Standing with your body sideways is less threatening, and will encourage the dog to want to meet you.
 When talking with the owner, speak in a calm, soothing tone. This will signal to the dog that you are a calm, non-threatening presence. If you seem too excited, it could make the dog excited and lead to an unpleasant greeting, like the dog jumping on you. On the other hand, dogs can sense fear, as well. If the dog senses that you are fearful, it might respond in an aggressive manner. An overly excited tone can also trigger the dogâ€™s flight or fight instinct.
Do not baby talk to the dog either. Some dogs regard this energy as weak, and are more likely to jump or pounce on you.

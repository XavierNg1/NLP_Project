 Is it going to be on an alien planet? Is it going to be on a place that is relatively similar to places on earth? You don’t need to figure out everything about the entire world, but you do need to figure out where you want your story to occur. For example, maybe you want the major action of your story to occur in a world where most people live in caves because outside of caves there are a ton of dangerous slime pits that you could fall into.;
, Like slime pits! Anime’s often have parts of their world that are slightly magical or strange in some way. Maybe pianos talk and give people lots of advice. Maybe there are flying beasts that people use to get from place to place. It doesn’t have to be something incredibly fantastical or something out of a science fiction novel – just pick something that works with your world and your story. For example, the magic of the world could be a simple folk tale that may or may not be true. Maybe on the slime pit world there is a story that if you fall into a slime pit and survive you’ll be granted special powers but no one knows if this is true or not.
 Are the residents of your world living in apartment complexes or in wooden huts? Are they hunting for their food, or can they go out to dinner are restaurants? Obviously there are a ton of other possibilities in between and beyond these examples. The technological status of your world will inform a lot of the ways that your characters interact with the problems that face them. For example if someone falls into a slime pit in a technological advanced world, maybe it’s no big deal because everyone wears anti-slime suits.

, If using pre-prepared then roll it out and put in tin/dish for baking. Leave it for about 10 minutes as the pastry shrinks. Then you can cut off excess.
 Line the pie tin with the pastry and bake. This helps prevent a soggy bottom on your pie. Make sure you prick the bottom with a fork and overlay the pastry with a sheet of greaseproof paper or baking parchment and dried peas or baking beans. This helps to keep the shape and also stop any rising. Set your oven to approx. Gas Mark 5.
 Place them in the pan and add water. Ignite or turn on hob and bring potatoes to the boil and simmer until ready.
 Usually two standard tins are enough to make a pie but if you want more add more! Cut the corned beef into cubs as this is easier to mash.
 Add a knob of butter to the pan and start mashing making sure the texture is as lumpy as you like - obviously if you like your pie with lumps of potato don't mash too much!

, It may be too much to mash at once so add some at a time. Also add a good pinch of salt and pepper to season - add more if necessary.
 Add mix to the baking dish/tray that has been lined with pastry. Spread out evenly to the edges.
 Wet the rim of the bottom sheet of pastry so that when the top piece goes on, it will stick to the bottom piece. Place this over the corned beef, etc, that is in the dish. Cut to size then pierce pastry on top with 2 slits - this is so the steam can get out. Then press with your thumbs all the way around the edges of the pastry so that they join tightly together.
 Brush on with a pastry brush to that all the pastry is covered. This helps the pastry to go golden brown.
 (If you are using pre-prepared pastry thenÂ  follow instructions on packet as to what temperature the oven must be). Cook until pastry is golden brown.
 You can eat the pie hot or cold and with whatever you want. Enjoy!

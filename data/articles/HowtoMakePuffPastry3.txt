 Roll out your puff pastry into a thin sheet, then cut it into circles using a circle-shaped cookie cutter or drinking glass. Lightly indent the center of each circle with a smaller cookie cutter or a cap (such as from a spice jar). Lightly poke the inner circle a few times with a fork. Transfer the circles to a baking sheet and bake at 400°F (205°C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Take the pastry out of the oven and either pat the inner circle down with the bottom of a spice jar or wooden spoon, or lift the inner circle out completely. You can now fill the cups with cream, fruit, or any cooked filling., Roll out your puff pastry until it is slightly bigger than your wheel of brie cheese. Set the cheese in the middle of dough and pour some honey over it. You can also add nuts and dried fruit. Bring the corners of the dough towards the middle of the cheese, creating a packet. Bake the brie on a baking sheet at 350°F (175°C) for 25 to 30 minutes. You can serve the baked brie with apple slices and crackers., Roll out the puff pastry dough into two thin 10 by 14 inch (25.4 by 35.65 centimeter) rectangles. Cut each sheet into 24 smaller rectangles. Press the rectangles into the wells of a mini muffin tin. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 10 minutes. Take the pastries out of the oven and pat the center of each with the end of a wooden spoon or spice bottle. Fill the pastries with whatever you want, then put them back into the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Here are some ideas for what you can fill the pastries with:


Ham and cheese
Sautéed mushrooms and onion
Brie, pistachios, and peach preserves

, Roll the pastry into two 10 inch by 12 inch (25.40 by 30.48 centimeters) squares. Place one of the squares on a baking sheet and brush it with mustard; leave a 1" boarding. Cover the sheet with a layer of ham slices, then cover the ham with Swiss cheese slices. Spread egg wash around the border and cover it with the second pastry sheet. Press the edges together, then brush the top pastry with egg wash. Bake at 450°F (233°C) for 20 to 25 minutes. Allow the puff pastry to cool, then cut it into squares and serve.To make the egg wash, whisk together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of water in a bowl.
 Roll some puff pastry dough into a 10 by 14 inch (25.4 by 35.65 centimeter) rectangle. Brush one half of the pastry with egg wash. Mix 1/3 cup (35 grams) grated Parmesan cheese and 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning in a bowl, then spread over the other half of the puff pastry. Fold the pastry in half, so that the egg side touches the cheesy side. Cut the pastry into 24 strips. Twist each strip into a spiral, then brush each strip with some egg wash. Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 10 minutes. Let cool before serving.To make the egg wash, beat an egg and a tablespoon of water together in a small bowl.

 You have to practice... a lot. Particularly if you are giving a speech or performing in a debate, you need to know your material. If you do not practice, if you think you can wing it, you are really setting yourself up for failure. So practice again and again. You all know that 'practice makes perfect'.;
, This is a vital skill for interpersonal, professional communication. You have got one mouth and two ears, so you should listen twice as much as you should speak. Listening helps you to adjust and meet both your own needs and the needs of the person with whom you are communicating. Listen to your audience. Take in their opinions, make considerate comments in return, and through this practice, boost your listening skills. Try to listen with enough attention.
 This is kind of related to listen and practice; if you have got a video camera, you can record yourself, record it and watch. It may be painful because you are going to see how good or how bad you really are. We are our worst critics, so you may be disappointed at first, but if you can get it up to a point where you feel pretty good about the presentation, you know you will be ready to speak in professional settings.


Listening to your own speech can help you become conscious of and fix poor habits, like using crutch words such as "umm" and "like."

, Do not think that you are the best. Speaking is a difficult skill, and it takes years of experience and practice to get to a truly comfortable level. Realize that if you are honest with yourself, if you are willing to work on your skills, there is no traffic on the extra mile.
 This about you taking the time and doing the research. Before giving a speech, the best speakers plan their thoughts, write drafts, and make revisions. Examine your subject very carefully so that you can talk about it really well. Try to understand your audience and what they want to see and hear.

 Rice contains manganese, an important component in moving the energy stored in carbohydrates and protein into your body. If you enjoy a bit of spice in your snacks, a simple snack of kimchi and brown rice is perfect for a midday energy boost. A more elaborate snack might include brown rice with sweet potatoes, nuts, and raisins for an more energizing midday snack.White rice contains more sugar, and could cause your energy levels to crash after providing an initial boost. Stick to brown rice.
 Oatmeal is a kind of grain which, when prepared with water or milk, turns into a delicious gruel perfect for cold winter days. Top your oatmeal with fruit, nuts, or syrup for a tasty snack., Quinoa is a kind of grain, not unlike rice or couscous. But quinoa has higher protein levels than any other grain, and therefore makes a great midday snack. Try using quinoa just as you would rice, topping it with a bit of tofu and curry or beans., Trail mix is a combination of dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. The natural sugars in dried fruits – raisins, banana chips, and dried strawberries, for instance – provide a great source of energy. And nuts increase protein levels. Don’t eat more than a handful, though, as carb levels that rise too quickly can cause sleepiness, which would defeat the purpose of eating trail mix as an energizing midday snack.Throw some roasted pumpkin seeds into your trail mix for an extra dose of energizing calcium, iron, and protein.Flax seeds are also a great addition to trail mix.
 Granola has lots of protein to keep your energy high through the middle of the day. Paired with plain, low-fat yogurt, your midday snack will be irresistibly delicious, as well as energizing. Check the label on your granola to ensure it does not have added sugar.You could choose to sprinkle your yogurt with diced apples or blueberries if you wish to sweeten it a bit.

 Place the can of coconut milk in the refrigerator and allow it chill overnight. Do not shake the can.
 Remove the can of coconut milk from the refrigerator and open it. The coconut cream should be sitting firmly on top. Use a spoon to scoop out the solid cream into your chilled mixing bowl.


Leave the clear coconut liquid behind in the can. You can save it to make a coconut-based soup or add it to a fruit smoothie.
 Add 2 tablespoons powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the coconut cream.
 Whip for about five minutes until stiff peaks form and serve immediately.

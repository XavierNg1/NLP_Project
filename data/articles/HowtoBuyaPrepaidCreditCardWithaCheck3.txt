 Once you have used up all or most of the money you loaded onto your card, you may be able to load more money onto the card so you can keep using it. This is called reloading the card.


Some cards may not be reloadable. If this is the case, once you have used up the funds, you can just throw the card away. Prepaid gift cards, for example, may not be reloadable.
 The packaging that comes with your card explains all of the terms and options, including how to reload the card. If you do not have this packaging, look at the back of the card. You should find a customer-service number or website that may give you information about how to reload the card.
 If you purchased the card with a check, consider linking your checking account to the card. You will likely be able to reload your card online with a linked checking account.A linked checking account can also serve as overdraft protection for your prepaid credit card. If you accidentally go over your pre-loaded balance, it may keep a transaction from being declined if you have funds in your checking account to cover the transaction.
 Some prepaid cards allow you to go to a retailer and reload the card at the register. Pay the cashier the amount you want to put on the card. If the retailer accepts checks, you can write a check to pay for reloading the card. The cashier will swipe your card to activate this amount on your card.

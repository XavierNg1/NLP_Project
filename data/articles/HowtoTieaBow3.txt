 Hold the end against your palm with your thumb, and continue wrapping the ribbon until the entire piece has been wrapped. Each loop around your hand should be neatly placed on top of the previous loop.
 Be careful not to let the loops come undone when you slip them off.
 Hold the folded loop in one hand so that the center folded part is facing up. With the other hand, use a scissors to cut the corner off of either side of the cinch, the folded middle.









Make sure you cut through all of the ribbon layers. Use a careful, firm snip of the scissors to ensure the cut is even and none of the layers slip.
Don't cut the two corners too close to the center of the ribbon.
 Fit the second ribbon between the notches you cut in the middle of the loops and tie a knot there. You can also use florist wire or a small string.
 Separate the loops one by one from the inside to the outside. Pull the loops gently from the center and twist them toward you. Arrange the loops so that they form a petal-like circular pattern. The floral bow is now complete.

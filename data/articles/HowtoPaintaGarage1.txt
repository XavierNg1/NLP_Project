 This means power washing the outside and scrubbing the inside. If you are painting the garage floor as well, there are a lot of other things you need to do to prepare that surface. The last thing you want is to spend a lot of time and sweat painting your garage only to see the paint peeling and looking ragged next season. Do it right the first time.
 This means goggles and chemical resistant gloves and boots. You will need some pretty strong stuff to get that oil off the old concrete and get it ready to accept a coat of paint.
 The overhead garage door should be open, at least at the cleaning phase. If it is too windy, opening it up 6-8 inches (15.24 - 20.32 cm)should be sufficient to ventilate, but keep the outside from coming in and sticking to your new floor.
 Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing. Make sure you rinse it well when you are done. Seal up any cracks and repair any damage to the concrete after the water has evaporated.
 By the time you get this all together, the crack repair and sealant should be completely dry. If not, give it more time. It has to be completely dry before you put down the paint. You may have to etch the floor if it is newer or does not readily absorb water. If it doesn't absorb water, it is not going to absorb the paint.
 A primer will make your floor look 100 percent better and make it last longer. It is worth the time, effort and extra money. After at least 1 day, when the primer is completely dried, you can apply your paint. Make sure with both your priming and your top coat, you start from the back of the garage and work your way to the front so you can exit without walking over your masterpiece.

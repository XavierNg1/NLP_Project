 A teammate, coach, or parent/guardian can catch with you. All you need is a mitt and ball. Start close together, but eventually spread out until you are far away from each other. Long toss helps warm up your arm. When your arm feels like it is at its best, stop throwing, because your arm has been warmed up.;
, Pull it across your chest and hold for 10 seconds. Then pull it over your shoulder for 10 seconds. Do any other stretches that will make your arm feel less tense, but if you feel a pain, stop immediately.
 Chances are you won't be pitching the whole game, depending how old you are. Know when in the game you will pitch (starter, middle, closer) and get ready in the coming innings.

 This is an Nvidia program which manages your Nvidia drivers and game settings. You can download the installer from geforce.com/geforce-experience.


The installer will scan your system for supported hardware. You will likely encounter an error during installation if you don't have an Nvidia graphics card or are using an older product.
Launch the program after the installation has completed.
 When you start GeForce Experience, it will check for any available updates.
 Any available driver updates will be displayed. Click the "Check for updates" button if GeForce Experience hasn't checked recently.
 GeForce Experience may have already downloaded the files.
 Advanced users can choose the Custom option. Most users will be fine with the express installation.


The custom installation will allow you to choose which of the drivers you want to install.
 GeForce Experience will handle all of the installation work. Your screen may flicker or shut off for a moment during installation.
 Windows will create a system restore point when your Nvidia drivers are updated. You can boot into Safe Mode and run the system restore utility to roll back to before the drivers were updated.

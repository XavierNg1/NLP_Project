 Once you realize you have an allergic reaction, and from past experience you know it is not serious, take deep breaths. Inform a responsible adult that you are suffering from an allergic reaction, and that you wish to delay or not use your Epipen. Do not shout or run around needlessly. Stressing about your allergic reaction and increasing your heart rate may cause your body to overproduce chemicals such as adrenaline, and this could aggravate your condition.
 Spit out any allergy-causing food and clean your mouth with water, another liquid, or gum. Swish the liquid around in your mouth and spit it out. If you use gum, be sure to replace it often so that the food particles stuck in it do not cause you to have a reaction again., Once your mouth is clean of the food that made you sick, eat some safe food, such as fruit or vegetables. This is to help you forget the taste and texture of the food that caused the allergic reaction. Do not eat too much on your already upset stomach or you may vomit., If you still have an itching sensation in your mouth and throat, brush your teeth. Use lots of toothpaste and rinse your toothbrush often. This will help distract you from the itchy feeling, and you are getting rid of any last allergy-causing foods., The initial itchy feeling should lessen after twenty minutes and be gone in an hour. If it's getting worse after that tie, use your EpiPen or other medication. Try not to go to sleep for at least four hours in case the symptoms return. Make sure you have a responsible adult to watch your symptoms, because an outside perspective is better at noticing changes., You will probably feel sick and nauseous the next couple of days. Eat clean and safe food, like fruits, vegetables, and bread. Find out what made you sick and be sure to avoid it in the future! If in doubt, contact the hospital to find out for sure if it is gone.

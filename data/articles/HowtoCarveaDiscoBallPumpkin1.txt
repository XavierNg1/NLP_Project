 The pumpkin should be medium to large in size and as round as you can get it––think disco ball when selecting it!


Apply the usual pumpkin choosing requirements when selecting––choose a healthy, non-bruised pumpkin. Carve it just before your display date to avoid spoilage.;
, Scoop out the flesh using a strong spoon or other implements. Discard the flesh (or make something vaguely tasty out of it if you're brave––the seeds can be roasted if desired).
 The pumpkin should sit flat. This may necessitate removing some of the base but remember that if you do this, it'll affect where you can place the pumpkin for display or will require a surface for it to sit on (non-flammable surface if using real candles).
 Work around the pumpkin from top to bottom (or bottom to top) placing dots at evenly spaced intervals in rows around the pumpkin. These are your markers for drilling the holes next.
 If you want to be really fancy, there are drill bits designed to do this but really, any electric drill should do the job. The size of the holes is up to you––you can enlarge them by using a "carving" action with the drill as you make the initial hole and simply working at it until the hole is large enough.


The best look will come from trying to keep the holes the same shape all the way around. But don't despair if a few are lopsided––it'll still work.






Don't forget to also drill holes in the lid. It completes the look.
 If using live candles, make sure the surface it sits on is non-flammable.
 Either use tea light candles with real flame or use battery operated versions (LEDs). Make sure it is well lit, as this is a disco ball pumpkin after all!

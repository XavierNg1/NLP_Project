  Do not keep your hands too far apart, however, do not keep them too close to each other.
  This will make it easier.  Hold it from the center, between your index finger and your thumb.,  Hit one of the prongs of the spinner hard, using your index finger. It should start spinning.  The harder you hit it, the faster it will spin., Toss the fidget spinner from your dominant hand to your other hand,  without letting it  stop spinning., The idea is to transfer it back and forth, while not letting it stop spinning.  To accomplish this, catch it from the bearing in the center,  the part that makes it spin.,  Keep tossing it from one hand to the other, and catching it from the center.

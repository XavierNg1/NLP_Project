 Your equation should be in the form of x2 + 8x + 12 = 0.
 These two points will be your zeroes, or answers to the function.
 If you're graphing an equation in order to find its zeroes and you need to show work, use this method as a way of double-checking that the answers you got were actually correct. Most teachers will not assign credit for just the answers, without the work shown.

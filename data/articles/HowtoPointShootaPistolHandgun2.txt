 In a lowered gun stance (safe-carry position), pull your gun up, as quickly as possible, to firing position and fire multiple shots into the target. Do not use your sights! This drill is to get you less dependent on your sights.


It may take quite a few tries, but you will find you eventually can place that bullet near the center of your target every time.
The key is to try to perform it quickly, but try to take just enough time to allow the momentum of your arms and gun to slow as you get to the target.
Attempt to stretch your abilities by increasing the distance to the target, or decreasing the time you have to fire. Try to get good hits. A slow hit is always better than a fast miss.
 You want to start by setting up three or more targets a yard or two apart. Quick to firing position and go down the line. One shot at each target.


Change it up: fire a burst at each target; maybe try in a different order; have a friend tell you which one to shoot ("one!", "three!", etc.), but the key thing to be sure of is that you hit your target; once you are sure you can hit your target every time, try to accelerate your pace.
Try it from the close contact position at 3- then 5-yards. See how quickly you can change between targets and how many bullets land in "good hit" zones.
 While moving, you should still be able to hit targets at 5-yards. Set up three or more targets a few yards apart from each other. Start about 15–18 yards (13.7–16.5 m) back. Run up to about 5-yards (from your first target) while drawing your gun to firing position. Fire a two-shot burst, side-step to engage the next target, and so on.


Each time you run the course, try to do it faster; try not to pause when shooting, but remember that doing so will likely make you much more accurate.
Try drawing when 3- or 5-yards away from the first target. Once you have landed good hits on the first target sidestep and move down the line of targets.

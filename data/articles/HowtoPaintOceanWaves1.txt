 Start with a horizon line, using Prussian blue for a sunny day. Fill the distant background of the sea with dark blue or ocean blue paint, optionally including a little green as well. Leave enough space in the foreground for two or three lines of waves near the shore.


If there is a beach in the foreground, create a layer of yellow sand, then a shade of blue along the water edge, then a line of white foam over that. Prussian blue shading just behind the foam makes it look like the wave is hitting the shore.;
, Start with a flat-edged brush. Dip the base of the brush in blue paint, then the tip of the brush in white or light blue paint. If you like, you can even divide the brush into three parts, using two shades of blue. Painting the waves with this technique automatically gives them some depth and shading.


This works best with acrylic paint. If you are using oil paint, just layer the different colors over each other.
 Move the brush in the same direction the waves are traveling. Each short stroke will create a small, choppy wave.


If you are using a more traditional approach than the two or three color brush described above, paint the waves from the base up, blending a darker blue into a lighter blue, and finishing with a white crest.
 These could be white for afternoon sun, or red and orange for a sunset scene. Also consider white or light blue flecks around the wave crests to represent foam.


Even in a daylight scene, a small touch of orange and white can increase the contrast with the sky.
 For a free-spirited, active painting, try finishing with a splatter of paint from your fingers. This works best on close-up images of the water, or on water in the foreground of a landscape.

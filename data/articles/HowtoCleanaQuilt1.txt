 Look for a care tag with guidelines for washing and drying. If there is one, follow the instructions provided. Check the quilt for embellishments, appliques, and loose seams or lace. See if there are any highly saturated or contrasting colors, hand dying, or batiks.Quilts with embellishments shouldn’t be washed in a washing machine. Loose seams should be repaired before washing the quilt.Quilts with vivid colors may bleed. Test the fabric with white cotton fabric dipped in hot water. Rub the quilt’s highly saturated area and see if any color comes off. If so, use a color catcher product in the washing machine.;
, Choose a liquid-based detergent that is colorless and unscented, without any fabric softener, brighteners, or bleach.You can purchase special laundry soap specifically for quilts, if desired. Alternately, use baby shampoo instead of laundry detergent.For example, castile soap is safe to use on quilts.
 Alternately, if your quilt is delicate or not cotton-based, you can hand wash it in a large tub. Let the detergent completely dissolve, then stir the quilt gently in the water.Never use hot water to wash a handmade quilt. Don’t use the normal wash and spin cycles of your washing machine.If your quilt is yellowed or has an odor such as smoke, soak it overnight first in cold water.You may want to wash the quilt in cold water a second time, without any detergent, to ensure that no detergent residue remains on the fabric., Pour half a cup (125 mL) of distilled white vinegar into your wash cycle. This will help keep the colors of your quilt bright.

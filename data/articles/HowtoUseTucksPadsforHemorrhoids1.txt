 Before you use a TUCKS® pad, you will need to ensure that the anal area is clean. The best way to clean the anal area is to take a warm Sitz bath. Sitz baths only require a few inches of water to soak the anus but you can take a full bath if you prefer. If you prefer the traditional Sitz bath, just fill the tub with a few inches of water.You can also buy a Sitz bath at a pharmacy or medical supply store. These are small basins that you can attach to your toilet seat and use to wash your anal area.;
, Add about one cup of Epsom salts to a full bathtub or two to three tablespoons of Epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat the bath two times per day., If you cannot take a bath, get a clean, cotton washcloth and soak it in warm water. Apply the compress for about 10–15 minutes, directly on the hemorrhoid three times per day or before each time you use a TUCKS® pad.
 Using a clean cotton towel, dry your anus well.Make sure that you pat the area dry. Do not rub the area because this may make the hemorrhoid worse.

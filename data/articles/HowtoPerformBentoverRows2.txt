 Instead of holding the barbell just above the ground as your starting position, start with the barbell resting on the ground. Place your hands a few inches wider apart than you would with a standard row. Since your arms and back won’t be as active as they would be during the standard starting positioning, compensate with a more explosive lift. This will force the muscles along your spine to participate more than they do during a standard row.Set the barbell back on the ground to finish each lift. If you continue to hold it in the air between lifts, you’re back to doing standard rows.
 Keeping your back straight, squat to take hold of the barbell. Grip it with an underhand grip (also called “supinated”) so that your palms are facing upward or outward, with your hands placed a little wider apart than shoulder-width. Extend your legs until you are standing upright with your arms held straight down toward the floor. Bend your knees a little. Then bend forward from your waist, but only until your upper torso is at a roughly 70 degree angle toward the floor.Instead of rowing to your chest, lift the barbell to where your hips and lower torso form a crease
This technique utilizes your biceps more than standard rows do.
 Although the standard row is typically performed with an overhand grip, feel free to switch it up. Use an underhand grip instead to utilize more of your lats and biceps when executing standard or Pendlay rows. Also favor the underhand grip if you tend to feel sharp discomfort in your shoulders during overhand rows.

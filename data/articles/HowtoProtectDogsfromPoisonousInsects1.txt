 Regularly check the yard for signs of pets, such as anthills and wasp nests. Try to treat or remove these as soon as possible, or at the very least, keep your dog away from these areas. Paying attention to where dangers are can help you keep your dog safe.Look for medium-sized papery nests or smaller nests made out of mud. These nests are usually types of hornets. They can build in cracks in your house, as well as in cavities and hollows around your yard.Ants make hills on the ground, usually.
Other bugs that can be poisonous to your dog include fleas (as they can give your dog tapeworms), ticks, spiders, kissing bugs, and botflies.;
, Standing water is the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. The more mosquitoes there are around, the more likely your dog is to get bitten. Look for hidden spots of standing water around your home, such as flower pots, drainage pipes, low-lying areas, and even dips in roofs.Make sure any trash cans or pots have drainage holes in the bottom.
Fill in holes in your yard or garden with soil or sand, so water can pool there.Also, keep your pool clean. A pool can also be a breeding ground for insects like mosquitoes. Making sure it stays clean, covered, and chlorinated can help cut down on this problem. Be aware, though, that bugs can also use the standing water on top of a cover for breeding or drinking., Birds and bats are predators for most insects, so having more in your yard will help reduce the insect population. You can put out bird seed, for instance, to help increase bird visitation to your yard, or purchase bat houses to encourage bats to hang out there.

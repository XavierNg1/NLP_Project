It is about 5hrs journey that is from Euston Station to Glasgow. Since Orkney is further north, there are sometimes connecting lines to take you through to Caithness a registration county, lieutenancy area and historic local government area of Scotland. The train journey ends at Thurso a town and former burgh on the north coast of the Highland council area of Scotland part of Caithness.

 Generally smaller supplies like paper clips, thumbtacks, rubber bands, staples and binder clips are ideal for this project.
 You’ll need one jar per supply group (i.e. one for paper clips, one for thumbtacks, etc.). Additionally, pick up a magnetic knife or tool holder strip (typically found in the kitchen section of the bath and home store) and charge your electric screwdriver (to help you mount the strip underneath your cabinet). You should also obtain a clamp (or an assistant) to hold the magnetic strip in place during the mounting process.


Consider how many jars you will need, the jar sizes and the amount of space you have when purchasing the magnetic strip. If you have several supplies you may need to find a few spots underneath shelves and pick up more than one magnetic strip.
Purchase a few fender washers if your plastic jars do not have a metal lid. You’ll have to glue one washer to the top of each lid so the jar holds onto the magnetic strip.

 It can be found in the bottom area of Wela Volcano Park. You have a 24% chance of finding one at any time of day. It'll be between level 16 and 19.;
, Go through the tall grass until you find a Cubone.
 Nest Balls are a good ball to catch it with, since they work well on low-level Pokémon.
 Cubone caught in Alola will only evolve during the nighttime. In Pokémon Sun, the in-game clock matches your console's clock, while in Pokémon Moon, the in-game clock is 12 hours ahead of your console's clock. So if you have Pokémon Moon, make sure you're playing during the daytime, not the nighttime.
 Since Cubone is a Ground-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Electric, Ground, Steel, and Rock-type Pokémon.

 If your child starts screaming when you want him to try on his new coat, don't spank him or take away his favorite toy! Maybe that coat feels like broken glass against his skin. Maybe he feels scared because the coat is not what he's used to. Make sure you understand the issue before acting.
 Maybe your child has just talked back to you, and you're about to send them to their room. However, their favorite TV show comes on in five minutes. Stop! To you it might not seem like a big deal, but that TV show might be the high point of their day. Discipline should be unpleasant, not devastating. Maybe say "no dessert" or "no video games for the rest of the week" instead.
 Children with Asperger's are often quite sensitive. Again, something that seems like no big deal to you might rock their world. It's possible that they might begin to doubt your love for them.

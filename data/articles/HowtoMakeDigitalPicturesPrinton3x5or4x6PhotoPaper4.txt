 Generally, set your digital camera to a resolution of 1600x1200, or 2 MP, for the highest quality prints 3x5 or 4x6 prints.
 Upload your photos from your camera onto your computer.
 When you do this, you ensure that you can always start over if you make editing mistakes.
 If you crop your photos using the wrong aspect ratio, even high resolution images can become distorted.


A horizontal 4x6 photo has an aspect ratio of 3:2, which means that the ratio of its length to its width is 3:2. A horizontal 3x5 photo has an aspect ration of 5:3 (5" long and 3" wide)
The aspect ratio is reversed if your picture is vertical. For instance, a vertical 3x5 print has an aspect ratio of 3:5, and a vertical 4x6 has an aspect ratio of 2:3.
When you crop your photo, make sure that the new photo length and width has the appropriate aspect ration for a 4x6 or a 3x5. Specify the aspect ratio in your cropping tool within your photo editing software or within your online editing tools.
 A DPI setting of 300 generally produces the best photos.

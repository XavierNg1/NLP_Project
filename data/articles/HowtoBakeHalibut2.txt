 Set aside a nonstick, oven-safe casserole dish or similar baking dish.


You do not need to coat this baking dish with cooking spray, aluminum foil, or parchment paper.
 Evenly spoon the cream of mushroom soup on each fillet, spreading it over the top of each one using the back of the spoon.


If applicable, keep the skin-side of the fillet facing down inside the baking dish.
While cream of mushroom soup works well, you can also experiment by using a different "cream of" soup. Other options worth considering include cream of chicken, cream of celery, cream of onion, and cream of potato.
If you'd rather not use the soup, you can create a very thin sauce by pouring 3/4 cup (180 ml) of milk or chicken broth over the fish fillets.
 Place 1 tsp (5 ml) of butter in the center of each halibut fillet, then sprinkle each fillet with ground black pepper.


Leave the butter solid instead of melting it for this method. It should melt and spread evenly throughout the flesh of the fish as it bakes.
 Place the prepared fillets in the preheated oven. Bake the fish for about 15 minutes, or until it flakes evenly when you pierce the center with a fork.


The sauce should keep the halibut moist while it cooks. You shouldn't need to baste, rotate, or flip the fish during the baking process.
 Remove the fish from the oven and immediately transfer it to individual serving dishes. If desired, spoon some of the sauce over each fillet before enjoying.

 Before your tree can be thrown out, all ornaments, garland, tinsel, lights, and other decorations must be removed.When the tree is back to it’s original and natural state, you can bring the tree outside.


Try to get rid of your tree before it starts to get really dry. Dry Christmas trees shed pine needles everywhere, but they’re also dangerous because they are highly flammable., Cut your tree into smaller pieces. These tree portions normally need to be into pieces at most, four feet long.This makes for easier pickup for the people who come to collect your trash.
 If you’re community doesn’t have a recycling waste system or a yard waste system, you can dispose of your tree as you would with your normal trash. When your tree has been cut down into smaller pieces, place the pieces into your yard waste bin, recycling bin, or garbage bin.Usually, the bin lid has to be able to completely close with the tree inside.


There are some communities where you may be charged a fee for not recycling your Christmas tree, so keep that in mind along with other options of disposing your tree.

 Indeed, you are always in the present, but it can be easy to let your mind wander back into the past. Learn to consciously choose where you place your attention. Notice when you are fixating on the past, and force yourself to turn your gaze to what is around you in this moment. Check yourself.


Consider whether ruminating on the past is useful for you. When you replay the past, your mind only has a finite number of memories to relive. Your thoughts run in loops, and it is easy to wallow in your emotions – but you have a choice in the matter!, If you are beating yourself up about something that you did or didn't do: remind yourself that you did what you could. You were acting on the information that you had at the time, and you made your choice as the result of a specific set of circumstances. You might make a different choice now – but that was the choice that you made then. You are human, and it's okay to make mistakes.
 Whenever this thing from the past comes up in conversation, try not to complain or wistfully reminisce about it. The way that you frame something dictates the way that you interact with it. Instead of talking about the negative, unchangeable aspects of the situation, try to talk about what you've learned. Share the bright side, and see how that shapes your perspective.

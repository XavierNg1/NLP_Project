The recognition of the divinity in man is the essence of Vedanta.
Vedanta teaches us there is one reality and each soul is identical with that reality. All the infinite powers of the world are with in the human soul. According to the Mundaka Upanishad:-- "Brahman is supreme, He is self luminous, he is beyond all thought. Subtler than the subtlest is he, farther than the farthest, nearer than the nearest. He resides in the lotus of the heart of every being.;
, Often we do not know why it would be good to love other beings as ourselves. It is possible when we understand that the whole world is one–the oneness of the universe is the solidarity of life–that in hurting anyone you are hurting yourself, in loving anyone, you are loving yourself., Vedanta tells us to build in all people a faith in themselves. We have to struggle to manifest the perfection and divinity within through the practice of yoga. This is the key to inner transformation and to change the world around us.

Rediscover your own divine nature and help others to do the same. The Veda teaches us " Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam " which means the total world is a family. Here we strive to enclose little spaces and exclude outsiders. So our aim should be to wipe out these little enclosures, to widen the boundaries until they are lost sight of.

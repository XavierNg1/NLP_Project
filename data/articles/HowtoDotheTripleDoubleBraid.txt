 Choose a side section to begin with, either left or right, then clip the rest of the hair up, being careful to keep the partings in place. Have an elastic band ready.
 Be sure to do a regular three strand braid, because other braids won't work. Tie the end of the braid close to the bottom, but not so close the elastic will fall off. Put the braid over the child's shoulder and carefully unclip the next section, then make sure the other seven sections are clipped up well., Take the three braids closest to the left or right then braid them together and tie the elastic near the bottom, over the other three., That's your double braids done, now for the triple-double. Simply braid the double braids together and tie your final elastic at the bottom. Done!, Pull the braid towards the back of the head and make a gap in that hair, then tuck the braid through. Secure with bobby pins. Then, tuck the braid through the right side, making a gap in the hair and pushing it through, and if there's enough hair, on the left too. Be sure to secure well.

 You will need a square piece of cloth for this simple design. The cloth should be of adequate size (one square yard or one square meter) to make a useful diffuser panel. Importantly, the cloth should be opaque when lit from the front and translucent when lit from the back, so pick a white material that will allow most of the light to pass. An old, white sheet of medium or low thread count will suffice, but scrim is ideal.;
, Take your PVC and cut it into four equal lengths of 30 in. (76 cm) each.
 Using the elbows and the straight PVC "runs" dry fit a square frame.
 Lay the diffuser fabric (scrim or linen cloth) on the floor and place the frame on top of the cloth. Mark the cloth 2 to 2-1/2 inches (5-6 cm) outside the frame, then cut the cloth along the marked outline. (Pinking shears are best. These will keep the cloth from fraying so badly.)

, Remove the frame and fold each corner inward so that you form triangles with six inch (15 cm) edges. Glue the triangle flaps down with fabric glue. Replace the frame, then fold each edge over the frame and glue it to the fabric that is on the floor. Make sure to stretch the fabric slightly, working any wrinkles out. Get the diffuser cloth nice and even.

 Make sure to fill in the entire lip with product!

, Start at the center of your lips and gently blend out. This raises the center of your lips, instantly plumping them up. This can also be done with a shimmer/highlighter if you don't have an appropriate color lipstick.


Don't use a drastically lighter shade, such as a maroon base and a bubblegum pink highlight. This will look weird and unrealistic.

 For individuals who lead a largely sedentary lifestyle, or anyone who works at a job which requires them to remain seated for multiple hours, gravity can draw fluids into the lower extremities of your body. This can lead to water retention in your feet, ankles, and legs. Avoid this by walking frequently throughout the day. Keep your blood circulating, and your lower extremities will not retain water.This also occurs during long plane rides, during which passengers remain immobile for many hours.
If you’re on an international flight, plan to stand up and stretch or walk around at least a few times.
 If you’re concerned that you may be retaining water in your feet, ankles, and lower legs, you can elevate the swollen parts of your body. This will let gravity drain some of the retained fluid from your feet and allow fluid to distribute through your body.For example, if your feet are swollen in the evening, recline on a sofa or bed with your feet on a pillow.
 If you find that your feet and ankles regularly retain fluid while you are sitting down or standing—for example, at work—you can purchase a pair of compression support stockings. These exert pressure on your feet and lower legs, and don’t allow fluid to build up in these areas.Support socks or tights are relatively common. You should be able to purchase a pair at your local drug store.

 It is extremely important that you set a stable base with your golf stance. Creating a stable base will give you a solid connection to the ground while also giving you a stable platform to rotate against. As you get into short irons and wedges, the stance should get a little less wide for more consistency.;
, The key to golf is consistency and the ground is the only thing that remains constant during your golf swing. In order to have a consistent swing you need to have your feet firmly planted on the ground.
 Aside from your hands and arms, during the golf swing your hips and shoulders should be the only parts of your body moving. A stable base will let you rotate and coil while still maintaining control of the resistance and power your are creating.
 This will make it easier for you to rotate your hips.
 Bend at the waist, not the back. It is very important that you bend from the waist properly. Bending from the waist will set your hips, back and shoulders all in a straight line. With these three sections of the body aligned, you can properly rotate your hips and shoulders along the same plane. If you bend from your back, your hips, back and shoulders will all be pointing in different directions, making it impossible to rotate consistently.
 Now stick out your butt. That is how you should be bending your body.
 Once you have set a solid base and are bending from waist, the only thing that is left to really do is flex your knees. You want to feel as though you are getting into a nice, athletic stance. With your knees slightly bent and flexed, you should feel like you have the ability to spring to the left or right.

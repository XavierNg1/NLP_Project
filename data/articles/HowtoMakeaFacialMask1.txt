 This mask works to reduce the appearance of pores with clay, which pulls dead skin cells and other pore-clogging debris away from your skin as it dries on your face. Go to a health food stores and get the following supplies:


Bentonite clay, which draws out impurities.
Oatmeal, which leaves your skin feeling baby soft.
Essential oil of your choice, such as peppermint or lemongrass, for an added sweet scent.;
, Place a tablespoon of Bentonite clay, a tablespoon of oatmeal and a tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Use a spoon or whisk to thoroughly mix the mask.









Add a few drops of essential oil if you want to feel the effects of aromatherapy as the mask works its magic.
Using the same ratio of ingredients, you can make a larger batch and store the unused mask in a jar with a tight-fitting lid for later use.
 Rub the mask lightly over your forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. Let it sit for 15 - 20 minutes, until it is completely dry.
 Splash lukewarm or cool water over your face to rinse away the clay. Blot your face dry with a soft towel and apply a moisturizer to finish.

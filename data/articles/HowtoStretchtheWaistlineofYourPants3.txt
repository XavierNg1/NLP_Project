 Pull your pants on as far as you can, ideally to the point where you can zip/button them up.


Laying down while buttoning/zipping your pants can also make them easier to get into.
 Using a spray bottle or similar, get the waistband of the pants thoroughly wet.
 Find a wooden hanger that’s at least larger than half your waistband’s size. Pull the waistband over both ends of the hanger.


Make sure the waist is stretched tightly across the hanger. If it isn’t, you’ll need to find a larger hanger to use.
 Keep the pants on the hanger until they’re thoroughly dry.
 If you need more stretch, repeat the previous steps using a larger hanger.

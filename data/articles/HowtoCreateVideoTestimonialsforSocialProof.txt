 Every time you finish working with a customer, make sure you ask for their video testimonial.


Have in place a reminder procedure to do a follow-up with your customers to ask them if they'd be willing to do such a testimonial.
Realize that not every person will agree to do this. Some people will be too busy, some too shy and some would like to preserve their privacy. On the other hand, other people will probably jump at the chance for a little online "fame".;
, Ask them to follow this pattern:


Transformation
Pains and problems; and
Recommendation (them recommending you, for instance).
 Do a few test runs without the camera.


If wished, you could also do a mock run with the camera and play it back for them to see how it comes across. This depends on how much time you have available and how willing the customer is to try this approach.
 Doing this will put them at ease when recording, as well as making the video more enjoyable to watch.
 It’s best to do after you film videos with them, especially if you’re working on a video project.
 Always remember to send a copy of the video to your client. They'll love to see how it came out and to have a copy of their own.


Ask ahead whether the client would prefer an email, a cloud-based transfer or a hard copy of the video testimonial. Remember that each client will have their own preference and ability to download and/or play the video.
 More happy clients means more amazing video testimonials!

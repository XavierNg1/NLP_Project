 Squaring a number means to raise it to the power of 2. To square a number, you simply multiply the number by itself., A basic calculator is a calculator that only has functions for the most basic operations, such as multiplying and dividing.This is the type of calculator you might use in elementary school. To find the square of a number using a basic calculator, type in the number, then the multiplication sign, then the number again, then the equal sign.

For example, to calculate 952{\displaystyle 95^{2}} on a basic calculator, you would type the following sequence:95{\displaystyle 95}Ã—{\displaystyle \times }95{\displaystyle 95}={\displaystyle =}You should see a result of 9025{\displaystyle 9025}.
 Scientific calculators are calculators that contain a variety of functions needed in upper level maths. Scientific calculators contain a key labeled x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}. Hitting this key will give you the square of a number. To use it, type in the number being squared, then hit the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} key.

For example, to calculate 752{\displaystyle 75^{2}} on a scientific calculator, you would type 75,x2{\displaystyle 75,x^{2}}. You should see a result of 5625{\displaystyle 5625}.

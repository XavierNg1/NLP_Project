 Use either rollers or a brush to paint the ceiling. Apply the paint in a W, X, or N shape in order to make sure that paint is applied in all directions. You will want to be sure to remove excess paint from the brush or roller before applying, since otherwise it will just drip into your face! Ew!


If the paint wonâ€™t go on your roller (because it is too thick), you can try putting it on a trowel or similar tool first, spreading it in the general area you wish it to go, and then switching to a roller to even the texture.
 Divide the ceiling into sections and complete the sections one at a time. These do not need to be formally divided. Painting the ceiling in sections will make it easier to make sure you get everything, keep you organized so you get done faster, and help keep you motivated.
 When you have painted the whole ceiling, make sure to let it dry completely before doing anything else (if any changes or additions need to be made). This usually takes a minimum of several hours. Adding more paint, texture, or touching the drying paint too much will pull the drying paint off and make your ceiling look uneven.


The ceiling will dry faster if you increase the air circulation in the room.

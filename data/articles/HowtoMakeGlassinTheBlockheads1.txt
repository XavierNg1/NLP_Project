 You can do this by hand but it's better to use a digging implement (currently a spade).


Sand is located in deserts and at the beach (where your land reaches the ocean).;
, If not, chop some wood. You only need one.
 Tap on the glass icon to start the crafting. This is the milky-white looking block in the slots.


One sand will make one block of glass. As already noted, you will also need one wood.
 The glass is done when the status bar stops filling.


The glass block will enter your inventory. If this does not happen, you'll need to make space for it.

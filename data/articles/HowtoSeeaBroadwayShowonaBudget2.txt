 If you want to see a show as a family, planning to do so during Kids Night On Broadway week is a great option. During this week, kids ages 6 to 18 can see a show for free when accompanied by a full-paying adult. Your first step is going to be to check the program's website (kidsnightonbroadway.com) for annual dates.
 Different shows participate on different nights, so make sure you buy your tickets through the Kids' Night website to get the discounts.

, Copy your receipt(s), GSP Plan contract, and signed cancellation letter, and keep them for your records.
 At present, the address is:AWG / GSP Plans
ATTN: Cancellations
P.O. Box 9312
Minneapolis, MN 55440-9312

, Watch for a refund applied to your credit card, if you are due one.


For plans already paid in full, you will receive a pro-rated refund for the time remaining on the GSP Plan, minus the amount for any services rendered. For instance, if you cancel after one year of a two-year plan, you will receive half of your payment amount back. If, however, you had a repair done, that can be deducted from your refund.
For plans that are paid monthly by credit card, you pay in advance for each month of service. Therefore, unless you happen to be right at the end of a payment cycle, your coverage will continue until the end of that cycle, then your GSP Plan will be cancelled.
You should receive a confirmation letter of cancellation. If your card is charged another monthly payment, any refund due does not appear on your credit card statement within 60 days, or you do not receive a confirmation letter within a reasonable period (perhaps 14 days), contact Geek Squad by phone at 1-800-433-5778.

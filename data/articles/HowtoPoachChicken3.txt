 Place 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) of butter into the pan, or spray the cooking spray on the pan. Let the butter melt.
 Pour 2 cups of milk or cream into the pan so that most of the chicken breast is covered. Let the milk or cream begin to boil.
 Only do this once the milk or cream has reach a boil. Let the breast(s)s poach, or boil, for an additional 20 minutes.


If there is a meat thermometer handy, poach until the internal temperature of the chicken is at 165 degrees.
 Make sure the juices are clear and the meat is whitish-gray.
 For a balanced meal, serve with a carb or starch (like pasta or potatoes) and a vegetable (like green beans).

 Then say "Sorry I really have to go; someone's at the door. Bye!"


You can also record the doorbell ringing if your phone is not wireless.;
, Then say that your home phone is ringing, and that you have to go.
 Say, "Hold on." And then yell, "It wasn't me! I didn't eat the last pizza slice, Nancy did!" or something like that. Pretend to bicker, then say "Sorry, I have to get off the phone. I've been sent to my room" or "I have to stop the kids/siblings from fighting."

, Then hang up.
 Say sorry, and then hang up. Of course, there is an unspoken expectation that you'll call back afterward, so this can be a rather rude way to ring off if you don't.

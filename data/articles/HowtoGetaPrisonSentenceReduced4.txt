 Many states have rehabilitation programs available that you can complete to reduce your sentence.


For example, states such as Florida and Washington have introduced alternative programs that provide employment assistance and counseling. Other states such as Vermont no longer sentence people convicted of misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies to prison, instead sentencing them to probation.In other states such as Pennsylvania and Washington, you may be able to reduce your prison sentence by completing rehabilitation or substance abuse programs or vocational training., If you complete RDAP you can succeed in getting your sentence reduced.


RDAP is a voluntary program for federal prisoners with substance abuse problems. After completion of the 9- to 12-month program your prison sentence can be reduced by up to one year if you were convicted of a non-violent crime.Generally, you are eligible for RDAP if you have a verifiable substance use disorder, are willing to participate in the program, and have at least 24 months remaining on your sentence.The federal Bureau of Prisons also has a 12-week nonresidential drug abuse treatment program available for inmates with shorter sentences so may not meet the criteria for RDAP., One of the most common ways to get your prison sentence reduced is to behave appropriately and follow all the rules while you are incarcerated.


Many states have instituted "earned time" or "good time" credits that allow lower-risk prisoners to be released early.

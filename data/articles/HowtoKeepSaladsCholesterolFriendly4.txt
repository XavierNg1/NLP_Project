 Fishes like tuna have healthy fats and low cholesterol, so make a flavorful and healthy topping to a salad. Begin your salad with a base of mixed greens (spinach, romaine, etc.), and top it with a 2- or 3-ounce portion of tuna. For additional flavor and textures, add about 2 tablespoons each of healthy grains including sunflower seeds, dried cherries or raisins.Dress your tuna salad with a balsamic vinaigrette, or lightly garnish it with an oil-based dressing.
 These low-fat fruits are also high in fiber, which will help keep your cholesterol levels low. To make this minimalist salad, cut up and combine 2 ½ cups of grapefruit with 1 ½ cups of green apples. If you would prefer not cut up the grapefruit—which could result in a large amount of liquid in the salad—try pulling the slices into finely “shredded” segments.Mix in 2 or 3 tablespoons of diced walnuts for added flavor, texture, and heart-friendly omega 3 fatty acids.
Serve the salad immediately. If you find it tastes under-seasoned, salt and pepper the salad to taste.
 Oils commonly used to dress salads include extra virgin olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, and flaxseed oil. Compared to thick, creamy salad dressings, these contain a higher percentage of healthy fats that help reduce cholesterol levels. They are still high-fat foods, so use a small amount with other flavorful ingredients. For example, mix ½ cup of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon of paprika, 1/8 teaspoon of dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon of sugar.Combine all of these ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat together until well blended. The liquid ingredients may separate, so be sure to shake the dressing well before serving.

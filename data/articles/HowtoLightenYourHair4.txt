 For the most effective lightening, use hydrogen peroxide 3% solution, which is available at most drugstores. Mix 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 1 part water in a spray bottle, and shake well to mix it.Using a stronger concentration of hydrogen peroxide may damage your hair.
 Before applying the hydrogen peroxide mixture, detangle it with a comb or brush. Next, divide your hair into sections with clips so you can make sure to apply the solution to all of your hair., Once your hair is sectioned, mist the mixture all over your hair as evenly as possible for all over lightening. If you want to create highlights, wet a cotton ball or pad with the hydrogen peroxide solution and rub it along the strands you want to lighten., When the hydrogen peroxide solution is applied the way that you like, let it sit on your hair depending on how light you’d like your hair to be. For average lightening, 30 minutes is a good amount of time. Leaving it on longer may dry out your hair.If you want to speed up the lightening process, sit outside in the sun with the hydrogen peroxide solution on your hair. When your hair starts to dry, you can wash the solution out.
  Once your hair reaches the desired color, wash the hydrogen peroxide out of your hair with cold water. Apply your favorite conditioner to hydrate it, and rinse it again with additional cold water. Allow your hair to air dry.

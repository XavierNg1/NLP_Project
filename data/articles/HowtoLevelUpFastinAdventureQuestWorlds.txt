,, You can get one from the Wheel of Doom or buy one with 150 Adventure Coins. The choice is completely yours.
, If you own 300 ACs then you can afford the 'Chaorrupter locked' weapon from /join chaoswar; this weapon doubles your damage against Chaos Monsters only.


The Ultra Chaos Warrior, who has 119,662 HP, gives you 5,000 XP. With the XP boost, you can get 10,000 XP per kill!

, If you can't find a good team, or the Ultra Chaos Warrior is too strong for you, then try the normal Chaos Warrior. He has 69,330 HP. He can be soloed (killed by you alone.) He gives you 1000 XP. With the boosts, 2000 XP.


In either cases, you can reach your goal in no time!

 Baskets are generally smaller in size, and while this might suit smaller dogs, it's unlikely a medium to large sized dog will be able to fit in a basket. In this case, you might consider using an old, unwanted suitcase instead.


Baskets and suitcases both can be found for relatively little cost at garage sales, thrift stores, and secondhand stores.Remember to account for the sleeping style of your pet. If you notice that your dog moves a lot in its sleep, you may want to buy your basket/suitcase a size larger than necessary. This way, your pet has room to move around.
 Since most suitcases hinge at the middle and open into two hollow sections, you may want to use a utility knife, shears, or other tools to remove one side of the suitcase to create a single hollow spot for your dog bed. Baskets often have handles, and you may want to remove these to make it easier for your pet to get in and out of the bed.Sometimes, cutting free previously connected parts of your basket/suitcase can leave sharp edges behind. To prevent your pet from getting poked or cut, you may want to file these down.
 You can use old throw pillows, unwanted bed pillows, leftover padding, blankets, and so on to add to the comfort of this kind of dog bed. Layer your padding, whatever it may be, evenly and completely along the bottom of the suitcase.Padding materials, like throw pillows, can generally be found and bought for cheap at thrift stores and secondhand stores.
 Over time, the wear and tear of your dog sleeping in this bed will cause your padding material to break down. You can prolong the life of this padding by covering it in an unwanted sheet or towel and tucking the edges of the covering into the sides of the suitcase or basket.


This covering also provides a uniform outside for the bedding. This means that even when your pet jumps in or out of the bed, or even if it has dreams and runs in its sleep, it's less likely to push the padding around and cause it to bunch up.

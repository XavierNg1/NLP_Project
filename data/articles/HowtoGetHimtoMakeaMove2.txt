 Flirting helps him realize you’re interested. More importantly, it’s an invitation for him to comfortably make a move that won’t meet rejection. Help him to see the friendship could be something deeper. Generally, flirting is done via body language, gestures, posture, or verbalization.


If you are sitting next to each other, flirt with your eyes. Look him in the eyes and smile. Keep eye contact for a bit longer than normal.
Mimic his body movement. Lean closer when he leans in. Smile when he smiles.
Lick your lips. If you see him looking at your lips, lick them nonchalantly. Don’t do this a lot. You want to be somewhat suggestive, not compulsive.
When you catch him looking at you, smile a little and look down. Then look back up at him, smiling coquettishly the entire time.Play with your hair. Natural grooming movements are often performed by both sexes when trying to impress., Show him you’re cool with being touched gently, and you won’t flinch or back away. Allow him to touch you. Without it going beyond your physical contact comfort level, don’t push him away if he tries to get a little frisky.Hug him back. If he comes in for a hug, invite it happily, and be sure he’s the first one to let go.
Play with his hair. When you see a strand or two out of place, reach up and gently swipe them.
Use discretion, or it may be very off-putting.
 Find reasons to say things to make him smile or feel confident. Try a few of the following options:


Hook his arm and say, “Look how little my arm is next to yours!”
Touch his hair and tell him, “Your hair is so cute this way.”
”I could stare into your baby-blues for hours.”

 Towards the end of life, your dog may require more cushioning and warmth due to weight loss or aches and pains.To enhance your dog’s comfort, you can:


Add some extra cushioning to his bed. You can do this by adding an extra blanket or two to his bed, or by getting an extra cushy dog bed for him.
Place his bed in a warm spot, such as near a heating vent, or get a small space heater to increase the temperature where your dog normally sleeps.
Get him a dog sweater for going outdoors, or just to wear on chilly days around the house.
 To help him feel more comfortable while he is resting, try placing one or more of these toys near him.


For example, if your dog absolutely loves his stuffed rabbit, then place the stuffed rabbit next to him in his bed.
 Towards the end of your dog’s life, some daily activities may be harder than they once were. Your dog may have trouble doing things like getting into a car, going up and down stairs, or even going to the bathroom. To make things easier for your dog, you can:


Provide a ramp to help him go upstairs, get into a car, or get up on the sofa.
Place puppy pads around in case your dog can’t make it outside in time to go potty.
Get a raised food and water bowl if your dog has a hard time bending over to eat.

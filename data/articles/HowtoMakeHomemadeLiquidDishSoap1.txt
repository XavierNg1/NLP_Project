 Add 2 cups (470 ml) of water and ¼ cup (9 g) of soap flakes to a medium sauce pan. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together so the soap is mixed throughout the water.Soap flakes are usually sold in the laundry aisle at grocery stores.
You can substitute soap shavings for store-bought flakes if you prefer.;
, Place the saucepan with the water and soap on the stove. Allow the mixture to slowly heat on medium until the soap melts completely, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. When all of the soap has melted, remove the pan from the stove and allow the mixture to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.Do not allow the mixture to come to a boil on the stove. If it starts to boil, reduce the heat.
Stirring the mixture as it heats can help the soap melt more quickly.
 Once the soap and water mixture has cooled for several minutes, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the pan. Stir well to ensure that the vinegar is fully incorporated.You can substitute fresh lemon juice for the vinegar if you prefer. Both will help cut grease when you’re washing dishes.
The amount of vinegar you should add to the soap depends on how thick the mixture is. If it is extremely thick, add approximately 2 tablespoons (30 ml) to help loosen it up. If the soap mixture is already liquidy, just add approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml).
 Allow the soap to sit in the pot until it is completely cooled, which may take 15 to 20 minutes. Next, pour the soap into a soap dispenser or pump bottle, and place beside your kitchen sink.It’s often easier to transfer the soap from the pan to the dispenser with a funnel.

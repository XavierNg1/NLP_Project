 Be sure it is full but not overly full. Inflate it 3/4 of the way full.
 Twist the neck several times so it is well sealed. Stretch out the balloon with one hand. Wrap a rubber band around the neck, and tuck it into the other end of the rubber band. Pull the longer end tight.This knot is called a lark's head knot. The goal is to use the rubber band as a tightening agent.
For increased support, you could tie the rubber band as well. This could be just as challenging to untie as a regular balloon's knot.
 One of the easier ways of deflating your balloon without popping it is to use a twist tie. Simply hold the neck tight with one hand, and then begin securing the neck with a twist tie.
 Do the same process as above, only this time secure the balloon with a clothespin. Be sure the clothespin is fresh and sturdy, or else it might not hold the air well.
 Have a few strips of tape ready to be used. Grip the neck of the inflated balloon with one hand. Then tape off the ends using your strips.


Use scotch tape for the best results.

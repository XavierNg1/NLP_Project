 This is one of the easiest methods of folding shirts. It's best to use on short-sleeve shirts, but can also be used for long sleeved shirts. Start by placing the shirt face up on a flat surface.









Fold in half vertically with the arms together.
Fold the arms back onto shirt.
Fold horizontally, so that the hem of the shirt touches the neck.
Flatten the shirt. This is optional but it will make the shirt neater.;
, This one takes a little practice to get right, but it makes it easier to tell which shirt is which (especially if you have lots that look similar).









Begin by holding the shirt by the shoulders between forefinger and thumb in front of you.
Using your excess fingers, fold the sleeves back.
Fold the shirt in half, horizontally, so that the hem touches the neck.
Smooth.

 If you are experiencing tooth pain, clove oil may help. Clove oil contains eugenol, a substance believed to cause the pain relieving effects found in clove oil. Eugenol has the added benefit of having antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, antifungal, and anti-oxidant properties.


Eugenol is similar to NSAID pain relievers due to the similarity in their properties. Researchers believe eugenol reduces pain by preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins, which is a substance also in NSAIDs.It is so effective that dentistsâ€™ offices use it as a local anesthetic when giving temporary fillings., Although clove oil is typically considered safe, some people may be allergic to it. During dental visits, there have been some recorded cases of gum irritation and complications linked to the use of eugenol.Also, the FDA has reclassified the eugenol as a standalone substance as a Category III substance, which means there has not been enough evidence to prove its use.When used at home, avoid ingesting too much. Ingestion of clove oil in large amounts has been linked to respiratory and liver problems.Clove oil and fresh cloves are safe for use for anyone older than two years.
If you are on blood thinners or are diabetic, ask your doctor before using any home remedy with cloves., At the first sign of tooth pain, call your dentist. Even if you think it is something small, you should always have your dentist look at your tooth if it is in pain. Some tooth pain may be small and not last very long, but it may be something more serious. This is why you need a professional opinion for proper diagnosis and additional treatment.


While you are waiting to see your dentist, you can use clove oil to help dull the pain.

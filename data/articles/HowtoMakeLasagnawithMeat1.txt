 In a large skillet, add the ground beef and sausage and cook on medium heat until lightly browned.


Drain most of the fat from the pan, leaving some behind for flavor.;
, In a large bowl, beat the eggs and then add the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese, garlic powder, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix all of the ingredients together.


Set the remaining mozzarella cheese aside for later.
 Spread the mixture out evenly to form a smooth layer. Cover the meat sauce with one layer of uncooked noodles (about 3).
 Make sure to form an even layer that covers the entire dish.
 Then add an additional layer of noodles and top it with the remaining meat sauce.
 Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 45 minutes.
 Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes, or until the noodles are tender.


Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving.

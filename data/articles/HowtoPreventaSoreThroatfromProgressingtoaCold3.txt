 Know that not all sore throats come from colds, and often you cannot prevent them from developing. If the sore throat is due to a viral infection, then you cannot stop its progress by treating it with antibiotics.
 Go to your doctor to find out what is causing your sore throat. Your doctor will use a lighted instrument to assess the status of the throat, along with the ears and nasal passages. Palpation of the neck is also done to evaluate presence of swollen lymph nodes. Breathing patterns are also checked through the use of a special instrument, the stethoscope.
 To find out if you have a bacterial infection, ask your doctor for a throat swab. Specimen samples are taken at the back of the throat using a sterile cotton swab. They are then brought to the laboratory for proper analysis and identification of streptococcal bacteria.


Results of the procedure are usually available within a few minutes after the collection of the specimen.
Positive results can denote a bacterial infection while a negative result may mean a viral infection.
 A blood sample can be obtained to measure the count of various kinds of blood cells. This can help determine what kind of blood cells are elevated, normal, or below average levels, and reveal whether the infection is due to bacteria or a virus.
 Sore throats can be caused by allergic reactions. Get an allergy panel done to see if the cause of your sore throat is allergies. Allergy cases are typically referred to a specialist for further evaluation and proper management.

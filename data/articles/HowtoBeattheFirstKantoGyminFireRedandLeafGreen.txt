 It is Brock, so you must be prepared for a Geodude and Onix.;
, Is it only your starter? If you chose Charmander, you either will want to train another Pok√©mon to help, or train Charmander to lv.14 where it learns Metal Claw. Pidgey and Ratatta will be no help, so you might want to try a bug like Butterfree that you can evolve at an early level. If you have Bulbasaur or Squirtle, this gym will be a breeze.
, If you have any starter but Charmander, don't bother with status reducing moves {i.e. growl, leer}. Absorb and Water Gun should one-hit-KO the Geodude. With his Onix, now try Leer to lower the defense of the Onix, then come in for the kill.

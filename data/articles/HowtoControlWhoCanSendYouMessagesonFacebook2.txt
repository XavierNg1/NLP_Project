 You can no longer filter who can send you messages. Instead, you can add annoying users to your block list, which will prevent future messages from them. This is the only way to control who can send you messages.
 This will open the Facebook app's menu.
 This will open a new menu allowing you to control who can contact you.
 A field will appear where you can enter in a user's name.
 This will open a list of users who match the name you've entered.
 You will no longer receive messages from that user, and they will no longer before able to see your Facebook posts.
 You can change your privacy settings so that you can only receive friend requests from friends of friends instead of everyone:


Return to the "Privacy Shortcuts" menu.
Tap "Who can contact me?"
Tap "Everyone" and then select "Friends of Friends."

 All you need to do a sand swirl drywall texture is a wide brush, about 7 inches (17.8Â cm) long.You can replace the drywall compound with a mixture known as perlite, which is primer with sand mixed in. The fine grit of the sand adds another dimension to this texture.If you choose to do swirls with just the drywall compound, you may need to thin it out a little more to get even swirls., To get the right effect from this texture, load the brush and wipe away any excess compound. You don't want your brush to have so much compound that it drips on your wall.Don't hold the brush by the handle. Grip the brush so that your hand is actually touching the bristles. This will give you better control when making the swirl pattern., Start at one end of the wall and work your way over in a horizontal line. Place your brush several inches below the ceiling and make a half-moon shape.When you start the next swirl, place your brush on the spot where your half-moon ended. This will create a nice overlapping effect.Work your way down the wall. The top of each swirl should cover the bottom of the row above it, so that all the swirls overlap.Practice your technique on some scrap cardboard or drywall before attempting the texture on your wall., Once the compound or perlite has dried, add another coat of primer. Let the primer dry and then paint the room as normal.

 You’ll have the most success on Craigslist if you search through the most affluent areas near your location. Make sure you see plenty of good quality photographs of any pieces you’re thinking of purchasing.Have the seller agree to let you inspect the piece before you finalize the purchase.
If you don’t own a large enough vehicle, you can rent a truck from a home improvement or rental agency to transport the piece. Have a friend or family member help you pick up the item.
 You’re more likely to score a quality piece of furniture at a thrift store now more than ever. As older generations downsize, secondhand stores have become filled with good inventory. Some pieces might need a little attention, but painting or refinishing a worn chest or desk is an easy fix., Look online for local estate or yard sales, especially those that are held in more affluent areas. You’re likely to find high quality brands at estate sales for less than half of what you’d pay retail.Most estate sales reduce prices by up to 50 percent on the last day. The best pieces typically sell on the first day, but keep in mind first days can be hectic and competitive.
Be sure to bargain at estate and yard sales, especially on the last day of a sale.
 Look for local flea markets online and, again, try to locate nearby markets in more affluent areas. You can find new or gently used pieces at prices lower than retail. If you're an antique lover, you might find a nice, affordable vintage piece as well.
 You usually don’t have to pay much or anything at all for hand-me-downs from loved ones. Make it known throughout your social circle that you’re on the hunt for affordable furniture. You might have a friend or family member who has a piece they’re trying to unload.

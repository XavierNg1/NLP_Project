 While command training can be an effective way to modify behavior, social training is the foundation of preventing barking problems. If you have a puppy, start introducing it to children, other animals, your neighbors, and other new sights and smells as soon as possible.Get your dog used to your neighbor by making a good introduction. Have your neighbor give your dog a treat when it stops barking, and do so regularly if necessary. If your dog knows command words, have your neighbor tell your dog to sit and offer a treat when it follows the command.
 Both command and social training take time and repetition. Make sure everyone in your household knows what specific command words your dog understands. Have everyone give command words with the same tone of voice.Make sure no one encourages your dog to bark by saying things like, “Who’s that?!” or getting up to look out the window.Remember to avoid yelling at your dog when it barks, unless you’re clearly and firmly saying a command word it understands. If you say “No!” or yell, your dog might think that you’re barking, too, which will reinforce the noisy behavior., If your dog isn’t responding to command or social training, consider enrolling it in obedience classes or getting it a private trainer or a veterinary behaviorist. Ask your dog-owning friends and family or your dog’s vet for a referral.Look for a board Certified Veterinary Behaviorist or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). When choosing a trainer, check their websites to identify their certifications. Look for reviews online, and ask trainers if they have any current clients who can offer testimonials.

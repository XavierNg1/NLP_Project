 Water is the only known compound that can be found as a solid, liquid, and gas under the earthâ€™s natural conditions. This allows for the circulation of water around our planet via the water cycle. Liquid water can evaporate and rise, water vapor can condense and fall back to earth, and water accumulates as ice in the coldest parts of our planet (the polar ice caps)., Most liquids become denser (their volume shrinks) when they freeze into a solid form. Water is an exception. When water freezes, it expands. This allows frozen water (ice) to float on top of liquid water.This is also why a bottle of water (or other drink primarily made of water) will often burst if left in the freezer.
 As a solid, water has a fixed crystal shape. Most of the time, though, we think of water in its liquid form. Fluids (liquids and gases) have no defined shape and will conform to fit the shape of their vessel. The main difference between the shape of a liquid and a gas is that gases expand to fill the entire container and liquids are held closer together by intermolecular forces., Roughly seventy percent of the earth is covered in water. Water makes up more than half of the human body, and some organisms are as much as ninety percent water. There is no known organism that can survive without water.

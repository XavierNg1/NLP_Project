 Most calculators have an alternate function button for multiple different calculations, often labeled "Math". Pressing it should bring up a menu.
 Doing so should either pull up the formula or display the words nDeriv(., If the full formula appears, fill in the blanks as normal. If only nDeriv( appears, input the function in the form (function,variable,point)., The derivative will be calculated at the point. Note this only works for single variables., Most calculators have an alternate function button for multiple different calculations, often labeled "Math". Pressing it should bring up a menu., Depending on the current version of the calculator, either the full formula will appear or the operator fnInt( will appear., If the formula appears, input it how you normally would. If only fnInt( appears, input the function in the form (function, variable, lower limit, upper limit)., The derivative will be calculated at the point. Note this only works for single variables, and will assume all non specified variables to be a constant., This will bring up the graph equation editor., Wait for the graph to fully load. Note the equation editor only accepts inputs in the form Y=f(x) when dealing with functions., Scroll over the operation you are attempting to use. For derivatives, go to dy/dx. For integrals use (integrand)f(x)dx., There will be a bar at the bottom of your screen reading your inputs before they are confirmed.

 The longer it takes to get to your candy, the harder it will be to find. For example, your sock drawer may not be a good idea. All someone has to do is open up the drawer and see the candy. A better idea would be inside one of your socks. This way, whoever opens up your sock drawer won't be able to see your candy right away—they will have to dig through your socks first.;
, Similar to hiding your candy in layers, the longer it takes to get to your candy, the less likely someone will find it. Great places include under your clothes in a drawer, far under your bed, in a box at the very top of your shelf, and so forth.
 The saying "don't put all of your eggs into one basket" exists for a reason. If you hide all of your candy in one spot, and someone finds it, you might end up with no candy. Try to hide your candy in at least two different places.


Don't hide your candy too close together. For example, if you have some candy tucked away into your socks in one drawer, don't hide the rest of your candy in the next drawer.
 This includes next to windows, near heaters, or close to lights. The reason for this is simple: candy melts if it gets hot. A good hiding place won't be of much use to you if you can't eat the candy later on. Not to mention, melted candy can create a mess, and messes attract attention.
 Lockers, safes, and piggy banks are all popular hiding places—and this means that they are obvious hiding places. Shoe boxes that say "TOP SECRET" or "KEEP OUT" are also bad choices, because they draw attention and curiosity. Your friends and siblings would be more likely to go through these boxes.

 You could cut it curved or straight, however you prefer.
 Glue or staple gun handles on each side of the top of the water bottle. Suitable handle ideas include:


Leather or fabric straps
Plaited twine or sisal
Rubber lengths
Braided fabric
Old belts
Anything else you can find around the house.
 The base of the bag should be wide enough for the bottle to reach over from the bag back to the front, as a “lid”. Place a bag clasp into the portion of the bottle that was once the top. It’s quirky and will require some daring experimentation but it can look very different when done!


In some versions of this bag, old military truck tarp was used as the back and sides of the bag.

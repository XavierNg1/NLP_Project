 Hockey skates are made to be tough and form to your foot and ankle and to add support to your skating. Remember that hockey skates should fit tightly to reduce movement while you are on the ice. A general rule to consider when buying a new pair of skates, is to wear the socks that you will wear while on the ice. Hockey skates generally run a size to a size and a half smaller than your shoe size.;
, Make sure that they fit well and don't wobble or buckle when you skate.
 Do not keep your blades straight when you push. Try turning them to the side so you have more surface area pushing you ahead.
 Squat as you skate, bending your knees as though sitting in a chairâ€”this will cause your legs to get more of a stride helping you go faster. Also, you will survive a check better.
 Think about the positioning of your feet. Try to keep them shoulder length apart.
 Leaning back will cause you to place your weight towards the back of you, causing you to fall.
 Your body tends to go where your eyes go, so keep your eyes pointing in the direction you want to go.
 This will help you a lot, especially if you play defense. If you don't know how, start by pushing off the boards backwards. Once you get the feel try skating backwards, making an "S" motion with your skates.
 Hockey is about 85 percent skating. Skate hard and stop hard.

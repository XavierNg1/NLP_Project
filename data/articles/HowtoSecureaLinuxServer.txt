 Every layer of software added on to make your system administration "easier" actually adds more methods for crackers to gain access to your machine and also reduces performance. All the further steps will assume your familiarity with using a shell.;
,, Shut down any unknown or unneeded services, using the appropriate tools for your Linux distribution, such as update-rc.d on Debian systems, or in some cases editing the /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.d/* files. Along with this, get rid of any tools your server provider added for system administration, such as Plesk.
 Set up a secondary port for root access that only works by shared keys, disallowing passwords:

Copy the sshd_config file to root_sshd_config, and change the following items in the new file:


Port from 22 to some other number, say 8899 (don't use this! make up your own!)

PermitRootLogin from "no" (you were supposed to set it to "no" for port 22, remember?) to "yes"

AllowUsers root add this line, or if it exists, change it to allow only root logins on this port

Challenge Response Authentication no uncomment this line if it's commented out, and make sure it says "no" instead of "yes"


Test this command: 
sshd -D -f /etc/ssh/root_sshd_config and see if it works correctly -- try logging in from another computer (you must have already set up shared-key authentication between the two computers) using: 
ssh -p8899 root@my.remote.serverand if so, control-C at the above (sshd) command to stop the sshd daemon, then add this to the end of /etc/inittab: 
rssh:2345:respawn:sshd -D -f /etc/ssh/root_sshd_config

Restart the init task: # init q This will run your "root ssh daemon" as a background task, automatically restarting it in case of failure.

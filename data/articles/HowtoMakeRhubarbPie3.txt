 The pie actually cooks at 375ºF, so the oven needs to be turned down once it goes in the oven. However, this moment of opening the oven and putting in a cold pie quickly sucks heat away, meaning the pie starts closer to 375ºF if you actually start the oven at 400º., If the dough sticks to the rolling pin, sprinkle a little flour on this as well., It is almost impossible to pick up and place a piece of thin pie dough without ripping it. However, by "wrapping" it around the rolling pin you can slowly unroll it over the pie tin, placing it perfectly every time., When done, use a knife of clean kitchen shears to cut the dough until you only have 1" overhanging.


Though not necessary, you can use the tines of a fork to press the edge of the crust into the rim of the pan, making decorative ridges on the edge., It doesn't matter which one you made, they both cook at the same speed and rate. Spread the filling evenly in the dish with a fork.
 If you used the crumb topping, simply spread it evenly over the entire pie. If you want a traditional crust, simply roll it out just like you did the bottom, lay it over the top and press in the edges, then cut away any excess.


If you do a crust topping, cut 4-5 slits in the center to allow steam to escape.
Feeling really creative -- try cutting the top crust into a lattice.
 Don't forget to turn the heat down when the pie hits the oven -- as 400ºF will dry it out. The pie is done when the top (either one) is a gorgeous golden brown and the edges of the pie are well cooked.


There should be bits of pink juice starting to poke out when done.
If the outside of the pie cooks too quickly, and the center is still yellow, you can quickly remove the pie and cover the edges with strips of tin foil, which will prevent them from burning.

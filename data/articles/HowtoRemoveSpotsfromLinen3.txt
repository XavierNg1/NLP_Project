 Apply fresh lemon juice to the stain and sprinkle salt over top. Let the linens sit in the sun for several hours before washing. Check on it periodically to make sure the stain is beginning to fade. If it is not, add more juice and salt. Be careful on bright, sunny days because the sun could lighten your linen items very quickly. Set a timer to check on the progress so that you don't end up with splotchy fabric.
For difficult stains, repeat this process several times. Wash the fabric in between repetitions.
For large stains or dingy white tablecloths for example, combine lemon juice and dissolved salt in a spray bottle and lightly spray the whole thing. Let it sit in the sun laid out flat so that the effect is uniform.
 Make a baking soda paste with 4 tablespoons (59.1Â ml) of baking soda mixed with equal amounts water. Mix and apply gently so you don't rub the paste into the stain. After the paste has dried and sat for about 15 to 30 minutes, scrape off any excess paste before washing the linens normally., Oils stains are some of the most difficult to get out of fabrics. Sprinkle cornstarch on the stain and waiting 15 minutes for it to set. Then, scrape the starch off. Wash the linens in a sink bath with some dish washing soap or in the washing machine at a gentle cycle.Don't coat the stain in too much cornstarch. You only need a small coating to absorb the stain. You can reapply another coat after the first one if the stain persists.
If you need to rinse the cornstarch out, use cool water to keep the stain from sticking around.

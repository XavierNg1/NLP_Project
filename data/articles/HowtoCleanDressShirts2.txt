 If you have an accident or spill, it is important to act quickly! Grab a brush, washcloth, or paper towel and try to carefully flick off any large pieces or chunks, without smashing the stain into the shirt. Then use a clean paper towel or washcloth to gently blot up any excess liquid., You are going to need a stain solvent to treat the stain. You can use a store-bought product, such as a spray (like Shout) or a stain-remover pen (like a Tide Pen). Or you can use household items like lemon juice, vinegar, or seltzer water. Grab whatever stain solvent you have ready-to-hand., Spray or carefully dab the solvent you've chosen directly onto the stain. You want to saturate the stain area without putting any pressure on the fabric. Be very careful not to press the stain into the shirt, as this will make it more difficult to remove. Wait 1-3 minutes., After you've waited for just a few minutes (no more than 3), run the stain under cold water. Allow the running water to lift out the stain and the solvent. Once again, do not wring or press the stain into the fabric. If you can still see the stain, repeat this process from the beginning.

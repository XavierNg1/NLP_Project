 If a system comes to mindâ€”bills in one drawer, tax information in another, et cetera-make notes on a pad of paper.;
, If you already have files set up, write down the names of the files and their contents.
 Start sorting the papers into piles according to how you would like them organized: credit card bills in one pile, expense reports in another, and so on. This is a good time to set aside out-of-date items for storage or shredding.
, For work files, you might want a file for each project or department; for personal files, you might separate them according to type of bill. Keep in mind that you may want to sub-organize items by month or year.
 Put each drawer on a separate page. On the left side of the page, list "category" files; these are usually hanging folders. On the right side of the page, list the individual files you want in each category; these are usually manila folders. For example, a hanging file labeled "Credit Card Bills" might contain folders labeled "MasterCard," "Visa," and "Gas Card," or you might have files labeled "Bills 2005," "Bills 2004," and so on.
 A series of hanging files combined with manila files, all clearly labeled, is a great way to organize any file system. Go to an office supply store and pick up the appropriate size files along with your choice of file folder labels.
 Apply the labels to the hanging folders and manila file folders.
 Now empty all your old files and put the paperwork in the appropriate places. Do the same for any loose paperwork.
 Now you're finished!

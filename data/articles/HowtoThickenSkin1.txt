 For best results, use a moisturizer that contains ingredients such as vitamins C, A, E and beta-carotene. Moisturizers that contain retin-A (an acidic form of vitamin A) can be used on the skin to encourage the multiplication of cells. Retin-A products are available in the form of serums, ointments and creams.;
, Prick a capsule containing vitamin E and squeeze its contents into your hands, before applying to the skin. Vitamin E helps to thicken the skin, especially when it is applied topically.
 Wear sunscreen daily, especially in areas that are very hot during the summer. Try to wear an SPF of at least 15 (or higher if you have particularly pale or sensitive skin), even if it's a cloudy day, as UV rays from the sun can penetrate the clouds.
 If possible, avoid using steroid creams on the skin, as these can have a thinning effect. Talk to your doctor if you have been prescribed a steroid cream to treat an underlying skin condition like eczema. A dermatologist can usually prescribe alternative topical treatments that do not contain steroids.
 This helps the skin to thicken when used regularly.

The salve should be kept refrigerated between uses.

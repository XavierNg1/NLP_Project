Depending on your product’s application method, spray it onto the sink or apply it with a cloth. Then use a microfiber towel to buff all of the sink’s surfaces.Apply a copper wax or protectant every six weeks or whenever water no longer beads on its surface.
Aside from products specially labelled for copper, you can also buff your sink with carnauba wax to preserve its brilliance., If your copper sink is hammered or has a patina, there’s no need to worry about dings or dents from washing dishes, pots, and pans.

Place a sink grid or mat down when you wash dishware, and dry wares in a countertop drying rack.

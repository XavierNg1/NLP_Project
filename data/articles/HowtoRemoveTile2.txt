 Safety glasses and leather gloves are essential to avoid sharp edges as they fly off your walls. Lay drop cloths around the room to avoid mess and damage to the area.
 If your tiles are small, this will take a long time. Dig the point of the scraper into the grout to loosen it.
 It should be easier to start with weak spots and attempt to dislodge several tiles at once.
 If they donâ€™t pop out, wedge the putty knife into the top of the tile and hit the end with a mallet to drive it under the adhesive.
 Then, scrape your putty knife horizontally across the remaining chunks of tile and adhesive to loosen them. Patch holes in the sheetrock with patching compound and drywall mesh tape.
 You can cut through the drywall with a reciprocating saw and remove the tile along with the wall. Install a new piece of drywall when the area is free of tile.

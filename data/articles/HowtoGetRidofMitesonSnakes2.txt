 Make sure to put these items outside of your house., Soak all of the cage decorations and the inside of the cage with it. You can also purchase reptile specific cleaners. Soak the items for at least 20 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Keep rinsing until all of the bleach scent is gone., But use paper towels as the substrate, as you can see if the snake still has mites and if you need to repeat the cleaning processes.

 This will allow enough space on top of the cupcakes for the fingers to be attached, so that they appear as life-life as possible. If you would prefer smaller cupcakes, that's okay but the rising fingers won't be as realistic.


You can even use metal pie dishes to get the size right for these cupcakes.;
, Chocolate frosting is best because it looks like the dirt of the ground the zombies will be rising out of. Dust thickly using cocoa. This is just more "soil".
 Roll the marzipan to the same thickness and length as your own fingers (an easy guide to follow). Pinch them in a bit more though––zombies have been stuck in the ground for a while and things have shrunk. You're after a "spindly" look to these fingers. And don't forget the shorter, broader thumb for each hand.


Some fingers should be a little bent over, to give the impression of grasping their way out of the soil, while other fingers can be reaching for the sky.
Score some of the back of the fingers with a knife, to give the impression of knuckles.
Make as many fingers as needed for four fingers and one thumb per cupcake.
 This will help the fingers to stand upright when inserted into the cake.
 Make an edible glue paste using water to which you've added a little sugar. Or use plain frosting. Glue each almond flake to the top of each finger to make the fingernails.
 Space evenly to make it realistic. The thumb should be around the corner of the fingers, as is the case on your own hand.
 Done.

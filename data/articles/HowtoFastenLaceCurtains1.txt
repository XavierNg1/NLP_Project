 These are also known as "invisible" hairpins; they have large bends and small beaded tips. The benefit of these hairpins is that they are sharp and fine, making them easy to push through the fabric without damaging it, whilst remaining invisible to the eye.;
, Use about 3cm (1.5") of fabric to make the fold over the rod.


It can help if you use sewing pins temporarily to keep the folded over lace in place while you work; remove the pins as you go.
 Face the rounded head at the top, the beaded ends hanging down. Be sure to catch both sides of the looped lace fabric.
 Pin at even intervals, to ensure adequate coverage and a strong hold.
 When you reach the other end, hang the curtain rod and curtain back up.

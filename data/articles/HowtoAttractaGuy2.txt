 Taking showers regularly and keeping up on your appearance is the first step to showing the world you're interested in it.


Deodorant and toothpaste do great things for unwanted scents. Applying deodorant every day and brushing your teeth after each meal will ensure that you're always looking and feeling fresh and clean.
Light make-up will enhance your best features. Make sure not to go too overboard; most men prefer a more natural look. Too much make-up says you're not beautiful without it--which clearly isn't true!

, Whatever you feel best in looks best on you. Whether it's dresses, t-shirts, or leather cowboy boots, your clothes are a symbol of you.


Don't try to fit in with a certain look. You want to attract guys that like you--not who you are trying to be.
Dress for the occasion. It may be tempting to wear sweatpants to your cousin's bar mitzvah, but negative attention is not what you want.

 To accommodate nut allergies, you’ll need to ask the caterer to serve an entrée that does not contain nuts. While this is relatively simple, the entrees for guests with nut allergies will need to be prepared and plated separately. Stress to the wait staff the importance of keeping these dishes completely separate from any meals or food supplies that have contacted or contain nuts.Nut allergies can be very serious; individuals allergic to nuts can have severe allergic reactions, and nut allergies are occasionally fatal. Unlike some other dietary preferences, there can be serious consequences for not accommodating a nut allergy.
 If you have kosher guests coming to the wedding, you’ll need to provide at least one kosher side or main dish. Coordinate this with the reception caterer, or the family members preparing the food.

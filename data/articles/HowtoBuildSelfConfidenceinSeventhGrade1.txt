 The most important step towards building self-confidence is realizing that it needs to come from within you. While outside support and praise are wonderful, you cannot rely on others, even parents, coaches, or friends, to give you self-esteem. You need to acknowledge your own self-worth and not depend on others to make you feel worthy.This also means that you should avoid comparing yourself to other people. Everyone is unique, so there’s no reason to judge yourself according to someone else.;
, Mistakes may feel like the end of the world at times, but they’re an absolutely essential part of learning and growing up. If you get something wrong, simply approach it as an important part of the process of getting it right. In this light, failure can actually build your confidence instead of harm it.The truth is, no one is successful all the time. Commit yourself to making a serious effort rather than to trying to get it perfect. Then, you can always be confident that you’ve tried your best., If you’re feeling negative about yourself or your abilities, take time to reflect on what you like about yourself and do well. Make a list of your strengths and things that you appreciate about yourself, anything from your singing voice to your consideration for friends to your knack for acing science labs.Write down as many things as you can. Challenge yourself to list at least five things, and add one thing to the list each week.
The goal of this exercise is to focus on your strengths instead of on your weaknesses. When you take time to acknowledge the things that you’re good at, it will help you recognize and give yourself credit for those things in your daily life.

 While standing, hold the sheet horizontally in front of you. Fold the sheet widthwise until it is the proper length. It should cover from your armpits to your legs. How much, or little, of your legs you cover, depends on what you want.
 Holding the folded sheet horizontally behind you, first wrap one side around your chest and then the other side - like a towel.
 Spend some time smoothing the layers and folds. Then pin your wrapped toga in place.

 Tie a belt or rope just under the bust. This will help secure the wrap and make a flattering empire waist.

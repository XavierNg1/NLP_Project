On the other hand, if you see their ears turned back or positioned back against their head, then it is highly likely that your cats are fighting., Cats that are playing typically have their claws sheathed or retracted most of the time. If they are unsheathed, they will not use them to intentionally hurt the other cat. On the other hand, if you see the cats using their claws to cause damage or hurt the other cat, then it is highly likely that your cats are fighting., During a play session, biting is often minimal and does not cause any harm. However, if you notice one cat biting the other in order to cause harm, then your cats are probably fighting instead of playing.For example, if one of the cats yelps out in pain and hisses or growls, then your cats may be engaged in a fight.

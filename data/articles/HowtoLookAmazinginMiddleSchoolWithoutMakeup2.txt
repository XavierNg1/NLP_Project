 How often you should wash your hair depends on your hair type and lifestyle. You should probably wash your hair daily if you exercise often, live in humid and hot place, have an oily scalp, or have thin hair. You can wash your hair only a few times a week if you have thick, dry, or curly hair.Try dry shampoo for days you need to remove grease but don’t have time to shower.
Brush your hair daily to avoid tangles and damage and to make your hair shiny.
 If you have trouble keeping your hair in place, you can use hair products to help. You can try using mousse or gels to pump up curly and wavy hair. Hair spray is great for getting rid of flyaway hairs and frizz. If you have thin hair, you can try volumizing products to make your hair appear thicker.


Make sure to only apply a small amount of hair products.
 If you are allowed to, you can try using heat tools to style your hair. Use a blow dryer to dry your hair and smooth it out. You can use a curling iron or wand to add texture, waves, or curls to your hair. Flat irons can make unruly, wavy, or curly hair straight and smooth.


Make sure to ask your parents’ permission before you use a styling tool.
 Mixing up your hair style can make you look and feel amazing, with or without makeup. You can put your hair in different types of braids, ponytails, updos, or buns to mix up your hair from your regular routine.


Try using different hair accessories like berets, clips, and headbands in your hairstyles.

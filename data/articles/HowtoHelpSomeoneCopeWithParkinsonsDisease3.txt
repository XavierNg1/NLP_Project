 Someone with Parkinson's may be experiencing changes frequently, and may not even notice all of them. If you check in regularly, you'll get a good sense of how they are changing. Try calling or stopping by once a week if you are a friend, or come by every day if you are closer and your schedule permits (as long as this many visits are welcome!).


If you do notice concerning changes, or see new difficulties that could be solved with adjustments to the household, do mention what you see to the person with Parkinson's or to a caretaker.
Look for new needs. If your friend can no longer drive, offer to drive them to appointments or to the grocery store.
 People with Parkinson's benefit from walking and walking-based exercises. Depending on how they are doing, they may be able to hike, walk in a mall, or walk very slowly. In the latter scenario, you may have to help them at some points or just be patient as they put one foot in front of another.Social interaction is also beneficial.
 Insofar as a friend or loved one with Parkinson's is still capable, keep inviting them to do what you did before. They may need extra support to do it, so make changes to accommodate this!

, The course of the disease varies from person to person, but generally starts with mild symptoms. It can eventually progress to the most advanced stage, that may leave the person bed- and wheelchair-bound. Make plans in advance so the transition, if it comes, is less stressful.

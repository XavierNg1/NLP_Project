 If you have already exhausted the daily supply of medicine, or you simply don’t want to spend any bells to heal, your character can also rest to make their bee sting disappear. Return to your house and go inside.
 Approach your bed and press the “A” button, and you will be asked if you want to “Save and End” or “Continue.”

After the game has finished saving, tap “Continue” on the start screen to start up your game again.
 Tap your resting character with the stylus to rouse them. When your character gets out of bed, he/she should be completely healed and bee-sting free.

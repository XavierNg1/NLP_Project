 Since open source CMS are available to all, they have community forums that help with support. However, if you aren't very proficient with computer programming, you will have to follow an alternate method.


Hire a web vendor to install the program and train your staff. Although you will need to pay for this service, it will decrease the problems you will have with the open source CMS. Ask if the vendor offers tech support help in the future at a fee.
Task your IT department with installing and training staff. You may have to send part of your staff to a course to learn all about the program and its requirements. If you already have a fully competent IT staff, you will save money with this option.
Install the program yourself and train your staff. If you and your employees are very computer literate, it may not be essential to get outside support. You can look for plugins in the directory and read how to fix problems in the forums.
 After changing any database, you should be prepared for a slow period where your employees learn to use the program, and at times, there are complaints. Try to wait for a period of 30 to 90 days before deciding if the CMS will work, because most website changes take time to adjust to.
 Look for extensions and plugins, once your employees are completely functional with the backend. The great thing about CMS is that talented volunteer programmers are improving it all the time.


Subscribe to blogs, newsletters or forums about your CMS blog. This will keep you aware of new updates or plugins. It will also direct you to websites that use the CMS so that you can see what others are doing with it.

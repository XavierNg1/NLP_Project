 This in in the top right corner of your "All Inboxes" menu.


If you need to search for specific emails to archive, you can use the "Search" function at the top of your screen to enter words that pertain to specific emails or users.
 Do this by tapping each email you wish to archive.


You can also swipe right on each email you wish to archive.
 This is in the bottom right corner of your screen; tapping the Archive button will remove the selected emails from your Inbox!

, Depending on which inboxes are synchronized with your Mail app, the name of the archive folder will vary; however, it will usually read "Archive" or "All Mail".


This option will be in your "Mailboxes" menu.

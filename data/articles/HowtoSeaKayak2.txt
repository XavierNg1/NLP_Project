 Most sea kayaks have “wells” or little pedals that the paddler can adjust to rest his feet on in order to maintain proper form. Adjust these foot wells, as well as the back rest, before putting the sea kayak in the water for optimal form and comfort.
 Dip one side of the paddle into the water, edge side down. Pull the paddle towards the stern of the kayak and up out of the water. As one side of the paddle comes out of the water, the other side should repeat the previous steps. Continue the paddling process as one fluid motion and do not move your hands along the paddle.
 Most paddles are offset to reduce wind resistance. With paddles that are not offset your trip range is reduced but you will not have to constantly twist the paddles.

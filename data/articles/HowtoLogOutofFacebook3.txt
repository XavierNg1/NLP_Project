 If you left Facebook open while at work or at school, or left the app open on your friends phone, you can use your Security Settings to log out remotely.


This method can also log you out of Facebook Messenger, which doesn't normally have a "Log Out" option.
 This will display all of your account's security options.


Desktop site - Click the down arrow in the upper-right corner of your Facebook homepage, select "Settings," then select "Security." You can also visit facebook.com/settings?tab=security and log in if prompted.
Facebook App and Mobile site - Tap the â˜° button, scroll to the bottom, then tap "Account Settings." Tap the "Security" option.
 This list will display all of the locations that you are currently logged into Facebook. This will include your current device, your mobile devices, and any other locations you are logged in at.Desktop site - Click the "Where You're Logged In" option. You'll find this towards the bottom of the Security menu.
Facebook App and Mobile site - Tap "Active Sessions."

, You'll see the name of the device (as reported to Facebook), the approximate location, and the date last accessed. Use this information to find the session you need to end.


You'll likely see several entries for yourself, including your current browsing session, your mobile phone, and Messenger.
 This will end your session for that device, and Facebook will be returned to the login page. If anyone is currently viewing your Facebook page from that browser or app, they will be kicked off immediately.


Desktop site - Click the "End Activity" link next to an entry to log out.
Facebook App and Mobile site - Tap the "X" next to an entry to log out.
 If you want to be absolutely sure you don't have an open session somewhere, click the "End All Activity" link at the top of the "Where you're logged in box." This will sign you out everywhere, including the browser you're currently using.


This option only appears on the desktop site.

, You may start with 0 or 1 or any number; 1 is recommended., If you want to save a little time, use a formula like "=J15+1" and copy it up, across or down off as many cells as need be. You may then find a like formula nearby as you go outwards, which will speed things up greatly. This will also allow you to use any originating number in the center, should you so choose..,, You might try blocking in non-primes in groups in patterns to see if you can predict primes!,, Its pattern to produce the sequence 1,3,13,31,57,91,133,183,241,307, ... is -1*0+1=1, 1*2+1=3, 3*4+1 =13, 5*6+1 = 31, etc. You will find a similar pattern extending to the upper left.

Notice that the second pattern is trickier: the vertical pattern that produces the sequence 1,4,15,34,61,96,139,190,249,316 is more involved. If one takes the difference of those numbers and then the differences of the differences, one gets 8's, so one knows that a constant value of 8 is being added in the sequence. Knowing that, a typical rate of change is produced by ((a*b)+c)+8 = result, with a being constant. Such is the case here as it turns out, for the sequence is produced by ((4*-2)+4+8)=4, ((4*1)+3+8)=15, ((4*6)+2+8)=34, ((4*13)+1+8) = 61, etc. with the increment to b being 3,5,7,... and the increment to c being -1, while a=4 and 8 are constants. There's an elegant way to write that in Summation Notation with N's and K's and i's and all but it's beyond the text capacity we're operating under. Actually, I just found another way to resolve the series: 1==((-1*0)-7)+8, 4=((1*2)-6)+8, 15=((3*4)-5)+8, 34=((5*6)-4)+8, 61=((7*8)-3)+8, 96=((9*10)-2)+8, etc.
 8's were again a constant difference of the differences but it took me awhile to find the rest of the formula. The sequence of 11,28,53,86,127,176,233,298, ... is generated as far as I know by ((4*-5)+23)+8=11, ((4*-1)+24)+8 = 28, ((4*5)+25)+8 = 53, ((4*13)+26)+8 = 86, etc., with a=4 and 8 remaining constant while b increments by 4, 6, 8,... and c incrementing by 1. Again, there's a more elegant way to state that. If anyone happening to read this can help out, great. There's another way to resolve this sequence also: 2=((2*3)-12)+8, 11=((4*5)-17)+8, 28=((6*7)-22)+8, 53=((8*9)-27)+8, 86=((10*11)-32)+8, 127=((12*13)-37)+8, 176=((14*15)-42)+8, 233=((16*17)-47)+8, and 298 =((18*19)-52)+8, etc. with element c decrementing by -5 each time., (1*2) changed next to (3*4). This might be the general pattern instead of working with 4's as had been, The role of d=8, the difference of the differences, was still present, so then you just need to figure out which a and b pair best approximated the answer and adjust with c accordingly, by trial and error. It did not take long to hit upon the solutions., and also 8==((2*3)-6)+8, 23=((4*5)-5)+8, 46=((6*7)-4)+8, 77=((8*9)-3)+8, 116=((10*11)-2)+8,163=((12*13)-1)+8, 218=((14*15)-0)+8 and 281=((16*17)+1)+8. These were done by the analytical method described above in Step 9, though it's a good hunch the problem will only yield to greater finesse than the lazy mathematician possesses., Has anyone hi-lited that yet? Might be interesting!

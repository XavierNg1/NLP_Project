 One theory of why a cat eat grass is that if a cat eats grass, they will throw it back up. This happens because the cat doesnâ€™t have digestive enzymes that are needed to break down the grass and digest it. A cat may eat grass to rid their stomach of any indigestible contents that is inside it.Your cat licks their fur to groom, and this causes hair to get in their digestive tract. They may need the grass to help throw it up or pass it through defecation.
Cats often eat prey whole, which means matter that the cat is unable to digest is in their stomach, such as bones, fur, or feathers.
 Cats may eat grass because they need an essential nutrient, folic acid. Grass contains folic acid, which the cat needs for proper bodily functions. Folic acid also helps the cat produce hemoglobin.If your cat is eating a few blades of grass occasionally, they may be trying to get folic acid.
 Another reason your cat may be eating grass is because they are constipated. Grass may act as a laxative to help any indigestible material that has moved deeper in the digestive tract continue moving through so your cat can eliminate it through defecation.You cat may eat grass if they are having indigestion.

 The wetter your toy, the longer it will take to dry. Make sure all the excess water is gone before drying your animal on a clothesline. On a sunny day, use clothespins to hang your toy and set it to dry.


The sun is a natural stain remover and sanitizer. Spot cleaning doesn’t require a lot of water so you probably won’t need to hang out an animal that has been spot cleaned.
 Let your stuffed animal air dry if the weather isn’t cooperating. Simply let it sit in a protected area, away from pets and children., If your label indicates that you are able to use a dryer, place your animal in a dryer on low heat or permanent press. You may also use a hair dryer on a low setting or on cool.While heat dries the animal quickly, it can also damage the animal or mat the fur. If your dryer has a fluff air setting, use this to help maintain the fur.
 Add towels into your load to soften the movements of your animal. Also use dryer sheets to eliminate static electricity buildup so your little one doesn’t get shocked when first holding it.
 The inside takes longer than the outside to dry. Make sure the inside is dry or else mildew may grow, which can be hazardous to a child’s health. Use a dryer or hair dryer for a short period to hasten the process., The stuffing may have jostled during the drying process so reshape your animal and fluff the fur so that it looks like the original version.

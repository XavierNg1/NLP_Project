 To know how to troubleshoot speaker problems, it's a good idea to know how it all works, at least at a basic level.


Sound signals generated inside your computer are sent to the speaker port (usually green) on your computer.
You plug your speakers into that port, and the sound continues down the wire into the little amplifier built into the speakers. This is just like how your stereo is wired, only smaller!
The output of the amplifier is wired to the speakers.
Power from the wall enables the amplifier to boost the tiny signal coming from your computer into something strong enough to wiggle the magnets in the speakers, vibrating the speaker cone, which in turn vibrates the air, which vibrates your eardrums.
Any failure in that little chain of events will stop all that vibration from happening. No vibration = silence.;
, This will tell you the one big thing right away: is your computer sending sound out of the port. If you hear sound, then everything inside the computer is hunky-dory, and your problem is with the speakers. If you don't hear sound, then don't worry about the speakersâ€”find out what's wrong with your sound card.



Is the volume turned up or right down?
Are the speakers plugged in?

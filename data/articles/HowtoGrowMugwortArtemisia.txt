 It grows best in a sunny spot with good drainage.


Allow for 12-18 in (30-50 cm) between the plants you set out and another 12-18 in. (30-50 cm.) around for weeding.
Use sticks and strings to mark boundaries. You will probably only need 3 to 5 plants, initially, since they multiply easily.

Note: Perennials form a lasting part of a landscape. They need regular seasonal care every year, rather than weekly care for one summer. Perennials should survive the winter if it doesn't get too cold. They can invade other plants if not given room and look unsightly if not tended properly.

Amend the soil with topsoil, organic matter like compost and a small amount of balanced organic fertilizer to provide nutrients over a complete season. More is not better. It will burn roots. Stick to materials rated for vegetables.
Mix these in while you dig over the spot removing rocks, roots and weeds.
Herb gardens in raised beds are the easiest to maintain and use.



Knock the plants out of their pots.
Trim long roots to 8 in. (20 cm) or less and set into the bed 12-18 in (30-50 cm) apart, at the same soil level they had in the pot.
Tamp soil around the plant stem and water thoroughly.

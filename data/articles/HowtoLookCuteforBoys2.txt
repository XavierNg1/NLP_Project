 Acne is in no way pretty. If you have acne, or are prone to breakouts, clearing up your skin can definitely be helpful. Wash your face with a face wash twice a day, once in the morning, and once at night. Use a good moisturizer, preferably with SPF in it. Be careful not to use a harsh face wash, because these can irritate and dry out your face. If you have dark marks, invest in a good dark spot corrector. These can take a while to fade, but be patient, in the end, it will work eventually.


Avoid touching your face with your hands, especially if they are not clean. Touching your face with dirty hands leads to pimples.






If you have bangs, try pinning them back. Bangs can trap dirt on your forehead, leading to huge breakouts.

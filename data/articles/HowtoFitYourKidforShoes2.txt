Place the paper on a surface that is flat and line it up along the wall.
Draw a line down the piece of paper.
Place your child’s heel on the paper so that it is touching the wall and then have your child’s big toe and heel centered with the line that you drew.
Mark the paper at this point. Do this to both feet and compare the sizes.
You can take this to your shoe store and this will help your store clerk to make sure that your child gets the right fit.
 Your child’s foot will expand throughout the day, so what may fit your child in the morning, may not fit your child at night.


Try to measure your child’s foot near the end of the day when his foot is at its largest size.
Be sure to use the socks that your child will be wearing when he is walking in the shoe.
Make sure that you have a pair of lightweight socks so that your child’s foot can breathe well.
The best way to measure a child’s foot is to do so when he is standing up straight as opposed to sitting or slouching. If he is not straight, it can cause the measurement to be wrong.
It is important for parents to check to see if the child’s foot is still the same size every few months.

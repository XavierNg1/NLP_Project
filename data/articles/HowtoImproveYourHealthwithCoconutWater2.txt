 The easiest way to improve your health with coconut water is to consume it straight from the coconut. Alternately, you can buy it bottled. Either way will expose you to all the health benefits of coconut water.When drinking it straight, any young, green coconut or unsweetened, bottled coconut water will do.
 If you love drinking refreshing smoothies after you work out (or just whenever), substitute coconut water in your smoothie for milk. This will give your smoothie a mild tropical twist.For instance, pour one cup of coconut water, one teaspoon of maca powder, three ice cubes, one banana, and Â¼ cup diced mango into your blender. Blend on high for thirty seconds.
 In a medium-sized pitcher, mix four cups coconut water with one cup of coarse-ground coffee. Put the pitcher in your fridge overnight, or for at least 12 hours. Filter the beverage through a fine-mesh strainer and into another pitcher. Serve with glasses filled with ice.

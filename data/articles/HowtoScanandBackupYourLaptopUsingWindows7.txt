 Make sure you have a USB stick, CD/DVD or an External Hard drive plugged into your computer;
,Â  then Click on Backup and Restore


You may have to wait a while if this is your first backup because it is taking all the times and copying them onto your external device.
 At the bottom right of your screen, you should see a little Green/Yellow/Red Check mark with a flag, Open that up.


You will see options for a Quick scan, Custom Scan, or Full Scan, If you want it to check every file use Full Scan method, if you want to check certain spots on your computer, do a custom, and if you just want to scan the minor files, do a Quick scan.






A Full Scan will take longer than the other two but it is the best one to do because it gets every file scanned for a virus or any other potential threats.
 Now that your scan is done you can set your automatic scanner time, Click on Settings and put scan type to Full scan, and pick what time you want it to scan at. (You should scan your computer at least once a week)

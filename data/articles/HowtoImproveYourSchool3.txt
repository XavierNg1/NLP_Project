 Make sure that all students have a chance to participate in activities and games, no matter what their skill level or ability. For example, when playing a game that only takes 8 players at a time, rotate people in and out, so that everyone can have a chance. Letting all students have a chance, even if they aren’t great at the game, will make things more fun and friendly., Being new at a school can make a person feel lonely. Whenever there is a new student at your school, make a special effort to make him or her feel welcome.Invite the new student to sit with you at lunch.
Introduce him or her to your friends.
Make sure the new student is included in games and activities.
 You can help keep your school a positive place by not taking part in talking badly about other people. If others around you are saying mean things, don’t be afraid to tell them that its not nice, and that they should stop.If someone tries to gossip with you, you can say you don’t want to talk behind someone’s back, or just change the subject.
If you someone says something bad about someone else, try saying something like: “Hey, that’s not cool. I don’t think it’s fair to talk about like that.”

, Bullying can be a very serious problem, and shouldn’t be tolerated. If you think there it has become a problem at your school, talk to a school administrator about ways to address the issue. You can also help stop any bullying you witness. If you see someone picking on someone else (offline or online), you don’t have to just let it happen:Don’t laugh or just watch what happens. Say something like: “That’s not nice. Why don’t you leave alone?”
Be a friend. If you see someone being picked on, make an extra effort to be nice to him or her. It will make a big difference if that person knows he/she is not alone.
Avoid physical confrontation if possible.
Tell a trusted adult about what you saw happen, whether or not you intervened.

 Among Firefox's greatest strengths is its tabbed interface, but you will need to supercharge, and then tune this to make it work for you. Spend a half hour or so, go through all the settings. Among the most important is the ability to protect a tab. A protected tab can't be changed; links open in a new tab, so what's on the protected tab can be returned to easily.
 Using your bookmark, load up the tracker. Now protect the tracker.
 It should open in a new tab. If not, check your settings. Once you're done reading, reply if you have something to add. If not, simply close the tab.

If you don't have a tracker, you can still stay on top, but it's not nearly as efficient. Read on to see how to do it...

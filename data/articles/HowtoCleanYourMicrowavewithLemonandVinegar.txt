, You'll want a bout 5 or 6 tablespoons if you use lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of vinegar.


Fresh Lemon can also be used; you would use 1 big slice, cut in half and squeezed into the water.
 The lemony steam works away at cooked on food and grease.
 Allow the bowl or mug to sit in the microwave once the cooking process has finished for an additional 4 to 5 minutes; this allows the steam to cool.
 Be careful; it will be hot! Do not empty the bowl or cup yet.
 Wipe out the microwave. If you find you still are having a hard time cleaning off some of the food inside, you can repeat the microwaving with the same cup or bowl previously used, or dip your cloth or towel into the cup or bowl and use some of the hot Lemony or Vinegar water to wipe the food off. It should help to loosen any areas that are being stubborn.


Use the hot lemon or vinegar water to clean the turntable in your microwave, the edges on the inside, the outside, your oven top and your sink...lemony fresh, no chemicals, very inexpensive, and very environmentally friendly!

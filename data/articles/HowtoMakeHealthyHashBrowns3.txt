 To make the cauliflower hash browns, you’ll need 1 head of cauliflower. Use a box grater to shred the head of cauliflower so it has a rice-like texture.Make sure that the cauliflower is washed and patted dry before you grate it.
 After you’ve grated the cauliflower, place it in a large bowl. Add 2 eggs, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of black pepper, ¼ teaspoon (⅕ g) of garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of minced yellow onion. Stir the mixture well to combine all of the ingredients.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.
Feel free to mix in or substitute any other seasonings in the hash browns. Cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, dried oregano, and dried sage are some tasty options.
 Place a large skillet on the stove, and add 2 teaspoons (8 g) of coconut oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it melts, which should take 3 to 5 minutes., Once the oil is heated, place half of the cauliflower mixture in the skillet. Use a wide spatula to press down on the mixture to flatten it.As you flatten the cauliflower mixture, try to keep the hash browns together as much as possible.
 After you’ve flattened the hash browns, allow them to cook for about a minute. You’ll know they’ve cooked long enough when the edges become golden brown., When the edges of the hash brown mixture have turned golden brown, use the spatula to carefully turn them over. Let them cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the other side or until the edges are golden brown.You may not be able to flip the hash browns in a single pieces. Working in small sections often makes it easier.
 Once the hash browns are finished cooking, transfer them to a plate or platter with the spatula. Serve the dish while it’s still warm.The recipe makes 2 to 4 servings.
Refrigerate any leftovers, and eat within 2 to 3 days.

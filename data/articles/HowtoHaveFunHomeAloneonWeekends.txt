  On weekends, let loose and don't eat meals.  Snack on foods frequently for the whole day!  Get some candy, chocolate, ice cream, soda, and chips onto your living room table and eat while watching TV! You could also play on the computer.;
,  You'd be surprised how much time passes when you have a screen in front of you to entertain you.  Watch a comedy, horror, romance, any movie/TV genre you enjoy! You can also watch them on your laptop/computer.  Just type out the TV show on Google, and it will usually show up.
  Go on your computer and play your favorite games.  You can also do this on the TV or on a DS, anything similar to the source.  It doesn't matter if you're bad, as long as you're having fun.  Practice makes perfect!

,  Watch lots of videos from your favorite YouTubers.  You can spend the whole day on your computer, just watching YouTube videos if you let yourself.  There are some really great and funny videos on there.
  Go to the library on Friday and borrow a couple of your favorite books or some books that you would like to read for reading on the weekends!  Find a book that you enjoy, and get lost in the words and story.
  If you are artistic or enjoy making drawings, why not draw?  Draw anime, cartoons, realistic things, 3D things, anything you want!  The list is endless. You can even spend lots of time on a piece of artwork.  It may look great!

,  If you have nothing to do, why not paint your nails?  Even if you don't want any color, just coat your nails with clear polish.  Go on the Internet and search up some very good nail art designs.  Give yourself a manicure!

,  One of the best and most relaxing things to do on the weekends is to let loose and relax.  Take a hot/warm bath or shower.  A bath is better, since you can soak in the bubbles.  Try using a bath bomb.  Reading or watching TV while bathing is a great way to pass time while still relaxing.  You deserve a treat.

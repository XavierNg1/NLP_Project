 Break the house down into sections and clean each section on certain days. For example, Mondays can be kitchen and dining room day, Tuesdays you can tackle the basement. This includes dusting, cleaning and organizing that room. This way you are not cleaning the entire living area in one day. Don't forget days you can do the exterior (mowing the lawn, tidying the garage). Tackling the house in small sections can really allow you to focus on that area only.;
, If you have a get together happening over the weekend, don't wait until Friday to clean the house. Start on Monday, and follow step one by doing small sections at at time.
 Extra kitchen appliances should be tucked away. Nowadays many inexpensive shelving options are available. If you are a visual person, then have everything organized out where you can see it.
 Donate! Donate! If you have not used anything in a year then donate it to charity or give it to someone who will. Always make sure you don't replace it with something else unless the new item does multiple functions allowing you to get rid of a number of items.
 Give them zones and rotate if need be. Cleaning is a responsibility and you work as part of a team it is not a means of getting an allowance. You should be doing it because you want to help out.
 Take a few minutes to decide if you should keep, file or recycle it. Paperwork can really pile up if left unresolved.

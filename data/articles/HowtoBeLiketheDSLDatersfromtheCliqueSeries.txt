If your hair is not already blonde, I seriously suggest that you dye or highlight it to the desired blondness.Or an even cheaper "in the shower" blonding idea for girls with dark brown hair is John Freida blonding glaze. It gradually makes brown hair look NATURALLY lighter even though its made for blondes. Once you've done that, wash and condition it every single day with either Bumble and Bumble or Aveda products. Wear it in dancey styles, like buns, ponytails, etc, but also occasionally just keep it down and wavy.
Make sure your skin is the best it can be- this means getting acne treatments prescribed and using them religiously. One or two blackheads is all right, but you just are not going to win a beauty pageant with a pimple the size of a tomato.
Wear a little make-up, from upscale brands such as Clinique (and Skye wears their Happy Perfume, so you might want to go for that, too), Sephora, Estee Lauder, and Victoria's Secret. However, if you want to get less obvious make-up from drugstore brands(you really only need expensive lip gloss and perfume- that's all other people need to see, right?) then go ahead.
Shower everyday, maybe twice a day, and use a cute smelling bath gel such as Essence of Beauty. Always wear deodorant! You never want a visible sweat mark!;
, Wear dancey clothes such as leggings, flats, shrugs, legwarmers, etc. with your basics (basics can come from stores like Old Navy or Forever21) and throw in a few expensive designer items (designer bag mandatory), such as Coach bags, Louis Vuitton sunglasses, Calvin Klein jeans, Tommy Hilfiger flip flops, etc. We are basically going for the rich ballerina look.
 Don't gossip too much, but a little is healthy fun, so go for it! Make sure your clique is at least semi-popular.
 That's pathetic.). Every time you kiss a boy, buy a new, thin silver bangle.

 This method is best saved as a last resort as you will be hitting the bottle on a hard surface like a wall or tree. You should not try this method on drywall or any weak structure. The pounding could break or damage your walls or furniture.
This method is very dangerous as you can easily break the bottle, causing the glass to shatter. The glass can injure you severely. Proceed with extreme caution.
 Wrap the bottom of the bottle in the towel or place inside the opening of a hard-soled shoe. Then carefully hit the bottom of the bottle onto your hard surface. 








The shoe should be sturdy like a dress shoe. It should have a solid, flat heel.
If you have a towel, make sure to wrap the towel evenly so that the part of the bottle hitting your hard surface is as flat as possible.
Hit the bottle on your surface with a slow and consistent rhythm. The force of your motion and the movement of the liquid will slowly begin to push the cork upward out of the bottle.
 Once the cork has begun to emerge from the bottle, grab it with your fingers and pull it out.









Donâ€™t keep hitting the bottle when you see that you can grab the cork. If you hit the bottle on the surface and force the cork out, your liquid will come spraying out after it.
Even when pulling the cork out, you may want to give your wine or champagne a few minutes to settle before pulling out the cork. It may spray when you remove the cork.
 Once you have finally removed your cork, you can now sit back and enjoy a hard earned drink.


This method of popping out the cork should be saved for last. It is recommended that you push the cork through the bottle before attempting this method.

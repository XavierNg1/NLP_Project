 You can buy the first bottle from a street merchant for 100 rupees.;
, There is a bridge there; swim under it to get the bottle from the Bird Lover. You need the Flippers in order to get this second bottle.
 There, you will find the third bottle with a letter in it.


After getting the bottle, go to the Milk Bar in Kakariko Village. Talk with the owner, and you'll get a bottle filled with Premium Milk, which you need to give to a man on Death Mountain. To get there, go to the Tower of Hera, and go east from there. Cross the bridge with the Hookshot, and enter the cave in the next area. In the cave, use the moving platforms until you reach a large platform with three walls on the sides. Merge to the bottom wall, and wait until the platform comes.
Follow this platform until you get to the point where there are three platforms. Go to the platform on the left, and follow it until you reach an exit. Exit the cave with this exit, merge with the wall, and go right until you reach a platform with a man on it. Talk to him to give him the Premium Milk, and after drinking it, he'll let you keep the bottle.
 Go to the northern side of the house, and place a bomb there. This will open a cracked wall there. Go inside and you'll find a treasure chest with the fourth bottle inside of it.
 Use a bomb flower to blow open the entrance. There, you'll find a pond which asks you to donate rupees. Once you've donated 3,000 rupees, you'll get the fifth bottle.

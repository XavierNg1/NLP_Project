 You can use old buttons that you have lying around, buy buttons from a craft store, or use a mixture of old and new buttons. Place the buttons on a smooth surface until you're happy with the color combination you've created for your button necklace.
 You should look for wire with 19, 21, or 49 strands of stainless steel wire that is coated with nylon. This measurement will ensure that the strands won't kink and that the necklace will be durable. Once you've found the right wire, just cut it to your desired length.


Remember to leave at least 4-8 inches (10.1-20.3 cm) to account for the clasp at the end.
 This will secure the end of the wire and will also secure the buttons onto the end of the necklace. When you're done stringing the beads, you can tie the other clasp to the other end of the wire.
 Choose a pattern for the buttons, whether it's alternating or just completely random. You can lay the wire horizontally below the pattern to ensure that you're using enough, but not too many, buttons.
 Once you've chosen your button pattern, just string the wire through the two holes in each button until all of them are tied to the necklace. Remember to leave enough room so that the remaining wire can be secured to the other clasp.
 This will complete your button necklace.
 Have fun wearing this funky necklace with a variety of outfits.

 The WIPO website has a search engine called Patentscope that has access to 2.7 million published international patents.


Once there, you can watch tutorials that will help you search for patents.
 This is the default interface. There are 8 predefined search fields which allow you to do a search in different parts of patent documents: front page, any field, full text, English text, ID number, International classification, names, and dates.Select a field and type in the term you want to search for. Then hit “Search.”
You can limit searches to specific countries by going to the “Options” menu and clicking on “show options.” Then click on “Office.” A list of nations will pop up. Select the ones you want to search.
 This can help you create a more targeted search.Click on “Search” and then “Field Combination.” You can use the “And” or “Or” operators.


For example, you may want to search for patents related to “electric cars.” Over 70,000 results will pull up if you do a simple search. You can therefore refine your search by adding a date in the “Date” field (e.g., 2011) and further refine the search by adding a company name, such as Tesla, in the “Applicant Name” field.
Search results will display with your terms highlighted. You can then open the individual records from the search results.
 Use an advanced search to perform complex search queries, using an unlimited number of terms. You can begin by going to “Search” and selecting “Advanced Search.” You can use “Specify” to select that patent collections you wish to search in.


Advanced search supports Boolean operators, proximity operators, range operators, and wildcards.For more information on how to use these operators, click on “Help,” then “How to Search” and “Query Syntax.”

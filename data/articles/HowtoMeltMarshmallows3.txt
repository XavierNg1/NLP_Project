 If you are using a gas grill, set it on medium to high heat so that you will have some flames. You will be roasting the marshmallows over the flames, which will give you a nice, crunchy outside and a soft, gooey inside.
 Make sure that the skewer or stick is long enough so that you can hold the marshmallow over the flames without scorching your hand. You can use a metal skewer, but make sure that the handle is heat-resistant so that you don't burn yourself. If you are using a long stick, consider shaving the end into a point; this will not only make it easier to impale the marshmallow onto it, but it will also lessen the changes of any tree bark getting into your marshmallow.
 Keep the marshmallow just above the flames and turn it slowly to ensure that it roasts evenly.


If your marshmallow catches on fire, do not wave it around. Instead, gently blow the flame out.
 You can tell when your marshmallow is melted on the inside if the outside is golden brown and crispy to the touch.


If you like your marshmallows charred, hold it closer to the flames and keep roasting it.
This method is perfect for toasting a marshmallow for topping. For example, a marshmallow milkshake can have several roasted marshmallows incorporated into the mixture in the blender and one on top for garnish.
 Break a graham cracker in half and place a small piece of chocolate on one of the halves. Place the marshmallow (without pulling it off of the stick or skewer) on top of the chocolate, and press down on it with the other graham cracker. While still pressing down on the graham cracker, gently pull the stick or skewer out from the marshmallow. Wait a few moments before serving, so that the marshmallow can cool down and melt the chocolate.Donâ€™t forget to turn off your gas grill when all of your marshmallows have been roasted.

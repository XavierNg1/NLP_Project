 The primary goal of self defense is to escape the situation safely. Throwing an object at the attacker, screaming for help, and running is often the best option. Even if you are cornered, car keys make an awkward weapon. Use them only if you happen to be holding them, and cannot reach a more effective weapon.
 Pick up your keys in your palm and wrap your fingers around them, with one key sticking out next to your thumb. Press your thumb down hard over the key, so it lies across your index finger's knuckle.This grip reduces the chance that you cut your own fingers, and holds the key steady to deliver force without bending or sliding against the target.

If you have other keys on the keyring, they should stick out the other direction, at the base of your fist., Punch hard at the attacker, with the key pointed directly at the target. The eyes, nose, groin, and hollow at the base of the throat are all targets that are likely to disorient or disable the attacker for a short time.

Warning: a strike to the eyes or the base of the throat has a chance to cause serious injury. Only target these areas if you are at risk of serious harm or death., If the attacker doubles over or falls back, immediately back away to increase the distance between you. If you can safely run to a more crowded area, do so.

One advantage to holding the key as described above is the ease of opening your car door if you manage to buy yourself time.
 If you have keys sticking out on the lower side of your fist as well, don't forget you can hammer downward at the attacker's groin or the back of his hands., If your back is against a wall, you may need to step forward and jab quickly several times to get the aggressor to fall back. If the attacker staggers or steps backward, step forward and push hard before she regains her balance. Use the opening you created to flee.

You may also need to do this if the aggressor is full of adrenaline, making it difficult to cause pain.

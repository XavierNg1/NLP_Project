 Offline censorship happens when people are acting a certain way because of fear of being recorded and put on social media. This can be serious since anyone from your mother to your boss can look at your social media accounts. Try to plan some family or friend time without smartphones or cameras. That way, everyone is free to act as they normally would without fear of being recorded., People want to take pictures and video at some important events, like parties or vacations. If you don’t want this media ending up on social media, you could insist that everyone use cameras that use film to take pictures. This will help ensure that content isn’t directly uploaded to social media, since it isn’t digital., Smartphones and digital cameras/recorders are very popular and convenient. Perhaps the best way to go about handling offline censorship is to agree ahead of time that no one will post their pictures or videos to social media. Just make sure that you trust the people around to keep their promise.

 For your speakers, try getting tall, narrow boxes with 2-3 speakers in them. Make sure the speakers are at least 2 inches, and no larger than 6 inches (15.2Â cm).
, For your subwoofer, you won't need anything more powerful than a 600 watt sub. Try out an 8 inch or 10 inch from Kenwood, Sony, BOSS, or Alpine. This should provide enough bass for the small party or home theatre.
 Put the port and speaker facing the front, with the port under the speaker itself. Place the subwoofer in the front center of the room, in between the 2 speaker sets.

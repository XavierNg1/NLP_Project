 Before the game starts, make a deal with another player to help one another out, but do not let any of the other players know. While you cannot stay alliances the entire game, it may help you knockout other players. Here are some sneaky tricks you can practice together:


You and your partner should not charge each other money for landing on property you both own. You can practice this until you have bankrupted the other players.
You can acquisition the properties you both want by letting each other know what you want, and then as you land on those spots, you can buy and sell them to that player in hopes they do the same for you.
 If you really want all of the railroads, and another player owns one of those properties, try to set up an agreement that allows you both to get the properties you want. Make a deal where if you land on a property that another player wants, you can buy it, and then sell it to them at the same cost you bought it for so long as that player does the same in return for a property you want. This may be an easy way to take the chance out of owning your desired properties.
 If you have your eye on a property, but do not have the funds to purchase it, try offering a real-life bribe to another player. Properties like Park Place and Boardwalk may seem like a good trade for someone looking for a free dinner or favor. So if you do not have the money to buy a property, or want to steal one from another player, try offering that person something they want outside of Monopoly as a trade.

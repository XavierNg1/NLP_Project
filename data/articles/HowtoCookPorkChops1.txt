 You can use either bone-in or boneless chops. Make sure they're completely thawed if you purchased them frozen.;
, Place the skillet over medium high heat and let the oil get nice and hot.


Any type of oil will do - olive oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil - you pick. You could also use butter.
If you're frying more than 4 or so pork chops, you might need to heat up a second pan as well.
Using a heavy cast iron skillet will give the pork chops a good sear.
 Sprinkle them on both sides with plenty of salt, pepper, and other seasonings of your choice like garlic powder or cayenne.
, Leave them in on the longer side if they're thicker than 1 inch (2.5Â cm). After a few minutes the first side should develop a good brown crust.


If you want to glaze the pork chops, add a teaspoon of honey, marmalade or maple syrup to the top of each one before you flip them.
For sage-infused pork chops, add a few leaves of fresh sage to the oil in the pan as the pork chops cook. The leaves will fry and become crispy.

 There are some people that need to be handcuffed in front of their bodies. This list can include pregnant women and people with limited mobility in their arms., This limits their mobility and gives you greater control. Hold their wrists together from the underside of their hands, close to their pinkies. If they begin to resist, you can hold their pinkies together and have greater control.
 Place the other cuff on the suspect quickly and accurately. Do this by grasping the suspectâ€™s wrists with your left hand and then removing your right hand. The suspect should have pressure on their wrists at all times.
 The chain should be coming out from the hands and away from the body. If your cuffs have a double locking mechanism, now is the time to lock it.

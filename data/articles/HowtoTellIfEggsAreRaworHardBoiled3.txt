 If you mark your eggs when you boil them, you won't need to do the tests above to tell them apart from your raw eggs. One simple way to do this is to drop some loose onion skins into the boiling water with the eggs. The boiled eggs will come out a nice beige color. This makes them easy to tell apart from your raw eggs.

The more onion skins you use, the more noticeable the dying effect. If you can, use about 12 onions' worth of skins to get eggs with a deeply-dyed appearance.
Skins from red onions also tend to dye the eggs more darkly than skins from white or yellow onions.
 Using food coloring or Easter dye kits makes it easy to keep track of which eggs are boiled. You can even color code your eggs: red for hard boiled, blue for soft boiled, etc.


If you're boiling the eggs in a small pot, you can add a few drops of food coloring and a few teaspoons of vinegar directly to the water as you boil. Otherwise, boil the eggs first, then soak them in a mixture of 1/2 cup boiling water, 1 teaspoon vinegar, and a few drops of food coloring afterward.
 This method isn't fancy, but it is quick and easy. Simply boil your eggs as normal, then remove them from the water and allow them to dry. When they are completely dry, mark them on the shell with a pencil or marker. For instance, you can try writing "B" for "boiled."


Don't worry â€” since you have to remove the shell to eat boiled eggs, this doesn't make your eggs unsafe to eat, even if you use ink.

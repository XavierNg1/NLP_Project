 Keep doing different positions, (angled, or strait) until you can get 1 strike. Notice how you curve or move your arm. This is key to getting strikes in a row;
, If you get 2 strikes in a row (a Double),using the same position, curving, etc, you found your strong spot!

, If you keep practicing with your strong spot, your body will do it more often, without your command.
 strikes in a row, you just got a perfect game! Congrats!

 Reaction statements describe the stoichiometry of the reaction. They can be used in two ways. Sometimes, the reaction statement simply denotes ratio of chemical species as a result of the reaction. If known, the reaction statement can represent the molecular changes that take place during the reaction, such as intermediate steps.A reaction without known intermediate molecules is known as an elementary reaction.;
, The study of stoichiometry focuses on relative amounts of chemicals as a reaction proceeds. You should be comfortable with this idea. The relative amounts of reactants and products will affect the rate that the reaction continues to a large extent.Acknowledge that reactions can proceed in the reverse direction (product back to reactants) under the right stoichiometric conditions. For example, there is too much product in the environment, so it begins to move back toward the original reactants.
 Transition states are molecules that form in the middle of a reaction. Understand that transition state molecules are highly unstable and usually break down in a fraction of a second. Work through the transition states of any reactions that have a known transition state to learn the mechanism of the reaction.

 It helps if the beer is not ice-cold (talk about brain freeze), but you should not drink warm beer either or you will end up with a stomach full of foam.;
, You want to get rid of as many bubbles as possible because that will make the beer easier to drink quickly. While you are waiting, the beer will warm up a bit (see previous step).
 This releases more carbon dioxide.
 Open your throat, take a half breath right before drinking, and then swing the glass or can quickly so the beer rushes to the back of your throat. Swallow right before the beer actually hits your throat, then let gravity take over. The beer should essentially pour down your throat.

 To use your carrier's Internet service, you will be required to enter the correct APN information into your cell phone.


Contact your GSM carrier directly or visit your carrier's website to determine the correct APN information to enter into your unlocked cell phone. The APN information may vary greatly depending on your Internet package or cell phone model.



Refer to your cell phone's manual to determine where you can modify the APN information. In most cases, you can go to the "Settings" or "Browser Settings" sub-menus within your Internet folder to modify the APN information.



Launch your browser or Internet from its icon or location on your cell phone to determine if it connects successfully.
If your Internet does not connect successfully, try accessing more than one website to ensure that the connectivity issues are related to your cell phone, and not with one particular website.
Contact your GSM carrier directly if your Internet does not work with the APNs you entered. You may be advised to modify your APN settings or they may send you an OTA update with the correct Internet or APN settings.

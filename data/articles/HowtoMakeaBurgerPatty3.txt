 Using your hands, thoroughly mix the ground beef with approximately 3/4 tsp (3.75 ml) salt and 1/2 tsp (2.4 ml) ground black pepper.


Add more or less salt according to taste. The same goes for the black pepper, as well.
If desired, you can use a separate hamburger spice blend or other seasonings that you enjoy tasting in your burgers, like garlic powder or chili powder. Make sure that the seasonings you choose will complement both the beef and the cheese, though.
 Break the chunk of ground beef into four even, separate pieces. Roll these portions into balls.


These “balls” of hamburger need to be pressed together firmly so that the meat is dense and able to adhere to itself. When using this technique, you cannot afford to have crumbly burger meat.
 Use your thumb to indent the middle of each ball. The indentation should be deep enough to reach the center of the ball.


Alternatively, you could also use the handle end of a wooden or plastic mixing spoon to form the indentation.
 Fill each indentation with roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) shredded cheddar cheese. Use your fingers to smooth the top of the beef over the exposed indentation, hiding the cheese in the center as you do so.


Cheddar cheese is recommended by default, but you can get creative by trying other types of cheese, as well. You can even stick small wedges or cubes of cheese in the center of the burger as long as they fit and are roughly equivalent to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of shredded cheese.
 Use your hands or a burger mold to flatten the filled burger balls into patties.


For these burgers, it might be easiest to form the patties using your hands. You could still work with some sort of patty press or mold, though. Line the mold with plastic wrap, press the stuffed patty ball into it, and flatten out the meat until it fills the mold.
 Wrap these patties in plastic wrap or an airtight plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes before taking them out and cooking them.

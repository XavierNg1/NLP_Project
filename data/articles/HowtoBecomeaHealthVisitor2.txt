 As soon as you've registered as a nurse or midwife, you can enroll in the program to become a health visitor (or school nurse). An SCPHN/HV program typically lasts one year if you take full-time classes. You can also take part-time courses, although it will take you longer to complete.Many part-time programs allow you to complete the degree program in two years instead of one.
 If you already have a degree in a health-related field, you might be able to take a fast track program (also known as a "2+1" program) to register as a nurse and get health visitor training. Find out if fast track programs are available at your university. Fast track programs are typically completed one year sooner than if you train as a nurse and then enroll in a health visitor program.Keep in mind that if you're already a nurse or midwife, you'll need to renew your certification with the NCM every 3 to 5 years., Be aware that in order to become a health visitor, you'll need to pass criminal records checks done by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). Once you've passed their checks, you'll be allowed to register with the NHS trust.You won't need to send in any forms for the checks. The health visitor program you enroll in will work with DBS to run their safety checks.

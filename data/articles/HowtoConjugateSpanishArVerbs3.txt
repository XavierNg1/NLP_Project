 Irregular verbs are those that don't use the standard, regular rules for conjugation. While fewer than 5 percent of verbs ending in -ar are irregular, many of those irregular verbs are ones you'll need to use often.Unfortunately, there's no blanket rule that you can use to conjugate irregular verbs, although you may notice patterns or commonalities among some of them.
For the most part, conjugation of irregular verbs is simply a matter of memorizing them. One way to start is by searching online for a list of irregular -ar verbs. Reading through the list a few times can give you a basic familiarity.
You also can identify irregular verbs by spending a lot of time reading Spanish-language websites or magazines, watching Spanish-language movies or television programs, or talking to native speakers.
 The verb estar (meaning "to be") is probably one of the first Spanish verbs you'll learn, and it also happens to be irregular. While the endings are different, the conjugated verb is formed the same as regular verbs – by adding the ending to the verb stem est.The conjugation of estar is present tense is "yo estoy" (I am), "tú estás" (you are), usted/él/ella está" (you/he/she is), "nosotros estamos" (we are), "vosotros estáis" (you all are), and "ustedes/ellos/ellas están" (you all/they are).

Estar is not irregular when conjugating it in future tense. You use the same endings as you do for regular -ar verbs.
The preterite or past tense conjugation of estar is "yo estuve" (I was), "tú estuviste" (you were), "usted/él/ella estuvo" (you/he/she was), "nosotros estuvimos" (we were), "vosotros estuvisteis" (you all were), and "ustedes/ellos/ellas estuvieron" (you all/they were).
 The Spanish verb dar, meaning "to give" or "to have," is another irregular verb that you probably will use quite often even as a beginning speaker of Spanish. It is conjugated in the same way as the irregular verb ir, which means "to go."The present tense conjugation of dar is "yo doy" (I give), "tú das" (you give), "usted/él/ella da" (you/he/she gives), "nosotros damos" (we give), "vosotros dais" (you all give), and "ustedes/ellos/ellas dan" (you all/they give).

Dar is not irregular in the future tense. Make the conjugated form the same way, and using the same endings, as you would for any regular -ar verbs.

Dar is one of the few verbs that is also irregular in past or preterite tense. Conjugate "dar" as "yo di" (I gave), "tú diste" (you gave), "usted/él/ella dio" (you/he/she gave), "nosotros dimos" (we gave), "vosotros disteis" (you all gave), and "ustedes/ellos/ellas dieron" (you all/they gave).

 Arrive at the venue at least 15 minutes before the event will begin or you are scheduled to read. Announce yourself to the organizer, or sign up if you haven't registered already.
 Most readings allow time before and after the event for poets to talk to other attendees. Take advantage of this time to network and connect with people who share your interests.
 Observe the the style and behaviour of the readers ahead of you.
 When you are called, stand and carry your papers without shuffling them. Walk to the front or rostrum and set the papers down if you can.
 State your name, affiliation if any, the number of poems you will read. Before each poem, state its title. Read slowly and clearly. Use inflection, and make eye contact sometimes. Take a deep breath before each one.
 Do not wait for applause or questions unless you are well-published, or it was previously arranged.

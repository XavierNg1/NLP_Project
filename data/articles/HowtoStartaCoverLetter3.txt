Use Mr. or Mrs. only if you are sure of the gender and marital status. When in doubt, just include the full name of the person.
If you are unable to find the person’s name, address the department or “Dear Hiring Manager.”

Include only your impressive figures that directly apply to the cover letter narrative and the job. , Include “Sincerely” and then your full name.


Make sure your contact information is included in the signature.
 To avoid problems with hitting the Send button early, finish, proof and fill out the subject line of your email before typing the hiring manager’s email address in the “To” line.

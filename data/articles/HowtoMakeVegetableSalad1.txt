 The base of a green salad is crunchy leaves that can stand on their own or stay firm when dressed. Romaine or red leaf lettuce are great choices if you prefer mild flavors, while dinosaur kale offers a hearty, earthy alternative. Wash thoroughly, then chop and add to a large bowl.


For an appetizer, plan on serving about 2–3 oz (55–85g) of (total) greens per person.
Avoid the more common curly kale, which is tough to eat raw.;
, If you're not sure how to chop the leaves, take a bite to test the texture. Crisp lettuces are easy to eat torn, or cut into bite-sized pieces across the stem. For greens with a fibrous stem such as kale, cut out the stems then slice the leaves into thin pieces.


Kale also benefits from "massaging" to break down the fibers. Place it in a bowl of acidic dressing and squeeze handfuls of leaves with moderate pressure. Let sit for 5–15 minutes before serving., A variety of textures is key to a good salad. Add a roughly equal amount of arugula, spinach, butter leaf lettuce, or another soft, leafy green to your salad. Handle these gently while washing and chopping, as soft leaves tend to bruise more easily.
 If you like some zing in your salad, throw in a large handful of radicchio, water cress, dandelion, or frisée. These add strong peppery flavors., You can stop here, or use your mixed greens as a base for all sort of ingredients. Here are a few examples:


A little feta or blue cheese, crumbled on top
Walnut halves
Cherry tomatoes
Avocado cubes

, Serve with French salad dressing, Vinaigrette, or just shake together balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

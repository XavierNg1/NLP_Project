 Instead of buying a policy from your travel agent or booking site, find a policy through an online broker. A travel agent may be selling you a policy that pays the highest sales commission rather than offering the customer the best coverage. This will help you get cheap insurance. If you already have health insurance, contact your current provider to see if they offer extra coverage that you can purchase for your trip., When you are looking for insurance, make sure that you look at multiple carriers. Check out an online broker like InsureMyTrip and compare different rates. Talk with a sales rep and get the details of any policies that you are interested in.This is particularly important for any travel health insurance policies. Failing to get the right policy could cost you thousands of dollars.
 If you are purchasing a policy, you want to make sure that it will cover any issues you encounter. For instance, if you have a preexisting condition, make sure your travel health insurance will cover any complications associated with it. You do not want to buy insurance only to find out later that it does not meet your needs. Read the fine print and get a policy that works for you.Before you buy, ask for a copy of the policy and be sure to go over it.
Talk to an insurance agent and make sure that all of your needs are met. Ask them things like “Does this cover my preexisting condition?” and “Will this policy cover the cost of all of my luggage if I lose it?”

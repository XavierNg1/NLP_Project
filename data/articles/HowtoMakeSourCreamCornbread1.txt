 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Get out two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2-inch (21 x 11 x 3 cm) loaf pans and spray them with cooking spray. Cut parchment paper to fit the pans and press the paper into them.Set the pans aside while you make the batter.;
, Get out a large mixing bowl and measure 3 cups (375 g) of all-purpose flour into it. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and whisk them until the ingredients are combined. You'll need to add<1 cup (120 g) medium-grind yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup (100 g) sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon kosher salt

, Melt 1 cup (226 g) of unsalted butter in a small bowl and set it aside. Get out a medium-sized mixing bowl and pour in 1 1/4 cups (295 ml) of whole milk. Add 3/4 cup (172 g) of sour cream and 2 extra-large eggs. Whisk the wet ingredients until the eggs are incorporated. Slowly whisk in the melted butter.Try to have the eggs at room temperature before you whisk them in. This will improve the texture of the cornbread loaves.
 Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to stir them together. Stir until the dry ingredients are totally mixed in and you can't see any flour.Avoid over mixing the batter or the cornbread loaves could become coarse and tough.
 Divide the batter between the two prepared loaf pans. Use a knife or offset spatula to smooth the tops, so the loaves are level.To ensure that you divide the batter evenly, you can use measuring cups to scoop the batter into the pans.
 Put the pans in the oven and bake the cornbread for 35 to 40 minutes. They should turn golden brown. Wear hot pads and remove the cornbread from the oven. Let the pans cool completely on a wire rack before you serve the cornbread.You can test for doneness by sticking a toothpick or skewer into the loaves. The toothpick should come out clean when the cornbread is done. If batter sticks to it, it should bake for a few more minutes.

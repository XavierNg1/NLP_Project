 This can be done through any search engine, but Google offers the widest range of sources. Type in the name of the show you want followed by the words “full episode.” If you have a specific episode in mind, type its name or number followed by “full episode.” This will give you a better chance of finding the episode instead of clips or discussions.It’s best to try this option if you want to watch for free but can’t find a video anywhere else.
 Find the word “videos” under the search bar and click on it. This pulls out readily available videos. Check these videos first, since they’re safer than going to streaming websites. You can check the content of the video by looking at the thumbnail before you click.


Dailymotion and Vimeo are video hosting sites like Youtube and are safe for use.
 Search normally or click on “all” under Google’s search bar to go back to the general search. You can add “full online free” to the end of your search to get more results. Look down the list and try out a website. Project Free TV is one example of a site that has show links.


If the videos don’t load properly or the site won’t let you start the video without completing an offer, leave.
 Some sites, including Primewire.ag, aggregate links. When you click the link, you are taken to a less safe site. Other sites make money by including popups and advertisements. Be careful where you click and enjoy your show.

 Use organic materials in your yard, such as grass clippings, dried leaves and wood chips to mulch gardens. The mulch serves as an effective ground cover that smothers weeds and keeps them from spreading.
 Cover the garden bed with clear plastic. The sun naturally heats the plastic, killing off weeds in the upper layer of soil. Remove the plastic before planting.
 Spray full-strength vinegar directly on weeds as they emerge.
 Organic weed killers do not include harsh chemicals or pollutants, and should be labeled as Certified Organic.

 Look in your art supplies or take a few carpet fibers to a store to try to find a matching crayon. Work the crayon into the bleached area, taking care to color down to the base of the fibers. Try to stay within the lines of the stain and avoid coloring unbleached fibers.Marker pens may also sometimes be helpful., Coloring the bleached patch will likely result in a darker hue than the surrounding carpet. Use a damp towel to dilute the color and spread the pigment throughout the bleached area.Continue to color and dilute until you’ve blended the color to match your carpet.
 If the bleached spot is in an inconspicuous area, you can try using an interior paint. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to apply a thin coat over the stain, and try to paint each fiber from its base to the top. Apply more coats as necessary, but be sure to keep them thin.The best thing about using interior paint is that you can take some carpet fibers to your local home improvement store and have them match the color precisely.
Avoid using interior paint in spots that are obvious or receive lots of foot traffic. The paint will make the carpet fibers stiff.
 Ask a professional for help if you’ve tried using crayons or paint without success, or if you don’t want to take the chance recoloring the stain on your own. A professional cleaner can attempt to:Clean the stain
Cut out fibers
Cut out and replace the affected patch

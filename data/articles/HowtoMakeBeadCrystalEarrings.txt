 Cut out a 100mm nylon wire and unfold it, then place the iron earring hook at the center position. Fix the earring hook by stringing one blue seed beads on each tip and then pass the wire tips cross through another one.;
,

Add three blue seed beads on each tip and cross through 6mm Abacus Glass Bead, finally tighten the wire.






At each tip, string one 6mm Abacus Glass Bead and then cross through the 8mm Round Glass Bead.






Repeat the first action; just replace the blue seed beads with the silver ones.






Add on another one silver seed bead on each, then pick up the two wire tips and pull it and through the wire across to the starting Abacus Glass Bead.
 When turn to the last part of the semi-finish crystal earrings, the detailed beading methods are just as same as the step2: add beads and cross through the shared beads.
 So far, the above are all steps necessary in making your own earring at home!

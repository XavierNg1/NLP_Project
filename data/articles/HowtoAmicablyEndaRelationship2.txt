 Plan out in your mind exactly what you want to tell the person. This will help you be clear, and will also help you stay focused on what you need to say if you start to lose your courage.


Have answers ready for any questions you can anticipate the other person asking. He or she will almost certainly want to know why this is happening, and if there's any chance you will change your mind.Be specific about the grievances that have led you to this decision, and be clear about the fact that the relationship is over--this is not up for negotiation. Plan to say something like, "Because of X, I need to break up with you," not "I've been thinking maybe we need a break from each other."

, If you can, talk over what you plan to say with a trusted friend beforehand.Ask your friend to tell you if anything seems unclear, and what questions they might anticipate the other person having.


You can also ask your friend if you are being too harsh, or if anything you are saying might give the other person false hope.
 Ending a relationship is hard. It will be difficult, both for you and the other person. Expect an emotional reaction, and do your best to steel yourself for it.


Think about what kind of support you may need after the conversation. Make plans in advance to do what you will need to do to take care of yourself.You may need some time alone afterwards. Or, you may want to meet with a friend. Think about what will be most helpful to you and make arrangements.

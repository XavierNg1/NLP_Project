 Most fitness monitors track motions and vital signs differently depending on certain health factors. Enter as much information as suggested in the deviceâ€™s instructions to get the most accurate readings.
 Take note of the proper position or location for the monitor. If monitors are placed in an incorrect spot on the body, they may give inaccurate readings.


Some pedometers require placement at the front of the waist, while others can be worn on the hip, back, shoe, or wrist.
Some heart rate monitors must be wrapped around the wrist, while others can be held in the palm or strapped to the chest.
If the monitor is built into a machine you are using, make sure you are able to comfortably use it prior to exercising; in some cases, the height of the handlebars or the orientation of the heart monitor can be changed to allow easier access.
 This is particularly important the first few times you use the monitor. Checking pedometers and heart rate monitors for accuracy is essential to ensure that you can rely on the values reported by the machine.


Some monitors may need to be re-calibrated depending on any changes in the desired purpose (to monitor walking instead of running), a change in fitness level (to accommodate a new target heart rate or new weight), or the amount of time you have been using them.

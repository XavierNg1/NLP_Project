 Just open your favorite browser, and type in https://www.linkedin.com. This will bring you to the LinkedIn home page where you will need to log in.;
, Once you’re on LinkedIn’s home page, enter your email address and password into the text fields on the upper right corner of the screen. Click on “Sign In” to access your account.
 On your profile page, look to the right of the screen for the thumbnail version of your profile picture. Hover over the photo to display a drop-down menu. Towards the bottom of this list is the option “Privacy and Settings” with a blue Review button beside it. Click on the button to load your profile settings.


In case the system prompts you to log in again, just do so. It’s simply a security measure.
 Scroll down towards the bottom of the settings page, and you will see a list of submenus on the left side of the page. Look for the one labelled “Groups, Companies & Applications,” and click on it to display its own settings to the right.
 To do so, once you see two rows of settings on your screen, look for “Privacy controls” on the second row. Under Privacy Controls, click on the option labelled “Manage settings for LinkedIn plugins on third-party sites.”


A small pop-up window will then appear on the screen with an explanation for the purpose of LinkedIn plugins. Below it is a tick button. Click on it if you want to allow LinkedIn to receive information about the pages you visit while you’re logged in to LinkedIn. Otherwise, leave the tick button unchecked and blank.
 Just click on the blue “Save changes” button at the bottom of the window to confirm the changes you made to your account.


Click on the “Cancel” tab below the “Save changes” button if you decided not to change your plugin setting.

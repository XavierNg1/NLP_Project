 A hashtag is a keyword with “#” at the beginning (e.g. #puppy) that links photos or videos that share common subjects. Adding hashtags to the captions of your photos and videos will make them easily discoverable by people searching for things they like on Instagram.


For example, if you type #puppy in the caption of a photo, someone searching Instagram for "puppy" will find it, along with other pictures that use the same hashtag.
Username tags (e.g. “@username”) identify a person or company that appears in the photo. They are different from hashtags.
 It’s the app on your home screen or apps list with a multicolored camera icon.
 You can add hashtags to any of your new or existing Instagram posts by typing them into the caption field. Here’s how to get there:


If you’ve already posted the photo or video: Go to post and tap the ⋯ (iPhone) or ⁝ (Android) at its top right corner, then select Edit.
When posting a new photo or video: Tap + at the bottom center area of screen, then select a photo or video to upload. Add effects, if desired, then tap Next at the top right corner of the screen.
 Simply type the hash symbol (#) before any keyword relevant to your photo. Your hashtags can appear as a list beneath your photo, or you can blend them in to sentences. Here are some ideas for incorporating hashtags into your caption:Subject of the photo: You could caption a picture of your kitten lying in the garden with “#Drake the #kitten sunbathing in the #garden."

Location: Some of the most popular Instagram searches involve specific places. Try something, e.g. “#mybed,” “Pic of my #holidays in #Phuket #Thailand #Asia” or “Nothing beats my favorite latte from #Stumptown #PDX"

Photo techniques: Hashtags for apps, filters, or styles used to create the photo, e.g. #iPhone7, #hipstamatic, #blackandwhite, #nofilter, will appeal to photographers.

Events: If you and your friends want to share photos from the same event, create a hashtag to use on all of your photos. For example, if everyone going to a party tags their photos with #sarah30thbirthday, it will be easy to find the images.
Identity: Make yourself easy to find by people with whom you share common traits, e.g. #redheads, #latinas, #lgbt, #borninthe80s, #teambeyonce.
Find out what’s trending: Do an online search for “most popular Instagram hashtags” or try a site like http://www.tagblender.com to view popular hashtags.
 If you’re editing an existing post, just tap the check mark at the top right corner of the screen. Your photo or video is now searchable by hashtag.


Tap the hashtag under your photo to see all other content posted with that hashtag.
If your Instagram profile is private, your hashtagged photos will only be visible to people who follow you.

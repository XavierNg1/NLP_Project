 If you want to remove the crab meat yourself to serve to guests or to package for later use, do the following:


Twist the legs and claws off the crab's body.
Using a mallet or nutcracker, crack the shell of each leg and claw.
Cut the body into quarts with a knife.
Break apart the legs and claws and, using your finger or a knife, remove the meat. Pull the body sections apart and dig out pockets of meat. One whole, cooked crab should yield 7.5 to 8 ounces of meat., If you prefer to serve the crab in its shell, simply provide seafood crackers or mallets alongside the remaining crab. Many people enjoy crab with melted butter, aioli, or cucumber mignonette for dipping., If you don't finish all your crab in one night, be sure to place it in the fridge or freezer within 2 hours of cooking for optimal safety.


To refrigerate your crab, store it in covered airtight containers. Crab generally keeps for 3 to 5 days when refrigerated.
If you decide to freeze your crab to extend its shelf life, place it in a plastic airtight container or heavy-duty freezer bags. It should keep for about 3 months.

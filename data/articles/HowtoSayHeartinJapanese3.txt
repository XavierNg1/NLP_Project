 The phrase will actually help you determine the word you will choose, kokoro or shinzou.


Remember, if your phrase at all has the connotation of spirituality, you will need to use the word kokoro, not shinzou.
In English, of course, the word heart is the same whether you are referring to the spiritual heart or the physical heart, so this can take some getting used to.
 If you want to say your heart is beating but in a sentimental way because it’s beating due to love or being anxious, say, “Kokoro ga doki doki suru.”


If your heart is beating in a physical or medical sense, say “Shinzou ga doki doki suru.”. To say the phrase “it’s a heart,” say “coke-oh-ruh des.”
To say your heart is broken, say “Watashi no kokoro wa zutazuta desu.” To say you’ve had heart surgery, say “shi-n-zo-u shujutsu.” "My heart is broken" in Japanese is: 私の心は傷ついています

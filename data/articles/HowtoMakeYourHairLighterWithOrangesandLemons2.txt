 Add Â½ cup (118 ml) of chamomile tea to a spray bottle. For the best results, make sure that the tea has brewed for at least 5 minutes.Make sure that the spray bottle holds at least 8 ounces.
Like the lemon juice, chamomile can help naturally bring out the lighter tones in hair.
 Add the juice from 3 lemons, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cinnamon, a squirt of honey, and 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of coconut oil to the spray bottle. Give the bottle a light shake to partially blend the ingredients.Cinnamon contains natural peroxide, and honey undergoes a chemical reaction when mixed with water that helps it serve as a lightening agent.
Coconut oil provides moisture to help counter the drying nature of the lemon juice. If your hair is particularly dry and dehydrated, you may want to add an extra teaspoon of coconut oil for a total of 2 teaspoons (9 g).
 When all of the other ingredients are in the spray bottle, add enough warm, distilled water to fill it. Shake the bottle vigorously to ensure that all of the ingredients are completely mixed., To lighten your hair, spray the mixture over your hair where you want to lighten it. You can apply it before you plan to spend time outside in the sun or before you go to bed to lighten your hair overnight.If you plan to use the lightening spray while you sleep, wear a shower cap to keep your sheets from getting bleached. Rinse the spray out of your hair in the morning.
You can give your hair an ombre effect by only applying the spray to the ends of your hair.

 These are the beams which make up the skeleton of your walls. You’ll need to plan ahead to know where you want all of your walls to go, which should have been done in your building phase. There are two main materials from which you can make your studs: steel or wood. Each has their benefits and you should choose what is best for you.


As a general rule, wood is cheaper but steel is stronger.
You can add further insulation at this point by putting traditional insulation in the framing area.
 Once your walls have a skeleton they’ll need a skin! Install drywall or use whatever wall finishing method you prefer to get nice walls which you can paint when your project is complete.
 If you did not already, you’ll need to add drywall or other finishing materials to your ceiling. This will give you a nice surface to paint or finish in your preferred method.
 You can save a few bucks by keeping your concrete floors and having them bare. This may be cold, however so consider carefully. Concrete floors can be stained to achieve really cool finishes, giving you a modern look.
 You’ll need to figure out what flooring method is best for you. Installing a subfloor will make for a warmer floor than just installing carpet but it may take away badly needed inches in terms of wall height, as well as adding to the overall project cost.
 If you’re adding rooms to your new space, you’ll also want to add doors. This will be especially important for bathrooms and bedrooms. Make sure you account for doors being able to open and close when you place items like sinks, tubs, and toilets into rooms.

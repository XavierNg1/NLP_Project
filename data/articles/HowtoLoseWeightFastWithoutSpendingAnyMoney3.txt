 If you struggle to get into an exercise routine, create a simple daily walk for yourself by parking at the far end of the parking lot, or getting off one stop early on the bus on your way to work and on your way home. This will force you to do some exercise every day, without spending a dime., When faced the prospect of a short elevator ride to your apartment, your office, or even the next floor of the mall, opt for the stairs. Walking up and down the stairs will get your cardio going, and can help you lose weight without paying for a gym membership.If you are just starting to get in shape, a cardiovascular workout once a day for thirty minutes total can burn calories without putting too much stress or tension on your body.
 Pack your own lunch and bring it to work to avoid eating out in the middle of the day. Prepare your lunches the night before so you aren’t tempted to eat out and spend money on unhealthy food.
 Stress and anxiety can be major food triggers and lead to unhealthy eating habits. Commit to getting a solid sleep every night so you are well rested, relaxed, and have enough energy for your workout routine. A good night’s sleep can reduce your cortisol levels, the hormone that rises when you are anxious or stressed. Avoid stress eating by committing to eight hours of sleep a night.

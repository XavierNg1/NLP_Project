 If you can't find any almond milk, you can make your own by blending 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water and Â½ cup (70 grams) of almonds.
 You may have to work in a few batches, since spinach leaves can be tricky to blend. Keep pulsing until the leaves are completely blended with the almond milk. Mixing the spinach in first will give you a smoother drink in the end.


Don't worry, you won't taste the spinach after it is done. It will turn the smoothie an interesting shade of green and add tons of nutrients, however!

, For a thicker smoothie, you can use a frozen banana instead. At this point, you can also add 5 to 6 ice cubes; it will make your smoothie colder and thicker.
 For extra fiber, add some chia seeds. Also, try to use smooth peanut butter instead the chunky kind. It will be easier to blend and give you a smoother smoothie in the end.
 From time to time, pause your blender, and push the ingredients down the sides using a spatula. This will help the ingredients mix together more evenly.
 It is packed with nutrients and protein, and will keep you full for hours. It makes an ideal breakfast!

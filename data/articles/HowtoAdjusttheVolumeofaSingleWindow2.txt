 Tabs in Chrome and Firefox are at the top of the browser's window, while Safari tabs are below the address bar. If you see a black speaker icon in the top-right side of the tab in Chrome or Firefox, it means that tab is projecting noise.


In Safari, you'll see a blue outline of a speaker in the right side of the address bar of a tab that's making noise.
 If you're using a Mac track pad, you'll instead use two fingers to click the tab. Doing so will invoke a drop-down menu.
 It's near the middle of the drop-down menu. This will instantly silence any sound coming from the tab in question.


This method is perfect for silencing advertisements or auto-play news reels.
On Safari, you can just click the blue speaker icon in the address bar to mute that tab.

 Unless you are withdrawing the daily interest you are accumulating, it will be added to the original amount of your principal which is a great way to save. To calculate, you will need the principal amount, the annual interest rate, the number of compounding periods per year (365 for daily) and the number of years the money will be in your account., Assign labels in column A, rows 1-5, for the Principal, Interest Rate, Period, Number of Years and Compound Interest Balance. You can expand the cell by clicking on the right line of the column number, A, B, C, etc. (Arrows will then show that you can manipulate.) These labels are for your reference only., Period is 365 and the number of years is whatever you choose to calculate. Leave cell B5 (Compound Interest Balance) blank for now.For example, principal = $2,000, interest rate = 8% or .08, compounding periods = 365 and the number of years is 5.
 Compounded daily, the total principal and interest earned balance is $2983.52 after 5 years. You can see it is a good idea to reinvest your interest earned., The formula to use is Initial investment * (1 + Annual interest rate / Compounding periods per year) ^ (Years * Compounding periods per year). The ^ indicates an exponent.


For example, using the same information from Step 3, principal = $2,000, interest rate = 8% or .08, compounding periods = 365 and the number of years is 5. Compound interest =2,000 * (1 + .08/365) ^ (5 * 365) = $2983.52.

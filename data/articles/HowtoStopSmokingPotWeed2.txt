 A medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathy (DO) can prescribe medications designed to help you ease off of marijuana. If you've tried to quit cold turkey or to quit gradually, or even if you just know that there's no way you can do it on your own, seeing a doctor may be your best bet.


Make sure you're committed to quitting before you make an appointment. Not only is visiting a doctor expensive, but many will not take you as a patient again if you continually relapse.
 If there are underlying issues that are driving your marijuana use — such as depression or anxiety — talking them through with a professional could help you quit. If possible, try to find someone who specializes in addiction issues.


Look at different modalities. There are several modalities, or types of therapy, that might be appropriate for pot addiction. Talk therapy is the most common kind, but you might also investigate cognitive-behavioral therapy.
 If you're having a hard time quitting on your own because of peer pressure or a lack of confidence, a support group might be the answer for you.


Narcotics Anonymous is in several countries, and provides free membership and meetings. Search online for groups in your area.
 If nothing else has worked and your marijuana addiction is seriously endangering your health and happiness, you might need the extreme help that inpatient rehab offers.


Exhaust all your other options first. Rehab is difficult and expensive, and not something you should enter lightly. If you are truly out of choices, though, it might be the best thing.

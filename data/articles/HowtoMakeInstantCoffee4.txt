 You will need 1 teaspoon of instant coffee and 1 teaspoons of hot water. Stir the instant coffee and hot water in a cup until the coffee granules are completely dissolved. You will end up with a thick, concentrated coffee syrup., At this point, you can also add in some sugar, vanilla extract, or spices. Once you have everything in your cup, stir the coffee base again with a spoon. Here are some ideas on how you can flavor your instant latte:


Add some cocoa powder or chocolate syrup for a sweet, unique taste.
Add a few drops of vanilla extract for a sweet, classic taste.
Give your coffee a unique flavor with a dash of ground spices. Consider using any of the following: allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.
Consider using some flavored coffee creamer instead of sugar and other flavorings.
 Measure out 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk, and heat it. You can do this in a pot over the stove or in a mug in the microwave. If you are using the stove, watch the pot carefully so that the milk does not boil. If you are using the microwave, heat the milk for about 2 minutes; watch the microwave carefully so that the milk does not boil out of the cup.
 Once the milk is very hot, pour the hot milk over the latte base. Gently stir the latte with a spoon to combine everything.
 For an extra fancy cup of instant latte, squeeze a swirl of whipped cream on top. You can also sprinkle some ground cinnamon or nutmeg on top of the whipped cream.
 Be sure to enjoy your latte before it becomes cold.

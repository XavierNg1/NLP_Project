 If the person who snores is overweight or has weight issues, they may want to consider losing weight with a healthy, balanced diet and daily exercise. Excess weight can add more tissue around the neck area and lead to restricted airways, causing louder and more persistent snoring.
 Drinking alcohol a few hours before bed can cause airways to relax and vibrate when sleeping, leading to snoring. As well, a heavy meal before bedtime can cause a restless sleep, full of snoring and shifting or moving around in bed.
 Throat exercises can strengthen the muscles of their upper respiratory tract and help to reduce or eliminate snoring. Suggest they try to do throat exercises on a daily basis, starting with one to two sets and then increasing the number of sets over time. Advise them to combine the exercises with other activities like driving to work, while doing housework, or while walking the dog. To do throat exercises:Repeat each vowel (a-e-i-o-u) out loud for three minutes several times a day.
Put the tip of the tongue behind the top front teeth. Then, slide the tongue backwards three minutes a day.
Close the mouth and purse the lips. Hold this for 30 seconds.
Open the mouth and move the jaw to the right. Hold this for 30 seconds. Do the same on the left side.
Open the mouth and contract the muscles at the back of the throat several times for 30 seconds. Look in the mirror to confirm the uvula (the hanging ball in the back of the throat) moves up and down.

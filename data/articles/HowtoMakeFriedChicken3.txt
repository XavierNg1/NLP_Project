,, Place the coated pieces on a plate.
 The fryer should be suitable for frying chicken. Heat on the stove at a medium setting. Watch to see that it does not get too hot and "spit". To test to see if the oil is hot, put your hands under the water faucet then flick the water from your fingers over the oil. If it sizzles, you know the oil is hot enough to add the chicken to fry.
,, Serve with coleslaw, salad or steamed vegetables of choice.


If you're going on a picnic, allow the fried chicken to cool down and pack in its own container, along with other food items ready for the outing.

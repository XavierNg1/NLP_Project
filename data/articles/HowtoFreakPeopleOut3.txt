 First impressions are everything. If you can give a really weird one, you'll be able to freak people out without even opening your mouth! See below:


Wear strange or themed clothing for no reason. Try dressing like it's Christmas Eve in the middle of June.
Look like you're having a really, really bad day. Dress completely disheveled - leave curlers in your hair, smear your makeup, press your hair into an odd shape, or even leave a slap-mark on your face (you can do the real thing or use makeup).
Wear clothing that is the wrong size. See if you can disappear inside a giant suit jacket or if you can squeeze into a T shirt that's two sizes too small!
Wear clothing incorrectly. Try wearing your shirt and/or pants backwards, or, if you're really not faint of heart, try wearing your shirt as pants and your pants as a shirt.

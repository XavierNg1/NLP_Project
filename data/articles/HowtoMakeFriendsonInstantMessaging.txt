 If your best friends have a computer set up with internet, you could try persuading them to get IM. They would probably be more than happy to, as it's cheaper than the phone. You could also persuade them to get a microphone or webcam later on.;
, If you are on Myspace, Facebook, any forum, or even a regular in an IRC chat room, you could ask one of your good online buddies on there if they'd like to exchange IMs. In some cases they'll say no, but don't be discouraged.
 While this may seem pretty creepy, if done right you'll seem normal. There are plenty of IM names floating around out there on the internet, but don't branch out too far. Don't talk to anyone just because you saw their IM name. You could say "Hey, I saw some of your videos on YouTube, you are awesome! Keep up the good work!" or "Hey, your posts on {forum} are pretty funny. You rock!" In most cases these compliments can turn into conversations in no time.
 Sometimes if you tell your friends about one, they'll tell someone else you don't know. If that person is nice and you aren't hostile towards each other AT ALL, you could become friends.

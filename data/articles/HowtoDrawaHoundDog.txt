 These determine where the head, chest, and hips are going to be.;
, Add the banana-shaped tail. Make sure your lines are smooth and even.
 Draw the legs of the dog. They are squiggly, teardrop-like shapes that connect to the main body--they look too frail to support such a sturdy dog, but once you've shaped your hound a little more they'll be more in proportion.
 These should be a little thicker at the top, and the back leg should be positioned in such a way that it looks like your dog is leaning forward.
 They are shaped like rounded triangles over the ends of the legs, almost like horses' hooves.
 For the other ear and the nose, draw two more rounded triangles.
 To make your dog look realistic you can use grey, brown, white, or black, but be sure to use different tones throughout. And don't forget to add toes to his feet!

 In the U.S., all firefighters must finish a minimum 110-hour NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) certification course.You may also undergo additional training in order to stay current with new technology. Visit the NFPA website for more information.


If you are going to be physically putting out fires, many departments require that you train in a live fire situation before you start going out on calls., You will need to be in great physical shape. Take care of your physical and mental health so that you can best serve your community. Some departments maintain an actual fitness requirement, while others only suggest it.
 Spend as much time at the station as you can. Part of your informal training is to get to know the other firefighters. You will be working on a team to respond to emergencies with these people, so it's important that you mesh well.

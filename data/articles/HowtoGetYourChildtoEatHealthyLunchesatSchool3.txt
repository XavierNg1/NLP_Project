 This allows him to observe your healthy eating choices. Model good food choices and choose foods for yourself that you would encourage your child to eat. Don’t pack yourself a soda if you would ask your child to drink milk.
 Decide where you will go for lunch and what foods you will eat. Discuss your lunch options with your child and encourage him to select similar healthy foods for his meal. Let your child have some say in his lunch options just as you had say in yours.



Limit unhealthy foods. If your family enjoys cookies or other treats, offer them only occasionally. Some families choose one day during the weekend to be more lax with eating habits. Others select one night during the week to do a family fun night, during which time they allow special treats. This method teaches your child that unhealthy food options, though not off limits, are allowed only once in a while. Your child will likely come to recognize them as specialty foods and will quickly understand that they are not every day staples.






Don’t store cookies and chips where you and your child can just grab them at any time. Unhealthy treats like that should be stored in a place where you can access them only when needed. Instead, provide easy access to healthier snack options. One way to do this is to put a basket of fruit on your kitchen counter, or to keep a bowl of cut up vegetables in the refrigerator.

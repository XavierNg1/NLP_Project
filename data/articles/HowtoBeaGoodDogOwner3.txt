 The amount and frequency of your dog’s feedings will depend on the age and size of your dog. Talk to your veterinarian if you are unsure about how much you should be feeding your dog. In general, adult dogs only need to be fed once per day and the amount they need is based on their weight. You can usually find weight charts on dog food packages that indicate how much food your dog needs each day.Keep in mind that dogs under the age of one will need to be fed more frequently. Puppies from 8-12 weeks old need to be fed four times per day. They also require special puppy food. Check with your veterinarian to be sure that you are giving your dog the right type and amount of food every day., Dogs need plenty of fresh clean water to drink every day. Your dog may need more water if he has been exercising or if the weather is hot. Make sure to provide a bowl of water that your dog can access easily. Refill it is if the water gets low and change the water daily., It’s nice to indulge your dog with a treat now and then to show him that you care about him. Treats can be used to reward good behavior as well. Reward your dog with a treat every day, such as a dog biscuit or a rawhide bone.

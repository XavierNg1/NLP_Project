 The difference between cocoa and chocolate is that chocolate includes the fatty part of the cocoa seeds, known as cocoa butter. Cocoa powder is what's left when the cocoa butter is extracted.There is a noticeable difference in flavour, but a steaming cup of hot cocoa can be just as enticing, especially if you don't have a bar of chocolate handy!








, In a 2-quart saucepan, whisk together the cocoa and sugar until blended. Add the water, and whisk until combined.
 Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil.Stop stirring, reduce the heat to medium low, and let the mixture boil for 2 minutes.









When stirring the hot chocolate in the pot, a wire whisk is best. A spoon may not blend the chocolate and liquid thoroughly, and you'll end up with a grainy beverage.
As with the first method, you can add any flavourings you like at this point.
 Slowly add in the milk, stirring to blend. Heat the cocoa until it's very hot, but do not allow it to boil.
 Pour the cocoa into a cup or a mug.

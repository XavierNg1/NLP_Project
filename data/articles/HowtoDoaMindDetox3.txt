 Start anew on a fresh page every day. Write at least 1 page, about anything that comes to mind.


Do not substitute typing a page for writing it by hand. The physical act of putting thoughts to paper can result in a more cathartic release.
 Write 2 or 3 positive sentences that reinforce what you want to gain from a calmer mind. Repeat your affirmation before you go to bed every night or when you awake every morning.


For example, "I can change the way I think about the world. I will remove those things are not essential and focus on the activities and thoughts that give me strength. I am moving toward my goals in a deliberate and confident way."

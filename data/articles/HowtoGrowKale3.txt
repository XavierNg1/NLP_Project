 Follow the directions for your specific type of fertilizer for precise amounts. For compost and mulch, spread a layer a few inches deep. For seaweed powder or rock dust, apply a thin, even sprinkle.
 Do so by gently patting the container on its side if you used plastic pots to start your seedlings. If you purchased kale starts at a garden supply store or nursery instead of starting with seeds, simply remove the purchased seedlings from their plastic containers.
 The holes should be just deep enough to plant the seedlings at the same level they were growing in the pot. If you are planting multiple rows, make sure that the rows are 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61.0Â cm) apart.
 Pat the soil down to the same level it was in the plant, without burying any leaves. Make sure to plant the starts perpendicular to the ground, regardless of the shape of the roots.

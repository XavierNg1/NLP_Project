 and placing a value on these things. Add them all to get new customer value.

Here is a formula on how to calculate user lifetime value:

User lifetime value (U) = (Gross distribution per customer) X Σ (yearly retention rate)^i / (1+ yearly discount rate)^i - (Retention cost per customer per year) X Σ (yearly retention rate)^p / (1+ yearly discount rate)^p+0.5

Where Σ runs from i= 0 to n in the first set while in the second set Σ runs from p= 0 to n-1. Here 'n' stands for the number of periods used in the calculation.
(In other words the internet advertising for which one has to pay for every time their advertisement is displayed) Here is on how to calculate it:


Use this formula to calculate, Impression value (I) = (Add up all impressions from Twitter, Facebook, You tube (Cumulative views), website traffic and other online sources) X (Industry based cost per thousand impressions (CPM))/100

,(Twitter, Facebook ,websites, etc.). Add all these values to get customer service value (C).
, Here are the steps on how to calculate the social media expenditure:


Hard costs: Calculate the hard costs which denote the work or costs associated with the actual project during the campaign or during a specific interval.
Soft costs: Calculate the soft costs which include the unseen work that composes the initial part of developing a project during the campaign.
Cost/Time spent: Unlike other investments, social media has a greater value when it comes to time spent on it. Calculate the money spent per time spent on social media during the campaign.
Sunk costs: Calculate the sunk costs involved during the campaign which include the costs that were required during a new addition or an internal fix during the campaign.
Social media expenditure (E) = Hard costs + Soft costs + Cost/Time spent + Sunk costs

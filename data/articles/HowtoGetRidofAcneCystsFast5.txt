 Acne scars caused by cysts can be made less visible by applying cortisone and fade creams to your skin.


If your skin is red and swollen, apply cortisone to reduce the inflammation.Cortisone is a common medication for all sorts of skin irritations, and will be absorbed by the skin.Stay away from hydroquinone. Hydroquinone is a fade cream used to lighten pigments in the skin, but which has recently fallen out of favor due to concerns about possible cancer-causing properties.Instead, opt for a lightener such as kojic acid, arbutin, or ascorbic acid.
 Chemical peels use potent acid formulas to lift off the top layer or layers of skin, thereby minimizing the appearance of scars.Very strong chemical peels should be used in combination with a doctor's advice and/or guidance.
 Dermabrasion is the process of sloughing off top layers of skin with a rapidly rotating wire brush.Blemishes on the surface of the skin are usually removed, and deeper scars are usually minimized, although dermabrasion can cause changes in skin pigments for patients with darker skin.


Talk to your doctor about microdermabrasion. A lighter procedure than dermabrasion, microdermabrasion is the application of small crystals onto the top layer of skin, which are then vacuumed up, along with dead skin cells.Because the procedure only removes the top layer of skin, results are generally a lot less pronounced than dermabrasion.
 Lasers blast the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and heat the layer of skin just beneath it. Skin heals, lessening the appearance of scars. Sometimes, multiple laser treatments are needed to lessen the visibility of scars; repeated treatments offer subtler results.
 Skin surgery is a minor surgery in which a punch excision cuts out the scar and replaces it with stitching or a skin graft.

 Sometimes the conditions that cause incontinence can be treated with hormone supplements, medicine, and/or surgery. Speak with your vet about potential cures or treatments for your dog that would make diapers unnecessary.If your dog is currently taking prescription drugs, inquire if any of their medicines might be causing incontinence as a side-effect. If that’s the case, an adjustment to their dosage might help address the problem.
Keep in mind that many of these treatments can be expensive, temporary, and/or have serious side-effects. Be sure to factor these considerations into your decision about whether or not to pursue them versus addressing the symptoms with diapers and other measures.
 Consider confining your dog to an area of your house that’s easy to clean. Alternatively, you can actively protect an area of your house by laying down plastic sheeting covered with easy-to-wash towels or blankets.There is also special bedding available for incontinent dogs to keep your floors clean and your dog from sleeping in a puddle.
You can also protect furniture and floors with washable pee pads, which are available from any medical supply business.
Keep in mind that this alternative to diapers is also labor-intensive since it involves constant washing and cleaning. It also presents a significant alteration to the aesthetic and cleanliness of your house.
 Letting your dog roam outside will help keep them clean and mitigate their anxieties about having accidents.This is also nice to do for your dog if you do decide to put them in diapers since it gives them a chance to spend part of the day diaper-free.
Remember to only do this as the weather allows. Senior dogs are less able to regulate their body temperatures and should not be left out unsupervised in hot or cold weather.

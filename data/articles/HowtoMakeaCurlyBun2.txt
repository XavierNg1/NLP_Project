 Make sure that there are no split ends in your hair. Add an anti-frizz serum, if needed. For a tutorial, visit wikiHow to Blow Dry Your Hair.
 You can use a traditional curling iron to achieve this. You can use just bobby pins, a water spray bottle, and a brush to achieve this look. Begin with dry hair.



Create the "curl." Divide the hair into small sections as you go. Take a small section (like you would create to use a curling iron), and wrap it around your finger. How you wrap the hair will be how the curl will fall. It should look like a perfect circle against your scalp.

Gather the section and pin it. Create a perfect circle by lifting up the strand of and compressing it gently. Using a bobby pin, pin the curl.
Continue until all of your hair is pinned.

Spray your entire head with the water bottle. Your entire head should be damp (not soaked). Add salt to the water bottle for more texture.

Let dry. You will be ready to remove the bobby pins when the curls are completely dry. You can use a hair dryer to speed up this process.

Remove all of the bobby pins. Your curls should be both tight and should hold well. Using your fingers, gently shake the curls loose.

Spray your hair with hairspray. Hold the curls up as your gently mist the curls.
 Using a comb or a small teasing brush, gather the hair at the top of your head and gently tease the back of it.
 Using just your fingers (not a brush), gather your hair in a ponytail. Attempt to keep the crown of your head voluminous. The ponytail can be any height, depending on the look your want.
 Get the ponytail and wrap the hair around the elastic holding the ponytail together in order to create a bun. Using a second elastic, fasten the bun.
 Re-curl them, if desired.

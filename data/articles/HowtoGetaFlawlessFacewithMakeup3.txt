 Applying foundation to your lips is a good idea if yo will be using a bright or bold lipstick color. By applying foundation first, your lipstick will look brighter and bolder than just applying it to your bare lips.However, if you are applying a sheer lipstick or a nude, then applying foundation first is not necessary.


To apply foundation to your lips, use a foundation brush or blending sponge to pat it on over your closed lips. Make sure that you blend the color until it is even.
 To ensure that your lip color does not bleed, try using a lip liner in a color similar to your lipstick. You can also use a color that matches the natural color of your lips.Use the liner to define the outer edges of your lips.Go over your cupid’s bow with special care.

 Apply a couple of coats of lipstick to your lips and then press your lips together to provide even coverage. You don’t need a dramatic color to get flawless lips. Try going for a sheer color or a nude just to give your lips a nice pop of color.After you apply your lipstick, you can blot your lips with a tissue to remove any excess color. This will also help to ensure that your color lasts longer.
 If you have made any mistakes and the color will not wipe away, then you can always use concealer to cover them. Dab a bit of concealer onto a small makeup brush and use it to cover over the imperfection and blend the makeup. When you are done, your lips should look flawless.

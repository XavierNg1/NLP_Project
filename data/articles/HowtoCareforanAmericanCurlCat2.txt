 This breed comes in both long and short-haired varieties and has a smooth, silky coat that lies flat.This breed does not have an undercoat, which means it sheds very little. A short-haired American curl cat requires very little grooming and needs only to be combed once a week.Run the comb backwards through the short-haired cat’s coat to help remove dead hair., If you have a long-haired American curl cat, plan to brush its coat twice a week. This will help prevent the fur from matting and becoming tangled.Consider brushing a long-haired American curl cat more frequently during the warmer months, since it sheds more during this period., Be sure to check the American curl cat’s signature curled ears for dirt, redness, or odor.If you notice signs of infection like odor, redness, or swelling, talk to your veterinarian.
 If you notice dirt in your cat’s ears, clean them with a cotton ball or soft washcloth. Moisten the cotton ball or cloth in one part cider vinegar and one part warm water. Be gentle during cleaning so you do not hurt or damage the cartilage in its ears.Cotton swabs can damage the inner ear, so do not use them to clean your cat’s ears., If you notice eye discharge building up in the corner of your cat’s eyes, use a damp, warm cloth to wipe the area clean. After you wipe one eye, use a different portion of the cloth to wipe the other. This will help prevent bacteria or infection from spreading from one eye to the other., Your American curl cat’s nails should be trimmed every couple of weeks.Plan to trim its nails when the cat is sleepy and relaxed. Gently massage your cat’s paw’s for three seconds, and allow your cat to sniff the clippers before you begin. Clip only the white tip of the nails.Find a local groomer or ask your veterinarian to trim its nails if you do not wish to do this task at home.

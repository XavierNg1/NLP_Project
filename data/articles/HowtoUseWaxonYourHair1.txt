 Using a bit of wax on wet hair will help you keep any hairstyle in place. Either shampoo and condition your hair or use a spray bottle to get it thoroughly damp before applying wax.;
, Use a comb or brush to work through any knots and comb your hair out straight.
 Don't work with a larger amount of wax than this at a time, or you'll have trouble distributing it properly., Rub your palms together as though you were washing your hands. The wax will become warm and pliable.
 Use your palms and fingers to distribute it throughout your hair, all the way to the tips. If you need more wax, rub another pea-sized amount between your palms and distribute it.
 Style it in any way you want. The wax will help hold any style in place. Wax provides a more natural-looking hold than hair spray or mousse.

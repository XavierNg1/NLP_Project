 To navigate to the popup blocker, click Tools → Options → Privacy, and then check the "Block pop-ups" option.;
, Google Chrome should automatically block popups as a default setting, but you can make sure that the setting is enabled by clicking the Chrome menu, then clicking Settings → Show advanced settings → Content settings, and then checking the "Do not allow any site to show pop-ups" option.
 Open Safari, and then click Safari → Preferences → Security. Select the "Block pop-up windows” option.
 Like many other browsers, popup blocking should come already enabled. If, for whatever reason it isn't, navigate to Firefox → Preferences → Content, and then press the "Block pop-up windows" option.

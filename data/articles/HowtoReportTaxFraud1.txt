 The IRS is a relatively small governmental body compared to the size of the US population. Because it only audits about 1% of the population, it needs to choose its targets carefully.Help the IRS out by blowing the whistle on truly significant instances of tax fraud.


A multi-national company serially underreporting its income in order to pay fewer taxes is significant, but a babysitter failing to declare the $40 of income is not.The IRS is seeking solid and comprehensive information, not speculation or educated guesses. Tax fraud reporting is meant as a way to tackle serious fraud not to resolve personal disputes.
The IRS offers rewards for information, but often the amount in dispute must exceed $2 million, or the individual have an income of over $200,000 to qualify for a significant reward.
These guidelines reflect the IRSâ€™s desire to catch major tax offenders.;
, The main way to report suspected tax fraud to the IRS is by downloading and completing the relevant form from the IRS website.

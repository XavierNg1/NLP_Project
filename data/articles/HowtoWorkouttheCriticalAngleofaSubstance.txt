 The general form of Snell's Law is nxsinθx=nvacuumsinθvacuum, where n is the refractive index and θ is the angle of incidence or refraction.;
,, Let's say you are using glass with a refractive index of 1.50. Therefore, the critical angle is the angle which, when it is the angle of incidence, produces an emergent ray of 90°.


nglasssinθglass=nvacuumsinθvacuum





1.50sinθglass=1sin90°






sinθglass=2/3






θglass=41.8° (correct to 3 significant figures)

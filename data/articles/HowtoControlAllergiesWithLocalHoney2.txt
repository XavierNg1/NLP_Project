 Some have indicated that people do experience lighter allergy symptoms thanks to honey. Others have found little to no difference in symptoms between those who use honey and those who don’t.Keep your usual allergy medication on hand in case your honey proves to be ineffective.
 Consider it highly likely that you are allergic to weeds, grasses, and/or trees. Understand that bees chiefly pollinate flowers, and are therefore unlikely to come into contact with other kinds. Even if you are in the minority of people who are allergic to flowers, be aware that bees do not intentionally bring pollen back to their hive, and so their honey may not contain enough pollen to make a substantial impact on your immune system., When buying raw honey, understand that it has not been pasteurized, heated, or filtered. Raw honey may contain bacteria and mold, as well as bee venom and body parts.Do not consume raw honey if you are allergic to bee stings., Be aware that, in addition to other possible allergens like bee venom and body parts, raw honey may possibly contain concentrated amounts of the very pollen that you are allergic to. Understand that there is no way to control or distribute the amount of pollen in raw honey. If you are extremely susceptible to allergic reactions from even small traces of pollen, avoid using raw honey as a remedy.Discontinue use if you experience swelling, itching, or hives on your skin, in your mouth, or in your throat., Never give honey (whether it’s raw or processed) to infants. Beware of toxins that may cause botulism in babies, which can be life-threatening. Seek immediate emergency care if your child shows the following symptoms after ingesting honey:Constipation, lack of appetite, and weakened muscles evidenced by loss of appetite, listlessness, feeble crying, pronounced floppiness, and a lack of strong facial expressions.

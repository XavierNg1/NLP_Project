 Don’t dismiss your friend’s feelings or resort to using clichés, even if you don’t know what to tell them. Saying something like, “Everything happens for a reason,” or, “Come on, it’s not so bad,” will only make your friend feel worse. Take their sadness seriously and, if you don’t know what to say, stay quiet., Avoid reassuring your friend that everything will be fine, and don’t compliment them in an effort to cheer them up. When someone is feeling down in the dumps, telling them to look on the bright side won’t help, and compliments may just seem empty and fake.If your friend is upset about failing at something, it may be okay to remind them of their strengths in other areas. Don’t overdo it, though, and stay far away from false praise.
For instance, if your friend is upset about not getting into the college they wanted to attend, you could reassure them that they’re a great student and they aren’t defined by which college they go to. Don’t say they’re the best student in school if they’re not, though.
 Avoid talking about yourself and your own problems, even if you’ve faced similar issues as your friend. Derailing the conversation with a story about yourself won’t solve your friend’s problems – it will just make them feel like you aren’t listening to them., You can’t solve your friend’s problems for them, as much as you might want to. Offering advice might also make your friend feel like you’re brushing their feelings aside. Focus on helping them feel understood and supported instead.It’s fine to offer advice if your friend asks for it. Just don’t push your ideas on them when they’re feeling miserable.

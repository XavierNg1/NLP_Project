 High amounts of sugar have been shown to spike your blood sugar levels, which ultimately slows down the function of your brain and decreases focus. Avoid sugary breakfast foods like bright, sugary breakfast cereals, i.e., fruit loops, cocoa puffs, and cinnamon toast crunch. Also avoid toaster pastries, like pop tarts and toaster strudels. Other sugary breakfast foods to avoid are doughnuts, pastries, Nutella, sweetened yogurt, waffles, and pancakes.Eat healthier versions of these foods by making your own healthy substitutes. For example, you can make healthier pancakes by substituting the flour with oats and cinnamon, and by reducing the amount of sugar you put in the mixture or how much syrup you pour on top. You can also make your own muffins and pastries with whole grain flour instead of white flour, and sweeten them naturally with fruit, like blueberries.
 Processed fruit juices such as, apple, orange, grape, cranberry, and other juices, are shown to have high levels of sugar, and sometimes even higher than soda. Instead, make your own natural fruit juices. For example, squeezing fresh oranges in the morning is a healthy alternative.Make sure to limit juice to 4-6 oz per day, even when it is fresh squeezed. You won't benefit from the fiber in fruit if you are only drinking the juice.
 Gluten-free diets have become very trendy in the last couple of years, but there is no reason to eat gluten-free unless you have celiac disease. However, consuming many of the gluten-free processed breakfast foods can cause potential problems. For example, rice, potato, and tapioca flour replace the wheat flour in these products. These flours are shown to have a high glycemic index. This means they raise blood sugar rapidly. A rapid rise in blood sugar can cause an insulin spike and a resulting sugar crash. The side effects of a rapid rise in insulin are hindered focus, memory, and brain function.Watch out for gluten-free pancakes, muffins, and other baked goods.

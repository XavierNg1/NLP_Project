 Stack pieces of your greenery on top of eachother. The greenery will be the base of your wreath. You can make your bundles as thick as you want your base to be.Some greens that will work great for wreaths are fir, cedar and boxwood.You may need to use wire cutters to cut your greenery into uniform size pieces before you bundle them.
Depending on the type of greenery you use, you may have to remove excess twigs and branches.
Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands.
 Hold your bundle of greenery firmly against your wire base. Wrap your wire around your greenery and your wire base a few times to connect them securely. Continue adding bundles until your entire wire base is covered.


Greens tend to shrink as they dry. You can use needle nose pliers to pinch your wire tighter so that the greens don’t fall out as they shrink.
Spray the front of and back of your wreath with an anti-wilting plant protector spray to keep your greens fresh and stop them from shrinking.
 Use your wire to add on any decorations that will make your wreath look festive. Some great decorations to put in your wreath can include:


dried berries
pine cones
ribbons
christmas lights

, Hang your wreath where it can help spread Christmas cheer. You can put it on your door, your mantle piece or even the mailbox.


You can use sewing pins to secure plastic wrap to the back of your wreath to make sure your greens don’t damage the surface you display your wreath on.

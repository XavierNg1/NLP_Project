 You will need three flashlights, colored cellophane (red, green, and blue), three rubber bands, and a white wall. Try to use similar flashlights. This will help keep the intensity of each light roughly the same.A large sheet of white posterboard or several pieces of white copy paper can be used in place of a white wall.;
, Be sure to cover the lit side of the flashlight and secure it with a rubberband. You should have a red, green, and blue flashlight when you are finished.Test each light to make sure that it is projecting color.
 If you do not have a white wall available, tape a large piece of white paper on the wall. You could also use several sheets of white copy paper taped to the wall. Be sure that the roomâ€™s lights are turned off and the windows are covered.The room should be as dark as possible.

 Any time you'd normally use milk or yogurt for a meal or in your cooking, substitute kefir. Kefir makes an excellent base for sauces, and it can even be used in baking as a healthier dairy substitute. Consider these options:


Eat kefir with granola for breakfast.
Stir kefir into your coffee.
Make a yogurt grapefruit cake with kefir instead of yogurt.
 Coconut kefir can't always be used as a direct substitute for milk in recipes, but it has a variety of other wonderful uses, and is especially delicious when enjoyed plain. Try these ideas:


Make a coconut kefir smoothie by blending a cup of kefir, a banana, and a handful of berries.
Use coconut kefir as the base for a homemade pina colada.
Stir coconut kefir into soups and sauces to make them thick, rich and creamy.
 Water kefir is much lighter than other types of kefir, so you might find yourself drinking it all day long. Use it whenever you'd normally use water in recipes for soup. You can also flavor water kefir with fruit juice, mint, or other flavorings to make a tasty drink.

 Dehydrating carrots is a great way to preserve them for soups, stews and other recipes that are partially liquid.;
,, Cut off the carrot tops. Consider saving the peels and tops for making vegetable stock.
 A small dehydrator may only fit six carrots, while a large one with nine trays may be able to handle 30 or more large carrots.
 If you want to dehydrate them for soups or stews, then one-half inch (0.6cm) rounds are ideal. If you want to make carrot chips for a snack, try slicing to one-eighth inch (0.15cm) with a mandolin slicer.You can also grate the carrots, if you want to use grated carrots in recipes. They can be prepared in a similar way, but they may require less drying time.
,, Then, pour your carrot rounds into the basket.
, Try to leave a little bit of space between the carrot round, so that air can flow through. This will reduce drying time.
 Turn it on to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 Celsius).
 Check them at six hours and then every two hours after that. They should be dry, leathery and brittle when they are dehydrated.Thinly sliced chips will take six hours to dry.
 Keep them in a cool, dark place to preserve them. Add as needed to recipes.


The carrots will rehydrate after being placed in liquid for an hour or so.

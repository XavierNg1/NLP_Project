 If members of family are pressuring you to get married or find a serious romantic partner, it is important that you are honest and clear with them about why you are not marrying your partner or are not in a committed relationship. You might want to explain to them that you are waiting to meet the right person or that you and your partner are not yet ready for marriage. The more open you are with them, the better.If you’re partnered but not married, you might want to say things like “we’ll get married when we feel ready for it” or “we’re not that serious.”
If you are single, you might say something like “I’m waiting for the right person” or “I’m enjoying being single.”

, Although you might feel the urge to get upset with your family members, try not to lash out at them. The result will likely be that everyone’s feelings get hurt. Try to remember that these people care about you and that their pushiness is a result of their anxiety about you finding happiness.To play things off more casually, try making a joke or say something like “Is there someone that you’d want to set me up with?”

, If your family members are particularly pushy and try setting you up with someone that you are not interested in, you should definitely stand up for yourself and decline. You do not want to be cajoled into a relationship that you are not interested in. It is your life and you should be in the driver’s seat.If you are not interested in being set up, let your family members know that you want do to things your way.
 If you are unable to resolve your issues with your family, you may want to consider family counseling. This will allow you, and whichever family members are pressuring you, to work out your issues. Once you and your family members have gained a little insight, you may be more accommodating to each other’s views.

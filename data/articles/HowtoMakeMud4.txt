 The most ideal place is in an open, fertile dirt area without grass. Avoid dirt with stones, twigs, oil leaks, or other debris in it.
 If you want deep mud, first make deep grooves, channels, or holes in the dirt. Make the spaces evenly, but near each other.
 Occasionally, use a stick (or your hand) to stir the dirt-mud around so it'll absorb the water. Keep using your stick to check the mud until it's the desired texture.
 As the mud gets wetter, stir and check it more often. Enjoy!

 It is important to deal with the ink stain immediately. Blot the spot with a clean cloth or paper towels and apply a little pressure on it. Just blot and don't rub, since rubbing might spread the stain.

Work from the outside going towards the center and try to absorb as much ink as you can.
Change the cloth or paper towels when needed.
If the ink is already dry, it's still worth a try to remove it.
 Vinegar works wonders on ink stains. Its acetic properties allow it to remove stains effectively. Plus, it's safe to use, gentle on hands and environment friendly. Vinegar can be used on any type of couch, but it's a good idea to test it in a hidden spot just in case it causes damage., Combine 1 tablespoon of dish soap, 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and 1 cup of water in a small bowl.
 Rubbing too hard will cause the stain to spread. Let it sit for about 10 minutes.
 Use a soft cloth damped with cold water. Wipe the affected area thoroughly until the solution is completely gone.
 If the spot remains, repeat the process or try a different method for removing it.
 This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time.

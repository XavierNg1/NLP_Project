 Your shampoo and conditioner can’t straighten your hair automatically, but they can give you a leg up. Purchase hair products that guarantee “smoothing.” After conditioning your hair, use a paddle brush to evenly distribute the conditioner, before rinsing out your hair.When drying hair, do not rub your hair with a towel. Instead, gently pat hair to absorb the moisture.
Invest in a Deva Towel. This softer alternative to regular towels helps fight frizz.
 If you hear your hair sizzling, that means the hair is still damp and you should stop straightening immediately. If your hair is dry when you straighten it and you’re still not getting the results you want, you may be using too much product.Only apply product to damp hair, never dry hair. The iron traps the product in dry hair, causing you to boil the product inside your hair follicles.
The more heat you use on your hair, the less products you should use. Try to limit your product usage to one or two serums, applied directly to damp hair.
 If you’ve applied heat to your hair, allow it a couple of minutes to cool down. Spray your brush with your hair spray, then comb it through your hair for an even application., This method works best for those with hair that is frizzy, but not wavy. After your shower, put your hair in a ponytail. Twist your ponytail like a rope to wrap your hair into a bun. Secure your bun with an elastic and sleep with your bun in.In the morning, allow the hair to air dry for a few minutes before brushing the hair out.
Use a fabric elastic rather than a rubber band, so you won't be left with a crimp in your hair.

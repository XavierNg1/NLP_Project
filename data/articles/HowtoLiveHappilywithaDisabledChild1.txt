 With specialists constantly talking about "deficits" and "delays," it can be difficult to say "My child is capable too!" Take plenty of time to work together with your child, and also appreciate their individual strengths.


Work with them, not on them.
Buy toys related to their strengths and favorite things, not only toys to develop lagging skills.
Make sure therapy is fun and consensual.;
, A light atmosphere will help them enjoy therapy and other educational activities, making it easier for all parties.


Read books in silly voices.
Play games and talk about fun things to naturally pick up social skills.
Integrate your child's hobbies when doing therapy projects.
Find an occupational therapist who recommends play activities, such as animal walks or finger painting, that are specifically tailored to your child's needs.
 Teach your child that their disability is natural and acceptable, just like your son's peanut allergy or your love of high heels. This helps them know that they are not burdensome or broken.


Be factual and kind when explaining their disability.
Do not try to hide their disability or suppress symptoms such as stimmingâ€”this hurts the child's psyche.
Speak respectfully about other people's differences (disability, race, LGBT+, etc.), so your child learns that diversity is natural and okay.
 Knowing others like them will help boost their self-confidence and remind them that they can be strong and successful the way they are.


Make disabled friends.
Have your child join a disability group, such as the Special Olympics or a Deaf kids' group.
Bring your child books about disabled people like Helen Keller and Woodrow Wilson.
Read about disabled culture, such as Deaf culture or autistic culture.
 What helped them when they were children? What did they wish their parents did for them? What is their advice to you?

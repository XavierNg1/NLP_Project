Never assume that you are too young to set funds aside every month for when you retire. Ideally, you should start saving as soon as you start working. It's a good habit to get into.

Acquire a basic understanding of investments, and learn the importance of diversification. You don't want to put all your funds in just 1 venture. Instead, you should spread your funds along a mixture of assets, such as real estate, cash, bonds, stock and gold. Diversification is a great way of reducing your risk while growing your wealth.
 You should have car insurance, homeowner's insurance, life insurance and anything else that will cover you in the event of a disaster. Review all your policies and ensure that you are adequately covered at the best price.

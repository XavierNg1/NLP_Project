 Make sure you are pointing your toe, and be sure to use both legs equally so you don't become one-sided. If you want, hold on to a barre or a chair. Try doing two to the front, two to the side and two to the back on each leg.;
, Spend ten seconds holding each one. (You'll do two, right leg in front one time, left the other). Don't worry if you can't make it all the way down; you could do half splits or other stretches if you want to.
 Do some sautés, jetes, fame jumps, sissones, changements and basically any other jump! Make sure you do sautés and changements, particularly the latter.
 Never rush a warm up!

, Put your arms wherever they feel comfiest: bras bas, demi seconde or you hands on your waist.
 Point your toes, keep your head up, pull your tummy in, turn your legs out and stretch your knees. The key to an enormous jump is to do an enormous plie to begin with.
 This just exaggerates the move and makes it look more professional.
 Keep your arms still and a professional look on your face (a smile usually works!). Make sure the foot is pointed.
 Make a plie so as not to jar your body, and stretch. As tempting as it may be, when you plie, don't stick your behind out; it looks so bad!

, Make it look easy! Blowing your cheeks out and clenching your fists won't work! Imagine you're a swan, calm and tranquil. Keep your upper half of you body completely still.

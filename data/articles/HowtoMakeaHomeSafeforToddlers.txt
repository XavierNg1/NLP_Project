 Keep heavy items locked away or well out of their reach. If oven doors are not lockable, buy a latch to keep them shut unless you want to watch your child at all times when baking.;

 If your toddler is the curious type, an open door is an open invitation to trouble. Make sure you close and lock any doors to the outside or to unsafe areas. Use baby gates to help you close off dangerous areas that don't have doors, including stairways. Supervise children well when they're roaming around.

 Toddlers will trip and fall often, but will do so less if the floor is clean and free of debris. Vacuuming and dusting often will also prevent toddlers from getting as many allergic reactions and other respiratory illnesses.

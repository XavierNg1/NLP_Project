 This includes a skein of yarn and a crochet hook between 3.25mm and 6mm (a smaller hook leads to tighter stitches). If you have never crocheted before, you may want to consult How to Crochet.
 Size can be further adjusted if you want a bigger or smaller bow tie.









Begin with a standard crochet slip-knot, then chain 30.
Turn, then single crochet 29 back to the end.
Turn, then crochet 30 to the other end.
Repeat until the bow tie is the width that you want. This will probably be 12-15 rows, depending on the size of your hook.
 Fold the ends in to meet each other in the middle, then stitch the ends together with thread or glue them with hot glue.










Pinch the middle of your fabric to make a bow shape.
Wrap a single strand of yarn around 18-25 times or until youâ€™re happy with the width of the center section. Tie the end of the yarn securely in the back of the bow and tuck the exposed knot under some of the loops.
 Using hot glue or needle and thread, attach a clip to the bow tie. Alternately, you can attach the bow tie to elastic that has been cut to the size of the neck of the person who will be wearing the bow tie.

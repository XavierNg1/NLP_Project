 Draw them toward the bottom of the page to leave space in the upper part of the page for the slipper's ribbons, or even someone with the slippers on their feet.;
, These will serve as the interior of the slipper.
 Make all four ribbons knotted into one bow, as shown. Try to twist the ribbons around each other as much as you can to make them look fancier or more intricate. Remember: it's okay to erase as long as you try again.
 Make the shape of the slippers slimmer, and put lines in the interior where the foot would have pressed down. (This is especially important if you want to make your slippers appear used.)

, Use a modular line (which passes from thick to thin line in a single drawing for realistic effect). Erase the pencil. Add color.


Of course the standard color for ballet slippers is pink, but you can give yours any color or patterns that you'd like.

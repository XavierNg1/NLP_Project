 Do not add your clothes or detergents just yet. Try to use hot water, if your clothes can handle it.Avoid using hot water if the how-to-wash tags caution against it.
 Stir the ingredients together with a wooden spoon or your hand.If you have sensitive skin, consider wearing a pair of rubber gloves so that the solution doesn't irritate you.
 Make sure that the washing soda and detergent are completely dissolved first.
 Once the cycle is done, take the clothes out and inspect them for stains. If you need to, reapply a stain-removable treatment, and wash the clothes again. If you put stained clothes into a dryer, the heat will set the stain.

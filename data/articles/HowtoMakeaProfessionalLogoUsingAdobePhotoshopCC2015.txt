 Choose colors that go well together, but are not complimentary (ex. the wikiHow logo). Avoid sending the wrong message with your colors; often red and green color schemes, for example, get labeled by the viewer as Christmas oriented, while blue and orange can be a little hard on the eyes.;
, Give it an easy name to remember. For a standard logo, make the project 11 inches (27.9 cm)  by 8.5 inches. If your logo is being printed out, change the color mode to CMYK 8bit.
 Make sure that the rectangles you use are rounded rectangles, as hard lines in a logo do not look professional.


Select the Rectangle tool. Click on this tool and hold it untill a window pops up with different tools that can be selected.
Choose either the circle tool or the rectangle tool and draw different shapes, making sure that you add a new layer between each shape, or else you will get a solid that has colors that can't be changed.
, Do this by selecting the text tool or pressing T on your keyboard. Click on where you want to place your text and then type in the name of whatever product or company you are making the logo for. Scale, recolor, and resize the text to make it look how you want it to.
 For this example, a question mark was used to indicate what this site will help you do. Find something and add it into your design. Try to avoid big complicated line drawings and make sure the background of everything is always transparent.

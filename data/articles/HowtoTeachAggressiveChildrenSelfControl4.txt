 “Hide and seek”, “Tag”, gymnastics are also good ways to spend energy. These activities reduce negative emotions.


After active games, step up to relaxation, even only for a minute. Offer your kid to lay down or just sit, everything that can ensure resting.
Rotate motion with relaxation. This process will teach your kid to control consciously his/her behavior and emotional state.
Before sleep or bathing you can gently massage the back, legs, arms and face of your kid. Before that talk to him/her with quiet calm voice. Children over 2 years love to be massaged as a form of game.

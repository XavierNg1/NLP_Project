 The BBB is the most famous consumer protection bureau in the U.S. You can report online at their website.


Click on the name of your county and enter your zip code.
Click on "Get Consumer Help" at the top of the website, then select "File a Complaint" from the drop-down menu.
If you do not have access to the Internet, call the BBB headquarters at 1-703-276-0100 to file a complaint over the telephone.
 The complaint will ask for basic information including contact information (for you and the business) as well as details about your complaint.


You will answer preliminary questions such as the category of complaint (vehicle, cell phone, or business product or service) and then whether you are a retired or active service member or a civilian employee of the Department of Defense.
You can search for the business by name and zip code. Then select the business from the list.
You will likely be redirected to a city or state BBB to actually file your complaint. At the website you will be asked to state your problem as well as your desired outcome and settlement.
Do not include personal information such as your Social Security number.
 Even if you choose not to meet with the agentâ€™s managing supervisor or broker, you can still inform him of the complaint. The BBB will send the complaint to them within two weeks.


If you have met with the broker and did not receive the relief you wanted, complaining to the BBB is the next logical step.

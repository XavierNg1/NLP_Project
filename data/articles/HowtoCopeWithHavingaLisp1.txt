 This is called an interdental lisp. When you have this kind of lisp, you make the “th” sound for “s” and “z” sounds in words when you speak. Interdental lisps often occur in young children and can be corrected if caught early enough., This is called a dentalized lisp. Your teeth will touch your two front teeth when you try to say “s” or “z” sounds in words. This type of lisp is common in young children and often goes away as the child gets older.Doing speech therapy and getting dental treatment can also improve this type of lisp.
 You may also notice air escapes outside the sides of your tongue, making the wet or slushy sound when you try to say words with the “s” or “z” sound. This is called a lateral lisp. A lateral lisp needs to be addressed with speech therapy so it can improve., Your tongue may touch your soft palate, or the roof of your mouth, when you try to say “s” or “z” sounds. This is called a palatal lisp. This type of lisp should be treated with speech therapy.Both lateral and palatal lisps are considered more severe than interdental and dentalized lisps. You may need to try several different treatments for lateral and palatal lisps to cope with them well.

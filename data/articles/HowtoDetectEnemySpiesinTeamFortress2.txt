 Spies can disguise themselves as a member of your team. Doing so gives them the name of a player on your team of the same class. For example, if a pyro on your team is named "Fireguy", and the spy disguises himself as a pyro, his name is likely to be "Fireguy". They can also become invisible for a short amount of time. They carry a revolver and a knife as weapons, and a knife attack from behind will always be fatal. A spy loses their disguise when they attack. They can place sappers on engineer buildings. These sappers disable the building and then drain their health, destroying them if not removed. Spies do not lose their disguise when placing sappers.;
, "Teammates" with your name are certainly spies, as no two people with the same name can be on the same server at the same time. Spies disguised as medics will not have an Ubercharge meter. (360 and PS3 only!) Also, you cannot cause damage to a teammate. If you see a friendly pyro catch a "teammate" on fire, that person is a spy. You will be able to pass through teammates, but spies will be a wall. If a friendly spy is cloaked, you will see a faint outline. If a "friendly" spy appears out of thin air, he is in fact an enemy. Also, when leaving a teleport, people's feet will glow the color of their true team. A blue sniper with a red glow is a spy. (360 and PS3 only!)

, Spies can backstab you, and if they are good at it, they probably will. If a teammate seems a little too "chummy", shoot him.
 An inexperienced spy will often stay near his teammates despite being disguised as your team. This is a dead giveaway.
 However, don't go overboard with this, as is can really annoy other players.
 If you see a spy cloaked, immediately try to shoot where they are or run into them. Shooting them or colliding with them causes temporary malfunctions in the cloak.
 The Dead Ringer allows the Spy to fake his death and escape. Listen to the sound of a Dead Ringer decloaking to see if the Spy is actually dead.

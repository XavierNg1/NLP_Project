 Many municipal areas now offer weekly pickup of recyclable materials. Max out the amount of items that you recycle, since any items that are recycled are items that will not end up in the garbage bin.;
, Turn it periodically and take such other steps as may be needed to make it compost efficiently and not harbor pests or otherwise become a nuisance.
 Many municipal areas offer monthly bulk trash pickup. If you have items that are not considered garbage and are not recyclable, these items may be placed out for pickup for the monthly trash pickup. These items will also not end up in your garbage bin.
 If your garbage collector offers them as an option, buy and use their plastic garbage bags for your garbage pickup instead of buying weekly pickup with a garbage bin. In using bags, you will only place one at the curb if you have need to do so that week. If you do not have a full bag of garbage for a particular week, you will wait until you have a full bag before placing it out for pickup. You may be able to go several weeks before you have need to place a bag out for pickup, because of steps 1 and 2, doing so on an as-needed basis. In this way, you can avoid having to pay for weekly garbage pickup, if you do not have the garbage volume to justify it.

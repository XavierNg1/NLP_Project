 For this you'll need:


Five gallon plastic bucket
Wooden or metal dowel rod
Tin or aluminum can
Peanut butter or desired bait
Small wooden plank long enough to ramp from the ground to the top of the bucket

, Make sure the holes are big enough for the dowel to fit through., Be careful of any jagged edges created by drilling the hole.
 Make sure the dowel fits securely and won't come loose with some jostling. The mouse will probably try to crawl along the dowel to get to the bait.
 If you'd like to kill the mice, fill the bottom few inches with water or leave it empty for a live release option.

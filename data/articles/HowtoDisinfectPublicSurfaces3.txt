 Always do a visual inspection of potential eateries.


Scanning the room for rats, cockroaches, and raw sewage might save one the time one would spend attempting to develop a filth-avoidance strategy.
Select a seat at the most obviously hygienically sound table/booth/bar stool available (after a through search for leftover food particles, dead animals ).
Ensure silverware and dishes are clean, and that one never utilizes the napkins or other disposable wear that has already contacted a public surface or previously inhaled atmosphere.

For example, the napkins in the middle of the stack are more desirable than those at the top or bottom.


Avoid sitting too close to others, finger-slurping, double dipping, consuming comestibles from public eating dishes, and sharing in general.

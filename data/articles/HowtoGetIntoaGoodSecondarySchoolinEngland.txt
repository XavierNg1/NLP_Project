 Around September to October of the year before you hope to join the new school, you'll want to go to Open Evenings or Open Days. These are evenings where the school is opened especially for prospective students to visit the school and take a look around.;
, Make sure you organise the dates and get to the evenings with plenty of time to look around - you don't want to be rushed. Take time to look around different subjects and look at course content and previous student's work.
 Make sure you bring your parents along and pay close attention to what the Head tells you about the school.
 This could be good grades at GCSE; the extra-curricular activities they offer or which school is closest to you. Make sure to compare the different schools.
 If you've decided you want to get into a Grammar School (this is a school in which you have to pass exams to attend) make sure you have prepared for the exams. This could be doing practice tests with your parents or revising things such as verbal reasoning or maths.
 You'll need to ask your parents or legal guardians to do this for you.
, You'll need to apply to at least three different schools. Ensure that you meet any relevant residential requirements.
 Check with your local council to find out when applications open. Ask your parent/guardian to do this.


The earlier you apply, the more likely you'll get your first choice of secondary school.
 Remember that it isn't just about which school you go to. If you want to achieve, you'll need to put in effort yourself. You can go to what is considered a 'worse' school and do better than somebody who goes to what is considered a 'good' school but slacks off. If you try your hardest, you will succeed.

 Look for the following sorts of problems:


Cracks, splits, chips, and splinters

Insect infestation or damage, signs of borer (very important!)
Stains or marks
Odours
Sharp edges

Repairs - are they solid, do they reduce the value of the item
Missing pieces.;
, If you cannot check them, seek reassurance from the seller that they work and that you can return them if they do not when you try them at home.


Ask what guarantees and/or returns policies there are.
 Don't just assume it's all good on the outside.
 Do this with care in case they break though!

, You don't want to buy something that will be too difficult or too expensive to fix or improve.

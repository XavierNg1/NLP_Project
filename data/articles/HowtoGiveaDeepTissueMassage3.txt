 Starting above the ankle on the back of the leg, use your forearm to add pressure to your strokes. Your forearm should be across the leg, and you add pressure with your body weight. Move up the back of the calf and thigh, and rest your arm for a moment just under the glutes. Sweep your arm in a fluid motion around the hip., Place your hands on either side of the calf with your thumbs in the middle of the calf, one behind the other. While applying pressure, move your thumbs up the calf, staying in the groove in the middle.The muscle along the back of the calf is actually one muscle, the gastrocnemius muscle, but it has two heads. That means that there's a groove down the middle of it for your thumbs to follow.
Alternatively, you can use your knuckles.
 Starting at the elbow with the person on their back, move up the arm toward the shoulder with the heel of your hand. Use your body weight to help apply pressure.You can also use your knuckles on the arm to apply pressure. Use small circular motions.
 With your thumb on one side and the rest of your fingers on the other side of the forearm (inside/outside), apply pressure on both sides. Move your hand up the arm towards the elbow.You can also use both thumbs on the top of the forearm. Have your thumbs in a single line, not next to each other. Applying pressure, run them up the middle of the forearm.
 Have both thumbs next to each other on the inside of the wrist. Move them together slowly over the wrist and up along the lifelines in the hand. Pay special attention to the muscled areas, including the area around the base of the thumb.

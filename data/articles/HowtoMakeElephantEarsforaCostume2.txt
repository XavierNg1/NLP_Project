 Grey is the best color for an elephant. Silver is another option for a "shiny" elephant., It needs to be wide enough to sit soundly and hold the ears and trunk.

Tape the end of this circle together under your chin. It can help to have someone else do this; if not, fit in front of a mirror.
 Attach a piece of elastic to one side, then attach another piece to the opposite side. This forms the tie that goes behind your head.

Knot this so that when it's around your head, it won't fall off.
 It's best to draw on paper first, in case you make an error. At the straight side (the part that attaches to the circle strip), add a small flap for each ear to enable easy attachment. Be sure to make a right facing ear and a left facing ear. Add little curve cuts (waves) at the base to emulate the elephant ear shape and keep the sides curved.

Cut these out and use them as templates.
 Trace around, then cut out the elephant ear., This is very simple. Draw a block-letter T in the appropriate proportion to the ears. Cut out the large T., Do this as follows:

Bend the top of the T over. Align this with the circle strip, above and in the middle of where you have already stapled on the elastic. Glue, tape or staple in place.
Being guided by the placement of the trunk, attach the right ear on the right and the left ear on the left. Again, tape, glue or staple them in place.
 Make any adjustments needed and it's ready to wear.

 If your power steering fails while you are moving at high speed, your first instinct will be to panic. Instead, turn on your flashers and honk your horn to let other drivers know you are having sudden car problems. This will cause them to get out of your way.
 Do this as carefully as you can; without power, it will be much harder to steer your car.
 Slamming the brakes may throw the car into a skid that would be difficult to steer out of with power steering and almost impossible to steer out of without it.









If your car's power steering goes out because of the engine stalling, your brakes will feel stiffer if you have power brakes, forcing you to hit the pedal harder and depress it lower than normal. You may also have to downshift to a lower gear or use the friction of a guardrail, gravel shoulder or cement divider to slow the car enough for the brakes to do the rest.
 Turn the steering wheel in either direction to see how well it turns. If it turns as freely as usual, pull back onto the roadway and continue driving as normal. If it doesn't, either drive slowly to the nearest mechanic or call for a tow truck.

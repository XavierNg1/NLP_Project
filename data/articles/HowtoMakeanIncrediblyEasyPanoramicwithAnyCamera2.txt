 When you copy your photos from your camera to your computer, take a look at them and choose at least four.


Make sure all four have similar brightness and sharpness and none of them are blurry or have white spots.
It’s recommended to use at least four photos to merge, but if you like, you can make a panorama with as few as two.
 Make sure all of them are open in tabs on the right-hand side.


If you have some adjustments to make in the individual photos, now is the time to make them.
 Go to File and select Automate>Photomerge. The Photomerge dialogue box will appear where you have to click Add Open Files.


On the left-hand side, you can choose various layouts of your future panoramic picture.
When you’re done, simply click OK, and you now have your panoramic picture.
 Sometimes the panoramic picture may be a bit crooked with leaning edges. If this happens, simply crop your image until you’re satisfied.

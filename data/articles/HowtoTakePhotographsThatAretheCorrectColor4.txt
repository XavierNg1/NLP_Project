 Too much brightness can wash out a picture as too much flash. Just like adding white paint to any color on a painting the same thing can happen to pictures when using flash and changing the exposure higher. At their worst the whole picture will be a white square.


However lowering of the exposure can be used to reduce the washing out of colors in pictures when the flash is used. You can also experiment with different flash speeds on your camera depending on your model and type your using. Also experiment with varying amounts of exposure and make note which ones work the best.
Too low exposure can be just as bad as too much. Many underexposed photographs are dull grayed out and lifeless.
When dealing with items with light, whether it's a firework video or a light up skyscraper, keep your exposure low to avoid the "light flare blur". Also when dealing with sunsets and sky photos lowering the exposure keeps the details of clouds and the landscape clear and pushes the sky nicely into the background. The same goes for any reflective or metallic surfaces. Adjust shooting scenes with lowest exposure first and adjust the exposure higher to figure out.
Flash can also do amazingly strange things for some pictures. Try it in a dark landscape picture and the little minute details of the clouds in the sky become very clear as well as the gradients of brightness in the sky. Low exposure flash pictures with lots of adjusting or experimenting can lead to amazing pictures with sharp detail.
Flash can also cause the very common culprits in photography as well. In portraits using the wrong flash or using it incorrectly can cause the dreaded red eye. Flash can also kill critical details in textural, macro photography as well.

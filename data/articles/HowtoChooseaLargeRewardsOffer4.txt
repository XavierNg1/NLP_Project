 You will lose ground by paying interest or "late fees" because of missed payments, late payments, or partial payments.


Do not use the card for installment purchases.
Pay off the full statement balance each month.
Make your payments consistently on time.
 Do not pay by mail unless you can mail the payment well in advance of the due date. Be aware of late fees and interest rates for unpaid balances. These costs are typically very high. It's always best to pay off your full balance every month. If you can't do that, be sure to make at least the minimum required payment for the month. Failing to do that is very costly in terms of fees, interest, and damage to your credit rating.
 If you're not completely satisfied with the card, place a reminder to cancel it before the next year's annual fee is charged. You may have to ask the company what that date is.

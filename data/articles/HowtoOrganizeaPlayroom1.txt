 Spread them out on the playroom floor so you can get an idea of what you're dealing with.
 This might sound like a Herculean task, but there are some methods, listed below, that you can use to convince your kids to get rid of some of their toys.

Show them how much they have. Indicate toys they haven't played with in a long time; tell them that other children would be happy to have those toys and (if they're little) that the toys will get to make new friends and start a happy new life.
Remind them of how difficult it is to play in a cluttered room. In a cluttered room there's no space for them to set up a dollhouse or a toy train track. They might trip and they can't move around well, and they might lose their favorite stuffed animals under a pile of other stuff.
Tell them that giving away toys that are "too young" for them or toys they just don't play with will make room for newer, more interesting toys they might get for their birthday or Christmas.
Tell them that giving things up is a part of growing up and being a big kid.
Stay side-by-side with them the whole time to keep their spirits up and encourage them. Try to make it as pleasant an experience as you can.
Start small; ask them to find five or ten toys (depending on how many they have) that they would be okay with giving up.
 Praise them and tell them how proud you are, and that they've made a big step in growing up. If they seem sad about it or you feel like they've earned a special treat, take them to get ice cream or get them a toy they've wanted for some time (and tell them that they can have it because there's enough space now).

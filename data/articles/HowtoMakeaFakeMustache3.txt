 You can make a fake mustache that sticks to your upper lip. You can get the supplies you need at a local craft store. You will need the following:A piece of cloth
A pen or pencil
Black paint a paint brush
An x-acto knife
Double-sided sticky tape

, You can draw whatever shape you prefer. Use your pen or pencil to carefully draw the shape on a piece of white cloth.If your pen or pencil is not working on the cloth, you may need one with a thicker tip or darker ink.
 Use your x-acto knife to do so. Cut around the edges of the mustache. You should be left with a piece of cloth in the shape of a mustache.Make sure to lay something down, like a stack of papers, underneath the cloth when you cut. You do not want want to cut into a table with an x-acto knife.
Be very careful with an x-acto knife. Do not touch the blade, as it is very sharp, and make sure you handle it with care. If you're not comfortable using the knife yourself, ask a parent for help.
 Use your black paint. Place the mustache on a piece of scrap paper. Paint the mustache black.The color is optional. While many fake mustaches are a shade of black, you can also use brown or gray. If you want, you could do an unusual color like yellow or green.
Wait for the mustache to dry before proceeding. How long this takes varies depending on the type of paint you used.
 Take a piece of double-sided sticky tape. Place it on the non-painted side of the mustache. You should attach it to the middle of the mustache.You can now stick the mustache to your face. Simply place the mustache on your upper lip, just below your nose.
The sticky tape may lose strength over time. You may have to periodically replace the tape.

 The volume for any prism can be found by using the formula V=Ah{\displaystyle V=Ah},where V{\displaystyle V} equals the volume of the prism, A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of one base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the prism.

The base of a prism is one of its congruent sides. Since all opposite sides of a rectangular prism are congruent, any side can be used as the base, as long as you are consistent in your calculations.
;
, If you do not know the volume, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you know the volume of the prism is 64 cubic meters (m3{\displaystyle m^{3}}), then your formula will look like this:64=Ah{\displaystyle 64=Ah}


, To find the area, you need to know the length and width of the base (or of one side, if the base is a square). Use the formula A=lw{\displaystyle A=lw}. To find the area of a rectangle.

For example, if the base is a rectangle with a length of 8 meters and a width of 2 meters, to find the area you would calculate:A=(8)(2){\displaystyle A=(8)(2)}A=16m2{\displaystyle A=16m^{2}}


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if you found the area of the base to be 16 square meters, then your formula will look like this:64=16h{\displaystyle 64=16h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 64=16h{\displaystyle 64=16h}, you would need to divide each side by 16 to find h{\displaystyle h}.Thus:6416=16h16{\displaystyle {\frac {64}{16}}={\frac {16h}{16}}}4=h{\displaystyle 4=h}So, the height of your rectangular prism would be 4 meters.

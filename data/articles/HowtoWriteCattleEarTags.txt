 Layer a table with at least three sheets of newspaper, equip it with a few paper towels for blotting the pen on, and gather the marker and blank tags.


You will need a marker specifically for cattle tags or the dye will wear off.;
, To have each cow's number fit on its tag, number will need to be written tall and narrow. Note how each number is uniform in height and also width., Do this by shaking it vigorously and then pressing the end of it hard into the paper towels. This will let down the ink into the tip of it.

This procedure is also helpful for when the tip starts to dry up.
 Mentally envision the number layout before you start, remembering that each number should be as large as possible while retaining great readability.


Remember to write a duplicate tag number for calves, if necessary.
Write a few tag numbers beyond what you'll need. These will come in handy for next time you need tags (this way you'll know what number at which to start).
 This will help the ink to last longer and also make the numbers more readable from a distance.

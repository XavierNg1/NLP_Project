, This latter form fits the quadratic form of ax^2 + bx + c, in that a = 1, x = x, b = -b and c = -b^2.
,


Collecting and simplifying, we have {x1, x2} = (b ± sqrt(b^2 + 4b^2)) / 2.






Further collecting and simplifying, we have {x1, x2} = (b ± sqrt(5b^2)) / 2.
 Adding the squares of these numbers results in 3. The added squares are always 3 times the square of b. At any rate, we have successfully determined the numeric Golden Mean from the geometric Golden Mean.


If b = -1, root x1 = .61803399 and root x2 = -1.61803399 and we have again determined the Golden Mean numerically from its geometric roots.
 It explains how to convert the Golden Mean from its Geometric Version to its Numeric Version, which is the point of this article.

 There are 19 horizontal and vertical lines. You can use a board or make a grid yourself.


Sometimes smaller boards are used. Often 13x13 or 9x9 boards are used for quicker games or for teaching.
There should be nine marked points spread out evenly on the board (4rd, 10th, and 16th lines). They are called "star points" and serve as reference points or markers for handicap games.;
, This amount is for a 19x19 game. The number correlates to the amount of intersections on the board. If you are playing on a smaller board, use fewer stones.


Black plays with 181 stones and white with 180. This is because black makes the first move.
Keep the stones next to the board, in bowls.

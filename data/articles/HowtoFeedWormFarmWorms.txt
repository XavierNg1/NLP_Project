 Just like any pet or animal in your care, the feeding always goes better when it's what the animal wants! Worms are really happy to consume the following:


Most fruit and vegetable scraps (see the exceptions in the next step).






Waste from your juicer (but not citrus).






Cardboard boxes - be sure to soak them first and tear into small pieces).






Paper, tissues, paper tickets, etc.






Your hair - give all hairbrushes a good weekly clean and give the worms your hair!






Coffee grounds.







Eggshells.






Banana skins (these are especially enjoyed).






Leaves.





;
, There are some things that your worms don't like or can even cause them harm. Do not feed worms the following food:


Any fruit that is very acidic - basically, don't give them tomatoes, any fruit from the citrus family, or kiwifruit. Some tropical fruits may also be too acidic.
Onion skins.
Dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, cream.
Pasta.
Bread, buns, cake.
Meat, fish.

Spicy food.
 Keep an eye on their consumption rate, however, as this will determine how often you need to replenish their food supply.


The amount of food needed can vary from season to season

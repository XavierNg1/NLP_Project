 Brooders can be made out of anything such as cardboard/plastic boxes, children's pool, cage, etc. Your best bet is starting off with a cardboard box or making your own wooden box.;
, The brooder will need to be sheltered away from wind, rain, snow and the sun. The best place to keep a brooder is in a shed, garage or basement. Keep it out of reach of young children and dangerous pets., The bedding should be soft, absorbent and non-slippery. A good material to use is hay, straw, wood shavings or paper towels. Avoid using newspaper as this is a slippery material that can cause leg problems in chicks and isn't absorbent enough.
 Acquire a small shallow bowl and fill it up with water. If the water bowl is a bit deep place some marbles inside which will help avoid chicks drowning and encourages the chicks to drink. You can purchase a chick feeder or drinker which is better. Always keep chicks on a chick starter feed., Chicks require heat for the first few weeks when they are born. You can purchase a bulb that keeps a high temperature but with a heat lamp you can choose the temperature yourself. Be sure the temperature is at 95 degrees and lower it by 5 degrees every week until it reaches room temperature.

 You will be fashioning regular photographs to look like Polaroids, so you can use any digital photographs that you own.


Photographs from the application Instagram are already in a square form and can be printed as is.
 You can also print them inexpensively at a kiosk or using an online picture printing service.
 You can also cut them down to this size after they are printed.
 Look for neodymium magnet paper. This type of magnet may be more expensive than standard magnet craft sheets; however, it can hold up considerably more weight than standard models.
 This is approximately the size of a single Polaroid sheet, including white space.
 Make sure not to touch the tape too much before application, or it will lose its stickiness.
 Press on the photograph to firmly attach it to the magnet sheet. You will leave extra space at the bottom for writing.


If you are worried about aligning the photo correctly onto the magnet paper, practice before you affix the double stick tape. Trace around the top corners with the pencil. Align the corners again once you have tape on the back.
 You can use different colored markers for more lively illustrations. Place the magnets on a metallic surface.

 Start from the city of Morthal, and from there, take the road south and turn eastwards. Keep on walking along this course and turn right around the first corner that leads to the south. Stick to this small road and you’ll be able to come across the entrance to the Labyrinthian, an abandoned city in ruins.;
, Make your way through the Labyrinthian up to its third level, called the Labyrinthian Tribune. Inside this chamber you’ll find a dragon priest named Morokei who’s wielding a staff called the Staff of Magnus; kill him.


Range weapons like bow and arrows, and magic spells are very effective against Morokei. Close combats like swords or axes can damage the priest too but will not be as effective. Also, avoid the shock spells that he’ll cast at you as these will deal severe damage on you.
 Once Morokei is defeated, approach and search Morokei’s ashes to retrieve his mask and the Staff of Magnus.
 After killing Morokei, you’ll find a door inside the Labyrinthian Tribune that leads back to the outside world. Exit through this door and head back to Winterhold, taking the northeastern road from where you are.

 Trichomoniasis is a parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract and causes diarrhea in cats. In many cases, this diarrhea may be uncontrollable, meaning your cat cannot make it to a litter box, or it causes the cat to go to the bathroom more frequently. The diarrhea may also include blood or mucus.If your cat has diarrhea that does not clear up quickly, no matter what the cause is, then it should be seen by a veterinarian. Diarrhea that continues for more than a day or two can be life threatening to a cat.
 While Trichomoniasis can occur in any aged cat, it is more likely to occur in cats that are under a year old. If you have a young cat that has severe diarrhea, you should have it seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible.Diarrhea can be a very serious health problem for very young cats in particular. Even one day of serious diarrhea can threaten a kitten's life.
 If you suspect that your cat has Trichomoniasis, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. Tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms and when they started, and allow your veterinarian to do a thorough examination of your cat. If your veterinarian suspects Trichomoniasis, they will then test your cat's feces to look for the parasite.


Tests that your veterinarian may use for diagnosis may include a saline diluted direct fecal smear, inoculation into a testing pouch, or DNA extraction and testing.Testing your cat's feces will take some time.

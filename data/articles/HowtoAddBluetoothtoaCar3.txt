 If your head unit can’t use a Bluetooth receiver, you can always use a separate Bluetooth car kit. You can purchase one from your local car accessories store or from the Internet starting at $50.
 Unlike Bluetooth receivers, a car kit can function all on its own. Just connect it to your car’s cigarette lighter port for power, or if it comes with rechargeable batteries, you can just clip it on your windshield visor.
 Press the Power button on the kit to switch it on and your mobile device should be able to detect and connect to it. You can start playing music from your MP3 players or even accept phone calls.

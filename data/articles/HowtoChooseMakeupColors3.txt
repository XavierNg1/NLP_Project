 If you have a medium or deep brown skin tone, you may want to try lipstick in a bright color like bright pink, bright purple, or bright red. Bright colors will pop against your skin tone and enhance the warm undertones of your complexion.Try to maintain a balance of color on your face by wearing a bold lipstick color with paired down eyeshadow and foundation. If you go for a bright eyeshadow look, you may wear lipstick in a more neutral color like nude or light pink.
 Lighter skin tones, such as fair, or olive, look good with lipstick in light pink, nude, or light purple. These shades will not overwhelm your pale skin tone and will add warmth to your face., If you feel your lips are small and you would like to enhance them, you can try using lipstick that is pearlescent or metallic, as they will add shine and depth to your lips. You may also try lipstick in light colors like pink, peach, or beige so your lips are not overwhelmed by a bright, dark color.Another trick is to use a lip pencil to create a new lip line outside of your natural lip line. Try to go no further than 3mm out. Make sure the line is precise and even. You can then color in your lips with the lip pencil or with lipstick that is the same shade as the lip pencil.

 Cover letters should not be longer than one page, single-spaced. In most cases, you should get some kind of word-count to shoot for, which may be shorter or longer, depending on the purpose of the letter. Always defer to the guidelines you receive.


If you don't get a word-count guideline, just focus on making one or two good points about yourself, and keeping it at that. No need to drone on four several pages.
 Addressing letters to, "All concerned" or "Sir or Madam" makes your letter look strange and like a computer wrote it. If you're applying, but don't know who is going to read it, leave off the salutation at the beginning and title the document instead, so it will be clear.


Instead of a salutation, write, "Letter of Application" at the top left corner of the page, or put it in the header on the left side at the top.
If you do have a contact, address it to them, making sure the name is spelled correctly. Then space down and start the body of the letter.
 Cover letters should always be word processed and single-spaced. Use a normal, standard font, like Calibri or Times New Roman. Avoid childish looking or gimmicky fonts, like Comic Sans when you're applying for jobs and school applications.
 When you get to the end of your letter, add a space, then include a closing, like "Sincerely" and sign your name.


Sometimes, it's appropriate to type your name, then print out the letter and sign it in pen. That can be a nice touch., The following contact information should be included in the header of the document, usually over to the right margin:


Your name
Mailing address
E-mail
Telephone and/or fax number

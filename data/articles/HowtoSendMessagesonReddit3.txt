 The official reddit app is in active development with regular updates, and many users still use one of several unofficial apps. On some versions of the Android apps, you can reach the messaging inbox by touching the envelope icon in the top right.
 If you do not see an envelope icon on Android, swipe left to open the navigation drawer. Select the envelope icon on the list.
 The official reddit app for iOS places the envelope icon at the bottom edge of the screen.
 Instead of browsing through inbox options, you can send a message from someone's reddit name instead. The layout varies with each app, but this is the general process:


Select the username written in small letters just underneath or above a post. If you don't see one, tap the post or the "..." expansion button first.
Tap the envelope icon or the "send a message" button.
Type your message and hit "send" to deliver the message to the username you selected.

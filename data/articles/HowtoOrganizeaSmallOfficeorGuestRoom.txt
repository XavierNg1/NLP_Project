 Don't buy a desk, file cabinet, bookcase or bed without comparing sizes. A big mistake many folks make is buying something they like, bringing it home, and then finding out the object is taking up too much of the room.;
, This is critical to utilizing your space. A desk just deep enough for the computer with lots of shelves going up towards the ceiling to hold Cd's, books, etc. is key to successfully furnishing this small office. Try to allocate a desk with cabinets to hide tower and monitor from view when not in use. Also, keep the desk clean and clear when it is not being used. This makes for a more relaxing environment for guests.
 Avoid dark colors on furniture and walls. Light colors give the illusion of space.
 This adds floor space and storage to your room.
 Avoid using any horizontal files which take up more space.
 Your overnight guest will feel more comfortable if they don't have to walk around your files.

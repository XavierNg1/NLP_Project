 Anything that touches your nails should be used on your nails only. Sharing files, brushes, and other tools can spread infection, leading to puffy red cuticles and weak nails.Even a professional nail salon may not clean its instruments properly. Bring your own tools or ask the salon staff to sterilize their instruments.

Fake fingernails that extend over the cuticles also cause harm. Use fake nail tips instead.

Some dermatologists recommend leaving nail polish on for no longer than five days.Try using hand lotion instead of a base coat, to further protect your nails., Never chip or peel off the polish. Always soak it with a nail polish remover until you can easily scrub it away.

 Manual labor, housework frequent hand washing, and exposure to cleaning chemicals can all tear your nails. Wear gloves during these activities when possible.

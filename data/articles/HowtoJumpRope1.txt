 You should find a rope that reaches nearly up to your shoulders when it's folded in half. This will give you enough room to comfortably jump over it, but not so much that you trip over the rope.









The rope should have handles that are easy to grip and shouldn't be too light or too heavy.;
, Hold the rope's handles in each of your hands. Extend your hands and forearms at least a foot away from your body, at a 45 degree angle. This will create a larger arc for you to jump through.
 The rope should hang behind you, so that the middle of the rope hits the back of your feet.
 Don't move your arms -- try to keep the motion limited to your wrists.
 Stand on your tiptoes, and push off with the balls of your feet.









Try to keep the motion in your ankles. Bending your knees to jump will make the exercise a lot harder.
 For beginners, it's best to move the rope slowly, so that you have enough time to take a small hop in between each jump over the rope. Maintain a straight back and keep your gaze set straight ahead as you fall into the correct rhythm. If you watch your feet as you jump, you'll be more likely to get off balance.









As your skill increases, you can swing the rope more quickly and eliminate the middle hop.
As you improve your skills, you can count how long you can go without messing up. A fun way to track your progress is to count how many skips you can do in one stretch, without fumbling.

 Older dogs are a great choice for first time dog owners because they do not require the same amount of attention or training as a young puppy. For first time dog owners, training can be a very difficult and time consuming task. As a result, adopting a senior dog, that is already trained, may help to ease the transition into life with a dog. Tell potential adoptees to talk with an individual who is currently raising a puppy in order to get a realistic idea of the amount of work and time involved.
If they are not interested in constantly cleaning up after the puppy, a senior dog may be the right choice for them.
 Senior dogs make excellent companions for senior humans. Companion animals, such as dogs, provide many benefits for the owner. For instance, they provide physical activity, increased social engagement, love and affection, and some believe they even contribute to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. As a result, senior dog adoption is a fantastic way to provide senior humans with companionship and purpose during the latter stages of life.Provide senior citizens with added incentives to adopt a senior dog. For example, some shelters provide senior citizens with a discount on adopting senior dogs. This could be as much as 50% off in order to help encourage senior dog adoption. Senior dogs can also come with a starter kit and food to help in the transition.
 At times it may be difficult to find an individual to adopt a senior dog from your shelter. An alternative to adoption is fostering. This means that an individual will provide a temporary home for the dog as it awaits permanent adoption. Fostering is an excellent option for people who are unable to commit to full time dog ownership, but want to help out dogs in need. Fostering a senior dog will help remove them from the stressful environment of the shelter.Advertise your foster program in the local media.

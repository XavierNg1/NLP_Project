 The average maturation time is between 43 and 50 days. By that time, there should be at least 6 leaves on each of your spinach plants. Pick baby spinach leaves from all the plants, so that every plant will keep growing to maturity.
 When bolting, the spinach will begin to form a center stalk. If this happens, your spinach will be tough and bitter. Remove large developed leaves and remove any brown, withered or diseased leaves to prevent your spinach from bolting too early. You can start picking leaves as soon as they are big enough to eat.
 Once your spinach plants have at least 4 true leaves, add some organic fertilizer to the soil. The spinach will not only grow faster, it will taste sweeter.

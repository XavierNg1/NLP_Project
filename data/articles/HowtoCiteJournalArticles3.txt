 Citing an online journal is similar to citing a print journal, with one exception:


Include name of database.
 In practice, the above structure should lend itself to a citation that looks like this:


Last, First M. "Article Title" Journal Title Series Volume. Issue (Year Published): Page(s). Database Name. Web. Date Month Year Accessed.

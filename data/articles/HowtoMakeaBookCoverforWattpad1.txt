 Your cover is the first thing that people see when they look at your book. It shouldn’t be off-putting, disturbing, or too comic and absurd. Even if your book is a very funny book, the cover needs to be professional looking. Remember that there’s a difference between professional and boring – your cover should be interesting and enticing, but it also needs to look composed and clean.


For example, if you want your cover to be a naked man running through a football field that is perfectly okay. You just have to find a professional way to show that. Maybe the picture is from behind and far up so that you can see an empty stadium and the entire field. This cover is interesting, professional and engaging.
Avoid low quality pictures and sloppy fonts.
Make sure that people can actually see your title. You don't want it to be fading into the background of your cover.;
, You don’t need that much on your cover to make it interesting. Don’t choose a picture that is too busy or complicated. Remember, most people are just going to be glancing over books. Your book cover should pop without being too intricate. You also don’t need to use Photoshop or any other more serious editing software to make a good cover. You might just end up with a poorly photo shopped photo if you do that.
 Everything from the text to the color scheme to the picture should act as an extension of your story. It doesn’t necessarily have to show a scene or character from the story, but it should match the general feeling that you want the reader to have while reading the book.

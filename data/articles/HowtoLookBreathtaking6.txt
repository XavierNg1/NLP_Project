It's best for darker-skinned girls to flaunt flashy colors. As for blonds, they should use pastel colors, whereas brunettes should use "earth colors". Also, browns and gold are best for blue eyes, purples and violets for green eyes, and blues for brown eyes.

Smokey eyes look perfect on everybody! However, pay attention to the colors you choose.
Use concealer to cover up spots such as bags or acne. Don't overdo it, though!
Use mascara. Make sure your mascara doesn't clump, because clumping looks too unnatural.
Use rouge. Bronze your cheeks and nose in the summer. Ask an assistant in the store to help you with this. Gloss your lips to make them look juicy and full.
Use foundation if your skin is bad. Ask for help in the make-up store for the color that suits you.
 Try on the different colors on your wrist to find which one accentuates your looks best while looking most natural. Pick a livelier color for your most prominent and beautiful facial feature.

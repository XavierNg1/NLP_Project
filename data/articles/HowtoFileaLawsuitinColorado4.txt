 You should visit http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/CourtOperations/CMECF.aspx and read about Electronic Case Filing. All documents in federal court are filed electronically.
 You need to complete a “Civil Cover Sheet.” This sheet is available for download at http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/CourtOperations/RulesProcedures/FilingCivilSuits.aspx. You can type the requested information into the PDF.


This form asks for the names and counties of residence for the plaintiff (you) and the defendants. It also asks for information regarding the nature of the lawsuit.You should fill out the information and then save an electronic copy. Print out a completed copy for your records.
 A complaint in federal court will resemble a complaint in Colorado County or District court. It has the same elements: a caption, a title, and then the body, in which you list the factual allegations surrounding the dispute.


You can see a sample civil complaint for federal court at http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Forms/CivilForms/General_Complaint.pdf. You can use this as a template as you type up your complaint.
 You also need to present to the court a summons.You can access a blank summons form for download at http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Forms/CivilForms/summons_civil_action.pdf. Fill in the requested information on the parties, as well as the defendant’s address.
 You must provide the federal court with the original of all documents. Make copies for each defendant. Make sure any exhibits are attached to the copies., Other than the complaint and summons, you will need to file all other documents electronically. For this reason, you should apply for an ECF Registration by downloading an application form at http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Portals/0/Documents/CMECF/cm_reg_prose.pdf as soon as possible. Read the instructions and complete page two of the form.


You also need a PACER account to view documents filed in the case. You should get your account by calling 1-800-676-6856 or 210-301-6440., You will not be given an ECF account until you have a pending suit before the court. This means that you must file your complaint by taking it to the court clerk. The court staff will upload initial documents to the electronic system for you.In addition to your complaint, take your Civil Cover Sheet and the summons with you.
You should also take your completed ECF registration form with you and give it to the clerk at the same time.
 In Colorado federal court, you will need to pay $400.00 in order to file a lawsuit.You can pay the filing fee in cash, money order, credit card, or personal check. Make checks and money orders payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court.”If you cannot afford the fee, then you need to fill out an “Application to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying Fees or Costs.” This form will require that you supply information about your income, your assets (such as home and bank accounts), as well as your monthly expenses.The form can be downloaded at http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Forms/CivilForms/AO-Form-239_PDF.pdf.
 You must serve notice on all defendants. You do this by providing a copy of the complaint along with the summons. You can have a person make personal service on the defendants so long as he or she is at least 18 years old and not a party to the lawsuit.Give them a “Proof of Service Affidavit” to fill out. (This is the second page of the summons).


The federal marshal generally will not make service for you.If you want to hire someone, then look in the phone book under “Process Server” to find a private business that will make service for you.
You must make service within 90 days of filing.There is probably no good reason to wait, so you should make service as soon as possible.
 After service has been made, have the server complete the Affidavit and then file it with the court. Keep a copy for your records.

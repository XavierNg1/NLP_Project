 In addition to underlining (or highlighting) important text, it is also quite useful to write down some notes. One of the best annotations you can make is to simply jot down the main theme (or main idea) of a section in the margin. (It can also be useful to list themes at the beginning of chapters.)


Once again, taking the time to identify themes and main ideas is an excellent learning strategy.
 Create your own system of symbols to help guide your note-taking. For instance, you might use a question marks to indicate something you don’t understand (or don’t agree with), an exclamation mark to note something you feel strongly about, a triangle to show a shift in thinking, and finally, a star to indicate something very important.
 An important part of learning is being able to identify what you don’t know, don’t agree with, or don’t fully understand. These questions are valuable points of discussion, particularly if you will be talking about this reading in a class. (You can ask these questions of your instructor or classmates.) Furthermore, these give you places to deepen your research with alternative sources. Jot down any questions or concerns you have about the text in the margins., If you see a link between one section and another (particularly if the author is not making this link explicit), it is a good idea to draw a small arrow to indicate this connection. Alternatively, if a related idea appears on a different page, you can write the page number down instead.
 Literary analysis (or any type of analytical thinking) is all about making connections. Whenever you think of a connection while you are reading (to another author’s work, a concept from a different reading, or even an example from your personal life) take a moment to write this down in the margin. This will be valuable for future essays, research, or discussions.

 Wardriving is technically legal. Doing something illegal from a network you find while wardriving is not.
 If you’re doing something you’re not supposed to be doing, it’s probably not a good idea to do it from your own network. Connect wirelessly to one of the open networks you found while wardriving and run the exploit you’ve researched and chosen.

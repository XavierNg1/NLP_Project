 Use pastel colors on the invitations. Decorate with a lovely springtime design, such as little flowers. Send one to each person you'd like to come.;
, If you don't have everything, plan a shopping trip.
 This could be pastel colored, or something with floral, etc. designs on it. A white tablecloth is also a good choice, although it shows stains easily.


Consider using flowers for decorations. You'll need vases or bowls to hold them in.
 Do you already have outdoor furniture? If not, hire or buy some; get a foldout table and some chairs.


Springtime cushions for the chairs will add a pleasant touch.
, If you're not going to make all of the food, order or purchase cookies, croissants, and cupcakes. If you are going to use store bought tea, then buy the tea as well as everything else.
 Decide what can be made the day before and what needs to be made on the day. Anything fresh, such as scones and whipped cream, should be made a few hours prior to the tea party. Some food ideas include:


Pastries, cookies, maybe cupcakes
Crackers and Brie cheese, cream cheese and salmon
Lemon and orange slices for the tea
Strawberries and blueberries
Salad avocado, tomatoes. cucumber, alfalfa sprouts.
 Put up the table and set up all the chairs.
 If it's tea leaf tea, then follow the directions on the packaging.
 Get your teapot and put a teapot strainer in in it. Put mint leaves in the strainer and leave them be. Boil some water and put it in the teapot. Let the mint leaves steep for about 3 minutes.
 There is a dramatic way of serving. First, sit everyone down and give a brief speech about how happy you are that they came. Then if you have a family member or friend, ask them to be the server. First, have them bring out the cookies, croissants, and cupcakes. Let your guest eat those for a minute. Make sure there's still some left! Then bring out the tea in little cups.

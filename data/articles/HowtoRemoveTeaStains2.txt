 Check the garment label for the specific washing instructions.If the label on the garment tag says “Dry Clean Only,” take it to the dry cleaners right away. Point the stain out to the cleaner so they know exactly what kind of stain they’re dealing with.









If the label does not say “Dry Clean Only,” you can try to get the stain out yourself using some household products.
 Immediately rinse or blot the tea stain with cold water if the spill has just occurred.Blot the stain with a clean cloth, continuous moving the cloth around to blot the stain with a clean section. Continue blotting the spot until no more of the stain is lifting from the garment.
 If your garment does not require dry cleaning, soak it in cold water for at least 30 minutes. You can also leave the garment to soak overnight if the stain is particularly big.









Consider adding a small amount of detergent (a few tablespoons for 1 gallon of water) or bleach to the cold water soak.However, only add bleach if the garment is white.
 You could also try soaking a cotton garment in a vinegar solution. Mix together 3 cups of white vinegar and 1 cup of cold water in a bucket, bowl, or sink.Add the cotton garment to the solution and let it soak for about 30 minutes.









Alternatively, you could spray the vinegar solution straight onto the stain, and allow it to sit for approximately 30 minutes.If the stain remains after the soak, pour some table salt onto the stain and rub the fabric and salt together with you fingers., When the stained garment has had time to soak, launder it as you normally would.If the garment is white, use bleach. You can use oxygenated bleach or color-safe bleach on colored fabrics.
 Remove the fabric from the wash machine and survey it before you place it in the dryer. Heat will set a stain, so it should not be used until the tea is entirely removed.If the stain is entirely removed, dry the garment as you normally would or place it outside to dry in the sun.

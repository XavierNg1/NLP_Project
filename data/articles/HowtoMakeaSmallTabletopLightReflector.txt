 You'll need a piece of cardboard of a decent size, reflective material and tape. There's no need to go looking for expensive reflective material â€“ as you can see from the photos in this tutorial, a cleaned-up potato chip packet was recycled as reflective material.;
, Face the reflective side away from you.
 Center it so that what is taped isn't too bulky on one side or the other.


Tape the long sides down.
 This will help it tape flatter when you tape it completely.
, Obviously, it won't stand up by itself, so find something sturdy to prop it up against that is able to be hidden behind the reflector. It's now ready to be used in your tabletop photography projects.

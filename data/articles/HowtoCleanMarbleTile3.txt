 Anytime that a liquid sits on the surface of your tile, it has the potential to stain or discolor the marble. Acidic liquids, such as citrus juices, wine, coffee, and vinegar, are a particular danger to marble, but even a puddle of water that isn’t cleaned up quickly can stain the tile. To avoid discolorations, wipe up any spills on the marble as soon as you see them.You can wipe up water with paper towel or a clean cloth, but if an acidic liquid spills on the tile, wipe it up and then clean the air with a cloth dampened with water and dish soap. Make sure to dry the surface thoroughly when you’re done.
If you have marble in your bathroom, remember to dry the tile after every shower and bath.
 The best way to protect your marble tile from stains, discoloration, and other damage is to cover it. Use coasters and trivets on tiled countertops to keep any liquids or food that drip over the edge of a glass or pan from falling on the marble. On tile floors, place mats or throw rugs near doorways so you can wipe dirt and debris off your feet before walking across the marble.If you want to protect a marble tile floor from scratches, try placing rubber mats under metal furniture and accessories. It’s also a good idea to place them under plants and flower pots.
 To protect your marble surface from stains and discoloration, it’s important to apply a sealant approximately once a month. It forms a protective film over the marble so you have more time to wipe up spills and clean stains. You can purchase marble sealer at your local hardware, home improvement, or stone supply store. Follow the directions on the bottle, but you usually mist it on, allow it to soak in, and then wipe down the surface.Make sure to start with clean marble tile before applying the sealer.
If you want extra protection, you can apply a second coat of sealer after the first one is completely dry.

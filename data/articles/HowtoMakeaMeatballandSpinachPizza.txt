 Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Preheating your oven helps the pizza to bake better and more efficiently.;
, Using a cooking brush, brush your pizza crust with olive oil. Make sure to cover the crust edges and to brush every part.
 Use a spoon to spread the sauce all around the crust. Avoid adding too much sauce, or it will cause the pizza to be very soft or soggy.
 Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese all around the pizza. For an extra cheesy twist, sprinkle 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of cheddar cheese as well.
 Remove the stems from the spinach leaves and place them on your pizza. You may consider placing them one by one and then slowly spreading it across with a wooden spoon.
 Add the meatballs by placing each meatball in a different location on the pizza. Avoid making them too close - the meatballs should be about two inches apart, since they are large. Add any extra toppings and onion powder, if desired.


Be creative with your meatballs! You can use different flavored meatballs as long as they're jumbo sized. Examples include vegetable, turkey, jalapeño, ham, etc.
 Bake the pizza for about 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the crust is crisped. The spinach will also change by looking darker and soft. When it has finished baking, let it cool for about 10 minutes.
 Slice the pizza using a pizza cutter or slicing knife. Serve on a plate. Enjoy!

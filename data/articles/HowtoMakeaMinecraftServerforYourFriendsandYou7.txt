 Most residential internet providers assign dynamic IPs. This makes connecting to your server somewhat more difficult, as you have to let people know your new address every time it changes. Some ISPs will give you a dynamic IP, but it won’t change for long periods of time.

Type “my ip address” into Google and note your IP address over a few weeks. If you’re only giving out the IP to a few friends, then you may not have to worry about setting up a static address if your IP doesn’t change very often.
 A Dynamic DNS will assign a domain name to your dynamic IP. This will give you an unchanging address to connect to. Many services offer free accounts for single addresses.


Dynamic DNS will require a program to run on your computer, that will update your domain whenever your IP address changes.
 You will need to set your router to connect through a Dynamic DNS. The location of this setting varies from router to router, but it is typically under the Advanced settings.


You will need to enter your Host name, username, and password.

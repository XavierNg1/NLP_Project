 If you are concerned about your nutritional intake or any recurring symptoms that may be related to vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, see a healthcare professional as soon as possible. One of the first exams you will receive is a physical examination to ensure that there are not issues with your reflexes.Other important tests you should talk about with your doctor are your complete blood count, your reticulocyte count, your LDH protein level, and your actual vitamin B12 level.
Causes of B12 deficiency include pernicious anemia, gastrectomy or gastritis, H. pylori infection, age, intestinal disorders, tapeworm infestation, medication, inadequate dietary intake, and HIV infection.
 If there are no health complications that make it harder for your body to process vitamin B12, you can likely simply add more of this nutrient to your diet. Follow any of your doctor’s recommendations regarding dietary changes, and consider taking vitamin supplements if you are unable to adjust your diet.The goal of any type of vitamin B12 deficiency treatment is to increase your levels of vitamin B12. This may only require dietary changes.
Treatment options that your doctor may recommend also include high-dose vitamin B12 tablets, or even vitamin B12 injections.
 If you have a medical or lifestyle complication that prevents your body’s absorption of the nutrient, injections are a viable route to ensure you’re still getting the vitamin B12 your body needs. Again, your body’s ability to absorb vitamin B12 is the primary factor in determining whether these injections are a necessary form of treatment, as taking vitamin B12 supplements by mouth is adequate treatment for most patients.If your doctor deems it necessary for you to receive injections, know that you may need several injections within the first few months of treatment.
After a few months of treatment, you will likely need one shot per month, potentially for the rest of your life.

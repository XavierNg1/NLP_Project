 This cleaning tool can be found in most supermarkets. You may be able to find an off-brand version for cheaper as well. Make sure you're using a melamine foam eraser., Make sure to scrub in straight lines from the center outwards. Apply a fair amount of force so that the eraser can polish the scratches, but not so much that it wears away the entire layer.
 After you've finished polishing the scratches with the magic eraser, run the disc under a water tap and dry it off with a soft cloth. When drying, use the same motion that you used to erase: straight lines from the center out to the edges.
 After you've finished polishing and rinsing the disc, you can try playing it again. If it still doesn't work, you can go another round with the magic eraser, or try another method from this article.

 Review the design plan for your project. Identify all the pieces of any particular material type that you need. Determine the length of each separate piece.

For example, suppose you are installing a new kitchen countertop. Your plan might require a two-foot length from the wall to the sink, a three-foot length from the end of the sink to the corner, and another two-foot length to wrap around the corner.

, To find the total number of linear feet that you need for your project, add together the lengths of the individual parts. Imagine the individual pieces lined up end-to-end and determine the length from one end to the other.

In the countertop example, you need three pieces of two feet, three feet, and two feet. Thus, the total number of linear feet of countertop material that you need is 2+3+2=7 feet.
 For some projects, the design plan or instructions may tell you the number of linear feet that you need. For example, suppose you were knitting a sweater. It would be impossible to look at a picture of a sweater and determine the amount of yarn that you need. Somewhere, the instructions should tell you how much yarn to purchase.
 By definition, "linear feet" are measured in feet. However, the individual pieces you need may be measured in inches or a combination of feet and inches. It may help first to convert all your measurements to inches, then add them, and convert to feet and inches in your final step.

For example, suppose you have three pieces measuring 5'2", 4'6" and 3'8". If you convert each of these to inches, you get 62", 54" and 44". Add them to get a total of 160". Divide this by 12 inches per foot, and you will get a total of 13 feet, with four inches left over. Thus, the total linear footage is 13 feet, 4 inches.

 Organize your study time and the time that you spend with people, including your friends (ie don't forget Kat). Have an agenda, and write down what you will study one day, how much time you will study and at what time.;
, If you have free time don´t waste it! Don´t just lay around and do nothing! You might get used to it.
 For instance, if some of your classmates are having a party and you're invited, don´t think twice, just go and have a great time. That way you will be sharing time with them, and letting your mind and body relax.
 Nowadays we have the advantage of online social networking technology, use it! Facebook, Skype, Hi5, Myspace,Tagged, etc. are some of the tools that you can use in order to keep in contact with your buddies. Your mobile phone is with you at all times, so feel free to call to your friends whenever! They will appreciate your call!

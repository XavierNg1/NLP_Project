 A profile picture's main purpose is to let potential matches see you. Because profile pictures tend to be small, you might want a picture of just your face or your shoulders and face. That way, they can see you easily without even clicking on your profile.That means getting an up-close picture. Make sure you aren't wearing anything that blocks your face, such as sunglasses or a hat that casts a shadow.
If you need to, crop a photo so it shows just your upper body. Just make sure it's still clear after cropping.;
, Personality is important in a profile picture. A goofy expression may show that you're fun-loving. However, you don't want to go overboard. Stick to something fairly straightforward, so potential matches won't be instantly put off., Most people don't want to date a grump. If you look like a grump in your picture, that's likely going to turn people away. Make sure you are showing a full, genuine smile, as happiness is very attractive., Fuzzy pictures will not get you anywhere. Make sure your photo is clear. Your potential dates want to see you in all your glory, not a blurry blob on a blurry background. If you don't have a clear picture, it may be time to take a new one.You should also choose good lighting to highlight your best features. Try picking a photo taken in natural light., You're not always the best judge of your photos. Sometimes, other people may be more adept at picking out the most attractive photo that also shows your personality. Poll a few friends to help you select one.

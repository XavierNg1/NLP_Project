 Most natural acid reflux remedies are safe for the majority of adults. Note that some herbal remedies, however, may not be safe for children or teenagers. It’s best to try mild lifestyle changes first if you need to treat acid reflux in an adolescent. If these do not work, consult your doctor or do some thorough research before giving an adolescent an herbal remedy.


For example, you should not give aloe juice to children under the age of 12 since it typically results in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cramping., Most herbal remedies and other natural treatments will be safe in moderate amounts, but too much of a good thing can quickly become bad. When using herbal supplements, check the label for dosing instructions. For any natural remedy that does not have dosage instructions readily available, do some research to find out how much you should safely be able to endure.


For instance, aloe juice can cause stomach pain and other forms of digestive upset, especially if the juice contains aloe latex. Long-term use of large amounts can also result in kidney problems, muscle weakness, and heart problems. Make sure that any juice you drink contains no more than 200 mg aloe or 50 mg aloe latex to avoid complications.Consuming apple cider vinegar is usually considered safe short-term, but drinking 8 oz (250 ml) per day for several weeks or months may result in low potassium.High or prolonged doses of licorice root can result in headaches, fatigue, high blood pressure, heart attacks, and water retention. Do not take licorice for more than four to six weeks., If you are not currently pregnant or are not at risk of becoming pregnant, most natural remedies are likely safe for you. However, for acid reflux connected to pregnancy, always talk to your doctor before treating your symptoms to make sure you do not inadvertently harm your baby. It’s important that you do this before trying any herbal remedy, dietary fix, or lifestyle change.


Similarly, if you are currently breastfeeding, you may need to stay away from certain ingested remedies since they could get into your breastmilk and harm your baby. Most lifestyle remedies will likely be safe, though.
Potentially problematic remedies for pregnant and breastfeeding women include, but are not limited to, aloe juice, apple cider vinegar, ginger, fennel, licorice, and slippery elm., In addition to pregnancy, certain medical conditions may also make herbal remedies or other natural fixes unsafe. If you have a known health concern other than acid reflux, talk to your doctor or do your research before trying any particular home cure.

 While most healthy adults can safely treat acid reflux at home using natural remedies, it’s never a bad idea to confirm the diagnosis with your doctor and discuss treatment options before making any major changes. This is especially important if you’ve already been trying home treatments and they haven’t worked.


If your condition worsens after following natural remedies or does not improve after two to three weeks, you may need to make an appointment with your doctor.
If you experience acid reflux symptoms more than twice per week or if you are unable to swallow/eat because of your symptoms, call your doctor before trying home remedies.
In addition to guiding your treatment and possibly prescribing stronger medications to treat your acid reflux, your doctor can verify that acid reflux is the problem and rule out other conditions that may behave in similar ways.

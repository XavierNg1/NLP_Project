, Borax will neutralize the urine odor. Be sure to cover the whole area.


The jury is out on whether or not Borax is toxic.Just don't eat it or leave it on your skin. It will irritate your skin, just like baking soda.
 Work borax into the stain well. It should seem to get beneath the surface. Use rubber gloves if you're concerned with its toxicity level.
 This could be in sunshine, if possible, or in a well-ventilated area away from dampness. Turn a fan onto the area or open the windows and doors.

 You're all set! Take some preventative measures if you're concerned it may happen again.

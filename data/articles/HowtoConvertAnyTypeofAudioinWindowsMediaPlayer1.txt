 Windows XP and Vista users can only update to WMP 11.


Open WMP and click “Help,” then “Check for Updates.” Older versions of WMP should have a Help menu at the top of the screen, but you may need to first enable the menu bar. If you don’t see a Help menu, click “Organize” then navigate to “Layout.” Put a check next to “Show Menu Bar,” then open the “Help” menu to select “Check for updates.”
As long as you’re connected to the Internet, WMP will check for a new version. If you see a message that you should install a new version, follow the on-screen instructions, then re-open WMP once the process completes. Windows 7, 8 and 10 users will now have WMP 12, and XP and Vista users should have WMP 11.;
, WMP 11 users must complete this step, but it’s optional for WMP 12 users. WMP 12 users should definitely install this if you want to put music on your iPhone or iPad.

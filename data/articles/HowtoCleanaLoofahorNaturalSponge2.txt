 Avoid becoming so attached to your loofah that you keep it around when itâ€™s no longer safe to use. Discard your loofah if you notice mold growth or if it smells mildewy or musty. Doing so will help prevent you from catching a nasty skin infection.


Replace a natural loofah every three to four weeks. Synthetic loofahs can be used for up to two months., There are many different natural and synthetic loofah products on the market. Be aware that loofahs made from natural substances do not last as long as those used in synthetic sponges. Synthetic sponges will last longer on average and require less maintenance.
 Loofahs are a favorite bath and shower accessory for many people; however, because of all the nooks and crannies in a loofah, it is very susceptible in breeding bacteria. You might want to consider ditching the use of loofahs for a more sanitary alternative instead.


Washcloths tend to be used more frequently and easier to wash and dry. In addition they accumulate less bacteria due to their physical structure.If you can't bare to part with your loofah, then alternate days between using a washcloth and a loofah.

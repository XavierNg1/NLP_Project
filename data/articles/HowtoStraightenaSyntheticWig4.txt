 Secure the bun with a hair clip. The only hair that is hanging loose should be the hair that is sewn along the bottom edge/hem of the wig.


If you look closely, you may notice that the hair is sewn to the wig cap in rows. These are known as wefts. Pay attention to these. You will be using them as your guide.
 This will keep the fibers from overheating.
 The best place to grab this section is from the front of the wig, at one of the temples. This way, you can work your way around the back of the wig and to the other side.
 Make sure that the section is completely tangle-free.
, Once the section of hair is completely tangle-free, place the comb/brush at the roots of the wig. Make sure that the bristles are under the fibers. Hold the hairdryer a few inches away from the fibers with the nozzle pointing towards the fibers. Slowly move the comb/brush and hairdryer down towards the ends of the section at the same time. Keep the fibers between the comb/brush and the hairdryer nozzle at all times.
 Once you have finished a row, undo the bun and let the next layer fall loose. Gather the rest of the hair into a loose bun and secure it once again with a clip. Use the wefts/rows as your guide. You can work with one to two wefts/rows at a time.

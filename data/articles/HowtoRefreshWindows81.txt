 There are essentially three different options you have when Windows is not performing well: a Refresh, a System Restore, or a Factory Reset.



Click here for instructions on Refreshing. This reinstalls Windows files but doesn't affect your personal data. Perform a refresh if your computer feels sluggish or your experiencing crashes and freezing.

Click here for instructions on performing a System Restore. This rolls your computer back to a previous date. Use the System Restore to roll back Windows if a driver or program has caused the computer to not work. System Restore can also help combat a virus infection. System Restore is not available in Windows 8 RT.

Click here for instructions on performing a Factory Reset. The factory reset will wipe everything off the computer. This is best used when neither of the above works and your computer just isn't functioning right. This is also the best way to get rid of viruses and malware. Performing a reset every six months will help keep your computer running more effectively for longer.

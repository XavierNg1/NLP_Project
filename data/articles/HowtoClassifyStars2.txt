 A roman numeral, indicating the star's size, is added after the temperature designation. 0 or Ia+ indicates a hypergiant  star. Ia, Iab  and Ib represent supergiants  (bright, medium, dim). II is bright giants, III giants, IV sub-giants, V main sequence stars (the part of a stars life that it spends the most time going through) and VI is sub-dwarfs. A prefix of D indicates a white dwarf star. Examples: DA7 (white dwarf), F5Ia+ (yellow hypergiant), G2V (yellow main-sequence star). The Sun is G2V.

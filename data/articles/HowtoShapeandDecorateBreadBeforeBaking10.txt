 Stencils can be very easy to make from ordinary household objects to personalise your loaf. Mist the dough with water and then the stencil can be applied or held above the bread. Flour or other toppings (such as seeds, spices etc) may be sifted or sprinkled through it to leave a pattern or a silhouette. For example:


A baking rack has slots and bars, where cake cooling racks can be diamonds, squares or a spiral. When the rack just gently touches the bread and flour is sifted over, it will leave the pattern in flour on the bread when the stencil is removed.
You may also cut one out of baking paper to make a letter or shape.
You may use cutlery like a wooden spoon to leave a silhouette, or even your hand.
 If you add it before, it may end up warped or at best unexpected patterns will arise.

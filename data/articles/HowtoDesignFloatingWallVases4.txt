 In order to achieve that “floating” look, you can cover the nails with the same color as your walls for a more blended effect.

Allow nails to fully dry before using them.
 If you are hanging more than one vase, use your tape measure and possibly a level to ensure a symmetrical line.
 Use a pencil to mark the area.
 The vase should lay back toward the wall and not tip forward.

Another option is to drill a hole.






Insert anchors in the hole you made.






Insert a screw, and leave a few turns for you to hang the vase.
 If adding more than one vase, repeat the process to hang them all in position.

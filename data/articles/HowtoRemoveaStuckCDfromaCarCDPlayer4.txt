 In this method, you insert a long, flat knife or similar object directly into the CD player. Knives made from metal conduct electricity, so, if you have an object made from wood or plastic that will work (like, for instance, a popsicle stick), use it. If not, be sure to disconnect all power supplies from the CD player and make sure any electrical charge has been removed. Turn the car and the CD player off and disconnect the negative terminal of your car's battery.



Note: As with other methods described in this article, this method carries the risk of damage to the stuck CD or the CD player itself. If you don't want to put your property at risk, take your car to a trained automotive professional.
 Use a strong tape like Gorilla tape for best results. Putty knives are typically tapered so that if you wrap the tape tight enough, it will not slide off the end. If you're using another object, like a popsicle stick, which doesn't taper, you may need to stick the tape to the object, wrap it around several times, then put a twist in the tape and wrap it around several more times to make sure the tape is adequately secured to the object.
 Because your knife (or stick, etc.) is now covered with sticky tape, it can be difficult to insert it into the CD player. To make this process easier, use paper to make one side of your knife smooth. Stick a small piece of printer or construction paper onto your knife. Trim the paper with scissors so that it matches the size and shape of the knife.
 Delicately wiggle your knife to feel for the top of the CD. Press down gently to get the tape to stick to the CD. When you feel that your knife is stuck to the CD, gently try to lift and remove the CD.

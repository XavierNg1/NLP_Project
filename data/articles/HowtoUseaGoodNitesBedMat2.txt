It's sometimes useful if the product hangs (as to give you more surface area to work with for spills, as if the paint drips, it first has to run more onto the mat before it runs onto the clothing underneath).






Think about positioning the mat in landscape position, so that the tabbed areas are to the left and right of the drawing area, if the child has a small perspective of their working area (school-age children may enjoy this convenience).

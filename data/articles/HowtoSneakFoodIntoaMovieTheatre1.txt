 Use a bag, such as a backpack, messenger bag, or purse to hide outside food and beverages. For example, you could hide small snacks such as candy, chocolate bars, chips, fruits and veggies, popcorn, or bottled beverages inside your bag., This way your snacks wonâ€™t spill inside of your bag while you are transporting them into the theatre. A sealed container will also mask the smell of popcorn or other snacks in your bag, making them less noticeable., Place a wallet, day planner, or any other item overtop of the food you are sneaking into the theatre. That way, if someone looks inside your purse, they'll just see your personal belongings, not the food.
 Make sure to choose a bag that is large enough to fit all the snacks you want to sneak into the theatre. You should not stuff your bag so full that some of the snacks are sticking out of the top. This is a sure way to get caught. Make sure that the snacks fit into your bag and are not visible.

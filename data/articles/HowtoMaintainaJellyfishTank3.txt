 When moving jellyfish from a store-bought bag to its own tank, place the jellyfish -- still sealed in its bag -- in the water. This will allow the water in the bag to warm or cool to the temperature of the water in the tank. Do not remove the jellyfish from its bag.Wait about ten minutes for the jellyfish to acclimate.
 Whatever you do, don’t dump the water out of the bag, since you’ll run the risk of dumping your jellyfish out along with it.


If moving jellyfish from one tank to another, place it in a plastic bag of an appropriate size. The jellyfish must have room to move. A small jellyfish can be placed in a big plastic bag, and a larger jellyfish can be placed in a very large plastic bag.
 You might be able to add water to the bag by holding the top edge of the bag just above the level of the water in the tank, then dipping one corner of the bag down slightly below the level of the water, allowing water to fill it.


Alternately, you could try filling the bag with tank water using a ladle or measuring cup.
Keep the jellyfish sealed in its bag, and keep the bag in the water for another ten minutes.
When the ten minutes are up, remove the jellyfish from the bag. Open it at the top and carefully pull it down the length of the jellyfish, then move it away and out of the water.

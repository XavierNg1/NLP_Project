 If the method above failed to loosen your chuck, an impact wrench can provide more force. Insert a hex socket into the center of your chuck and tighten the chuck to hold it in place.If there is a screw in the center of your chuck, unscrew it first with a clockwise turn.
This method may have a higher risk of damaging your chuck or drill.
 Set the drill's gearbox to the locked position, neither forward nor reverse.
 Place the impact wrench onto the hex socket and set it to reverse. Engage the impact wrench in short bursts until the chuck loosens off the drill.
 You can now remove the chuck the rest of the way by hand.

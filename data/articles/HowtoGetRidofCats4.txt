 Animal control agencies usually trap the cats and euthanize them. Unfortunately removing cats from where they are living creates a vacuum effect. New cats quickly move into the vacant area and start using the resources to thrive and survive. The most effective method of reducing the population of cats in an area is TNR. You may also be able to ask animal control to help you employ the Trap-Neuter-Return method if you're uncomfortable trapping cats by yourself.
 Most shelters don't accept feral cats, since they are most often not adoptable. Feral cats that enter shelters are euthanized over 90% of the time after entering shelters. Feral cats are often shy and unsociable, so they shouldn't be invited into people's homes.

 One of the surest ways to make sure that your children continue in caring for your dog is by modeling good pet care yourself. If you are a responsible pet owner, your children will likely follow your model. This does not mean that you need to do everything. However, you do need to show them what regular and responsible pet ownership looks likeFor example, as a parent, you should model how to feed the dog. Feeding your pet regularly and maintaining its diet is a good way to build good habits for the entire family.
 If your children are skirting their pet care responsibilities, you should remind them in an even tone that your dog needs food, water, and exercise like everyone else. Do not yell at the children or scold the children for failing to care for the dog. A gentle reminder should spur some action. If you berate your children, they will likely develop some negative emotions towards you and the dog.Remember to emphasize the importance of your children’s responsibilities. Reminding them that their pet’s general health and well-being depends on them may help them be more responsible.
 Have your children learn about your dog’s breed and history. Encourage them to research the special traits of your dogs breed. If you adopted the dog, research its history. Knowing more about your dog and where it came from can help your children feel more invested in the dog and caring for it.Contact the shelter or rescue group that you adopted the dog from, or talk with the person you adopted it from.

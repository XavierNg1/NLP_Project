 Sometimes, you may want to bathe your dog with dry shampoo. A dry bath may be optimal if your dog gets smelly or dirty frequently. Bathing her every time you notice a smell can result in dry skin. Dogs should not be bathed more than once a month. If you feel your dog needs a bath more frequently than this, try using a dry bath., To make a dry bath, you'll mix 1 cup of baking soda, 1 cup of corn starch, and a few drops of essential oils together. Essential oils can be found at a local supermarket, drug store, or health food store. They can also be purchased online.Be very careful when using essential oils. You should always dilute oils in a carrier oil, like olive oil, before using them directly on your dog's skin.Do not use Oregano or Thyme oils on animals. You should also be extremely careful not to get essential oils anywhere near your dog's eyes.
 You do not need to use all of the dry shampoo. Sprinkle a small amount along your dog's bath. You may also sprinkle some on top of your dog's head, being careful to avoid your dog's eyes. You should use a cup of the mixture for mid-sized dogs and half a cup for small dogs., Use your fingers to gently massage the mixture into the dog's skin. You can also use a comb if you do not want the mixture to get on your hands. Massage the mixture until its dispersed evenly throughout your dog's coat., Allow your dog to shake vigorously when you're done, as this will get a lot of the dry shampoo out of her coat. Then, brush her thoroughly to get rid of the remaining dry shampoo.Make sure you brush the dog until you do not notice any dry shampoo residue. Baking soda can dry out a dog's skin if it's left on for a long time.

 Greeting the sun is a good way to start a morning yoga routine. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and put the palms of your hands together. Hold your hands in front of your heart and then bow.


As you bow, you can also think or say, "I welcome the sun."

, After you have greeted the sun, it is good to do a big upward stretch. Raise your arms to the sky and stand on your tiptoes. Take a deep breath in as you reach your hands up.


As you reach up, you can think or say, "I welcome the sky."

, If you are going to be doing your yoga at night, then you might want to start by connecting with the moon instead. Stand with your hands on your hips. Then, lean to the left and take in a deep breath. Next, lean to your right side and exhale the breath.


As you stretch, you can think or say, "I welcome the moon."

, Make big slow circles with your arms. Move your arms in big slow forward circles. As you do this, close your eyes and try to imagine that the entire room is filled with stars. Try to imagine that you are a star as well.


As you do this, think or say, "I welcome the stars."

, Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, bend your body forward and try to touch the ground. If you cannot reach it, that’s okay! Just reach down as far as you can even if it is only to your knees.


As you do this stretch, think or say “"I welcome the earth."

, Close your routine with a balance pose and a shout. If you are worried about waking someone, then you can just think the shout. Stand again up straight and put one foot on the opposite knee.


As you do this pose, think or shout, "This is fun!"

 Put a small amount of the cleaning product on an inconspicuous spot on the fabric. Rinse the fabric and let it dry.;
, Make sure the stained area is not resting on another part of the fabric. Place a towel underneath the area on which you’re working. This will ensure that the ink stain will not run through the fabric and stain more of the fabric.
 Household items that contain alcohol such as hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol (isopropyl) or cheap hairspray are good options. Apply enough of the product to cover the stain.


Let the fabric sit for 10 minutes. Give the household product enough time to set on the stain.
Do not use drinking alcohol on the fabric. This type of alcohol will not treat the stain.
Although it is not alcohol-based, nail polish remover is also a good household item that can effectively remove ink stains.
 After the stained area has been moistened with the household product you’ve chosen, add a few drops of clear liquid laundry detergent to the stain area. Rub in the detergent with your fingers or a cloth., Put a regular amount of laundry detergent in the washing machine and set it to use hot water. Do not include other items in the washing machine so that you don’t risk any transfer of the ink to another item., The stain should be gone, but if there is still a trace, repeat the process of applying the alcohol-based item to the stain. Wash the fabric again and if the stain is gone, then proceed to dry the fabric as usual.

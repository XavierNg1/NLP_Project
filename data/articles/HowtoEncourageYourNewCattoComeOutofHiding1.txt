 The best way to make your cat comfortable enough to come out of hiding is to give it time to adjust to its new surroundings. Most cats take a couple of weeks to acclimate, but it might take a month or two. During this time, try not to force the cat to come out of its hiding spot.Avoid chasing or picking up your cat, especially during this initial timeframe.;
, While your new cat is adjusting to its new home, you’ll want to get it used to your presence. If it’s hiding, sit near its hiding spot and talk softly to it. This will help get it used to your scent and sounds.Try sitting with it in intervals of about 20 minutes a few times a day.
 If it comes out of hiding, hold your hand out with a fingertip extended. Let it approach you and smell you on its own. When it does, gently touch your fingertip to its nose to say hello.Cats greet each other by touching noses, and you can simulate this by using your fingertip.
 Your cat will be a bit stressed out during its acclimation period. When you speak to it, be sure to speak softly, and avoid making lots of noise around it. Try not to make direct eye contact, as your cat will interpret this as a confrontation.Reducing your new cat’s stress will help it become comfortable enough to come out of hiding.

 Use the darkest shade possible. These products will bring out your highlights and deepen your darker tones if you already have brunette hair.

You can purchase these products at most drugstores. Some hair salons might have more effective (but also more expensive) versions.
 Use the brunette-specific hair products as your regular shampoo and conditioner., The more you wash your hair, the sooner you’ll see results. If you wash your hair every day or two, you should see results within one to two weeks.
 If you don’t want to buy brunette-specific shampoos, many people claim that you can darken your hair by adding cocoa powder to your shampoo at roughly a 1:1 ratio.


Fill a bottle 1/2 full with shampoo and 1/2 full with cocoa powder, then shake it vigorously until the two are completely mixed together.

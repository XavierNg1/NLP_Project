 Purchase seat covers that will protect your seats. These can either match your seats or they can have bright, colorful patterns on them. They are available for both bucket seats (such as front seats) and for bench seats (such as backseats), and can cost $30-$40. Many kinds can be machine-washed, making it easier to tidy up your car., A stain repellent will make it hard for stains to settle into the upholstery and will prolong the life of the upholstery. A stain repellent like Scotchgard Fabric and Upholstery Protector is available at home supply stores.


Follow the instructions on the product label for proper usage.
 Don’t allow spills and messes to sit in your car if possible. If they are not cleaned up right away, they may set into the upholstery, making it hard to remove them. Additionally, they can add to an unpleasant odor in your car.
 By banning food and drinks in the car, you can reduce the potential for many stains and messes. Accidents are sure to happen if you stop suddenly or you are trying to eat while driving. Eliminate this risk by not allowing food or drinks in the car.
 By removing garbage and other items from your vehicle after each journey, you may reduce the potential for stains to occur from grease-soaked fast food bags or spilled coffee cups. Dispose of any excess trash immediately after use so it doesn’t pile up and add to the clutter of your vehicle's interior.


Remove crayons and other things that are prone to melting if it is hot outside. The temperature of your car’s interior will be markedly hotter than outside and crayons, for example, will melt on upholstery if left there in the heat.
 Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from grinding into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly.

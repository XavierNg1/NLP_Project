  Each pitch is associated with a specific colour- when you see that colour, you name/ play the pitch.  The downside to this is that studies show, colour pitch association can be very subjective, and so if incorrect for that student, it may not work.  It is possible to purchase simple musical instruments that use this system (xylophone being the most common) and to learn to play quite complex melodies, through developing this memory.  Check out synesthesia for more information on cross sensory connections.

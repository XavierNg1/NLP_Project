 Doing arts and crafts can be incredibly relaxing and therapeutic. It engages the senses and helps shift attention away from whatever you might be worrying about.If you regularly do arts and crafts, pick something that you enjoy doing and that you know will help you feel relaxed. This isn’t the time to try and learn a new skill.
Projects that involve repetitive actions, like knitting, are particularly helpful for reducing stress and calming both the body and the mind.Even if you’re not the artistic or crafty type, something as simple as doodling or coloring can help you relax. Coloring books for adults are a great stress-relief tool that just about anyone can use., Make sure you have whatever you need for your project before you start. For a coloring or sketching project, this could include paper, pencils, and pens. If you’re doing something like knitting or crochet, make sure you have the yarn and needles you need.
 Pick a quiet, comfortable area where you know you will have enough space and light to work. Organize your materials the way you want them. If you’d like, prepare yourself a light, healthy snack and a relaxing beverage (like herbal tea) to have on hand while you work.
 Pick something soothing that won’t distract you too much while you work on your project.
 If you’re feeling cramped or stiff from sitting too long, it may be time to take a break. Walk around and do some light stretches.


Gently shake your wrists and ankles to loosen them up.
Shrug your shoulders up and down a few times, and gently roll them forward and backward.
Stretch your arms up above your head and then very slowly bend over until you are touching or almost touching your toes. Let your arms hang loose in front of you for a moment, and then slowly straighten up again.
 The goal is to relax, not stress yourself out. You don’t have to finish or even get a certain amount done. If you start to feel tired, put your project away for the night.

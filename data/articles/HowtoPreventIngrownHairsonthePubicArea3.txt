 One of the worst things you can do is to pluck or pick at ingrown hairs. Doing so will put you at risk for infection and scarring.Wait for the hair to grow out before treating it. Attempting to shave the hair will only cause further irritation.
 You may not realize it, but your skinny jeans aren't helping an ingrown hair problem. Tight clothing and undergarments actually make it difficult for your skin to breathe, which is one of the culprits of ingrown hair.Cotton is the way to go for both undergarments and clothing, as it allows your skin to breathe properly.
 If you do spot an ingrown hair, be sure to monitor it for signs of infection. If the area is red, tender, itchy or filled with pus, that may indicate that the hair follicle is becoming infected.


Call your doctor immediately if you feel a fever coming on or if the redness begins to spread to other areas.
Otherwise, keep the area moisturized and let it breathe by wearing loose clothing. Do not attempt to shave the area or pick at it in any way.

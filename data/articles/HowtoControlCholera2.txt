 Doctors prescribe antibiotics to help control diarrhea brought on by cholera. These antibiotics wonâ€™t necessarily kill the bacteria responsible for cholera, but they will shorten your symptoms. Talk to your doctor before to get these prescriptions. Typical medications that are prescribed are:Doxycycline only requires a single pill. It is not recommended for children or pregnant women due to possible effects on tooth development, but should still be used if it is the only option.Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, known as TMP-SMX, Bactrim, or Septra, is recommended for children.
Tetracycline, like doxycycline, is not recommended for children if other options are available.Furazolidone is recommended for pregnant women.
 In order to combat diarrhea, take zinc supplements. Studies show that zinc supplements can help control diarrhea problems because zinc makes the lining in your stomach and intestines less vulnerable to irritation, even when you have cholera. It is recommended that you take:


50 to 300 mg per day if you are an adult
20 mg a day for 10 to 14 days for children six months or older
10 mg a day for 10 to 14 days for children younger than six months, Despite feeling weak and awful, it is really important that you continue to keep up your hygiene practices. You don't get sicker or spread the cholera to others. Wash your hands whenever you go to the bathroom or deal with dirty diapers.


To prevent further water contamination, make sure you dispose of your and others human waste properly, even if you do not have a proper toilet.

 While each troop's order should be organized, separated, labeled, and correct, this isn't always the case. If you're one of the first ones there, you can be sure that you get the cookies in the best condition, there will be enough to fill your order completely, and you can double (and triple) check that your order is correct. Depending on the size of your order, you may need help with this... preferably someone who owns a van.
 This may be the leader's house, someone's large shed or garage, or just about anywhere that the whole order will fit. Inform the whole troop of this location, and have each parent stop by sometime to take their girl's order home.
 While not required, it's a nice touch, and your neighbors will love to see a handwritten note from the scout. Just a generic "Thanks for buying Girl Scout cookies from (troop number). We can't wait to (what you plan to do with the money). I hope you enjoy your cookies, and thanks again!" will make an impression. have as many thank-you notes as you have orders, and put one in each bag (see next step).
 It makes the delivery process much easier if all the orders are already divided up. Boxes or plastic bags with the person's last name on a tag will make the whole deal go much more quickly, and organizing the orders can be fun for younger scouts.
 When delivering to your neighbors, you may wish to load the orders into a wagon and pull it door-to-door, or if you're delivering to a bigger area, you can go in your car. At every house you go to, hand the person their order, collect their money, give them change (if necessary) and put it in an envelope or fanny pack, thank them again, and leave. Remember to mark off who you've delivered to and that they've paid.

 Treat your brain’s craving for chocolate like you would treat a toddler who keeps demanding ice cream. Instead of putting effort into battling your urge, find something else to do instead.


Being active will help your brain move on. Try taking a walk, or if you’re at work and can’t leave the building, even walking up and down stairs can reset your thinking.
Talk to friends. Start texting or messaging someone online. Typing will keep your hands – and your brain – occupied, making it hard to give in and eat that chocolate.;
, Giving and getting hugs also makes you feel better. Instead of the dopamine rush you get from chocolate, hugging can give you a rush of oxycotin, which also makes you feel better without the regret of chocolate., Chocolate is high in fat, high in calories, and high in sugar. It tastes good when you give into it, but it won’t feel good in the long run. Treat yourself right. Your health will thank you if you avoid it.Chocolate does actually make you feel better – it gives you a rush of dopamine. But that good feeling only lasts three minutes., See how long you can go. Wait five minutes. Then up the time to ten minutes. Postpone the urge, and if it’s not out of hunger, you might find that it dissipates the longer you wait, or you may get busy doing something else and forget about the urge altogether.


Each time you give in and eat it, your brain will make stronger connections telling you that you should have it. The more you resist that temptation, the weaker that connection becomes., You may have gotten used to making chocolate your treat after a long day at work or a difficult experience, but think of other things that make you feel better. Why not take a bath, get a new book at the library, or play a video game? You can change your rewards based on how you feel, or you may find one that works perfectly for you every time.

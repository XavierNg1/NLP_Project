 Using a styling iron on wet hair can seriously damage it. If you wash your hair daily, shampoo and condition it before you begin. Add a heat-protecting product before blow-drying.If your hair is naturally wavy or has loose curls, then it's already in perfect shape for a shoulder-length cut. Instead of heat styling, simply spritz in a little texturizing spray.
If your hair is naturally very curly, you can still style it into waves. However, you will likely need to straighten your hair first.
 For boho waves, you can use any type of curling wand. However, specialty waving wands may be easier to work with.Be sure to have a heat-resistant or "thermal" glove on hand to keep from burning your skin as you style.
 With one hand, separate out a one-to-two inch section of hair. Wrap it around your styling iron, leaving at least an inch of unwrapped hair at the tip. Shoulder-length hair only needs to be wrapped two or three times around a medium curling wand.
 Release the section from your iron after 10 to 15 seconds.With your gloved hand, hold the tip of the section out away from your head. It may seem counterintuitive to straighten your freshly-curled locks back out, but this will give them the relaxed, effortless boho look.
 Take a second section of hair and curl it just like you did the first. Repeat this process until all of your hair is in waves, moving from one side of your head to the other.


Don't worry about making your strands the same size, as a little unevenness will give your hair a more natural look.
Likewise, don't wrap each section around your wand in exactly the same way. Alternate directions when winding and start at slightly different lengths., Texturizing sprays are a relatively new type of product specifically designed to create a dry look without leaving behind residue. Spray a light dusting on your hair to mimic tousled, sea breeze-kissed texture. Afterwards, give your locks a quick finger comb, and your perfect boho curls are done.

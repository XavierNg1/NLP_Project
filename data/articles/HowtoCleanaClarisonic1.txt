 Before you get started, double check that the Clarisonic’s power button is switched to the “off” position. You don’t want it to accidentally turn on while you’re in the middle of cleaning it!


Clean your Clarisonic a safe distance away from its charging base or any other plug-in grooming products that could potentially be damaged by stray water.;
, Grip the brush head by the edges a twist counterclockwise. This will release it from its slot inside the handle of the unit. Lightly brush any excess dust and debris from the bristles by hand, then set the brush head aside.Don’t attempt to clean your Clarisonic while it’s still in one piece. The worst of the mess is usually hidden inside the brush.
You may notice dirt or mold collected on the inside of the unit, as well., Beneath the brush head you should see a separate plastic piece used to secure the brush head to the handle. Pinch the depressions on the sides of this piece and lift it straight off of the base. You can clean this separately.Keep up with the connector piece. If you lose you, your brush may not fit back together properly.
Since you’re already taking the brush apart, it will be wise to go ahead and clean every component that you have access to.

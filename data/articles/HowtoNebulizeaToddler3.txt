 The mask of the nebulizer can be the scariest part for a toddler. By making the mask seem like the most special or exciting part of the nebulizer, you can help your toddler feel less scared. You can try telling them it’s a pilot mask or a mask for a spaceship., As long as you stick to decorating the outside of the mask, it will still work properly. Let your toddler decorate it with stickers so they feel it’s theirs.You can also buy masks in the shape of animal’s faces. If your toddler has a health condition – like asthma – that might require the regular use of the nebulizer, investing in an animal-shaped mask might make things easier on your toddler.
 They can watch you put the medicine in, fill the nebulizer with water, or prepare the tubing. It will make the nebulizer seem much less mysterious and therefore less scary., Most toddlers can’t sit still for more than a few seconds, and it can be especially hard when they’re wearing a mask over their face. Read a story to them, or watch a short video or cartoon while they’re being nebulized.

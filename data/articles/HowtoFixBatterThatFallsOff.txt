, It is really important to use fat or oil that is able to take high temperatures, such as peanut oil. Good fats for deep frying include:


Butter, ghee
Corn oil
Cottonseed oil
Lard
Macadamia nut oil
Peanut oil
Rice bran oil
Walnut oil, You will see a little blue smoke rising. This is known as its "smoke point", the temperature at which the fat or oil gives off smoke. The smoke point of oil is affected by the purity and age of the oil., This step is optional if you don't have a thermometer but it is very helpful.

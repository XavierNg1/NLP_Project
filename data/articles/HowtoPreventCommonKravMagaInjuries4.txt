 In Krav Maga, the 360 knife defense involves slamming the blade of your forearm into the attacker's forearm. You're going to get a bruise, and so will the attacker. When doing groin kicks or round kicks, you want to hit the attacker with your shin, not your foot. This means you will get bruises on your shins too.
 Since you're working out, you should be eating a high-protein, high-carb, low fat diet. It's trendy to not eat carbs, but they are key in muscle and tissue growth, so you want them. You can get your carbs from vegetables instead of pasta if you want, but get about a gram of protein and carbs per half-kilo or one pound of lean muscle.


Getting enough vitamins helps bruises heal.
 It helps build muscle, and you should take 4 to 6 grams each day. It forces muscles to store water, and this helps in their recovery. This reduces the time your bruises take to heal, and also helps reduce muscle soreness.
 After a great deal of repetition (and bruising), your nerves will become fairly numb and you won't even notice the bruises anymore. Your forearms and shins will go numb instead of hurting, allowing you to hit much harder. This takes about a year of constant training to achieve.

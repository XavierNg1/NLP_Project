 For this method, you will need to .


Hold your Zippo in your off hand so that the hand that can snap the best is free.
Hold your Zippo between your index finger and thumb and position it so that the lid is unobstructed.



Think of it like you’re about to flick a quarter to spin it. Or, like you’re flicking a paper football.
 Flick your Zippo open with your middle finger. If done with enough force, your fingers should be extended, and your hand should be forming a “4” symbol.
 Now quickly position your middle finger and thumb on the wheel and snap downward.









Rest the edge of your middle finger on the very top of the wheel.
Simply snap your fingers normally, don’t try to do anything special. If you snap correctly, the momentum will have enough force to spin the flint wheel and ignite the wick.
It may take a few snaps before you successfully light your Zippo, especially if you’re new to the trick.
 When you are done, close your lid with your middle finger, or in any other manner you wish.









You can snap your lid closed by flicking your wrist forward and downward toward the ground. Just make sure you have a tight grip so you don’t drop it.

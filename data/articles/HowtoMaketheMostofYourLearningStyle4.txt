 Kinesthetic learners learn through movement, hands-on exploration, and experiences. They benefit from demonstrations and acting out what they learn through manipulation and building models.
 Since kinesthetic learners use movement to retain and evaluate information, you can incorporate movement into your study techniques.As you read, use your finger to trace across lines of text, headlines, graphs, and photographs.
Move around as you review or study information. Many people like to pace, tap their fingers, and move their legs as they review information.
Establish physical rituals for studying like moving to a certain location, changing sitting positions, or moving rooms after an hour.
 Note taking is an important way to retain and recall information that you’ve learned. Transferring hand written notes into a typed document on a computer (or the inverse) is a good way to commit your notes to memory. Using a keyboard is a good way to reinforce learning through touch.
 Hands-on learning helps kinesthetic learners to engage with the topic and to process information more quickly.If the subject you want to learn involves your body, like learning how to paint or hit a baseball, the best way to learn is by doing.
If you are learning about how a physical object works, touch, move, and manipulate the object as you’re learning about its parts.
Use hand motions while you are speaking or presenting about the topic to feel connected to what you are speaking about.

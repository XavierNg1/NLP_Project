 Use a comb to separate your hair from your bangs, and secure it away from your face with a hair clip or elastic band. Comb your bangs straight forward to prepare them for styling.
 Plug in your iron and let it heat thoroughly. Using a higher heat setting will result in a longer-lasting, sleeker look, while a lower heat setting will leave some texture in your hair.
 Grasp your bangs at the root with the straightening iron. Slide it down to the tips, pulling your bangs in the direction you want them to sweep and slightly turning your wrist under so your bangs will curve inward against your forehead. Release your bangs from the iron when you reach the tips.
 Use a comb or your fingers to fluff up your bangs in the direction you want them to sweep. Adding a little volume will make them look more natural.
 Use mousse, hair gel or hairspray to keep your bangs flowing in the right direction.

 Cats need safe spaces where they can retreat from the mayhem of everyday life. This is especially important for shy and nervous cats. Create a space in your home where your cat feels comfortable. This can be as simple as placing a cat basket in a cozy corner in a quiet room or buying an enclosed cat bed.Your cat will choose spaces in your home where it feels comfortable. For instance, if your cat enjoys sleeping under the bed, you can make this place more comfortable for it by placing a soft blanket or cat bed in the area where they like to rest.
 Do you find your cat scratching your favorite furniture instead of its scratching post? You can help curb this behavior by positioning multiple scratching posts around your house, rather than a single post in a place of your choice. This will create more comfortable spaces for your cat to scratch around the house., One way to create more space for your cat is by placing several litter boxes around your home. This will give your cat multiple bathrooms and expand their household space. Try placing the litter boxes near places where your cat spends a lot of time, like by your catâ€™s favorite window and in the bathroom.In general, you should have as many litter boxes as you have cats plus one, so if you only have one cat, you should have at least 2 litter boxes. You should also make sure you have a litter box on each level of your home. Your cat should always have access to its litter box.

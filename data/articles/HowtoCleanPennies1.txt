 For many pennies, one tablespoon (15 g) of salt in 1/2 cup (4 oz) of vinegar will get the job done. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salt.









If you don't have vinegar, use lemon or even orange juice. Copper oxide (the gunk on your pennies) dissolves in weak acid, and that's just what all three of these liquids are.;
, Make sure they are not directly on top of each other.
 If they're extra dirty or if you're cleaning a lot simultaneously, give them a few more minutes for good measure.









For those especially nasty pennies, scrub them with a scrubber or toothbrush after they've been resting in the solution for a bit.
 Let them dry for around five minutes so they will no longer be wet. They will now sparkle.









If you don't wash them off, a blue-green sheen will develop on your pennies. That's what happens when the copper, oxygen, and chlorine (from the salt) combine (called malachite).

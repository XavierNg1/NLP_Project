 Yarrow stalk was probably used in ancient times, since it grew around the temples and shrines, but you can use any other 50 identical objects (e.g. matches, pens or cotton swabs), as well.;
, There should be 49 stalks left.
 Just randomly separate them into those two pillars.
 Since 49 is an uneven number, one of the two pillars has to be at least one stalk bigger than the other pillar. Take away one of the stalks from that and put it aside.
 Take the last pillar, which should be made out of 1 ~ 4 stalks (since some numbers are not dividable by four), and put them aside. There should be a number between 40 and 46 stalks left now.
 Take your 40 - 46 stalks and start over from part 3. Do this over and over again, until you've got a number of stalks between 6 and 9 left.
 According to the amount of stalks, you have left, you write down the first line of your hexagram. The first line is always the bottom line. The lines are:


Six stalks - Old Yin (also called Changing Yin or Strong Yin): --- o ---
Seven stalks - Young Yang (also called Weak Yang): ---------
Eight stalks - Young Yin (also called Weak Yin): ---   ---
Nine stalks - Old Yang (also called Cahnging Yang or Strong Yang): ----x----

, In order to get a full hexagram, you will have to do steps 1 - 7 another five times, until you've got all the six lines.


You will have to draw the second line above the first (bottom) line. The sixth line should be the upmost line on top of the hexagram.
 The commentary of the hexagram shows your current situation in life. If there is any Old Yin or Old Yang in your hexagram, you will have to draw a second hexagram.


Any Old Yin will change into Young Yang and any Old Yang will change into Young Yin.

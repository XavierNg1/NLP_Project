 You don't need to play any games, especially if you have been with this person in the past. Say exactly what you feel. Put all of your cards onto the table. Spell out your expectations for this relationship, and explain what you want. If you're going to rebuild a relationship, it's incredibly important to establish a line of open and healthy communication.


If you want to get back together, say so. If you just want this person to know that you love them, then make that clear. If you have a vision for what you want to happen next, then explain it.
 Don't wait too long, and don't be afraid to act on your feelings. The more you obsess about this, the harder it will be. Work up your courage, talk to your love, and explain how you feel. Ask yourself this question: "If I do not do this, will I regret it later?"

, All you need to say, really, is "I still love you." But once you do this, don't laugh or stare at them, that will give them the wrong message that it is a prank or joke. Act serious but show them the personality in you that they love. If you have the words for it, then explain why you still love them, or explain how long or how consistently you have loved them.If you need to apologize for something, then make your apology and let it stand. You should not have to grovel in order to get this person back.
 If you have agreed to meet this person somewhere, don't just leap right into the "I still love you," line. Make a bit of small talk: ask how they've been, and tell them a bit about yourself, and try to set a positive scene. That said â€“ don't beat around the bush. This person probably has some idea of why you wanted to meet up, and he/she may be waiting for you to speak your piece. Be patient, but forthright.

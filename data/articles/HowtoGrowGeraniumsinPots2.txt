 Early to mid-April is usually standard. Once the seeds start to sprout, you can move them outdoors. Just make sure that the last frost of the season has already passed.
 Allow the soil to remain fairly loose, as tightly packed soil can suffocate the plant.
 Space seeds a few inches apart from one another. This space is necessary to ensure that the flowers will have room to grow without suffocating another's roots.
 Only apply a light layer of soil, as too much soil may prevent the seeds from germinating.

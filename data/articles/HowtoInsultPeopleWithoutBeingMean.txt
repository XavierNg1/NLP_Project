 Sometimes, someone will insult you, and you insult them back, and they'll get all upset. Usually you can tell who is okay to insult and who isn't. Make sure you know that this person is okay to insult!;
, Make sure you have an enthusiastic and happy, joke-y tone. If you have a serious tone they'll think you are not joking! Make sure you make it obvious you're joking!

, You never know, even if you think they're not the kind of person to get upset, and if you ensure you're joking, you have to be ready to apologize. A good apology! Make sure, you include that you were only joking and you didn't mean to offend them. Also, make sure you cover up the insult with a compliment on the same thing, for example, if you're insult was "You're top sucks" then you should include (even if it's a boy) that they're top looks awesome!

, No big ones like "You're the worst person on earth" because, even if they act all happy, they could be upset on the inside, just little one's like "Seriously, that's the hairstyle you're going with?" and remember, even though this was already said, make sure you say it in a joking matter!

, Say if you said "You have a bad hairstyle" one day and then said it the next day, they'll think they really do have a bad hairstyle and get self-conscious! So, try not to use the same insult on someone over and over, it could also show you aren't very good at insulting people!

, If you just choose one person to insult, and do it frequently, make sure that when you're not insulting them, you're being nice to them, they'll then know that you really are just kidding and they'll want to be your friend

, Especially if it's your friend or someone you want to be friends with, even if they know you're kidding, they'll find it annoying that you're always insulting them. One insult war to one person a day is the maximum, go over this and you may be annoying, unless, of course, They start the war, then you can proceed!

, Just follow these rules and be careful!

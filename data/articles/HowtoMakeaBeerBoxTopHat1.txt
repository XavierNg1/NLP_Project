 Frat Toys has a few great visuals of hats made from beer boxes.;
, Each box should be the size that holds 24 cans of beer.


Make sure the boxes are dry and in good shape. Use the same brand for a more professional look or different brands if you want to showcase multiple kinds of beer.






Be careful not to cut or rip the cardboard. This will ruin the box.






Once the boxes are unfolded, face the printed side of the box downwards towards the floor or tabletop. The brown cardboard from the inside of the box should face upward.






Flatten any lumps or uneven sections. This can be done with your hand or a hard, flat object like a book or ruler. The flatter you can make the empty beer boxes, the better your top hat will look.
 Mark the spot on the string where it intersects itself.

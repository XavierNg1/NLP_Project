 It's best during early spring but can be found all-year around. Choose stalks that are bright green/purple or white and are firm. Avoid limp, discolored or bruised asparagus.


Frozen asparagus can be steamed, although the texture won't be as firm as steamed fresh asparagus.;
, Run it under cool water. Use your fingers to remove any soil.
 The tough, woody part at the base of the asparagus stem is not as tasty and tender as the top part. Snap it off with your hands or use a knife to chop it off.


If you wish, cut the asparagus into bite-sized pieces before steaming.






Thick asparagus can be peeled. If the skin seems a little tough, use a potato peeler to remove it.
 Squeeze out excess water so the towels are moist, but not dripping wet.
 Grab a good bunch of asparagus and wrap it completely in a towel. Repeat until all the asparagus has been bundled and wrapped.


Alternatively, place inside a microwave steamer bag available from the supermarket.
 Microwave on high for 3 minutes.


Check the asparagus to see if it is ready. If it looks bright green and is slightly tender when pierced with a fork, it's done.






If the asparagus is still tough when pierced with a fork, microwave it for another minute.
 Unroll it from the paper towels, place it in a serving dish, and serve hot.


Be careful when removing the asparagus from the paper towels, since it will all be piping hot. Use tongs if necessary.
 It will taste great without this addition, since the stalks have been steamed in their own moisture, and have not lost any of their nutritional value.

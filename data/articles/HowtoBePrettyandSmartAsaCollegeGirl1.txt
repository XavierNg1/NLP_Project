 Ideally, you should write this list down, but thinking about it should be enough. List all the things you love about yourself, such as shiny hair or wonderful eyes, all the things you don't, like love handles or a big nose, your GPA, every subject you're good at, the things you're struggling with, pour it all out.
 This can be anything from a poor grade in a subject to feeling like you dress less than fabulous.
 Write down your dream GPA, what grades you need to achieve on each subject to attain them. Make a list of all the things you wish to improve your knowledge on, be it national history, geography or art. Also list all your goals appearance related, be it long string nails, shiny hair or luscious lips.

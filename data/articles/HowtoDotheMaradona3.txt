 Place three cones in a V shape about 5 yards apart from each other. This will give you plenty of space to work up a ball dribble and set up the Maradona move.
 The first step to perfecting the Maradona is to get your body accustomed to the movement and spin. Start at the first cone and pretend to dribble a ball toward an imaginary defender at the second cone. When you want to start the Maradona, tap the ground with your dominant foot, turn, and step that foot in between you and the defender. Tap your other foot on the ground and spin to complete the Maradona, heading for the third cone., Start at the first cone and dribble the ball toward the second cone. Imagine the second cone is a defender and do the Maradona. Dribble the ball to the third cone and back to the first cone.
 Working with another person is much different than using a cone to imagine the position of a defender. Have the other player stand still while you approach, do the Maradona, and accelerate away.Ask the other player to start moving around, running toward you at an angle or from the side. Have them try to steal the ball away from you.

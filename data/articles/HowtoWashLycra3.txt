 Lay a towel flat. Place the Lycra item in the center of the towel. Next, fold the edges up over the clothing. Roll up the clothing. Gently squeeze out excess water, then lay the towel and clothing flat again., Heat and direct sunlight are damaging to the stretchy Lycra fibers. To keep your clothing fresh, pick a safe area. Find an out of the way area where you can lay out a towel.Hang drying is a quicker alternative, but the water pulling downwards will stretch out the Lycra over time.
Avoid using an iron on full Lycra clothing. On Lycra blends, if you still want to risk ironing, use as low a heat setting as possible.
 Set the laundry bag filled with Lycra items in the dryer. The heat of a dryer can be harmful to the stretch of the fabric, so pick the lowest heat setting you can find. Pick the delicates setting, if your machine has it, or a low heat tumble dry.Air drying is the better alternative. Machine dry only when you’re short on time.
Don’t use fabric softener when Lycra is being dried.

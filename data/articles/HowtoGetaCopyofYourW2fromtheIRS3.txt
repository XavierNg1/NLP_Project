 Sometimes, W-2 forms from employers are not sent, or they get lost in the mail. If you’re missing your W-2, contact your employer before contacting the IRS. Employers have until January 31 of the year taxes will be filed to send a W-2 to employees. If you haven’t received a W-2 by January 31, contact your employer.Make sure your employer has your correct address. If the address was incorrect, the form may have been returned.
Allow two weeks for your employer to resend the W-2.
 If you haven’t received your W-2 by February 14 of the tax year, call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.

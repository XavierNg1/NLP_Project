 Don't hang on to them no matter how much you like them. If they aren't working, they probably won't work in the future! Have you been posting the same ad in the newspaper for a year, without a single call? Perhaps you can use the same strategy, but update the ad!;
, You should have a budget for marketing and that can range from 10-25%.
 If you are a florist, volunteer to do some arrangements for community events. If you are a website designer, donate a website creation to a local charity's silent auction. If you are a clown, volunteer to do face painting for the community picnic. If you are a photographer, volunteer to take pictures for the Chamber of Commerce's Newsletter. Be sure to always have a sign and business cards with your donation so you can receive full credit. Not all marketing is about the radio, television or newspaper ads. You can have fun being creative!

, I would only suggest this if your business is medium- large sized. Small business simply don't usually have the resources to hire a marketing specialist but rather you can consult a business coach. A business coach can help you come up with ideas and put you in contact with key people that will help promote your business.
 Focus on how your product or service will help people and make them feel, not just what you are selling them. People don't care how much you know until they know that you care!

, Many small businesses find that marketing on Google AdWords is both affordable and really helps their company feel like a real company. A simple budget of $100 a month can turn into multiple leads per year!

, Many manufacturers will help you advertise by reimbursing you for advertisements (these are called Co-Ops). These funds may make methods of advertising that are too expensive on your own become more affordable!

 Just remember that as a human, she actually has to be using surfaces! The angle of her body needs to be believable.
 If she's sitting, what is she sitting on? What is she looking at? Try to always maintain a curve in her torso, through to her waist.


Don't forget her facial lines and joints. Her large eyes should match up with her small nose and smile. And her hands and fingers need to be delicately proportioned, too.
 You may need a template, as Ariel in her human form is much less iconic than when she's in her fins. The dress is fairly basic -- full, straight angles, and complemented by an absolutely huge bow.


Have you mastered her hair flap yet? The great thing about it is that it doesn't have to look believable at all (she's too perfect to be human). It just has to look adequately Ariel-esque.
 This is the chance you get to put the delicate lines exactly where you want them. The finer the tool, the more precise you can get.
 It'll be a lot easier to do this if you've refined the sketch. Sometimes too many lines gets a bit confusing. Outline whatever lines need to be present in your final draft.


Have you got the wrinkles in her fabric outlined? The lines in her hair? Eyelashes? Don't forget those eyelashes!

, Be diligent; depending on your medium of color, pencil marks (or even eraser marks) will sometimes be visible.
 The bodice of her dress should be dark blue, her skirt and bow medium blue, and her sleeves light blue. Her eyes are also blue and her hair is that classic fire engine red.

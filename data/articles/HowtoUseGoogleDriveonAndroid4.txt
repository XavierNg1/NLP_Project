 Open the file you want to send via email. Once open, tap the share icon next to the file name at the top.


From the drop-down menu, select “Send file.” Your default email app will open, and the file will be attached to the email. All you have to do is enter recipients, the subject, and compose the content of the email, and then hit the “Send” button.
 To do this, open the file to share then tap the share icon next to the file name at the top. Select “Add people,” and a list of apps will appear. Tapping on one of the apps will allow you to share the file link through the app.


For example, tapping Facebook will compose a Facebook post with the share link of the app.
Sharing a file through any email app will attach the file to an email using that email app, and all you need to do is add recipients, a subject, and the body of the email.
 Google Drive also allows you to grant someone access to edit a file; this is especially useful when working on a project. To collaborate on a file, open the file you want to share and tap on the “i” icon to the right of the file name.


Tap on “Add people, which is the first option. You will have to enter the email address of the collaborator in the first field, and an optional message in the next field. Tap “Add” at the bottom to send the invite.
People you collaborate with will have to install Drive, Sheets, Docs, or Slides (depending on the file format) to have access to the file you shared.

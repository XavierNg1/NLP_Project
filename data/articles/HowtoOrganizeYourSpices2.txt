 To organize your spices according to their level of utility, you’ll first have to figure out which ones you use most often. Make a list of your favorite dishes, the ones you cook most frequently. Next to each dish, list the spices involved in the dish. This secondary list will be your guide for organizing your spices.Spices you use regularly should be given pride of place when organizing your spices. Place them in a convenient location like the top row of a spice rack or toward the front of your kitchen pantry.
 Make a list of dishes you cook only intermittently or rarely. Draw a second column next to this list and identify the spices used in each of these dishes. Use this list to determine which spices should be located toward the middle of the spice cabinet or in the middle of the spice rack., If you look at a particular spice and realize you’ve never used it, or cannot remember the last time you used it, place it in a low-priority position when organizing your spices such as the back of the kitchen cabinet. These spices should be given the lowest priority when organizing your spices, or discarded altogether.Unlabeled spices or spices that you cannot identify also fall into this category.

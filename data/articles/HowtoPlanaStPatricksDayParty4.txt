 In this simple mind teaser game, the party guests must sit in a circle. Each person must think of a St. Patrick’s Day-themed word within five seconds, then the person next to them must think of one that begins with the last letter of the word the person before them offered.For instance, if the first person said “clover,” the next person might say “rainbow.”
The game keeps going until no one can think of another appropriately themed word within the time limit.
 Draw an image of a leprechaun holding a pot of gold onto a poster board. Cut out several small shamrocks from construction paper. Place a piece of inverted tape on the back of each shamrock. Blindfold party guests and invite them to try to attach the paper shamrock to the leprechaun’s pot of gold.Award players who attach the shamrock accurately with a small party favor like a chocolate coin.
 Another simple holiday activity involves painting white or green t-shirts with t-shirt markers or paints. These materials are readily available at most arts and crafts stores. Encourage partygoers to paint a shamrock, leprechaun, or similar St. Patrick Day-themed image on their shirt., Find some Irish music you can play during the party. Look in the Celtic music section of your favorite music store (online or in-store), and stock up on some Irish favorites. Play this music in the background during the party.Popular Irish artists include The Pogues and Enya.
If someone can play instruments, enlist them to play some tunes.

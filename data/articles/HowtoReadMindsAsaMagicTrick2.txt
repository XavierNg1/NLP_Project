 Announce that you're writing down each name on a notecard and placing them all in a hat. At the end of the trick, you'll predict which audience member is the luckiest one in the audience, and you'll write your prediction on a chalkboard or slate. The name of the luckiest person will then by drawn from a hat by a volunteer, and it will match your prediction. If you have a large audience, you can pick the first ten people to volunteer their names; for a smaller audience, everyone can participate., When the first person calls out his or her name, write it down on a card. Write the same name when the second person calls out his or her name. Keep writing the same name on every card even though people are calling out a different name each time. Put all the cards in a hat as you finish writing on them.


Make sure no volunteers are too close to you while you're writing down the names, or they'll see what you're up to.
If you're doing the trick at a birthday party or an event to honor someone, you could also simply write down the name of the honored person on every card, to ensure that he or she is named the "luckiest" person there.
Instead of saying you're predicting who is the luckiest person, you could say you're predicting who will get married next, who's the most mysterious person, or who's the unluckiest person. Tailor it to the event and the people.
 After everyone is finished speaking and the cards are in the hat, write the special person's name down in large letters and show it to the audience. Announce that you know without a doubt that this person is the luckiest one in the room.
 Hold the hat above the volunteer's head and ask him or her to draw a name and announce it to the audience. People will gasp when they hear the name. Make sure you put the remaining cards away immediately so people won't see how you did the trick.

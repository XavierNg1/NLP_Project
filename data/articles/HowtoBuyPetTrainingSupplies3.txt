 Almost all pets respond well to new (or even old) toys. Earning trust through play is an important part of any training process. Get a few new toys as often as you can and rotate them in with the older toys. You can also use access to a favorite toy as a bit of motivation for a difficult part of the training process.


Cats, for example, loves toys that make unique noises or are complex to the touch, such as feathers., It is best to go online to look up any toy safety concerns that specifically pertain to your pet’s breed. Some animals don’t do well with strings (birds) whereas others (cats) are perfectly okay with them. Varying sizes of balls can be an issue for pets as well because they can present a choking hazard.Trust your safety instincts as well. If a toy looks dangerous to you, don’t buy it. Even common items such as tennis balls can be hazardous when used by certain animals, such as particularly large dogs., It is also always a good idea to pick up and remove any toys that are well past their prime. Pet training supply manufacturers are not fully regulated and so it is best to not push these products too far. Any toys that are ripped apart could possibly be ingested by your pet., Many training regimens involve positive reinforcement in the form of treating. Buy a treat type that is best suited for your particular pet. Their animal group may do best with certain types of treats and your pet may have personal preferences as well.


For example, cats do well with pieces of tuna, diced cooked chicken, or even commercial treats.Make sure to buy treats that are actually treat portions, not meal replacements.

 The sharper the knife, the easier it'll be able to cut through the skin of the banana. You should also get a cutting board so you can cut the banana on a thick, safe surface.
 Place the banana on the cutting board and slice it from the very tip all the way to the handle. If the handle/stem is a little tough, you can use your hands to split them apart at the end.
 Now, place the two halves on the cutting board and cut them horizontally, to create four parts that are about the same size.
 Now, just hold up each piece and gently peel the skin away from the fruit. This is an ideal method if you want to treat others to the banana, or if you want to enjoy the banana more slowly, in sections. It also just looks kind of cool! You're all done.

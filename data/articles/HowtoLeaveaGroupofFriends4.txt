 They might also badmouth your other friends, family, or significant other in an effort to pressure you into spending less time with them. Leave groups of friends like this as soon as possible.
 Whether for good or ill, friends are a major influence in your life. If your friends engage in negative behaviors, you should leave the group of friends before you get yourself into trouble with them. You should consider leaving your group of friends if they:


Steal goods from stores
Abuse drugs and alcohol
Vandalize public or private property
Engage in other immoral or illegal acts

, This might be an indirect form of bullying (bullying by exclusion). Friends who do this do not value your company, and are not friends at all.
 If you’re providing money, food, or a place to crash for your group of friends and your generosity is not being reciprocated, you are being taken advantage of and should leave the group., Avoid friends who try to minimize your accomplishments. They are bad friends and not worth keeping.


For example, if you tell your friends that you got a 93% on your test, and they brag that your score is not that great because they got an even higher score, they are bad friends.
Conversely, if you say that you’re having a bad day, and your friends insist that they are having even worse days, consider leaving the friend group.



If you find yourself making excuses to avoid your group of friends, they are probably not good for your mental health.
Friends that wear you out with their complaints, drama, or criticism should be left behind.

 Your kitten will love the safety and security of its crate or cage. The cage provides your cat with a refuge from you and all the other people that it doesn’t quite trust. Don’t close the door to the cage. Just allow your kitten to hang out in there when it wants.Don’t attempt to remove your kitten or pester it to come out. This will not be conducive to trust-building.
The cage should have enough room for the kitten to stand up and turn around.
You might want to put a soft towel or cloth on the bottom of the cage to make it cozier for your kitten., If you live in a house with loud children and big, barking pets, your kitten might be scared – especially if it already doesn’t trust you. Place your kitten in a small room without other pets or people. If you’re not yet at the stage where you can pick your kitten up, entice your kitten into the room using kitty treats.This is an important step if you know you’ll be having company over. Keep your kitten in the enclosed space until you’ve told your guests that you want to introduce them to your kitten. Instruct your guests to get down on their hands and knees and speak in a kind manner to the kitten that doesn’t trust you.
Even if you don’t have company, kids, or other pets, it is important to keep kittens isolated when introducing them to a new space. This will keep them feeling happy and safe. And if they feel happy and safe, they will be more capable of extending their trust to you.
 Being in a big, new space can be disorienting and scary for kittens. Your kitten might struggle to trust you if it is suddenly set loose in a house that, from its perspective, is a giant maze. Keep your kitten confined and introduce it to new spaces of the house gradually. Showing your kitten one new room every two or three days should be a slow enough rate of exposure to prevent alarm.

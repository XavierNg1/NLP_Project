 If the website does not appear to be reputable and list its sources, then you should try again using another website from your search results. The following are ways to evaluate websites:


Give preference to any sites that have strictly controlled URLs. This means that any website that ends in .gov, .mil, .edu or .org falls into the institutions of government, military, school or non-profit, respectively. These organizations vouch for the material and are more selective that personal or company websites.
Determine if it is someone's personal web page. Look for a name, such as Jill Peterson, jpeterson or j. peterson, at the bottom or side of the page. Look at the author or "about" section to determine who has gathered the information. If the web page is personal, you must find out if the author has enough credentials to be an expert in the field. Most personal web pages give opinion, but it may be worth citing if the person is an academic or author quoting from their own journals or books.
Look for the publisher. The publisher is often listed in the "about" section, at the bottom of the page and in the URL. Decide if the publisher is a news resource, such as The Washington Post, or if it is relatively unknown. Search for information about the publisher in a search engine to find out if they are academic or news related. If not, it may not be a reliable source.
Look for the date the information was last updated. Near the top or bottom of a page, there should be a date listed when the information was last updated. If it is not recent, consider finding a source with more recent information.
Look for links or sources. If the person quotes other sources, ensure they are listed accurately. A well researched article should have a short bibliography or source link at the end.
Use your best judgment. Ask yourself if the tone and language of the website seems professional and objective. If it seems like opinion, look for a more balanced source.

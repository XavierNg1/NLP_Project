 On your Ribbon, you will see drop-down menus for font and size. To make changes to text you first have to select the text that you want to work with. You can select individual characters, specific words, or entire paragraphs. After you select text, you can format it. For example, you can change the font, size, and color.


Click on to the left of the first word you wish to select and hold the cursor while dragging the cursor over all the words you wish to select.
 Navigate to the drop-down section on the Ribbon to choose your desired font, size, color, and highlighting. You will see the font button first, to the left right after the Style button. Next, you will find the size button with your default size (usually size 12 font).


Always consider the formatting guidelines of the document you are writing when choosing the font style and size.
The standard font for most college and professional papers is Time New Roman size 12 font.
 Besides setting the font style and size, you can also adjust the emphasis of words and lines in your document. Beside the size button, you will see the Bold, Italics, and Underline button. The Bold button is a bolded capitol B, the Italics button is an italicized capitol I, and the Underline button is an underlined capitol U.


Just click the buttons on the Ribbon once you have selected the font you want to modify.
 If you would like to add colors and highlights to your document, you can do so by selecting the part of the document you like to add colors to and clicking the Text Highlight or Font Color buttons on the Ribbon.


Navigate to the far right of the Ribbon to find the Highlight button, a blue ABC with a white bar underlining it, and the font color button, a letter A with a black bar underneath.

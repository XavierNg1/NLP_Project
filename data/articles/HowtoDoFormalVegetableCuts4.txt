The first cut is making the vegetable into 10 or 12 cm length portion slices. Then cut these into long sticks 5mm to 10mm wide much like a larger Julienne.
From here, you can then cut into 5 x 2cm sticks if you had cut a 10cm portion, or alternatively you may cut 4 x 3cm or 3 x 4cm sticks for a 12cm portion.

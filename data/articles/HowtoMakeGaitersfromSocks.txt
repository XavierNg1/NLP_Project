 Soccer socks work well.;
, Make the holes smaller than you think you'll need. The openings will stretch out and if they stretch too much, the gaiters won't be very effective.


Put your socks on, then put your gaiters on as if they were socks, but pull them all the way up to your ankles (as if they were ankle bracelets).






Put on your shoes.






Pull the gaiters over your shoes. Find the bottom strap and put that under the arch of your shoe.






Tighten the edges around the opening of your shoe to create a seal.
 If you couldn't get them on, cut the holes a tiny bit bigger and try again.

Some dog owners have had good luck with acupuncture, as they notice it seems to help relieve pain in their dogs. It may also help to correct things like a stiff gait.Some vets may practice acupuncture, too.
Though you may not have an acupuncturist in your area that works on dogs, you can search online or in the phone book to find one. Try looking under "alternative medicine" or "Chinese medicine." Alternatively, look for a vet that also provides natural alternatives, as they will either be able to do the acupuncture themselves or point you in the right direction.

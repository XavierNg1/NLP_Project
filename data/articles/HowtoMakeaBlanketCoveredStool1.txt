 You'll need to know the dimensions of the footstool before choosing a blanket but in most cases, a single bed blanket will be more than enough for a small stool. Clean it up if needed.
 Look for a blanket that has plenty of life left in it and looks hard-wearing. Old military blankets are a good choice (they were usually made of quality wool), as are well woven tartan blankets and blankets from renowned mills. Many vintage blankets can be found online, through auction sites selling collectibles or vintage linens.

If the blanket smells of mothballs, hang it outdoors on the clothesline for a few sunny days. The air and sun will fix things for you.

 The equation should have four separate terms. The exact appearance of those four terms can vary, however.


Usually, you will use this method when you see a polynomial equation that looks like: ax3 + bx2 + cx + d

The equation may also look like:

axy + by + cx + d
ax2 + bx + cxy + dy
ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx
Or similar variations.



Example: 4x4 + 12x3 + 6x2 + 18x

, Determine if all four terms have anything in common. The greatest common factor among the four terms, if any common factors exist, should be factored out of the equation.


If the only thing all four terms has in common is the number "1," there is no GCF and nothing can be factored out at this point.
When you do factor out a GCF, make sure that you continue to keep it at the front of your equation as you work. This factored out GCF must be included as part of your final answer for that answer to be accurate.

Example: 4x4 + 12x3 + 6x2 + 18x

Each term has 2x in common, so the problem can be rewritten as:
2x(2x3 + 6x2 + 3x + 9)



, Group the first two terms together and the second two terms together.


If the first term of the second group has a minus sign in front of it, you will need to put a minus sign in front of the second parentheses. You will need to change the sign of the second term in that grouping to reflect that choice.

Example: 2x(2x3 + 6x2 + 3x + 9) = 2x, Identify the GCF in each binomial pair and factor it to the outside of the pair. Rewrite the equation accordingly.


At this point, you might be faced with a choice between factoring out a positive number or a negative number for the second group. Look at the signs before the second and fourth terms.

When the two signs are the same (both positive or both negative), factor out a positive number.
When the two signs are different (one negative and one positive), factor out a negative number.



Example: 2x= 2x2, The binomial pair inside both parentheses should be the same. Factor this out of the equation, then group the remaining terms into another parentheses set.


If the binomials inside the current sets of parentheses do not match, double-check your work or try rearranging your terms and grouping the equation again.
The parentheses must match. If they do not match no matter what you try, the problem cannot be factored by grouping or by any other method.

Example: 2x2= 2x2, You should have the final answer at this point.



Example: 4x4 + 12x3 + 6x2 + 18x = 2x2(x + 3)(2x2 + 3)

The final answer is: 2x2(x + 3)(2x2 + 3)

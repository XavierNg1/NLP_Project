 This trick is very simple, and relies on your charisma performing this trick. You’ll need a sugar cube, glass of water, and a pencil. Have your materials ready in front of you before performing the trick.


This trick works best on smaller children who won’t suspect what you’re doing.
 Ask your audience for a number between 1 and 10. Once they give you a number, write the number into the sugar cube. Trace over the number several times with your pencil to make sure the number is bold., Pick up the sugar cube so that the side with the number is facing your thumb. Apply pressure so that the pencil mark transfers onto your thumb. Then, drop the sugar cube into the glass of water.


You will need to apply a lot of pressure, so push your thumb into the cube with force.
 This is the most important part of the trick. Grab their hand with your thumb that you printed the number onto. Hold their hand so that your thumb is on their inner palm. Hold their hand for a few moments and say some magic words.


Say magic words to pass the time while you transfer the pencil onto their palm.
Tell them to keep their palm over the glass of water for ten seconds.
 Now tell them to show everyone their hand. They should have a faint image of the number on their inner palm. You should practice these steps with a trusted friend or family member before taking it out to the public.


This works best on little kids who won’t expect the allusion.

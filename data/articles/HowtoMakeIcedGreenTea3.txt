 You will be making a consecrated green tea lemonade first using a small amount of hot water. Don't worry, you will be adding more water to your tea later.
 If you'd like to use another type of sweetener, such as honey, skip the sugar; you will add the honey (or other sweetener) at the end., Give the bag a squeeze to get out any excess liquid.
 If you'd like a little more tartness, add some lemon zest as well.
 This will help dilute the consecrated tea mixture, and make it less tart.
 How much ice you use is up to you, just make sure to leave enough room for the tea. This recipe is enough to make 1 large serving, or 2 smaller servings.
 The tea might still be a little warm, so don't worry if the ice melts a little. This is normal.
 You can serve your green tea lemonade as it is, or you can give it a pop of color. Popular green tea lemonade garnishes include mint leaves and lemon slices.

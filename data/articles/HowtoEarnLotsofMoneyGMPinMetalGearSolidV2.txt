 After Episode 2 of the main story mission, Revolver Ocelot will introduce you to the Fulton Recovery System. Use this to extract as many personnel for your R&D team as possible so that you can get the Cargo +2 upgrade.

The Cargo +2 Fulton upgrade will also require that you extract the Transportation Specialist found at Lamar Khaate Palace (Episode/Mission 10).
 Once you’ve upgraded your Fulton, you can now extract tanks, jeeps, anti-aircraft gun emplacements, and materials containers easily regardless if you’re on a mission or free-roaming in the Afghanistan and Angola-Zaire maps., Although vehicles can be used for missions, it’s best to sell them off for GMP. Open up your iDroid and sell your surplus tanks, walker gears, placeable weapons (anti-air gun emplacements), and other resources from the Resources option under the Mother Base tab.

Selling a tank will net you 50000 GMP while Walker Gears can fetch up to 70000 GMP. Trucks and jeeps can be sold for about 20000–50000 GMP (depending on the model) but are also easy to find in bases and outposts in both Angola-Zaire and Afghanistan (compared to tanks and Walker Gears).
Resources are a bit iffy to sell off because they’re important for developing platforms on Mother Base as well as Venom Snake’s weapons and equipment. It’s recommended that you sell them off only when you’ve constructed all of your Mother Base’s platforms.

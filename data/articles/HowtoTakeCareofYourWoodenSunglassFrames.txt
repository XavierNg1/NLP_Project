 A lot of people make the mistake of using facial tissue paper to wipe their glasses clean. Avoid this. Any wood based material would be abrasive in nature, and may cause scratches. Microfiber lens cloth is your best option when it comes to cleaning lenses.;
, ­Even though it may drop your coolness quotient a tad, it will keep your glasses properly aligned. Taking them off with one hand usually stretches them out.
 ­When cleaning your glasses, use lukewarm water to wash away any dust or dirt that may cause scratches.
 When cleaning your glasses, don't try to scratch off a mark with your nail or fingers because this will only make it worse.
 ­When your wood eyeglasses start to look a little worn out, apply a hint of wax or oil to bring back the luster. Butcher block oil or transparent lip balm should do the trick.
 Cleaning liquids usually have strong chemicals in them, that might damage the wood. Avoid these, use only a microfiber cloth.
 ­Wooden Rx eyewear is typically water resistant. It can withstand sweat and nominal quantities of water. Excessive exposure to water might cause your wood eyeglasses to warp.
 ­This might distort the shape and increase the risk of falling and breaking.
 ­This is especially true for areas that get a lot of sun. Rays from the sun could damage the lens and the frame.
 ­People stuff all sorts of things in their bags. Food, earplugs, combs, cosmetics, credit cards and so on. If you throw your glasses in your purse without their case, they are likely to be damaged in all sorts of ways.
 And if you've got keys in your pockets, the odds are you will most definitely ruin your wooden frame eyeglasses.
 ­Again, as fashionable as that looks, it's not safe for the glasses. They can very easily fall off, especially if you jump or bend.

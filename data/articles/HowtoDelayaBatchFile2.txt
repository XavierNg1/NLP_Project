 The user can skip this waiting period, or you can apply a parameter that keeps the user from skipping.



TIMEOUT may not work with older systems. Try the deprecated SLEEP command if the TIMEOUT command isn't working.
 Add the flag /t followed by the number of seconds.
 Add the flag /nobreak to keep any input from skipping the delay.


The user can still end the program by pressing Ctrl + C (keyboard interrupt).

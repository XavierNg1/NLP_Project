 Whole grains should make up a substantial part of your diet, in part to provide fiber. Try to work them into every meal in the form of whole-wheat breads, brown rice, bulgur, whole cornmeal, or oatmeal, among other options.For instance, add barley to soups and stews, use bulgur as an alternative to rice, and bake with rye and whole wheat flour.
You may need to increase whole grain consumption slowly to decrease side effects such as bloating and constipation.
 A small percentage of people may actually experience increased inflammation after consuming a protein called gluten that is contained in wheat and some other grains. If you fear you may be sensitive to gluten, get tested. If you are gluten intolerant, you can still eat high-fiber, non-gluten whole grains.Amaranth, brown rice, buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum and oats can also be used in gluten-free cooking and baking.
 Highly processed refined grains are not only low in nutrients, they can also actually worsen symptoms associated with inflammation. Further, these sorts of ingredients increase the likelihood of developing other health issues aside from arthritis. Accordingly, remove white bread, white rice, and sugary pastries from your diet.Make sure the ingredients of any packaged bread begins with “whole grain”. Other terms are often used on packaging to imply that a product is healthy, even when it may contain predominantly unhealthy ingredients.

 Even if you feel like your friends decisions are bad for them, they aren’t your decisions to make. If you have talked to your friend about changing, you can do no more. If you have decided to remain friends, you must respect your friend as a person.Do not try to manipulate or force your friend into doing things your way. You can voice your opinion, and then accept the decision that your friend makes.
 Though you do not make your friend’s decisions, you do get to decide what you will participate in and/or tolerate. Make your boundaries clear to your friend and don’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Be clear that your friend must show you the same respect that you show them.If your friend likes to drive recklessly, you might want to say “I will go out to eat with you, but I will not ride in the car with you.”

, You are always in control of your behavior. If you don’t like something your friend is doing, you have the right to remove yourself from the situation. This does not give you the right to belittle your friend or hurt them. They will act as they see fit, and you can act as you see fit.For instance, if you friend is sneaking into the park pool to go skinny dipping, you are under no obligation to go. This doesn’t mean that you should yell at your friend about how irresponsible they are.

 Start with tape line at center of your forehead on hairline. Run the tape line around head, under the bulge at back of your head and back to front to meet the tape line again. This measurement is your correct head-size.








Average head size measurements range from 21" (53cm) to 23" (58cm) in half sizes.
 Decide where you will wear your hat, either sitting further back or forward on your head. Mark this point and start the tape line on the mark. Run the tape line over the top of your head and just over the bulge on the back of your head.








This is the back to front measurement and usually measures 9 1/2" (24cm) to 10 1/2" (26.5cm).
 Start the tape line where the edge of your hat will sit to the same point on the opposite side of your head near your ear.









This is the side to side measurement and usually measures 10" (25.5cm) to 10 1/2" (26.5cm).

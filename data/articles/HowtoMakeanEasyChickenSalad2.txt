 Here's what you'll need to make a chicken noodle salad:


Mayonnaise
Chicken (cut into small pieces)
Carrots (chopped)
Black olives
Celery (chopped)
Radishes (chopped)
Yellow peppers (chopped)
Noodles
Any other vegetables of your choice;
,, When the noodles are good, put them in the fridge so that they can cool.
, The size of the bowl depends on how much stuff you're putting in it. Put the rest of the ingredients in and take out the mayo.
 There should be enough to be a layer on most of it, but you don't want the salad to be just mayo.
 You can eat it now or put it back in the refrigerator until you need it.

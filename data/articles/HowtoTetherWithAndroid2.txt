 Some carriers have blocked the ability to download third-party tethering apps from the Play store, because they allow circumventing of the paid tethering service. To download these apps, you will need to get them directly from the developers’ websites.


Download the .APK file through your phone’s web-browser. When it is finished, tap on the file in your notification bar to install it.
You will need to make sure that third-party apps can be installed to your phone. Open your Settings menu and scroll down to the Security option. In the Security menu, check the box next to “Unknown sources”. This will allow you to install apps that have not been downloaded through the Play store.
 You will presented with options for configuring your Wi-Fi hotspot. You can set the network name as well as the security type and password. Check the box to activate the hotspot.
 Once the third-party app is running, your network will be joinable by other devices. Select the correct network name and enter the password to connect.

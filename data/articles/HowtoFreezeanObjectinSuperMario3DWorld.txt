 You cannot use the freezing ability while on the world map, so you will need to start a level. The world map is set up like a board game, with several levels scattered about the world. Use the toggle stick to move, stopping at one of the many levels. Press the A button to begin the level.;
, Move your character by using the left toggle stick on the GamePad. Find an enemy or object youâ€™d like to freeze.
 Once you encounter enemies or objects, you can use the GamePad screen to freeze them in place. Either tap objects on the screen with your finger or use the stylus (which is located on the back of the GamePad) to freeze them. Freezing objects does not affect your ability to interact with them; it just makes moving items easier to grab.
 After tapping an enemy, it will be frozen in place for 3 seconds. While it is frozen, your character can jump on the enemy to defeat it.

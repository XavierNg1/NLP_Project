 We all have cravings, but if it is hard to satisfy that craving, we are less likely to indulge. To ensure that you donâ€™t overdo it, limit how much junk food you have available. Either do not keep junk food in your house or only keep small, snack size portions. In contrast, keep healthy food close at hand, so that it is easier to eat healthy. Consider, for example, keeping a well-stocked fruit bowl near at hand, so that you are more likely to snack healthy., Cravings can often be triggered by visual cues that remind us of eating the food in the past. Spend some time considering when you typically tend to crave foods. Try to determine if your cravings are related to any particular type of behavior. If so, avoid it in the future. For example:


You might find that you have an urge to eat donuts whenever you pass by a cafe on the way back home. If so, take a different route next time.
Food advertisements can provoke cravings. Consider watching less TV or using a web service that does not run advertisements.If you tend to snack on unhealthy foods at a particular time of the day, resist the urge to do so. This can build an addictive habit., If you stick to reasonable dieting objectives you are more likely to succeed. Overly restrictive diets can create too much temptation and encourage us to give up altogether. Without varied meal options, you are more likely to be tempted and fall for junk food.Part of a good diet, therefore, includes occasional, moderate consumption of unhealthy food. A cookie a week can hold off a more destructive craving.
 You should have a plan for how often you want to eat and what you want to eat at each meal. Most experts now recommend that you eat smaller meals throughout the day, approximately once every four hours. This will keep your metabolism up so that you burn more fat. Either way, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it.

 If you feel lucky enough to get away with jeans, then black skinny jeans with no rivets look gorgeous. Some schools might have a day once a week where you're allowed to wear jeans and/or spirit shirts. If that's allowed, take advantage of that opportunity. If your school is very lenient on types of jeans and everyone at your school breaks the rules, break them too. Wear baggy/bootcut jeans for a tomboy look, skinny for trendy, slim for sexy, and straight-legged for preppy.

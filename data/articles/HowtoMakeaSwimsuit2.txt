 Get a pair of leggings in any color. They must fit you. The material will work best if it is cotton or spandex.
 Cut the legs off of the leggings. They can be cut as shorts (for a 1950s style suit) or a little higher. Just be sure to leave an extra 1/2" for the hem. Don't cut them too short!

, Hem the new leg holes you made.
 Trim the leg pieces that you cut until they reach from the waistline of the leggings up to the back center of your neck, with a half inch seam allowance on either end. Sew the wide base of the legs to the front hem of the shorts, with a gap in between, creating the halter straps.
 Sew the two ends of the legs together where they reach at the neck. This should make a loop that you stick your head through to put the suit on.
 You're done! Put on your new bathing suit and enjoy the sun!

 You may cook this dish in a variety of shapes, but chunkier carrots will take longer to cook.
 Add the carrots and cover to steam gently until almost tender.
 Stir well to cover and simmer gently uncovered for 2-3 minutes more or until carrots are fully tender and the sauce has formed.
 This comfort food is good with a hearty stew.

 Subtle makeup adds charm and flirtatiousness to your face. Well-done makeup is sheer; it should enhance your looks without being obvious. If you're unsure how, try getting a makeover at a cosmetic counter or spa, and ask the operator to show you how to apply the products effectively.
 How you dress affects how people treat you. Subtleness is key when it comes to your wardrobe. Modesty may seem like an old-fashioned concept, but clothes that fit well (not too tight or too baggy) and cover your torso make you look more mature and grown-up. Find a style that fits your personality, then pick clothes that work together on you.
 The number one rule for mature tweens and preteens is NEVER have words on your clothes. If you have clothes like these, and they are expensive, don't throw them away. Just never wear them until your parents forget you had it. Wear lots of those same bedroom colors. Never wear gray cotton or wool. This is a one way ticket to make people think you're from lazyville.
 Make this very subtle. Let's start on Monday. Use some of your moms makeup. Put a TINY bit of foundation on and and little lip gloss. Do you hair in a sleek style, with a little bang or hair down in the front.
 Have a peaceful day in your room with your new phone and color. Relax.

 Hallow or blown-out eggs are not recommended for this method because they will float; the eggs need to sit submerged in the dye.
 Fill a measuring cup with Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water. Stir in 1 teaspoon vinegar and 40 drops food coloring.You can also use an Easter egg dye kit from the store. Dissolve the color tablet in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of vinegar.This will be your darkest shade and you will be adding water later.
 Lean the egg against the side of the cup so that it stands upright. If it keeps tipping over, set it down onto a bottle cap.You can also set it into a wire egg holder, then hook the handle over the rim of the cup.

If you are using a dye kit, place the egg right into the dye instead. Only the bottom part of the egg should be in the dye.
 You want the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) or so of the egg to be submerged. This will create the bottom, darkest layer.If you are using a dye kit, let the egg sit for 30 to 45 seconds., Pour enough dye into the cup so that the bottom third or so of the egg is submerged. Wait 3 minutes.If you are using a dye kit, add some water, then wait 30 to 45 seconds., This time, add just enough dye until the bottom two-thirds of the egg is submerged.This should be your lightest shade, or close to it.

If you are using a dye kit, add more water, then wait another 30 to 45 seconds., If you want the top white, proceed to the next step. If you want the top colored, pour the rest of the dye into the cup so that the egg is completely covered. Wait 30 to 60 seconds.

If you are using a dye kit, cover the egg with water, then let it sit for 30 to 45 seconds more., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to lift the egg out of the dye bath. Hold it over the cup and let any excess dye drip down., Set the egg down onto a paper towel, an egg holder, or an egg carton. Let the egg dry before adding it to your Easter basket.

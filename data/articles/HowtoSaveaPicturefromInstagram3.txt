 There are plenty of websites that can save all your photos for you in bulk, providing a safe, consolidated backup of your account. This allows you to keep a spare copy of your pictures in case you delete your Instagram account. Search for "Instagram Backup" in your favorite search engine to find a service for you.


Well documented sites for Instagram backup include Instaport and FrostBox.While some of the language or features may change, the following general instructions will work for any backup website.
 This allows the site to access all of your pictures at once and prevents other people from downloading your photo library without your permission on the site.


Be careful of any site that requests "permission to post" on your Instagram or requests more of your personal data.
 You can save the photos to a .zip file or send them to Facebook or Flickr. If you click on the Advanced Options button you can choose to limit the download by date, number, or photos you've liked.


If you choose photos you've liked, they will be shrunk to a maximum resolution of 612 x 612 pixels.
 This will take a few minutes, depending on the number of pictures you need to download. When it is done you will have a folder with all of your Instagram photos.


If you cannot find your photos check your "Downloads" folder., When you take a photo on the instagram app, the picture is also saved in your "Camera Roll" for future use. This means that you will always have a copy of your own photos on your phone. You can even tell Instagram to save a copy of the photo before you add filters too:


Open your profile by tapping the silhouette button in the bottom right corner of the app.
Tap the "Gear" icon in your profile to open your settings. It is in the upper right corner.
Turn "Enable Original Photos" to "On." You may have to scroll through your settings to find it.

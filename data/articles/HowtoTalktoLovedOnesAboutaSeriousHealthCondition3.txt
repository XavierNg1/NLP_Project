 When this sort of news is discussed with children, they may not how to engage. Let them know that it is OK for them to ask questions, and that these questions don’t need to come right away. Often a child will need hours, days, or even weeks to think before their questions surface, and that’s fine.You can say, "It's OK for you to ask questions. And you don't need to ask them now. Anytime you think of a question, or just if you want to talk, come and find me."

, If a child says they are scared or sad, you can tell them you feel that way too. These discussions can bring about feelings that may be new to kids. When you share your own feelings, it helps them to know that their feelings are normal and natural, and that it is OK to feel that way.You can say, "Are you scared about this? I'm scared too. This is a very scary thing to deal with, but those feelings will eventually pass."

, When you share this kind of news with kids, it is important to inform the other adults in the child’s circle. Talk to teachers, babysitters, or other caregiving family members. If all appropriate adults are kept in the loop, they can be available to help the child cope, and can better understand the child’s behavior.Don't feel like you need to disclose anything you're not comfortable sharing.
You can simply say to a teacher or caregiver, "We are experiencing a serious illness in the family. We've just told Tommy about it, and we're not really sure how he's going to react."

, Avoid making this comparison when discussing death or serious illness with the kids in your life.Rather than comparing death to sleep, simply try to describe it as honestly as you, within your family's belief structure.
Children are capable of having complex discussions. Do your best to be honest with them.

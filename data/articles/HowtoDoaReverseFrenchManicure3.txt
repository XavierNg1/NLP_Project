 You will use round bandaids to make the half-moon shape at the end of your nails. However, bandaids that are too sticky can peel off small amounts of polish. Use your hand to remove some stickiness from a band-aid before applying it to your nail.Remove the bandaid from the wrapper. Apply it to your hand and leave it on for a few moments.
Peel the bandaid off. It should now be slightly less sticky.
 Place the rounded bandaid over the bottom of your nail. Half the bandaid should be on your nail and the other half should be on the skin just underneath. The band-aid should form a half moon shape at the base of your nail., Apply your second color now. Paint the tip of your nail. The bandaid will act as a barrier, keeping the half-moon shape in place.You may have to paint two layers of your top layer of nail polish depending on how well the second color covers the first.
 When you're done, slowly remove your band-aids. You should be left with two solid colors, one color forming half-moon shapes at the base of your nails.,

 Keeping your vaginal area clean can help reduce any burning or itching sensations. Take a daily shower and clean yourself well.Never use douche. Your vagina contains both beneficial and harmful bacteria, carefully balanced to create an ideal, acidic environment. When you use douche, this balance is disrupted and can lead to an overgrowth of the bad bacteria. This can lead to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis and can push an infection deeper into your body where it can cause more harm.You do not need any special products, like douche, to clean your vagina. The mucus made by your vagina naturally cleans blood, semen, and vaginal discharge.Simple soap and water should be enough to clean your vagina.

 This helps more than anything.;
, One that is strong enough to impact your abs is the best. The exercise should include:


some inhale 4 counts
hold for 4
out for 4. At 80 or 120 bpm (beats per minute).
 At one, do an inhale of one count and exhale for one count, for a good 40 counts. This will hurt a little.
, Long tones means a single note for 8 counts at a solid mouth force, no blasting or wimpy playing.
 (You can make your own warm-up for this.) This is good for fingers and slides too.
 This is called "lip slurs". The staff of notes above is best played by flutes - not trumpets! Start your practice of lip slurs on 2nd line G and slur smoothly down to open low C and back up to the G you started with. Continue chromatically after the open tones to these fingerings - (0), 2, 1, 12, 23, 13, 123. Use these daily like push ups. Once you can play these back and forth and slow to fast, start on higher notes; 3rd space C, top space E etc,

, Not only will this improve the tone quality, but it will also enable you to play a note for a longer period of time.

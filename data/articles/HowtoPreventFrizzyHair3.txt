 If you live in a warm place where it is always sunny, you may want to protect your hair from being damaged by the sunlight and heat. Make sure to wear a scarf  or hat when in the sun. Not only will it protect your skin from getting sunburned, it will also keep your hair from turning a different shade of color, especially in colored hair. Besides, you can always make a hat or scarf go cute with an outfit. This should also help the frizz be maintained throughout the day.
 It may help your hair stay in place for a while. But there are many chemicals in it that are bad for hair. Many hair sprays have been proven to make frizz worse, so investigate and try different products. Use these to get rid of frizz, while keeping your hair in place.
 It may have not worked so well when you were little but it does help in tangly, frizzy hair. Just find some and spray it in the frizzy parts of your hair. Just comb it through, and soon your hair will be frizz free.

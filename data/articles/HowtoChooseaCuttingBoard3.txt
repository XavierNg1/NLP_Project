 Stay away from cutting boards that have “feet” on the bottom, or are otherwise not reversible. By using both sides, you essentially get two cutting boards in one., Experts chefs suggest choosing a cutting board that is 15 by 20 inches (38 to 50 cm) in size. This gives you plenty of room to work safely and effectively as you cut., When opting for a wood or bamboo cutting board, you will have the opportunity to choose end-grain (meaning the board is grafted from many small pieces of wood in a checkerboard pattern) or edge-grain (meaning the strips of wood are laid side-by-side).


In bamboo boards, edge-grain boards are sturdier, and have been shown to last longer.In wood boards, end-grain boards are a bit easier on knives.Ultimately, choosing end-grain or edge-grain will come down to the look you want for your kitchen., By and large, wood cutting boards are the best choice for durability, beauty, and protection of your knives (with bamboo as a close second). However, wood (or bamboo) cutting boards can be cumbersome to wash, and they need to be oiled regularly. Plastic cutting boards, on the other hand, are often dishwasher safe and require no additional maintenance. If you do not have the time to regularly maintain your cutting board, plastic may be a better choice for you.

 They should be side by side. Make one slightly larger than the other. Make sure they're not too far apart. That is key in this drawing.;
, Draw a line that goes down and goes on top of the ovals you've made. Then draw one under it doing the same. On the bottom one, bend in a little in between ovals. Then draw the beginnings of legs, like drawn in the picture. Make the bottom and top lines go up, then draw a circle for the beginning of a head. Draw a nose by drawing an oval that's partially in the head.
 Do the same to the head as you did to the body. After this, erase the circles in the body and head. Add ears to the head that are either long and floppy, or short and up. Then add either a short or long tail. At this point, it's good to have a selected breed in mind, as this it where all the details are.
 Carefully erase all of your circles and ovals. Then add fur by drawing ruffles on the outlines. Your dog should be very realistic!

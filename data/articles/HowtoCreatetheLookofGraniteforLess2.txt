 If your counter has any damage, you want to replace this prior to painting. You don't want to paint over any rough parts of the counter, as this will not look as professional and finished.If you notice any holes in your counter, fill them with wood patch or auto body filler. You can find these supplies at a local hardware store. Once applied, you will have to sand over the holes you filled so the counter looks smooth.
If you have silicone caulking on your counter, you may not be able to paint on it. It's a good idea to remove silicone caulking and replace it with caulking you can paint on.
 You don't want to end up getting paint everywhere when creating a faux-marble counter. Use painters tape on the corners of your counter so you don't end up painting on walls, sinks, or cabinets.You should also lay a tarp down on your floor to avoid getting paint on the floor.
 Do not use your counter again until your paint is dry. Using the counter too soon can smear your paint job. It will take about one to three days for the counter to dry completely. Keep appliances off the counter until then.You should also make sure that the paint is dry in between coats.

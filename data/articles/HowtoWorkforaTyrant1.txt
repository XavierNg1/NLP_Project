 By not slipping up and continuing to perform your job duties as perfectly as you can, you leave the tyrant as little room as possible to complain about your work.Be punctual, work accurately, don’t call in sick, double-check your work and strive for the company’s overall good.


Try to anticipate your supervisor’s needs and comply with all requests.
Also give your boss positive reinforcement when they demonstrate successful communication and management. Say something like, “I appreciate you being so accommodating when I had to push my big project back by a few days to take on some new work.”;
, Make an attempt to discuss your feelings with your boss, in a way that can be constructive rather than critical. Practice your key points ahead of time. During the discussion with your boss, remain calm, stay positive and encourage an improved relationship.Express yourself in a way that is non-threatening, not critical and cannot be construed as whining.
Try saying something like, “Sometimes I feel as though my work doesn’t satisfy you, or it’s consistently inadequate. Is there something I could fix overall, or steps I could take to address this?”
Also bring up points like: “Some of the ways you speak to me and treat me make me feel as though I’m not a valued member of the office. Is there a way we can focus more on the positive aspects of the work I’m doing?”

, It may turn out that tyrannical behavior and office mismanagement simply stem from a breakdown of communication. Listen to your boss to gain insight to their side of the story.When communicating with your boss, ask clarifying questions so that you can both be clear about exactly what they expect you to accomplish.
Reminding your boss of all your current responsibilities may help them to realize that some of their demands are overbearing.
Also consider whether your boss's behavior is a product of their cultural background. In some cultures, an overbearing or authoritative posture is considered desirable.

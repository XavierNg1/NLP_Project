 Purchase professional grade white or gray greasepaint makeup, which is often used in clowning and can likely be found at Halloween or costume specialty stores. Dip a toothbrush in the greasepaint and rub to cover the brush in paint.Greasepaint has better staying power than powder and is less messy to apply.
If you have long hair and are applying it all over, it will likely feel heavier and stiffer than powder.
White or grey greasepaint can work, depending on the shade of grey you want. If you use a light hand, your natural hair color will come through so that even if you use white it will likely look grey.
 Brush the greasepaint through your hair in the same way that you applied the powder, starting at your hairline around your temples and forehead and brushing out to the rest of your head.Use a light hand and work in layers, as too much greasepaint in one spot can look blotchy.
 If you want a dramatic, all over grey effect, use a hairbrush to apply the greasepaint. Smear a thin layer of greasepaint onto the tips of a hairbrush and brush the paint through your hair until you get the desired effect.Greasepaint will wash off after shampooing your hair.

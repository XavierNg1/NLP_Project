 These three characters are the most difficult to unlock. If you don't want to play hundreds of offline Brawl matches, you must complete Subspace Emissary, then try the special unlocks below. None of these unlocks will work if you have not finished Subspace Emissary.

As with all unlock methods except for playing Subspace Emissary, these will trigger a fight with the character you're trying to unlock. You must defeat the character to add it to your team.
 After beating Subspace, there are two special ways to unlock Jigglypuff:Complete Event matches 1 through 20.

Or replay The Swamp (Stage 18) in Subspace Emissary. Play through most of the level until you reach the barrels you can fire yourself out of. Enter the door between the barrels to fight Jigglypuff., Besides playing 400 Brawl matches, there are two ways to unlock Toon Link:Complete all twelve stages of Classic mode. You may select any difficulty level and character.

Or replay The Forest (Stage 9) in Subspace Emissary. Enter the door that has appeared near the beginning of the level and defeat Toon Link., Wolf is the hardest character to unlock. Here are two options to choose from:Beat Boss Rush Mode. This mode unlocks after you beat Classic mode. You will have to defeat ten bosses in a row without losing a stock.Or replay The Ruins (Stage 14) in Subspace Emissary. You'll see a new door once the falling platform reaches the bottom of the spike-filled elevator shaft.(This is not the door halfway down the shaft.) Enter the door and defeat Wolf to unlock him.
 If you're worried about reaching the unlock fight but failing to defeat the computer opponent, pick your strongest close range character. All three of these characters are weak at close range, and lightweight. Land a couple of hard hits, and smash attacks should take care of the rest.

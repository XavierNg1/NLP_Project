 You'll want to find a subject where the viewer can tell what it is just from the outline; whether it's a real item or a pattern, you want to keep it identifiable.
 If you're using a paper or pen, keep it light, and avoid any drawing or colouring on the inside of the subject area; if you need to draw there for planning/sketching purposes, then make sure you do it very lightly, in pencil, so you can erase it.
 Once you have the outline in place, shade the picture; instead of focusing on the subject itself, shade everything else around it. Think of it like drawing the background, not the foreground.
 Once your background is shaded and your foreground is still plain and white, clear up any sketched or unfinished edges. A clean and crisp line will look the most striking.
 Once you have the basics down, move on to more involved drawings with negative space.

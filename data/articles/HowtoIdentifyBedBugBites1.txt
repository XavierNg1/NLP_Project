, If you wake up with fresh bug bites or itchy welts, you likely have bed bugs. See if they look and feel like mosquito or flea bites -- bed bug bites are often red and slightly swollen, itchy and irritating like other bug bites.

These appear because bed bugs will bite several times a night.If you’re experiencing new bites during the day, it’s likely not bed bugs.
 Look for bites on skin that is exposed when you’re sleeping. Also check for bites under loose clothing. Note that bed bugs will avoid the soles of your feet, so any bites there are less likely to be from bed bugs., If you’re allergic to bed bugs, you might find that you develop hives or a rash similar to eczema or a fungal infection. Also check to see if the bites are getting larger, are painfully swelling, or even exuding a pus.

Consult a doctor if you develop a severe reaction to the bite.

 Wait till class is over and strike up a conversation with the person that’s distracting you. Try not to be confrontational. Rather, approach them in a friendly way so they’ll be more likely to listen to you. Calmly let them know that they’re disrupting your attention in the classroom.


Remember to always call out the behavior and not the person.Make sure they know you have nothing personal against them.
A good way to start off the conversation is with flattery. You can say something like “Your jokes are always so funny and I love to hear them when we’re not in class.”

, Be clear about your boundaries.Let the distractor know that you need to give your studies your full attention. Tell them that even if they don’t mean to, they’re affecting your ability to concentrate in class and you need them to stop.


Give specific examples of when they distracted you. Say something like: “Last Monday when you were trying to show me your new shoes in class, I had a really hard time listening to the lesson.”
Be cool. Speaking in a calm tone will be more effective towards getting the behavior to stop.
 You don’t want your conversation to become a lecture. You also want to get clarification that the distractor understands your point. After you’ve made your point clear, ask your classmate how they feel about the situation and be sure to listen closely.


Watch their body language. If they have a harsh stare or are avoiding eye contact, they’re likely getting defensive and not listening to you.Be understanding. Maybe the person didn’t realize they were bothering you and was only trying to be your friend.
 Give your distractor the benefit of the doubt and try to see the world from their viewpoint. They may be a very social person who has trouble paying attention in class. They might even need your help learning to stay on task.


If the distractor is your friend, they may just need some extra attention. Give them a hug or take some time away from class to listen to them vent.

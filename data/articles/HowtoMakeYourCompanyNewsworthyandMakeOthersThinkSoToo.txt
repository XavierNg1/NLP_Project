 Start by creating a calendar full of all the interesting dates that you can link your company or products to. You can also tie this to news from related industries. This will help you connect to a larger story. Usually this holiday or related industries twist won’t make it automatically newsworthy, but it makes it better. For example, don’t pitch a reporter on your spa. Instead, pitch the spa on father’s day and tell about your men’s package and how a spa treatment for guys is the fastest growing segment of your business.;
, When you tell the media about your news, make sure that it fits a specific demographic. This will help the editor properly assign a reporter to learn more.
 A reporter or assignment editor will likely spend less than 10 seconds reading your email or Fax. Make sure that in those fleeting moments that you convey the important details – especially why the editor and her audience should care.
 A picture is worth a thousand words. Sometimes this will sell the story more than anything else. If you can’t show something from this year, include a picture of last year’s event.
 If you have obvious spelling mistakes, it looks clear to the reader that you don’t care and this will make them less likely to care as well.
 Include the email, phone and of course your website within the news release. Additionally, if you have a store or the news is about an event then make sure they know where you are located and any parking or transportation issues that may apply.
 Sending your news to everyone at your local TV station isn’t going to help you. This will only annoy people who you want to be your allies when you need them. Also, make sure that each email is individually addressed or someone may ignore it, thinking that someone else is going to respond.
 Keep all your news together in one place on your site, maybe in a “press�? or “news�? section. When researching stories, reporters will want to see what other items of interest your company has created.
 Just like it is important to archive the news, it is important to place that archive somewhere easy to locate. Additionally, you can help a reporter by providing supporting documents like a company profile, executive bios and similar items. If you feel uncomfortable making those documents public, tell reporters on your website that those items are available upon request.
 Perhaps one of the most important things is that if no one is available to answer the phone when a reporter calls, you may miss the opportunity for coverage – or worse, they will report without your input!

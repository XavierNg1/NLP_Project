 whatever@spam.spamcop.net to quick.whatever@spam.spamcop.net, send one report and switch it back. You will get a response back with the instructions to follow.;
, Do so. Do not panic if you see: "Quick reporting is disabled due to careless use...” You haven't done anything wrong, everyone gets this message, it's nothing personal. All you needed to have done is mail the admin and request quick reporting. At one time it would have been automatic, but now you have to ask.
 You need to add a Host for each ISP that you get mail through. That’s so SpamCop won’t report spam to them by mistake, since their addresses are in the header of spam received.
 Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on "Activate quick reporting" which you will see there once it's turned on. You will also need to change from submit to quick in your reporting address again.
 SpamCop will process it and submit your report and send you a message confirming the spam you sent was reported. You may get multiple messages or just one message confirming multiple spams depending on how fast your server is and how busy SpamCop is.
 Submit some spam to quick.whatever@spam.spamcop.net. If it isn't turned on then you will get the normal reply with a bit added to the beginning telling you that quick reporting is suspended and the reason. If it is turned on you will get a reply that they were automatically processed and reports sent. Life shouldn't be so easy!

 Hay is the main part of any rabbit's diet. Your dwarf rabbit should always have a fresh, unlimited supply of hay available to him at all times. Do not feed your rabbit alfalfa hay as it is bad for them. Feed them timothy hay or some kind of grass hay.
 Choose a good quality rabbit brand that doesn't contain extra seeds or sugar. You should feed 1/4 a cup of pellets per 5 pounds of rabbit. Timothy hay is good for rabbits over 7 weeks old.
 2 cups a day of greens should be fed to your rabbit. A piece of carrot, apple(without seeds), banana, or strawberry are a great treat for your dwarf rabbit. Make sure you research what fruits and vegetables are safe for your rabbit to eat as some can be toxic.

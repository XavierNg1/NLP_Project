Latin American cuisine makes the perfect complement for a mojito party. Serve tacos, quesadillas or other Latin American finger foods.
You can also create a buffet table for the food so that guests can serve themselves.
Plan on 2 or 3 servings per guest.



Choose the room(s) of your home that you will open to guests.
Arrange your furniture so that guests can move around easily.
Place trays on tables or trash cans in convenient locations to make cleanup easier.
If you want to hang streamers, paper lanterns or strings of lights, then choose the design that works for your space.



Choose paper invitations to mail or to hand out.
You can also send email invitations or create invitations via social media. Digital invitations make keeping track of RSVPs much easier.
 Guests will need plates, plastic silverware and napkins in addition to glasses for the mojitos. You can also use real silverware and china if you prefer.
 Create a playlist on your mp3 player or iPod or use a streaming service like Spotify or Pandora.



Hide all of your personal papers, and polish surfaces, like the tops of coffee tables and end tables.
Thoroughly clean your bathroom since many guests will travel in and out of this room throughout the duration of the party.

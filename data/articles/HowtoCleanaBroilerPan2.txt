 Set your broiler pan in the sink or on the counter or table. Take your container of baking soda and sprinkle some over the entire surface of the broiler pan. Make sure the baking soda forms a thick coat for the most effective cleaning.








To conserve your baking soda, it’s not necessary to cover every inch of the pan, but give most of it a good covering.
 Fill a spray bottle with water and squirt it on the baking soda. Don’t be afraid of spraying too much water, as much of it will soak down into the baking soda.








If you don’t have a spray bottle, gently pour water onto the baking soda, mixing it slightly to form a paste on the pan.
 Grab enough paper towels to cover the whole area of the broiler pan. Get the towels dripping wet and lay them across the surface of the baking soda. This keeps the baking soda wet longer while it loosens the food residue.








Dampen the towels every so often if you feel they are drying out too quickly.
 Leave the pan sitting for a minimum of 30 minutes while the baking soda does its work. The process is more effective if you leave it for two or three hours, or even overnight for badly stuck on food residue.If you leave the pan sitting overnight, most of the water will evaporate, which is okay.
 Take the pan to the trash can and use a spatula to scrape the used up baking soda out into the trash. It’s better to discard it in the garbage rather than in the sink as it can clog up your drain.
 Take the broiler pan to the sink and rinse off any leftover baking soda, as well as any food residue that remains. If necessary, use a washcloth or scrubbing sponge to gently wipe away anything that is still stuck on the pan.

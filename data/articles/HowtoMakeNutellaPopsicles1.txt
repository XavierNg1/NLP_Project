 Combine 1 cup (240 mL) whole milk and â…“ cup (80 mL) Nutella in a blender.If you don't have a blender, use a large bowl and an electric mixer instead. Keep mixing until there are no gooey chocolate lumps.


Use almond milk instead for a low-dairy version.(Nutella does contain skim milk, so this is not completely dairy-free.);
, Pour the mixture into popsicle molds, leaving a little room at the top. Stick the popsicle handles into the liquid.


If you don't have popsicle molds, pour into cups and cover with plastic wrap. Poke a small hole through the plastic with a popsicle stick, dunking it in the liquid.You can use an ice cube tray to make mini-popsicles. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and stick a toothpick through it into each cube.
 This usually takes about five hours. You might be able to speed this up by keeping them in the back of the freezer, where it's coldest., Fill a jug or tall bowl with warm tap water. Hold the handle of the mold and dip the other end into the water. This should loosen the popsicle and make it easier to take out.

To keep viruses out of your computer, you must use a virus scanner that offers real-time protection. This means that it continuously monitors files being opened for containing a virus. If that is the case, the virus scanner immediately notifies the user and renders the virus harmless.
These offer added user friendliness and further functions for your online protection, like:
- real-time antivirus scanning,
- real-time spyware & malware detection,
- security for online banking,
- online technical support,
- automatic, scheduled scans of your computer,
- creating a startup disk to be used when your computer becomes unbootable.;
, A warned pc user has much less chance of being fooled.
Here are some tips for browsing the Internet safely:


Don’t click on internet pop-ups. Let your browser block most pop-up windows from appearing;

Don’t browse the internet without any virus scanner and anti-spyware program!
Do your e-banking only through the official website of the bank;
Don’t respond to e-mails that ask for your data (phishing);
Don’t open attachments from suspicious e-mails;
Don’t click "Next" during installation of a program before unchecking the installation of annoying toolbars and additional programs.
 Viruses and hackers often use security holes to infect your computer in Windows, Outlook Express, MS Office, and Internet Explorer. Therefore operating systems like Windows, Macintosh etc. regularly receive online security updates. These can for example patch security holes or recognize new viruses.

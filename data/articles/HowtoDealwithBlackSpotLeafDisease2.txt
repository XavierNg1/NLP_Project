 Keep the base of the plant or tree clear of infected leaves that may have fallen on their own. Clear away all fallen leaves, whether they’re infected or not, since beds of dead leaves trap and retain moisture, thus creating a ripe breeding ground for the disease. Be sure to rake straight up to winter’s first snow, or even after if needed; the disease may survive the cold weather and reinfect the plant or tree when spring comes., It’s best to prune from the bottom up. Lower leaves are more likely to be infected with black spot disease, so you’ll want to start in the lower canopy. Prune back lower branches that never completely dry and leave higher ones that receive sunlight.Pruning the lower canopy is also safer – you won’t need to get to those high-up branches.
 Water the soil directly. Keep the leaves dry.Avoid overwatering. Allow soil to dry before watering again.Refrain from watering during rainy weather.
 Weed the soil to improve airflow.Apply a level amount of mulch around the base of the plant or tree, leaving a ring of free space between the mulch and the trunk. Prevent weeds from growing while improving the area’s ability to dry more thoroughly.

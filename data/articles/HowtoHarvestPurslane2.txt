 These can be bought at many flower shops, nurseries, home and garden centers, and most greenhouses. Two common varieties suitable for a home garden include golden purslane (Portulaca sativa) and garden purslane (Portulaca oleracea).Store seeds in a cool, dry, dark location while waiting to plant., Your purslane will thrive in full sunlight and porous soil. If these conditions are unavailable, make a planter box and fill it with potting soil. Position the planter so it receives at least eight hours of sunlight., Purslane should be planted in spring when there is no longer any risk of frost or at any point in summer. Scatter the purslane seeds over your planting area. Drag a garden rake lightly over the soil after scattering the seeds. Tamp the soil lightly with a shovel or a similar garden tool.As long as you allow a few plants to mature to adulthood and seed, your purslane crop will continue to grow every year.
Purslane generally takes about four to six weeks before it is ready to harvest. In ideal conditions, your purslane may be ready to harvest even sooner., Purslane requires very little in the way of care once it is planted. In dry conditions, however, you should water the plants enough to keep the soil from drying out., Purslane can get out of hand quickly if left to its own devices. Harvest your purslane regularly to keep it manageable. Cut purslane with scissors or garden shears at the base of its stalk when harvesting.

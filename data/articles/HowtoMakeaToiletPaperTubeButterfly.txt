 Choose used wrapping paper, magazine paper, used clean foil, etc. Glue the paper together at the join (or use tape that doesn't show).


Alternatively, paint the tube any color.;
, Make them wide enough to appear balanced. Use a very simple design for the wings, making a mirror image for the opposite side.
 Cut around each wing (or both wings if you have designed them already joined).


The wings can be jazzed up a little by cutting them out with pinking shears.
 It's easiest to decorate the wings before affixing them to the butterfly. Any design is fine, but here are some ideas to help you:


Trace the same outline as the wing in decreasing size in different colors, to make a rainbow of colors.






Let the child draw whatever he or she pleases.
Glue on bits and pieces, like sequins, buttons, bows, lace, etc.
Finger paint dots and swirls on the wings.
 Check that they appear even each side.
 These form the antennae. They can be colored by either drawing on them with marker or dipping them first in paint water and letting them dry before affixing to the tube.


Alternatively, cut pipe cleaners in half and glue in place. Roll down the top of the pipe cleaner in a spiral, to make it seem more realistic.
 Draw two eyes and a smile at the top end of the butterfly, near the antennae.


Alternatively, cut out pieces of felt or scrap paper in the shapes of eyes and a mouth and glue these on.

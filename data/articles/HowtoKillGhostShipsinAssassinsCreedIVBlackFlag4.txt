 Found in the southwest corner of the map, La Dama Negra has extreme firepower and mostly attacks with its mortars. This is also one of the tougher Legendary Ship you'll come across due to the heavy weather and choppy sea.


It's pointless to use ram La Dama Negra since ship is heavily armored.
 Use chain shots to slow it when you're behind the La Dama Negra, fire your mortar, and then turn and hit it with heavy shot on its rear cabin.
 Having the Elite hull is very important, as you will be taking a lot of mortar fire. Just keep on approaching behind end of the ship, cause damage, dodge the mortar, and repeat until the ship sinks. Be patient and retreat when necessary and then speed up to get behind the ship again to launch more attacks.You will receive 20,000R for defeating La Dama Negra.

 Where does your target audience live, work, and shop? It’s important for you to know this so you know how to reach them. You wouldn’t want to go to the next city over to hand out leaflets for your new restaurant.Lifestyle messages, such as those about eating vegetarian, have broader reach but still need to find a receptive audience. Teenagers, for example, will be more likely to go vegetarian than an older person who has eaten meat for decades.
 Before you go out, decide where you’re going to go. For an effective distribution plan, think of how far you need to walk or drive, when you need to get to a location, and how many leaflets you need to bring. A good strategy will save you time and money while spreading your message further.


Use maps to plan out shorter routes and determine where customers will be.
Keep notes on what locations and businesses are receptive to your advertisements.
 When do you need to get the leaflet into a customer’s hands? If you’re advertising a holiday sale, the leaflets need to be distributed a few weeks before the holiday. Similarly, people will be more receptive at certain times. People entering or leaving an event are more likely to take a leaflet than people rushing to work.Keep in mind any events in the area. At a rock concert where teens gather, you will likely have some luck advertising a vegan restaurant. Advertising would be more difficult with an older audience set in their ways.
Your audience may be available at night instead of the day. Bars and clubs can be gathering grounds for you to advertise restaurants or products relevant to people who may be in work during the day.
 Repeat advertisements are easier to remember. Go back to your distribution locations a month or two later. Even if you deliver the same leaflet to the same people, you are likely to see improved results. Your message or business becomes more recognizable as you build connections.

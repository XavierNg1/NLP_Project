 Besides business cards, you will need two good quality rackets (always have an extra in case you break the strings), a ball hopper or basket that stands upright and that can hold at least 50 balls, cones, pen and paper, sunblock, sunglasses, hat and tennis attire.


It can be helpful to have a few extra rackets if possible, in case your clients have problems with their own. And it isn't unknown for a child to forget the racket in the rush of getting to the lesson on time!
Get newer balls if the ones you are using are getting too old. No one is going to pay much for a lesson with old, ugly and flat balls. Invest in new balls at least every month.
 Image is everything, and tennis is a sport that has some of the coolest looking sportswear. It doesn't have to be expensive but it must be tennis attire––there is nothing worse than a tennis coach wearing running shoes! Do your best to keep all clothing clean and wrinkle-free.


Carry extra shirts in case you get too sweaty.
If you have long hair, keep it back off the face. This presents a more professional image.
If you always look like a tennis player, people will associate tennis with you and that's always good for business.

 Arrange it so that the bottom corner of the napkin is pointing toward your chest, and the top corner is pointing away from you.








For best results, press the napkin first so it doesn't have any creases. If you want it to stand up straight, use starch.
If you're using a patterned napkin, the patterned side should be facing down, and the less colorful side should be facing up.
 Bring the bottom corner up to meet the top corner. The napkin should now look like a triangle, with the bottom edge facing you and the top pointing away from you. Press the folded edge with a hot iron.
 Take the bottom edge of the triangle and simply fold it up. Use a hot iron to press the fold.
 Start at either corner and tightly roll the napkin toward the other corner. Make sure the bottom edge rolls up evenly, so that the napkin will be able to stand up.When you're finished rolling, tuck the corner into one of the folds near the base.
 Since the candle fold is long and slim, it can easily tip over. The best way to display it is in a narrow water glass. You could also simply rest it sideways across a plate.

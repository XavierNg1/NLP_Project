 Open the canned longans and place two or more in the bottom of each serving dish.


Use 6-oz to 8-oz (180-ml to 250-ml) pudding cups for this recipe.
Reserve 2/3 cup (150 ml) of longan syrup after removing the longan fruit from the can. Any remaining syrup can be discarded or used for another purpose.
 Combine the sugar, pandan leaves, and 3 cups (750 ml) of water in a medium saucepan. Heat on medium until the water boils.


Pandan leaves are mainly used for their fragrance. Use them if you can find them, but if you're unable to find them, you can leave them out of the recipe and the jelly should still set. Consider adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of vanilla extract or almond extract, instead, to prevent the jelly from tasting bland.
Tie the pandan leaves together into a tight knot before adding them to the mixture.
 In a separate small bowl, mix the agar-agar powder with the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of water.


Stir the two ingredients until the agar-agar seems fully dissolved.
 Pour the agar-agar mixture into the boiling sugary syrup. Stir well and continue to cook it over medium heat.


Allow the contents of the saucepan to reach a boil after combining the two mixtures, then simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes before turning off the heat.
 Pour the soy milk, evaporated milk, and reserved longan syrup into the saucepan. Mix well until evenly distributed.
 Pour the liquid jelly mixture over the longans in your prepared serving dishes.


Allow the jelly to sit out and cool to room temperature.
 Place the containers of jelly in your refrigerator and chill for roughly 2 hours. Enjoy directly out of the refrigerator.

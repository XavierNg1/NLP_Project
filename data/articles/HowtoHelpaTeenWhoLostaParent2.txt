 Help the teen come up with a healthy way to deal with all of the “firsts”, such as the first Christmas or the first birthday without their parent. Come up with a plan for these days so they know what to expect.Include the teen when planning the day.
Allow the teen to talk about — or not talk about — their parent that day, whichever they feel like doing. Follow their lead in how much they want to talk about it.
Don’t be afraid to try something new, especially if a special day didn’t go well in the past.
 If you knew their parent when they were younger or outside their home environment, share these stories with the teen. It will be refreshing for the teen to remember how many great experiences their parent had in their lifetime. Share as many happy memories as possible.For example, you might tell the teen about the time you and their deceased parent went ice skating and fell ten times.
You might also tell them about the first time you met their parent.
 Encourage the teen to share these memories with you, too. This will help them feel connected to their deceased parent as they work through the grief. It will also give them a chance to think about their parent in a happy way as opposed to being focused on the death.Prompt stories by saying things like “Do you remember that time you and your parents went to the art museum?”
You can also encourage them to write or express their feelings and stories in other artistic ways.
 This can include creating a memorial to them, planting a garden, writing a poem, or donating to a charity in their honor. This can help the teen feel as though their parent’s importance lives on.

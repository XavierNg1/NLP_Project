 If the horse is tense when ridden and has a short stride something may be causing the horse pain. A horse who is easy to catch and happy in their work may have a more direct problem with the girth, rather than what they associate with it. Common areas to look for are how easy the horse is to catch and mount, being stabled, groomed or anything thing else the horse may associate with being tacked up and ridden.;
, Although these areas aren’t directly related to the girth, horses are excellent at associations. If a horse is in discomfort when ridden, they associate being tacked up with being ridden and therefore with the discomfort. You will need the help of a vet to assess your horse.
 Bits can develop sharp and rough edges with wear and flocking in saddles can form into hard lumps causing pressure points. Dirty girths and saddle cloths can cause rubbing. You will need the help of a saddle fitter to assess the fit of your tack.
 Some synthetic girths don’t stretch at all and must feel very restricting. Use a girth that is shaped around the elbow, and make sure it is the right size so you are not using the last few holes meaning you can’t tighten the girth gradually.
 Are you rough or impatient? Do you slam the saddle down or tighten the girth too sharply? It is helpful to ask a knowledgeable and honest friend to watch you.
 Tell them your situation and ask for an assessment of your riding position and if it could be causing the horse extra stress on one part of their body.

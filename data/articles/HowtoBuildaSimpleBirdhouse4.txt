 Perhaps you have a pair of boots that have one good boot and one boot in bad shape. Toss out the old boot and use the good boot for a birdhouse. Or, if both old boots are in good shape, but you just don't want to wear them anymore, make two birdhouses.
 Give it a warm, soapy wash to remove dirt, dust, etc. Tie the shoelaces together neatly, in a nice bow.
 Stuff from the toe up to about two thirds the way of the sole. This will make a nice snug place for the bird to lay her eggs and the chicks to sit on.
 This should be strong and firmly attached. It is what you will use to attach the boot to the tree.
 Place it at the level you want the birdhouse to be. Do this carefully; you only want to make the slightest of marks in the tree.


The U-shaped nail should be strong and solid enough to hold the weight of the boot and its inhabitants.
If you'd rather not attach the boot birdhouse to the tree's trunk, attach it to a flat piece of wood, then attach the wood to a post, using nails.
 Slide the hook over the U-shaped nail on the tree. Check that it is sitting firmly.
 Depending on the weather, the boot may last one season or it may last two. If it still looks good after one season, remove it from the hook and leave it in the garden shed over winter (place it inside a stocking to prevent insects crawling inside it), then hang it out again next spring.

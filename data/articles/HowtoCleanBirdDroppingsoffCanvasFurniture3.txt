 Use a household small dustpan brush to do this.
 Check the strength of the canvas before doing this though. Strong canvas in good shape will be okay, such as that used for overhead sail cloths but finer and older canvas may be weaker and pressure washing could break the fibers. A hose wash without the pressure attachment but putting a finger over the end of the hose to produce a stronger spray may be better for more delicate canvas.
 Mix 2 liters/1/2 gallon of warm water to 1/4 cup of liquid soap. Gently rub it over the stain to lift.


If the canvas is removable, such as seat cushion covers, remove and wash in the washing machine using the mild liquid laundry soap.






For really bad stains, using liquid soap may not suffice. See the section on using commercial preparations.

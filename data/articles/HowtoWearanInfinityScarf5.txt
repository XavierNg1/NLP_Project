 Slip the scarf over your head. Instead of hanging it from your neck, bring it down to your waist. One side of the scarf should be hugging the back of your waist. The rest of the scarf should hang loosely in front of your waist.
 Create a figure 8 in front of your body by crossing right side of the scarf over the left side. The intersection of the scarf should be right in front of your belly button.
 Pull the upper loop up and over your head to create a vest. Adjust the fabric so that it sits comfortably around your waist and neck. The scarf should cross in front of your bust, resembling a vest.

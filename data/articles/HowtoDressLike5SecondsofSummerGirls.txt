 You need to get a good idea of their style, so that when you go out shopping for clothes you already know what you want to buy.;
, 5SOS usually wear muted tones and dark colours, like black, white, red, green and blue.
 It doesn't matter what quality they are, whether they are perfect or have holes in the knees: you just need at least one pair of skinny jeans. If you can get black ones, even better!

, Most of the time, the guys are either wearing plain shirts or band shirts. Some bands that 5SOS have been spotted wearing the merchandise of are: The Misfits, Metallica, Green Day, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Nirvana, The Sex Pistols, and more. Dark shirts with slogans on are also worn a lot. Don't wear the shirts of any bands that you don't listen to, as you will be criticised for this.
 Flannel shirts have become very popular recently, especially among teenage girls. They can be worn in all sorts of ways: unbuttoned, buttoned up, over-sized, tied around the waist, or however you feel comfortable. Remember to incorporate some of your own personal style into your outfits.
 Converse, Vans, boots and similar shoes will be fine. Your outfit should give off a kind of "I don't care" look so make sure you have the walk and attitude to pull that off. Never be mean to anyone, however.
 You can really go for whatever you want. Black dresses would also be a good choice.
 This jacket helps keep the look together without ruining anything.
 Wear whatever you want to wear and don't let anyone judge you. The guys have learned this recently, and have gone with more bold outfits.

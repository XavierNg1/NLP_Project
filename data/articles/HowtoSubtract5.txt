 Let's say you're working with the following problem: 5 - 3/4. Write it down.
 You'll want to convert the number 5 into a fraction with the denominator of 4 in order to subtract the two numbers. So, you can first think of 5 as a fraction that is really 5/1. Then, you can multiply both the top and bottom of the new fraction by 4 in order to create two fractions with the same denominator. So, 5/1 x 4/4 = 20/4. This fraction is really equal to 5, but it allows you to subtract two fractions.
 The new problem can be written like this: 20/4 - 3/4.
 Now, you can simply subtract 3 from 20 to get the final answer. 20 - 3 = 17, so 17 is your new numerator. You can keep the denominator as it is.
 Your final answer is 17/4. If you'd like to state it as a mixed number, simply divide 17 by 4 to get 4, with 1 left over as the remainder. This will make your final answer 17/4 equal to 4 1/4.

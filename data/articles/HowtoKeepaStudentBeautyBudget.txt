, Look in supermarket catalogues for sales, or on their websites. Go in to the supermarket when you have a spare moment and check out their range and prices. Shop around a little before you buy anything, as prices fluctuate between stores.
 If you have a certain skin type, look for products that will help problem zones, or don't irritate. Take time to read the labels, as this information is usually on there. Don't go out and buy bright green eyeshadow if it doesn't suit your skin/hair colour, and you know you don't need it.
 Take a list of things you need, and make sure you stick to it. If you notice a new product, write it down and when you get home, assess whether you need it. Don't make on-the-spot decisions if you're trying to stick to a beauty budget.
 Make a note of which ones work, and which don't. This will help you in the future, when you shop again. A lot of packaging can look similar, so make sure you get the name of your favourite (or most loathed) product recorded correctly.

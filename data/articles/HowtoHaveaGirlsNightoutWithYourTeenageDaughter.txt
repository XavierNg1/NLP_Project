 You may spend a lot of time working, or maybe your daughter spends a lot of time alone in her room. Either way, make sure you know her interests and hobbies, her likes and dislikes. This may require a little bit of research. Just talk to her whether it be over a home cooked meal or during commercial breaks on the couch.;
, It's probably best that she knows and likes the idea of spending the day with you unless you two are already pretty close. Say something casual to her like, "so, I was thinking that sometime soon the two of us could go do something together." Try to avoid terms like , "let's hang out!" Or "we should go chill together." You don't want her to be too creeped out.
 You may want your daughter's help on this one. You definitely want to pick a date that works with both of your schedules. Pick a day that you are totally off work and she doesn't have plans. This may also affect what you will be doing. Think about if you really want to pull your daughter out of school or not. Do you want to spend all of Saturday (or a day in the summer) together? Or were you thinking a Friday night out?

, This will be easier once you know your daughter's interests. Does she love sports? Take her to a college softball game. Does she love theatre? Take her to a local performance. Does she love to shop? Save a little bit of money up so you can take her on a shopping spree. Looking for something both of you will enjoy? Get manicures or see the latest chick flick. Make sure you plan ahead and book appointments/buy tickets if needed.

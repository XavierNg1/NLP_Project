 Block the base and/or back of tables or book cases that have a gap between the floor and the bottom of the unit or the wall and the back of the unit. Remember that cats can slink into openings smaller than your fist, depending on the cat's size. Your cat can also move objects that aren't firmly fastened or are heavy. Hide as much of the cord from your cat as possible. Tidy up unnecessary corded appliances and put them away in a safe, cat-free location.Consider using wireless technology wherever possible, confining the cords to the transmitters to protected or cat-free areas.
 If you can create a charging station in a drawer, the cat will be unable to get at many of the smallest and most attractive cords. Putting items with cords in boxes (with a hole cut out the back) can also disguise their true function and make it less likely that a cat will pounce., It's the dangling that often attracts the cat; once taped firmly to a table leg or wall, the cord blends in and ceases to provide the same attraction. You can also purchase velcro attachments or special cord clips to keep cords attached flatly to another item., These are available at a hardware store in a variety of formats and colors. Some attach to the wall or furniture, while other just bundle the cords together. Regardless of the kind you choose, they are a plastic cover for your cords that a cat cannot bite through.

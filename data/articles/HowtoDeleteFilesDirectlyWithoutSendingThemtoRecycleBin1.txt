 There are two methods to directly deleting files in Windows.


Method 1 will show you how to delete files by right clicking on them and selecting Delete, which normally sends files to the Recycle Bin.
Method 2 allows you to send files to the Recycle Bin, but also allows you to permanently delete them when necessary.

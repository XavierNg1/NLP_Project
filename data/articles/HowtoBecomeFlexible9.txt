 Apart from working on physical flexibility; externally via stretches, crunches etc, one should also focus upon working on it from the inside. Its cause inner realm and outer realm are deeply interconnected to each other. Plus only through awareness will you have access to your inner body.


Inner body meditation means focusing your attention or feel the inner energy field of your body.
It not only dissolves the physical stiffness but make you aware of the tense body parts that were unconscious of.
Try this: focus your attention on your shoulders or hands from the inside and hold it there for some time. From there focus your attention on other parts of the body and then feel the body as a whole. Can you feel that your body is more relaxed now?
If you want, you can be more specific. For example, if you experience that your legs are not very flexible then you can focus your attention on inner energy field of your legs and hold it there.
Don't just reject or accept it. Put it to test. Read Meditate and Stay Rooted in Being for more details.

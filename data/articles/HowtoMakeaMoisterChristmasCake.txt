 The foil helps to reduce evaporation of the steam produced by the cake as it cooks and keeps more moisture in.;
, The layer should cover the cake but it doesn't need to seal completely - just a tab on each side perhaps to make sure it doesn't fly off.
 It makes the cake very moist, and also reduces calories and fat.
 This will help avoid any sinking or cooling down of the cake. Push the cake back in quickly.
 This is a fairly unconventional solution and one that won't please a number of cooks but if you're willing to give it a try, this is a great way to keep the moisture in because the cake cooks faster than it has time to dry out. You will need to know the right baking time to use this method.

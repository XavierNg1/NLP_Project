 It is important to treat the condition as early as possible. This will ensure that the condition is easier to treat, reduce the likelihood of recurrence, and help ensure that you do not need to have the nail removed. This is important: the infection will not go away on its own and home remedies are rarely effective.;
, There are a number of different treatment methods and which your doctor prescribes will depend largely on the state of your infection and other circumstances.Understand that most of these methods take weeks to show improvement and that you will have to be fastidious about following the regimen recommended by your doctor.


Topical medications may be prescribed in certain cases. These are creams and lotions which you will apply as your doctor sees fit. Disinfect nails and apply Canesten cream twice daily, for as many months it takes. It is a slow treat, but effective.
Oral medications are also commonly used to fight fungal infections. There are a variety of drugs available but many can cause health complications for those with certain health conditions, so be sure that your doctor is aware of your medical history.
Antifungal lacquer is occasionally used to combat these infections. Placed on the nail like nail polish, this can be an easy way to solve the problem but requires a prescription.
 Again, it is important to follow your doctorâ€™s instructions, as a lapse in treatment can cause the infection to come back or worsen. You should also consult with your doctor before combining different treatment methods.

 Buy a suit if you want the hitman look. Or, wear a cloak if you want to go with the more stealthy look.;
,, Settle a price that both of you agree on. For example, if 5 tix, he or she can visit your game, if more, and you are BC, you can make a T-Shirt that he or she has to buy.



Go to More>People then search "Assassin's Creed: Elite Assassins" and click Search Groups.
Click the group that's called it and then hit join.
Wait 1-2 hours.
In the group description, read the links, also the "Novizio Test" to rank up.
Start going to Masyaf and be active in the group.
Someone will soon then be holding a training, and you'll be trained as an elite assassin.
 Go to a war game that the target is at, or get him or her to come to you.


Note: A good way to assassinate is to befriend the target.
 If you kill him or her, and he or she kills you before you leave, the assassination doesn't count.
 Ask the man or woman who hired you if he or she wants the target to know they sent you. If so, say "NameHere says hello."

, They will be weary of the price on their head.
 Invite the person who hired you to your place (5 tickets) or have them buy a T-Shirt.
 These are needed in case a target comes to you. You may be targeted for assassination, as angry assassinated targets may try to have you killed.

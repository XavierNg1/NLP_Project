 Not all services use the same exchange rate. Also, fees vary from service to service. Transaction fees and exchange rate differences add up quickly. Spend some time researching how much it will cost to complete the money transfer using different scenarios.For example, one service may charge you a higher fee but offer a better exchange rate. Look at the total amount the recipient receives. Sometimes paying a higher fee costs less in total because of a favorable exchange rate.
 In general, it is less expensive to transfer a large amount once than to transfer several small amounts. However, the fees you incur will be based on the amount you transfer. If you are transferring small amounts, use a service that is designed for small amounts and has appropriate fees., You will save money if you transfer the money in your local currency and let the recipient exchange the currency. If you try to exchange the currency ahead of time in order to wire funds in the recipientâ€™s currency, you will spend more money. For larger sums, however, use a foreign exchange service. They always get the best rates on currency exchanges., The faster you want the money transferred, the higher the fees you will pay. It is possible to send money within hours or minutes. However, this service can be expensive depending on the amount you are sending. If possible, allow the transaction to take several days or weeks. If you have locked in a favorable exchange rate, you will end up saving money on fees.

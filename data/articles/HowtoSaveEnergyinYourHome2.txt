 In an average house, up to 50 percent of heat is lost through drafts. To test an area, simply hold the palm of your hand up against a door or window. If you feel cold air coming through, warm air is escaping. This is simple to fix and can save you hundreds on your yearly heating bill.


Fit draft excluders around all exterior doors and interior if needed.
Fill in any cracks or crevices on window frames, skirting boards or floors with a filler or sealant.
Close the curtains or shutters after dark fall to trap in the warm air and prevent drafts.
If your door has a large crack under it, consider covering it with something (some stores sell cute 'door-crack blockers').
 Turn off any appliances you are not using, especially by switching off lights when you leave the room. Don't leave fridge or freezer doors open for longer than necessary, and don't forget that your freezer needs to be defrosted regularly for it to run efficiently.


Turn off your computer. Leaving the screen saver on will not save any energy. Screen savers can use more energy than when you are using the computer yourself and can reduce the life of your monitor. Instead, enable the display blanking feature to automatically turn off the monitor when your computer is idle. You can save $50-$100 per year by enabling your computer to 'sleep' automatically when you are not using.
 Up to a third of your home heating escapes through the roof. Prevent this by insulating. Not only is it simple to do, but it's also the most cost efficient energy saving measure you can make. If you don't already have it, invest in cavity-wall insulation. This will prevent another third of your heat escaping.

 Purchase or find these feathers before commencing the project. If using feathers from outdoors, clean and dry them before use.
 Work out in advance how the feathers are to sit around the wreath. Some examples include:

Arranging the feathers all standing upright around the wreath.
Overlapping the feathers sideways around the wreath.
Making varied patterns with the feathers, perhaps based on color (blues, greens, browns, etc.) or in patterned shapes such as crosses or zigzags.
 Place the wreath base on the table or work bench. Methodically work around the wreath, gluing the feathers in place according to the design.

If not overlapping the feathers, it's a good idea to wrap the wreath base in ribbon first, to take care of any gaps that might occur between feathers. Choose a color similar to that of the feathers.
 Tie in place. The wreath is now ready for hanging on the front door or anywhere else.

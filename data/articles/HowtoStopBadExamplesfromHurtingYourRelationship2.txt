 Keep tabs on your feelings, and notice if you’re getting angry with your partner. If that happens, take a break and calm down before you address the problem. Breathe deeply or take a walk until you feel level-headed enough to handle a discussion without losing your cool.Don’t try to argue when you’re angry. You might say something hurtful that you’ll regret later.
Be mindful of your triggers. Pay attention to how you feel physically. For example, you might note things like shallow breathing, tensed muscles, and a racing heart. If you do notice anything like this, take time to calm down before you talk with your partner.
 Your partner isn’t your enemy – your mutual conflict is. No matter how irritated you feel with your partner, keep your focus on resolving the conflict so both of you benefit., If you’re upset with your partner, be honest. Let them know how you’re feeling and why. However, don’t say anything inflammatory or accusatory. Use “I” statements to take the edge off your message.For instance, instead of saying, “You embarrassed me,” say, “I felt embarrassed that you put me on the spot in front of my co-workers.”

, Listen to your partner’s perspective on the conflict, and don’t interrupt or argue with them. Accept that you may have contributed to the conflict, too. Prioritize solving the problem instead of trying to prove that you’re right., After you talk a problem out with your partner, work together to create a solution. Create some clear guidelines that you can both live with. Write down your plan, so that you can reference and add to it later.Making a plan is especially effective for resolving ongoing conflicts such as how to raise your kids, manage money, or divide chores.

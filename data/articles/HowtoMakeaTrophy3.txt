 To turn a glass into a trophy, you'll need a wine or champagne glass, model magic clay, a hot glue gun, spray paint, and spray paint primer.


The clay you want to look for is made by Crayola. Look for the kind that's air-dry.
 Form the model magic clay into two trophy handles. Lay the handles on top of one another so you can make sure they're close to the same size and shape. Trim and reform them as necessary so they're fairly identical., The model magic clay should take about 24 hours to completely dry. So wait a day before continuing.
 Use your hot glue gun to glue the trophy handles to the wine or champagne glass. Wait a few minutes for the hot glue to dry before continuing.


Keep in mind that glue doesn't stick to glass very well. It will stay but only if undisturbed. So handle the trophy with care, without pulling or holding on to it by the glued on handles., Prep the trophy for painting by spraying it with the primer. Then spray paint the cup all over.
 After the spray paint has dried, you can decorate the trophy any way you'd like. Use a sharpie or acrylic paint to give the trophy a title, or glue other little decorations on it.

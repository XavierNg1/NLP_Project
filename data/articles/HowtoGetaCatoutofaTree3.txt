 Only use a sturdy ladder to climb up a tree unless you have extensive experience climbing trees. Have at least one other person with you if you're going to go up after the cat. Your helper can warn you if the cat moves, and call for help if you fall.


If you are determined to actually climb up the tree after a cat, you should always use safety equipment so that you don't get injured and make sure you have someone else with you in case of emergency.
 Make sure that there is nothing that would increase the danger if you happen to fall while climbing.


Also make sure you have a sturdy ladder. The last thing you need is to get injured while trying to help a cat get down from a tree.
 Whether you are rescuing a cat you know well or one you have never met before, the cat will probably be scared and may lash out. Long sleeves and gloves will protect you from the claws and teeth of the cat, but they will also give you a better chance of holding onto an agitated cat once you reach it.
 It's best to hold the cat by it's scruff as it is easier to hold them and it puts them in a trance.
 Don't allow it to escape before you have put it inside the carrier or get a good grasp on it.


Stay calm, if you panic then the cat will react badly and may not allow you to grab it.
 You can, for instance, put it inside a cat carrier and lower it to the ground with a rope.
 The cat may be in shock from its traumatic experience, so make sure it is healthy before letting it go.

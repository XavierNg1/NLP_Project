 The Sims Wiki Career Chart shows all the base game jobs in a table and the jobs linked with expansion packs underneath. Remember, not just Ambitions introduced new jobs!;
, Either way if you don't make enough money you could do a hobby like fishing or gardening to make more.
 Even if your sim has a lifetime wish that is not based on a career you can still choose a career where you can forward your wish(have the same skill required for the job as for the wish).
 For example, an evil Sim will want to join the Criminal career, while a virtuoso will want to join the Music career. Sims with at least 1 skill point in a skill can register at city hall as self-employed in that skill.
 Or you could just choose a job with a better pay.
 Most careers start off with you being in a good mood then building up skills. So along with a good mood, build up skills and you will be raking in the dough!

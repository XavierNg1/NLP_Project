 Even a group of people is equal to you. Whether you're talking to a potential employer, a group of wealthy donors, a child, a stranger, the President of the United States, or an attractive guy or girl, remember that they are neither better than you nor worse than you. They are human beings with the same rights and responsibilities you have. Treat them as you wish to be treated.
 In other words, just as you are expected to treat them with respect, expect that they will return the favor. When someone is disrespectful to you, ignore them until they figure it out. Do not ignore as if you didn't hear your antagonist; instead, casually and conversationally disregard their hurtful, hateful or ignorant remarks. There is usually an undisclosed reason that they didn't show respect towards you or the person didn't do what you asked of them. It may be because they are unhappy, someone hurt them recently, they felt that you were disrespectful towards them, or because they were never taught the correct way to act around people. Provided that you understand there is some reason behind their behavior, this will allow you to be willing to find out what the reason is, as long as you want them to respect you.

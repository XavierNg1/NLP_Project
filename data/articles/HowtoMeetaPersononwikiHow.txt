 It's okay to make friends on wikiHow, but a common misconception is that wikiHow is a social media site. It's not; wikiHow is a wiki, not a social networking platform of any sort. Chatting excessively while making no edits to the site is frowned upon and may actually get you blocked if you leave more Talk messages than constructive edits.


Refrain from using wikiHow as a place to solicit a date or romantic relationship. wikiHow and its community is not the place for that. wikiHow's Online Dating articles, however, can be a good place to start if you want to know how to find a romantic relationship online.;
, Meeting someone on wikiHow may not extend to meeting them in person. If you're a good, active contributor, you may get invited to a wikiHow Meetup, which enables you to meet some of the wikiHowians that are attending that year's meetup. However, not everyone can go to meetups for various reasons. Not every friendship developed through wikiHow will be developed in real life, and that's okay. Every friendship is different; not meeting a wikiHowian in person doesn't make your online friendship with them any less real., One of the best ways you can meet people on wikiHow is through contributing to wikiHow articles. It doesn't have to be anything huge - it can be something simple like spellchecking. Soon enough, somebody will reach out and send you a message. Don't feel pressured to write an article straight away, but at the same time, try to make your contributions good ones. Generally, the better your contributions, the more messages you'll end up getting.


Contribute constructively - blanking, vandalizing, or spamming wikiHow articles will cause people to view you as a troll or vandal, and won't get you the kind of attention you want.
 Whether you reached out to someone or someone reached out to you, it's important to treat other wikiHowians with respect. Avoid using ALL CAPS (which is viewed as yelling or shouting), profanity, or insults, and be kind to those who reach out to you. Even if it seems like they're criticizing your work, they're most likely just trying to help.


If someone actually criticizes you, rather than your work (e.g. "Your edits on this article are stupid"), feel free to reach out to an administrator; they'll handle the situation for you.
At some point, someone is probably going to troll you. Avoid responding to them and just revert their messages. Responding will just make them more likely to keep trolling.
 It's great to make friends on wikiHow, but you'll need to find a way of communicating with them. The most obvious way is the Talk page, but seeing as this causes work for Recent Changes patrollers, you may want to use email. This can be a great way of striking up conversation with wikiHowians!


Talk page messages are not received in real-time, and even the most active contributors have to step away from the computer now and again. If someone doesn't reply to your Talk page message right away, don't spam them with messages. This is annoying to them at best, and can get you temporarily blocked at worst.
Keep in mind that if you make an abusive comment over email or do anything against wikiHow policy, the person you emailed can forward your email to an administrator, who can revoke your email privileges.
 Nobody likes being lied to. When communicating with the wikiHowians, be honest about yourself and anything associated with you. People want to be able to trust you on wikiHow, whether it comes to edits you make or your personal life. Keep in mind, it's better to not give the information in the first place than to intentionally give false information.


Don't be too honest; if someone asks you for personal information, such as where you live, your phone number, or so forth, don't give it to them. You might be honest, but you can't really know for sure whether they are.
 You never know what goes on behind the other end of the screen. While wikiHow is a friendly community filled with great people, some people on wikiHow might not be the same as the others. Be safe online; don't give out personal information that could be used to identify you (full name, address, phone numbers, workplace or school, etc.), and never agree to meet up with someone in person by yourself. Take someone with you or go to a crowded place. wikiHow meetups are a fairly safe place to meet wikiHowians; there are plenty of other wikiHowians around as well.


Even if you've met the wikiHowian in person, whether one-on-one or at a wikiHow meetup, be careful of what information you give to them. Just because you know a wikiHowian in person doesn't mean you should let your guard down online. Keep personal information off of Talk pages, and share it privately instead.

 If you notice the beginning of symptoms, follow the steps your healthcare professional has recommended to prevent flare-ups.


If your provider has suggested over-the-counter medicines to treat symptoms, such as anti-diuretics or anti-inflammatory pills, take the medication at the onset of symptoms.
Make a note of new or unusual symptoms or reactions, keep a list of any medications you used, and write down any potential offending foods or drinks so that you can discuss them with your healthcare provider and avoid the cause of such discomfort in the future.
 In some cases, stress relief techniques, natural nutritional supplements, gluten-free diets, exercise routines, and proper hydration help prevent or relieve Inflammatory Bowel Disease symptoms.


When you are feeling well, try adopting a routine of stress-reducing exercise and natural nutrition management to get the most out of life with IBD.
Consult your primary care provider before beginning any strict dietary regimens, nutrition supplements, or strenuous physical activity plans to prevent accidental complications or dangerous physical risks.
 Focusing on what you will do or accomplish during periods of remission can help remind you that freedom from the symptoms of Inflammatory Disease is possible.


Staying positive can help prevent anxiety and depression, and can help you appreciate and enjoy symptom-free time even more.

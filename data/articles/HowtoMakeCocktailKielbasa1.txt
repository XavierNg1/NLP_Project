 Use a sharp knife to cut your kielbasa into smaller, bite-sized pieces.Make sure to get the pieces of kielbasa as uniform as possible so that they all cook evenly when in the crock pot.
 Pour 18 ounces (510.3 g) of apple jelly and 9 ounces of mustard (255.1 g) to the base of the slow-cooker. Mix them together until they are well incorporated. The jelly and mustard will create a sweet and savory glaze that will start to form as you cook your kielbasa., Once your glaze is thoroughly mixed, add your kielbasa to the pot. Toss the kielbasa in the glaze until all pieces have been covered., Set the dial to low and cover the cooker with the lid. Continue to cook your kielbasa in the crock pot and only open the lid to mix it every 15 to 30 minutes. Make sure to pay close attention to the kielbasa on the bottom, as they will begin to caramelize and could burn. When you're ready to serve your cocktail kielbasa, keep the crock pot's heat low., You can skewer the pieces of kielbasa with toothpicks and line them on a plate to give them a cocktail flair. If your guests are coming in at different times and you want to keep the kielbasa warm, you can keep toothpicks next to the slow cooker and encourage people to skewer their own pieces.

Keep the temperature on low and remember to periodically stir the kielbasa as you serve it.

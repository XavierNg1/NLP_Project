 The medic should be someone who is relatively good at dodging paintballs, as they will have the power to heal everyone else and you want them to be in the game as long as possible.
 If a player who is not the medic gets shot, he is temporarily out.
 The medic must make their way over to an eliminated player and touch him to heal him. If you want, you can put a limit on the number of times a player can be healed.
 The medic cannot heal himself, so once he is out you will have to play as if your team does not have a medic. You cannot elect a new medic.

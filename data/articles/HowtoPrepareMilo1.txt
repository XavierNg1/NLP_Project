 This is the basic Milo recipe. Make it according to package directions, or customize it to fit your personal taste. For this recipe you will need:


3 tablespoons Milo powder
Hot water
Optional add-ins: Milk, cocoa powder, sugar, chocolate syrup;
, Milo does not dissolve well in cold milk so most Milo preparations begin with hot water. You can either boil water in a kettle, or heat it in a microwave-safe container for 1-2 minutes, until it just begins to steam.
 The package directions call for 3 tablespoons, but many Milo drinkers like to use a lot more, depending on personal taste. Begin with 3, and see how you like it. You can always add more powder later, or make it stronger next time.
 Add a few tablespoons of water first, and stir thoroughly to make a paste, then add more water and continue stirring until your cup is nearly full.
 You can add a few tablespoons of cold milk to your Milo to cool it off, and add create a creamier texture. You can also drink it plain, just be sure to let it cool off a bit if you made it with boiling water.
 Many people like to add additional ingredients to their Milo concoctions. Try the basic recipe first so you know what you're starting with, and then experiment with your recipe the next time around.


Add one teaspoon (or more) of sugar to the mug before you add the hot water for a sweeter drink.
Add one teaspoon (or more) of cocoa powder or chocolate syrup for a stronger chocolate flavor.
Substitute hot milk for the water for a creamier drink. Heat milk in a pan on the stovetop over medium heat until it just begins to bubble, or microwave for about 2 minutes in a microwave-safe container.

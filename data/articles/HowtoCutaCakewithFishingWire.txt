 You may need to cut rather small pieces of cake if you have a large number of guests relative to the available cake.


Compare the guest count to the cake size and take note of how many pieces you will ultimately need to cut, then plan your cuts so that the number of pieces will slightly exceed the number of guests
Determine if you can cut the entire cake with fishing wire. In the event of a staggered layer cake you may need to disassemble the cake and before you cut it. For a traditional double layer cake, though, the fishing wire method will work well.;
, You can make two small guide marks on the top of the cake for each cut, one near each edge. Alternatively, you can embed a toothpick to mark the end of each planned cut.
 Use a spool of fishing wire that has not been in the tackle box, sitting in the garage or is dirty. This tool is ideal for slicing through cake, but you must use a new spool of wire.
 Loop the wire once around each index finger and stretch the wire until taut. Hold the wire over the cake in a straight, long line.


Position the wire to over your planned cut and bring the fully taut wire straight downward.
,


Wipe the wire clean before each cut, though, for a cleaner cut.

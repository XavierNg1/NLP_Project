, Most airports will answer the question of "What is your three-lettered airport code?" with the code.
 Most of the major airlines will be able to find out what the code is to the airport, provided that you tell them the airport's exact name, city and state.
 Whether the travel agent is the one that you are using to fly or not, each one can answer your question.
 All airlines are mandated to place the airport name and airport code on the ticket.
 While some sites are better than others, most search engines will be able to answer this question. Type the complete airport name along with a comma and space and the words "airport code".
 Once you are signed into FlightAware, you can grab the information for any airport round the world. Go to their Browse Airports page and click the State the airport would be in.


Look down the column under "FAA code". While the Major Airports section is a "most commonly asked for section", there are other airports listed underneath (in All Airports) that contain other popular codes.
 Use mobile apps. Between the ForeFlight app (on iOS) and the FlightAware app on Android, or just about a few apps on an Amazon Kindle Fire, you'll never be without an answer to the code lettered question.

 A blackout box provides your rooster with a dark, non-stimulating sleeping environment. You can often locate the materials required to build a blackout box around your home or purchase them from a local pet supply store. If you intend to keep the blackout box outside, find a shady location. If you prefer to house your rooster’s indoors, place the blackout box in your garage or outbuilding., A raised dog crate serves as an ideal blackout box because it’s raised bed provides ventilation and you can easily cover the kennels’ holes. Assemble the crate in the location you selected—follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Remove any dog bedding and cover the floor of the crate with a layer of hay., The walls of your dog crate may be solid, slotted, or wire. To effectively block out light, drape the top, back, and side walls with blackout drapes. Purchase or cut a piece of plywood that is the same dimensions as the front wall. Lay the plywood against the front of the crate.

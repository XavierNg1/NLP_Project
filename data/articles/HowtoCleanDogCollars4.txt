 These cleaning materials may damage collars made from natural materials, including cotton, wool, and leather. However, they are both effective options for removing grime and odor from synthetic materials. An alternative method for synthetic collars would be to add them to a load of laundry in the washer/dryer. The detergent, hot water and heat from the dryer all help to sanitize the collar/leash. There is a padded/porous bag available that will eliminate the banging/clanging noise and protect the washer/dryer and other items in your load.


Take the collar off the dog before you get started.
 Make a solution of equal parts white vinegar and baking soda. Soak the collar for 15 to 30 minutes.
 Alternatively, you can submerge the collar in hydrogen peroxide for about an hour.
 Rinse out the collar after it's done soaking. Wash it in soapy water if you used hydrogen peroxide.
 Shake gently to remove some water, then place on a towel or hang it up to air dry.

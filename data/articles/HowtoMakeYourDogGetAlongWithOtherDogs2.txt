 Whether you’ve trained your dog for years or have recently become an owner, don’t force dogs to meet the way humans do. Humans meet each other face-to-face, look each other in the eye, and consciously use sight as their main sense. For dogs, face-to-face interaction is usually associated with a challenge, and they rely on smell much more than sight.Let the dogs show each other their profiles instead of meeting head-on. Let them walk around each other, and smell where the other has walked., When you meet another dog when you’re on a walk, don’t pull hard on the leash or make any other gestures that anticipate trouble. Try to remain calm yourself. Your dog will pick up you being nervous, afraid, letting your heart race, and other subtle behavioral cues. If you anticipate a problem, you’ll end up setting your dog up for failure.Let the dogs maintain distance, then cross paths, smell where the other has walked, and slowly approach each other. If they stare each other down, show teeth, snarl, or show any other aggressive behaviors, then give a verbal command to get your dog’s attention on something else and continue on their walk.
 Dog parks can be a great social activity for your dog. It’s particularly important, however, that you’ve already exposed your adult dog to others in a one-on-one setting before heading to a dog park. Otherwise, the experience might be overwhelming or even traumatic.Supervise your own and other dogs closely. Interrupt any rough or high-arousal play, like non-stop or fast running. Leave if your dog is being a bully, being bullied, or seems like it’s not having any fun.
Try to be aware if there are a number of intact males present, and be on your way if there are.
Don’t offer treats or toys to your dog at a dog park, and don’t encourage pack-forming or other competitive or domineering behavior.
Don’t ever let your dog off its leash in an outdoor setting if it doesn’t respond to your verbal commands.

 Choose your gender, name, and pick a starter, any one.

If you want, nickname the starter. Since it's not the Pokémon you'll be using, it's not really important.


It's not wise to pick a Pokémon that you won't have access to quickly like Dratini in HGSS. You'll waste a good portion of the challenge getting the Pokémon and miss the hard part of the Nuzlocke.
No already evolved Pokémon! It should be lower leveled like a starter when you begin.
 Don't be picky! Once caught, swap your starter for the Sololocke Pokémon as soon as you can. No training it with an Exp. Share!

Make sure you have a Pokeball to catch it!

,

You cannot catch any other Pokémon, as this is a Solocke. The only exception is an HM Pokémon, because a Pokémon like Blaziken, for example, cannot learn Surf. You'll need an HM Pokémon to learn this move. These HM Pokémon cannot fight in battles though!
No Revives. Once you die, it's over.
No soft resetting to avoid death. It's cheating, and the point of Nuzlocking is the challenge!

,

Try selling things you don't need or can't use. Revival items can be sold for a fair price.
Have a wide move pool for your Pokémon. Use TMs and Move Tutors to give it an edge against anything that it might encounter.
If you're in Gen 6, then use Super Training to boost your Pokémon's stats. Go for a high Attack or Special Attack, or try a strong Defence.
Remember to have fun!

 It is more likely for Italian business people to trust you if they know you personally. Whenever possible, try to let someone who knows the person introduce you as this will reduce any apprehension the other person may have about you being unknown and therefore uncertain.;
, Italians prefer face-to-face contact for doing business.If you are doing a lot of business with Italian organizations, it is advisable to actually visit Italy and develop your relations in person, so that they know who you are on that next Skype call or email.
 It helps if business contacts know something about you personally, perhaps little things about your family, your prior roles in life and what you like to do in your spare time. Knowing the personal details will increase trust and Italian business people are more likely to conduct business with you, increasing the chances of a more successful outcome.


It is highly recommended that you divide time between socializing to get to know your Italian business partners and time for the actual business meetings. Being too personal during meetings is not appropriate; however, by knowing one another well before attending the meeting, everyone will feel a lot more comfortable. As such, try to meet them for a social occasion before sitting down to negotiations; set such hospitality up yourself, including covering its costs.

 Be on the lookout for slippery spots that might be in the road. Ice is common on bridges, even when the rest of the road made be clear, so approach bridges and shaded areas with the proper caution., Dig loose snow out from under the tires and pour sand or kitty litter under the tires to create traction. Gently rock the car to help the tires make contact with the ground, if possible.
 If you notice despite the distance and precautions of safe winter driving that the rear end of your car is starting to skid, you have to avoid the hazard as gently as possible.


Remove your foot from the accelerator if the rear end of the car begins to skid while driving on snow or ice.
Steer out of the skid by turning the steering wheel in the direction you want the car to turn.
Turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction if the car over-recovers from the skid.
 Remove your foot from the accelerator if the front end of the car begins to skid. Do not brake while in the skid.


Turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the car to turn.
Shift the car into neutral if driving a manual transmission.
 If you can avoid stopping altogether, thatâ€™d be even better. Gradually slow down your car almost to a complete stop when you are nearing a red light. It might turn green without you even having to stop at all.If you see a line of cars stopped in front of you, start pressing your brakes several feet back to avoid rear ending anyone accidentally.
If you notice that your tires have locked up, take your foot off of the brakes completely.

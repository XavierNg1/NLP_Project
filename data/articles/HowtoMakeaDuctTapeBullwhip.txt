 You'll need to have two chairs (or something to string your tape between) spaced about ten feet apart. You can buy duct tape in many different colors. Basic gray is the cheapest, but you can get whatever you want.;
,,, This can be difficult and or very easy depending upon how nice you want it to look. If you want it to look nice, or are using dark colors, you should take it slow and make sure not to overlap. If you're using basic gray or white, it won't matter a whole lot as far as looks if you overlap, but it may be slightly sticky to the touch!

,,, Don't make them real loose (doesn't work as well), but don't make them real tight either (won't move as smoothly).
 Once you get towards the end of your rope, cut off about four to six inches of duct tape and wrap it around the end. Cut off any extra rope.
 Secure the handle by wrapping any color duct tape around the handle starting a couple inches off the handle and on the rope. Wind your way up the handle and back down if wanted.



To do this cut approximately eight inches of twine or whatever you chose to use.
Fold it in half and lay it on a flat surface.
Take the end of your bullwhip and lay it on the middle of it.
Bring the folded end up and feed your two ends through it (refer to picture).
Tighten it real tight so it won't fall off. You should tie it a couple times to just to make sure. The popper is very interesting because when you whip it and it "pops", it is moving beyond the speed of sound and creating a vacuum in space.
 You're done, so go outside wearing your protection (Below in Warnings) and practice. Wet the popper down before you use it as it makes it "pop" better. One method is to bring it forward and up and snap it back down. When you come back down you're using more wrist than arm.
 Seriously, this can be fun but like with everything, there are limitations.

 These include laptops, iPads, microwaves and other electronics. Turn the WiFi and Bluetooth off, too, and see if that helps devote more of your phone's resources to finding a signal.


Turn off these other devices if possible. If that doesn't work, consider turning your phone off too and turning it back on again shortly thereafter. Sometimes a little reboot solves just about any problem.
 Your cell phone uses a lot more power when connecting a call than when it is on standby. Often, your battery can be strong enough to attempt a call, but not strong enough to find a signal. If you find you are having signal problems, consider your battery and get to charging.
 Mobile phone antennas are designed to project a signal outward, perpendicular to the long axis of the antenna. As such, mobile phones seek signals in a donut-esque shape around the antenna. Normally, when a mobile is held upright, this is not a problem. However, if you are holding your phone in a strange way, such as on its side or upside down, you will hinder the operation of the antenna. Hold your phone upright to guarantee that your phone can "see" your carrier signal.


On most newer phones the antenna is located at the bottom of the phone, so if you are experiencing signal problems on a newer phone turning it upside down will boost your signal.
On the older phones, the antenna can usually be located on the rear upper area of the phone (near the camera).
 Make calls and connect to internet from your phone as normally you would. If your mobile phone supports UMA, you can use the wi-fi as your cellphone signal where you don't get GSM signal coverage or areas with poor coverage. There are also some apps that are free to download, such as Viber, which call using Wi-Fi


Not all devices and carriers support UMA calls. Some Blackberry, Androids and a few other phones support UMA, and it is becoming more and more common as technology improves.

 When you first open the configuration utility, you will be taken to the Basic Setup page. You can leave all of these settings at their defaults, unless specified otherwise by your ISP. When you click the Wireless tab, you will be taken to the “Basic Wireless Settings” section.


This section will allow you to create and secure your wireless network. It is important that you change it from whatever default it was set to for security.
 In the Basic Wireless Settings section, there will be a field labeled “Wireless Network Name (SSID)”. This is the name of your network, which will appear in the list of available networks for your wireless devices. Make sure you don’t give out any personal information, as anyone can see this name.


You can keep the Network Mode and Channel set to the default, unless specified otherwise by your ISP.
 Ensure that the “Enable” option is selected for “Wireless SSID Broadcast”. This essentially turns on your wireless network and allows it to be discovered. Once you are done, click the “Save Settings” button.
 Click the “Wireless Security” section to open up your wireless security options. Here you will be able to set the security encryption type and password.


Security Mode – Set this to WPA2 if possible. This is the latest for of encryption, and the most secure way you can protect your network. Note: not all older devices support WPA2. If your printer or other device can’t use, switch to WPA or WEP.
Passphrase – This is the password that people will need to enter when they attempt to connect their devices to your network. Make sure that the password is strong to prevent unwanted intruders.
 Your router will apply the changes and restart. Your wireless network will now be activated and secured.

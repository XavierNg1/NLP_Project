 Did you just open your business? Are you supporting a charity drive around the holiday season? Did you just wrap up a special project? Pitch your story to your local media outlets and see if they're interested in covering you. Try newspapers, broadcast news and radio shows. By using multiple media sources, you can reach more potential customers.
You can write press releases for almost any event in your business. However, if you send too many press releases that are of little interest, the media may lose interest.
 It is good to build relationships with as many columnists as possible. Sometimes, they may be looking for stories and may actually reach out to you.


Some newspapers have columnist who specializes in writing about good deals and new businesses. Try them as a first point of contact.
Look for columnists who reach your niche audience - for example, if you run a fishing tackle shop, get in touch with your local newspaper's outdoors columnist.
 Many newspapers will print special coverage of charity endeavors, particularly during holiday seasons. These charity events are often covered in the local media.


You could host a small charity drive during which you accept canned food or used-good donations to give to your local shelters or assistance organizations.
Be sure to contact the newspaper and other media outlets regarding the event and mention that your business is sponsoring it.
Display your business logo as prominently as possible without overshadowing the event. You can have signs, banners, or even articles of clothing with your company name and logo.
For even better publicity, offer a discount to customers who bring in an item to donate. This will increase revenue for both the charity and your business.

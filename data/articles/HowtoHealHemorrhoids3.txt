 For hemorrhoids that consistently get in the way of daily activities and present a painful medical condition, talk to your doctor:


Heat treatment. Called "infrared coagulation," this heat treatment blocks blood flow to a single hemorrhoid at a time, causing it to eventually fall off.Only one hemorrhoid can be treated at a time.
Rubber band ligation. This procedure also blocks blood flow to hemorrhoids, causing them to die.A rubber band is tied around the hemorrhoid to do this.
Surgical hemorrhoidectomy. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy removes individual hemorrhoids using a stapler or sutures., Hemorrhoids can cause surrounding blood in the anus to clot and nearby tissue to scar. If you think you may have clotting, see a doctor to help remove them and treat the hemorrhoids.
 Blood from the stool may be caused by hemorrhoids, but it may also be caused by a more serious condition, such as cancer.

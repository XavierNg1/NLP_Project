 Start writing the introduction in a way that appeals to the reader. Present your introductory characters or hypotheses clearly. Build curiosity and make the reader think.
 Divide different aspects of the story or topic into separate paragraphs. If you are writing a story or play, you will want to divide it into a sequence of scenes. If you are writing an essay, you should discuss different viewpoints in organized paragraphs.
 Don't go off into tangents that may confuse or bore the reader. This will help you bring your project to a focused conclusion later on.

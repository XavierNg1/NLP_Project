 If your child sleeps more than usual, he may wake up hungry more often. If you are still breastfeeding your child, make sure to be available when he wakes up.


If you cannot be around, consider pumping your breast milk and having bottles ready for when your child wakes up.
 Because of his growth spurt, your child will probably be hungry at random hours of the day. However, you should try to stick to a feeding schedule that also involves naptime. Once the pattern is established, you may find that your child is less cranky.


Children who are going through growth spurts have a tendency to be very cranky because they are either tired or hungry all the time.
 If your child seems to be eating a lot more at each meal, or drinking a lot more breast milk than normal, let him do so. His growing body needs the nutrients. Don’t be concerned that your breast milk will run out; if your child is demanding more milk, your body will rise to the occasion to meet the demand.If you are feeding your child regular baby food, consider adding a bit more food to his regular meals.
 Your child may prefer only one type of food at this stage in his growth. Your child’s appetite may decrease depending on how he copes up with his growth spurt.


Make sure that you are feeding him on time and that you are giving him the right amount of milk (breast milk or formula) together with other foods such as fruits, vegetables, meat and poultry

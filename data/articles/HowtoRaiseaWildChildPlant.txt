 Buying a plant is like adopting a young kid. While they’ll eventually adapt to your conditions, you have to respect where he or she came from, and understand their individual demands. Your Ardisia plant, also called the Coral Berry, is native to southern China and Indonesia. As a tropical plant, it’s quite sensitive to frost, so make sure you keep it inside during the winter until the first few weeks of spring. When your plant has fully grown (which may take a couple months), white petals will bloom from late spring into the summer, which will soon be followed by a ring of red berries that will last until Christmas.;
, Your Wild Child needs sunlight like a baby needs breast milk. Give them too much, and you're bound to see some undesired results. The Coral Berry plant only needs indirect sunlight, so make sure that it's a few feet from the window.
 It’s important to know how thirsty your plant is. Luckily for you, your Wild Child isn’t that needy. The Ardisia plant needs roughly one cup of water a week, but it's advisable to water him or her when their soil begins losing its moisture to the touch.
 Talk to them, tickle their leaves, and give them a big hug every once in a while.
 Over the next few months, your plant will grow out of its old clothes and will need a new getup. Let the next pot you buy be the next size up, and deck it out with items that fit your Wild Child’s personality. Is he or she chill and sedentary? Or one of those twerking in the breeze types?

 On any snorkeling adventure you are bound to get some water in your tube at some point, sometimes either due to surf conditions or excessive splashing, or by letting your head dip too low in the water. Learning to clear your snorkel will keep this from being a cumbersome disruption to your experience.
 You should feel that water is entering the snorkel barrel.
 Make sure the end of the tube is in the air this time.
 This blast method of snorkel clearing will remove nearly all the water from your snorkel.
 By repeating the blast method you should clear any water that enters into the snorkel.
 Sometimes you will get water in your tube when you have no air in your lungs. If there is only a little water, inhale slowly and carefully without letting water into your mouth until you have enough air for a full blast. If there is too much, you will need to lift your head out of the water and take a breath around the mouthpiece.
 Once you get adept at clearing your airway, you can consider diving below the surface of the water to get a better look at something nifty. Take a deep breath and swim down. When you need a breath, surface, keeping your face underwater, and clear your flooded snorkel tube like you practiced.

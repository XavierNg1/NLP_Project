Learn advanced ballet technique. If you intend to teach advanced ballet classes, study with master teachers who have performed and taught extensively.
Gain rudimentary knowledge of ballet for teaching young children. If your goal is to teach recreational ballet to kids, your ability to hold their attention and create an interesting class will be more important than mastering advanced ballet technique.;
, Ask permission from dance schools to observe classes. Pay close attention to the interaction between the teacher and her students, as well as the specific teaching methods that keep students engaged.



Decide what movements and terminology you will teach in a single class. In a dance studio where you teach the same dance level each time, your class attendees may be different from day-to-day. When teaching an introductory ballet class, cover the basic ballet positions and other fundamental movements, such as plieï¿½, tendu, jete, releve and retire.
Outline a plan for long-term students. If teaching in a college or community center where students have committed to attending class regularly, create a plan for the entire program. Start with basic ballet positions and teach more involved dance sequences by the end of the program.
 Ballet classes have barre routines, across the floor movements and a sequence to be performed in the center of the room. Adhere to this structure closely so that students know what to expect from one class to the next.



Buy a ballet class compilation CD. Purchase music online or visit a music store. Ask your ballet teacher(s) for recommendations.
Compile your own CD. Select music with the appropriate tempo, mood and rhythm to match the movements and skill level.
 If the dance studio has a strict dress code for students, such as a black leotard, pink tights and ballet shoes, abide by the same attire to set a good example. In community centers, it is generally acceptable to be more relaxed in your dance attire.



Enunciate the names of the ballet movements. Repeat them each time to reinforce learning. Limit extensive explanations during the ballet class. Students will learn more by watching and attempting to do the movements themselves.
Use brief metaphors if necessary. For students who need imagery, liken ballet movements to common images. Study the motion of animals and the appearance of nature, and verbally express them as metaphors for dance movement.
 If the majority are intermediate students, move at their pace.


Work independently with slower students during breaks or after class. Recommend slower students to other appropriate level classes, if available.
Challenge more advanced students. If the class is doing 2 turns, for example, ask advanced students to attempt 3 or 4 turns.
 Your teaching ability will strengthen with repeated practice. Use your passion for the dance form to inspire your students to persevere and enjoy the learning process.

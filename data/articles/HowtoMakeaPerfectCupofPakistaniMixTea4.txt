 You’ll need the following items: 2 teaspoons of Kashmiri tea leaves, ½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), 2 pods of smashed cardamom, 2 cups of water, 2 cups of whole milk and ½ teaspoon sea salt.If you don’t have Kashmiri tea leaves, you can substitute green tea leaves.
You have the option of garnishing your drink with 1.5 teaspoons of ground pistachios and almonds.
 Boil your tea on medium heat until frothy. Add your bicarbonate of soda and vigorously whisk your mixture for 10 seconds. Add your other cup of water along with your cardamom and boil your tea until the mixture turns bright red.If you don’t have a whisk, a fork or wooden spoon will also suffice.
 Turn your heat down to medium low and add your milk. Whisk the tea vigorously until a slight froth emerges. Add your salt, stir and pour your mixture into a cup. Garnish your tea by sprinkling it with your crushed pistachios and almonds.Once you add your milk, your tea should be a dark pink. The more milk you add, the lighter your mixture will be and the creamier your tea will taste.

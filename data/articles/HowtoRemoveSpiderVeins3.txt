 When your body retains extra water, it puts unnecessary pressure on your veins, which can cause them to enlarge and become visible. Decrease your intake of the following foods that cause water retention:


Foods with a lot of salt. Fried foods, canned soups and salty snacks can cause you to retain water. Try reducing or eliminating the amount of salt you use in everyday cooking and baking.
Alcoholic drinks. A few beers or glasses of wine a week shouldn't cause a problem, but more alcohol than that can cause your body to retain water and strain your veins.
 Constipation is another form of pressure that can lead to over-strained veins. Eating foods high in fiber helps your digestive system work properly and prevents this type of pressure from accumulating.


Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid juice, and eat whole fruit instead, since it contains a lot of fiber. Try making whole-food smoothies with spinach, blueberries and bananas.
Eat whole grains. Quinoa, steel-cut oatmeal, oat bran, and other whole grains help relieve the pressure of constipation.
Take fiber supplements if your system still seems to need more fiber.
 Regular exercise keeps you moving and improves your circulation, and it also helps the body maintain a healthy weight, decreasing pressure on the veins in your legs.


Focus on exercises that work out your legs, like running, swimming or biking.
Daily walks are another great form of exercise. Fit them in on your lunch break or before and after work.

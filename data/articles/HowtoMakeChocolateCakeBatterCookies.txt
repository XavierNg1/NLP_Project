 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius). Cover a baking tray with parchment paper.
 In a large mixing bowl, mix the cake mix, baking powder, vanilla, eggs, and oil using a rubber spatula. The batter should be slightly thick and doughy, and should also be a dark chocolate brown.

If the cookie dough is very sticky, try chilling it in the fridge for half an hour for better results when it's time to roll it into balls.
 Using an ice cream scoop, scoop a tablespoon of cookie dough to form a medium sized ball. Pour about about 4 tablespoons of sprinkles in a bowl and roll the ball in it, if desired. Continue to make cookie balls until dough is used up.

You may add more sprinkles if you are all out and need to roll the cookie balls more.
 Place the tray in the oven and have it bake for 10 minutes. The edges will be crisped brown once ready.
 Using a spatula, remove the cookies from the tray and lay them to cool on a wire rack for another 10 minutes.
 Place a cookie on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk. Enjoy!

 A guy who likes you, wants to connect with you. This will mean borrowing books from you, taking movie or music recommendations. He may even turn this into a chance to get in a little verbal flirting, by teasing you about your choicesThis shows that he values your opinion and wants to connect with you on a deeper level. It also probably means that you've got awesome taste!

, Gentle teasing can be a big part of flirting, so a guy who is teasing you is probably trying to flirt with you. This means teasing you about something you're doing, or making jokes about your terrible sense of direction, for example.


He might also make jokes around you more often than normal, because he's trying to get your attention by making you laugh. This could be anything from making bad puns to making gentle fun of himself (his bad sense of direction).
Make sure that he isn’t saying mean or hurtful things. Teasing shouldn’t make you feel bad about yourself. He might be trying to flirt, but he's not doing it in a very kind way. Give this sort of guy a pass.
 A guy who's interested in you and wants to flirt is going to be paying attention to you. Complimenting can also be a part of flirting, especially if he couples if with teasing.He might compliment your appearance, your smile, what you're wearing, and so on.
He might also compliment you on things other than your appearance. Things like your writing ability, your story-telling abilities, your head for math, your skill with videogames, etc.
 These are the kinds of questions that keep you talking, as well as see if he can hang out with you more, or flirt with you more. Pay attention to whether he drops these into the conversation.


A couple examples of dangling questions are: “So you’re single because…” or “You’re doing what this weekend…”
These questions indicate his interest in your relationship status or whether or not he can see you, but in a flirtatious manner.

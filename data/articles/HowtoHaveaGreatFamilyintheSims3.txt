 Make sure that you have at least one young adult/adult male and female. We definitely recommend a young adult over an adult.;
, There are many cheap houses already pre-made in the game.
 Notice in the top left corner of your screen, it will say, "*name here* thinks that *name here* is being flirty"After the first kiss and the romantic music, you can click on the Sim, then "Romantic", and choose whatever kind of romantic action that you want.
, After they are both relaxing side-by-side, there will be an option saying "Try For Baby". When relaxing, click on the other Sim and you will see it. There is about an 80% chance of getting pregnant. The only way to know for sure is if you hear the baby chimes. Once you hear those the mating will be done.
 She won't be able to go into a hot tub or skinny dip, and many other things. After she gives birth, she will go back to normal.
 Their needs will also be very weak. The second day, they will change into their maternity clothes. You can go to the mirror able change the clothes. They will only wear them until they give birth. The third day is when their stomach gets a big bump. The fourth day their bump will be bigger.
 This mostly happens around the time that you mated her in the first place (For example: if you made her mate with another Sim at 8:00 P.M., she will most likely give birth around that time)

, If you have extra money, you can buy extra baby essentials like the baby chair or toys. You MUST HAVE a crib!

, If you decide on having more, note that there can only be one baby in one crib. You'll have to get more cribs.
 All you have to do is go to the buy catalog, go under "Outdoors", then under "Outdoor Activities" and there will be a birthday cake. Of course you can always just go to the grocery store and buy one there. Once you get your cake, click on the cake and hit "Blow out Candles". There should be a list of the people that are available. Simply click on the person you want to grow up and you are done!

 Conditions such as blood clots, pulmonary embolisms, heart attacks, atrial fibrillation, and strokes are life threatening and serious. If they are not treated properly, you are at risk for recurrence. These conditions require regular check ups and care from a doctor. Under your doctor's care, you may be prescribed a medication to help with thinning your blood as well as a special diet.


Although certain foods may help thicken or thin your blood, do not attempt to use foods or diet to thin your blood.
 If you are at high risk or have had heart issues or stroke, do not attempt to thin your blood by yourself. Diet and other home remedies alone will not prevent clots or heart attacks. Diet and exercise will only help prevent heart disease early on. Once you have heart disease or have had an episode where your blood needs to be thinned, diet and exercise will not be enough to prevent a stroke or heart attack.


Always follow your doctor's advice on diet and medication.
 If you are currently on an anticoagulant, call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of significant amount of bleeding. These can also be symptoms of internal bleeding, hemorrhage, or other hidden bleeding.


Seek medical attention immediately if you experience unusual bleeding. These instances include nosebleeds that happen repeatedly, unusual bleeding from your gums, and menstrual or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal.
If you get injured or experience bleeding that is severe and uncontrollable, get emergency care right away.
You should seek immediate medical help if you show signs of internal bleeding, such as red, pink, or brown urine; bright red, red streaked, or black, tar-like stools; coughing up blood or blood clots; vomiting blood or your vomit looks granular like â€œcoffee grounds; headaches; or feeling dizzy, faint or weak.

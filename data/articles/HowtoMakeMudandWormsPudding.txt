 Prepare the chocolate pudding as directed on the box. Don't place in individual containersâ€”put all the pudding in one bowl, and cover with a layer of plastic wrap on the surface of the pudding (to prevent a crust). Let it set in the fridge until chilled.;
, Crush the Oreo cookies by putting them in a plastic bag and rolling over them with a rolling pin. Divide the crushed cookies into two bowls.
 Take about two tablespoons of the pudding from the fridge and mix it with one of the bowls of crushed Oreo cookies. Add more pudding if needed, but keep the mixture fairly dry.
 Flatten out some of the cookie mix into the bottom of each dessert bowl. Use a large spoon to do this. How much you use will depend on how big your dessert dishes are, and how many dishes you are making. Generally, you'll want to aim for about one heaping tablespoon of dirt per bowl.
 Dish the chocolate pudding from the fridge into all the dessert bowls, being extra careful not to disturb the cookie mixture on the bottom.
 Sprinkle the remaining crushed Oreos onto the top of the pudding mix, so it looks like dirt and mud. Use as much as you like!

, Be creative, put some in halfway and others lying on the top. Have fun with it.
 Store your Mud and Worms pudding in the fridge to keep it cold until you are ready to serve it to guests.

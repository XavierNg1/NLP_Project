 Crack two eggs per person into a bowl or jug. Add one tablespoon of milk, half-and-half, or sour cream per egg if you prefer a more tender, moist dish. Adding a little liquid to the eggs means the dish is less likely to turn out tough or rubbery.

, You may also add cheese for cheesy eggs.
 Two eggs will require a very small pan, while a dozen eggs requires a much larger one.
 Move the pan by its handle, so that the melted fat glides around the surface and coats the entire pan.
 When small droplets sizzle and evaporate, the pan is just hot enough to pour in the egg mixture. Continue to whisk as you pour the egg mixture into the pan. Set the burner on low.
 As soon as this starts happening, move the mixture around the pan with a spatula to scrape the cooked eggs from the bottom to the top of the mixture and expose the still-wet portions to the heat. This keeps the eggs from developing a leathery brown skin on the bottom.
 When they are, take them off the heat, as the hot pan will continue to cook them. If you prefer drier-textured eggs, leave them on the heat as required. Your eggs are done after there's no liquid of any kind left in the skillet.









Remove your eggs from the pan before they lose their moist appearance.You can also add strips of cheese to the eggs to get a more vibrant flavor out of them. Make sure to add cheese when the eggs are still hot so it will all melt onto the eggs.
Add salt and pepper to season, if desired.

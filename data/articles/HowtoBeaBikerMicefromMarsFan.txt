 If you are new to the show, it is always good to get familiar with the show itself, but because it is not on TV anymore, there isn't any chance of you catching an episodes. But you can get DVDs with the episodes on them, so that is a good start.;
, There are a lot of sites which tell what you need to know about the show and its characters, bikermice.com is the unofficial fan-site and one of the best resources out there, so don't be afraid to look it up on wiki as well.
 As with many other animated series, one of the important factors is characters, and you should watch the show to get to know what each character is like in order to understand them.
 Check sites like Amazon or eBay for Biker Mice stuff like action figures, comics, and any other stuff you can do find. Starting up a biker mice from mars collection is a great way to get into the series.
 Another great way to show your appreciation for the show is to visit the message boards at the Red Planet site or to join up and talk about the show with fellow fans.
 Like always, sharing is a very important part, it is good to share your new-found knowledge about the show with friends so remember to do that.
 Buy the soundtrack on amazon or eBay and listen to the tracks on it and since there is a lot of heavy metal involved, it's a great chance to rock out and have a great time.
 If you are a budding writer, you could write a fanfic or even a poem about the bros and their adventures.
 If you are a budding artist, take up art lessons so you can learn how to draw or paint, and for great practice why not draw the biker mice. And the more you practice the better you'll get at it.
 The most important thing is just have fun and enjoy yourself.

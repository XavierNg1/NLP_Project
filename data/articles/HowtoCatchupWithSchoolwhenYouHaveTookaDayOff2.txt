 If at all possible, do this before coming back to school. You can send an email or have a parent stop by your school to pick up any work you've missed. If you can't contact your teachers ahead of time, ask your teachers the next day about missed work., If you have a class where your teacher lectures a lot, it can be difficult to make up missed work. If you've missed an important lecture, see if you can get a classmate's notes. Lectures often highlight things that will be important on future tests and quizzes.Choose a student who you know takes thorough notes. This way, you'll be more likely to get a full picture of what you missed.
You can also ask a classmate for help if you're confused about anything. If you missed a lecture about a new equation in math, for example, you can have a classmate you trust help you figure it out.
 If you don't understand a lesson you missed, stop your teacher after class. Ask them if you can meet with them sometime to go over what you missed. This is especially important if you're struggling to complete an assignment due to missing a day of class., If you've missed more than a few days, you may be genuinely struggling to catch up. In rare cases, you may need a tutor if you missed significant material.If your school has tutoring services, take advantage of them. For example, there may be after school programs where students can stop in for tutoring.
You can also ask your parents if they could contact a tutor. This can be helpful if you're really struggling with a subject.
Usually, a tutor is only necessary if you've missed a lot of school.

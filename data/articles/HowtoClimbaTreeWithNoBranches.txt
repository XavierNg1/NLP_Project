 The tree should not have rotted or look dead as it could collapse or make you fall. Once you have found your tree with no branches, you need to adopt a good mindset to help you climb it. View the challenge of climbing the tree as meeting an adversary you need to overcome. This will put you in the right frame of mind.
 If you can interlock your hands behind the tree's trunk, you can get a nice grip. Otherwise, try to get your fingers into the bark. The goal of using your fingers is not to pull/hold yourself up, but to pull your body closer to the tree., This will cause damage to the soft plant tissue just under the bark. Use shoes with good, strong-gripping rubber or synthetic soles on the bottom., Quickly push out and up. Do this diagonally towards your face. In terms of physics, you must overcome gravity with your force pushing upwards while your outwards force will be met with the opposing force of your hands., If you can't stay there for close to a minute, you need more practice., To move up, push up with your feet, slide your hands up the tree and continue pulling. Then slide or shimmy your feet up to establish the position from step 4., Only go as high as you feel comfortable. Don't take unnecessary risks and keep a buddy on the ground in case you get into any difficulties. Then, come back down again as carefully and slowly as possible. Don't challenge yourself to climb a tree too big for you.

 In order to ensure that your Clarisonic brush head has been sufficiently sterilized, you’ll need to leave it in the alcohol for at least half an hour. Once that time is up, swish the brush gently through the alcohol to remove any remaining buildup and shake off excess solution.Use a cotton swab or toothbrush to eliminate any visible buildup that’s still clinging to the surface of the brush.
Don’t worry about damaging the brush. The bristles are non-porous, which means they won’t absorb alcohol or anything else used to clean them.

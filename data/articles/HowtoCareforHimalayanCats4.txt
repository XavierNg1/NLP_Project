 Himalayans require vaccinations like all other cats, so make sure that you take your Himalayan to see a veterinarian right away. Your cat will also need to be tested for feline leukemia and have a thorough physical exam as well.


Following this first appointment, you will need to make sure that your cat receives booster shots and that she has veterinary exam every year., If you do not plan to breed your Himalayan, then you should have your cat spayed or neutered to help prevent unwanted kittens. The cat population is already out of control and there are not enough homes for all of them, so spaying and neutering your cats is a good way to help prevent pet homelessness., Himalayans are prone to respiratory problems because of their flat faces, so you will need to watch for breathing difficulties. Tell your cat’s veterinarian if you notice that your Himalayan is wheezing or seems to be having a hard time breathing., Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is more common in Himalayans than other types of cats. The breeder should be able to provide proof that neither of your cat’s parents had this disease, but you can also have your cat checked by your veterinarian.


To detect PKD, your cat’s veterinarian can perform a DNA test or an ultrasound.

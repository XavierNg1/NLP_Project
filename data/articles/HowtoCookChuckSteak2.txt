 If your broiler is in the top part of the oven, move the oven rack about 4 inches away from the broiler element. If the broiler is in a sliding tray under the oven, you won't need to adjust the rack. Turn the broiler on while you salt and pepper both sides of your chuck steak.If you like, you can use any steak seasoning to flavor the chuck steak.
 Place the seasoned steak onto a baking sheet or skillet and place it below the broiler. Depending on the thickness of the steak, broil it for 7 to 9 minutes. If you'd like it on the medium or rare side, cook it closer to 6 or 7 minutes.Depending on the type of broiler you have, you may want to leave your oven door cracked so you can monitor the cooking.
 Use a sharp fork or kitchen tongs to carefully turn the chuck steak. Place the steak back under the broiler and let it cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, depending on thickness. Check the steak's temperature.If you want a medium-rare steak, remove it from the broiler at 145 degrees F (60 C). For a medium steak, let it cook to 160 degrees F (70 C).
 Remove the steak to a cutting board or serving plate. Place aluminum foil over the steak so it forms a tent and let the steak rest for about 5 minutes. This will help the muscle tissue in the steak redistribute the juice so it doesn't all run out when you begin cutting the steak.The steak should cool down about 5 degrees from the time you take it out from the broiler and after it's rested.

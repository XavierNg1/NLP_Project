Triangle ABC is an acute angled triangle. Squares are constructed on each of the three sides AB, BC and AC. Further, a perpendicular is dropped from the vertex A which intercepts the opposite side BC at point D;
,
We need to prove that the square constructed on any side (say AB) is smaller than the other two squares taken together by twice the rectangle contained by either of the other two sides (say BC) and the intercept (CD) between the acute angle and the foot of the perpendicular on it from the opposite angle (A). This can be done if we prove that the area of the square constructed on side AB equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides minus twice the area of the rectangle which can be formed by BC and CD.
Mathematically, we need to prove that
AB2 = BC2 + AC2 - 2.BC.CD

,,,,, Thus we have proved what we needed to.

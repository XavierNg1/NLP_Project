 Close it into a square as small as it will go, and keep your handwriting as small as possible. Remember, you are trying to be inconspicuous.
 A simpler way to pass the note is to place your hand on the receiver's desk as if steadying yourself and let the note slide out. Or if your neighbor has a purse or bag that is slightly open, you can drop the note in there.
 If your eyes are focused on them, it will be much easier to tell when to hide.
 If you know you'll have a class together with the receiver try to sit in front of, or behind them, instead of next to each other or rows apart. It's less obvious to pass notes over your shoulder than across rows.
 It will look like you're writing down and sharing notes about what the teacher was going on about - not what a cute guy just said to you.

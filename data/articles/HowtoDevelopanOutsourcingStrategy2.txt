 One of the most important reasons to outsource a particular service is to benefit from the knowledge and experience of outside individuals and/or firms.


Ask for cost estimates. Gathering cost estimates early on in the process will aid you in conducting a cost-benefit analysis and competitive pricing studies.
Check references to ensure quality of services. Ask to speak to other organizations that have been served by the vendor or service provider.

 Ensuring that your cat’s food dish is tall enough can help with its digestion. Swallowing its food will be easier if your cat’s mouth is higher than its stomach while it is eating. In addition, this allows your cat to maintain a more natural body posture while eating, which can reduce the stress that is put on its neck and back.


If you can’t find a dish that is high enough, you can use an elevated feeder to achieve the same results. Elevated feeders are raised slightly off the ground and usually hold two dishes—one for food and one for water., Some cats have very sensitive whiskers, so a bowl that is small in diameter might not leave enough room for them to eat or drink without their whiskers touching the sides, which can cause irritation. Look for bowls that are wide and shallow, leaving enough room for your cat to eat and drink comfortably without bending or rubbing its whiskers.Wide, shallow bowls may not be tall enough to ensure your cat maintains a comfortable posture while it is eating. If this is the case, try raising the dishes off the floor with an elevated feeder or by placing them on a slightly raised block.
 It will be easier for your cat to eat and drink if its bowl is not moving all over the place. In addition, keeping its bowl still can help keep the area around your cat’s dish cleaner. Look for bowls that have a non-skid rubber on the bottom to help prevent it from moving while your cat eats.If you can’t find any dishes with non-slip bottoms, you may be able to make your own by gluing a piece of non-skid material to the bottom of the bowl.

 Microwave popcorn comes pre-packaged in bags with seasonings and flavors already added. All you have to do is put the bag in the microwave and hit start. It may be labeled as instant popcorn -- but it all comes packaged. Don't buy a container of loose kernels.;
, One side of the bag usually say "This side up," but if it does not you should place the bag flat on one side with the two paper ends pointing up.
 However, do not leave the microwave alone -- the popcorn may not take this long to cook. After 15-20 seconds, you should hear the kernels start to pop.
 Each microwave is different and has different power settings. When the popping starts to slow down you are at risk of burning the popcorn if you don't stop it in time.If you smell smoke, turn off the microwave immediately.
 The bag will be full of steam, so open it carefully after letting it cool down in the microwave.

 UPF measures the amount of UV radiation that impacts skin through clothing.


Clothing can be marketed as sun-protective when they have a UPF of at least 50. Sun-protective clothing can lose its effectiveness through repeated wash and wear, or if it's stretched or damp. Some laundry additives contain sunscreen and can increase UPF.
Dark colors and polyester clothing are best because they reflect UV radiation, while white clothing absorbs UV rays. Regardless of what clothing is worn, apply sunscreen on your toddler's skin underneath her clothing to offer protection from the sun.



Use a broad-brimmed hat to protect your child's scalp, face and ears.
Sunglasses with UV protection can protect your toddler's eyes.

 You have two trapezius muscles, one on either side of your spine, in the shape of a triangle from the top of your neck to your shoulder to the middle of your back. The three parts of the trapezius muscle are called the upper, middle and lower trapezius muscles., To do this, lie on your back with your knees bent. Place a tennis ball under your back, about one inch out from your spine. Start at the top of your back and work your way down. Lie down on the tennis ball for eight to 60 seconds and then move it lower. Go down as far as your upper pelvis, and remember to work both sides of your back., This sounds worse than it feels! Place your elbow and lower arm on a counter or table so they’re supported. Use the opposite arm to pinch the upper trapezius muscle between your neck and shoulder. Hold for eight to sixty seconds and then do the opposite side. Don’t dig your fingers into your shoulder, just grasp the muscle itself., Lie on your back. Start with your arms down by your sides. Move your arms so your upper arms are at a 90-degree angle to the floor, and your lower arms are at a 90-degree angle to your upper arms. Then lower your hands to touch the floor behind your head. Stretch your arms out straight above your head with your palms facing the ceiling. Then move your arms downwards until your upper arms are at a 90-degree angle to your body. Repeat three to five times., While the pectoralis isn’t the trapezius, stretching it still helps your trapezius. For this stretch you’ll need to stand in an open doorway, or beside the corner of a wall. Raise the arm beside the doorway or wall so that the part from your hand to elbow is lying flush against doorway or wall. Your palm should be lying on the doorway or wall. Move the leg on the same side of your body one step forward. Turn your body out from the doorway or wall until you can feel the stretch just below your collar bone. You can move your arm higher and lower to work different parts of the same muscle.

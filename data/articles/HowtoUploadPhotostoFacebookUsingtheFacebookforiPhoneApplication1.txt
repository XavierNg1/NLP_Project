 That will bring up a menu on the left hand side. If you scroll down, there should be an option labelled "Photos". Click on it.;
, You will then be prompted to either take a new photo/video, choose one from your iPhone library to upload or create a new album.


When taking a new photo: Take a new photo like you would any other photo - just press the camera button at the bottom when you're ready. Once you have taken the photo, you can choose to either "Retake" or "Use".






When choosing an existing photo: Pick an album to choose the photo from. Default albums are "Camera Roll" for photos that you have taken with the device and "Photo Library" for photos you have imported from your computer. After opening the album, select a picture.
 If there are any people who are your friends on Facebook in the photo, click the spot in the photo where they are. Then type their name in the search bar and select it. This will tag them in the photo. You can also tag other people or objects by just entering in some text.
 Type where it says "Say something about this" to add a comment. The buttons below also give you opportunities to say who was there and where you were, along with changing the photo and the privacy options.
 Your photos will now be on Facebook to share with your friends.

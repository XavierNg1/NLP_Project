 Once you have installed your Pokémon game on your Android device, it is time for you to learn the commands. Since it's a Game Boy emulator, it has the Control Pad and Buttons of the old Game Boy.

SELECT: Arranges your items.


START: Displays the Menu screen.
B Button: Cancels the Menu screen, and cancels a command that was selected with the A Button.
A Button: Confirms a menu selection. You also use it to talk to people (keep pressing to reveal the entire message).;
, On the Title Screen, press either A Button or START, and the following options will appear. Use the +Control Pad to select and the A Button to confirm.


New Game: This mode lets you play the game from the very beginning. Register the names of your character and rival. Select letters using the +Control Pad and confirm with the A Button. If you make a mistake, you can erase the letters one by one using the B Button, so you can re-enter the names.
Continue: If you have saved a previous game, this mode will be added and you will be able to continue from the last time you saved.
Option: Select 'Option' to view a list of game play options. You will be able to change the speed of the text, the battle animation and the style of battle to your liking.

 One of the main aspects of the game is engaging in battles with different Pokémons you encounter during the game. It is very important that you learn the commands so you can win and collect as many Pokémons as possible.


Battle Animation: Turn the animation during a fight to ON or OFF. Battle Animation is a display of the attack selected. Eg. 'Bubble' attack will show a stream of bubbles hitting your opponent.
Battle Rules: Select the rules of the game as they relate to fighting Pokémon Trainers.
Switch: Rearrange the order of your Pokémon. When you encounter enemy Pokémon, the one on top of your list will fight first. You may want to rearrange the order so your strongest Pokémon, or the one you want to train, is on top of the list.
Shift: After defeating an opponent's Pokémon, you will have the option of switching to another Pokémon in your current group.
Set: In this mode, even if you defeat your opponent's Pokémon, you must continue fighting using the same Pokémon.
Cancel: Use Cancel when you want to return to the Menu screen.
 These commands are not specifically used during gameplay, but will let you access valuable information, save your game, change some characteristics, and exit when you're done.


Name: This command will display the name, amount of money, number of badges and time spent playing the game.
Text Speed: This changes the speed of the message text to three levels: Fast, medium or slow.
Save: This command lets you save your progress. When you continue, you will resume play from where you last saved your game. Remember: You only have one save slot. You can save the game anywhere except in battle, so save frequently!
Exit: This command returns you to the game.

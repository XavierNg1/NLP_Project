 No two bottle warmers are exactly alike, so it is essential that you read the instructions thoroughly before using it.


While the exact specifications and instructions vary from machine to machine, there are some general similarities.
Note that many, though not all, bottle warmers can also double as baby food warmers for when your child starts eating solids and cereals.



Bottle warmers that use a warm water bath work the same, in principle, as a warm water bath you create without a bottle warmer. The bottle of breast milk is immersed directly into the heated water.
Bottle warmers that use steam use less water. The water is heated in a separate compartment by a heating element or hot plate, and the steam comes up into the bottle compartment to warm the breast milk. This is a more gradual heating method.
 Pour tap water into the reservoir up to the bottle warmer's "fill line."


If the warmer has no fill line, check the instructions to determine how much water to use.






Water bath warmers tend to use more water than steam warmers.
The water should be changed in between uses for almost all water bath warmers and most steam warmers. Some steam warmers have reservoirs that stay filled until the levels dip too low, at which point a refill sensor light goes off.
 Secure the bottle of breast milk in the warmer, placing it inside the bottle compartment.


The bottle will sit loose in some warmers, while others may require you to "snap" it into place.
 Follow the instructions to determine how high or low to set the temperature dial, if the warmer has a dial. Press the start button and wait for the appliance to click off.


Most bottle warmers have a sensor light that comes on and off to tell you when the warming session is done. Others also make a ring or alarm noise when the process is done.

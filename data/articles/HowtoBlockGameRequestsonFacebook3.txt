 This page allows you to see and add apps, as well as review your recent invitations. You can access the App Center by visiting facebook.com/games. You will need to be logged in with your Facebook account.
 This is located at the top of the page beneath the search bar, next to the "Find Games" tab.
 You can navigate between the two sections by clicking their links on the left side of the page. Find any notifications that you wish to block.
 This will open additional options, allowing you to block the sender from sending future requests, or block the entire app itself from ever showing up on your feed.

 Take as much as time as you need, don't rush.;
, Create stuff directly from the script. If the script says the characters are lost in the forest, make the scene a forest. Include every little detail that you can think of.
 At the rehearsal when they say the love each other, if they don't sound sincere, Immediately correct that. If they aren't sincere in the final show or the book, that could result in a major problem.
 Or, you can just change up the essence of the scene. Make sure that your characters are being themselves in the scene,and not just how you picture a sweet scene working out. Keep them in place while they're in the scene, and remember what they want from life.
 That can be awkward, and some people don't really want to read that anyway. Just think about your audience. It can even be something like, 'he brushed his lips lightly over her hair, and she looked up into his eyes suddenly leaning into him as their lips met.'

, Writing is a ton of fun to do-don't be afraid to make it as amazing or as weird as you'd like!

 You can still be friends with someone of the other gender, something that most teenagers do.
 Relationships are much more fun if you are going out with someone you really like, inside and out. That might not happen straight away but that's okay.



A little secret: not only people in Sixth Class but nearly everyone in First Year and loads of people in Second Year haven't kissed a boy or girl, whatever they tell you.
Waiting to have your first kiss with someone you really like is worthwhile because it will be much more special.
Discos are place where most people get their first kiss.
If you have kissed someone, don't boast about it. People will find out themselves and you'll seem way more grown up and cooler if you don't need to make a fuss of it.
Don't talk about the other person behind their back or go around telling people that they're a bad kisser. Not only is it mean, nobody else will want to kiss you in case you slag them off too. Nobody is a good kisser the first time.
Find out the term for kissing with tongues in your area. Ask an older brother, sister or cousin or just listen to friends. French kissing is not a term commonly used in Ireland and you might look a bit odd if you used it out loud! Meeting is a term used in Dublin and in the south of Ireland and shifting is a term used in the northwest. One is always much cooler in an area than another.

Find someone who seems to like you, too. Even if they say they "hate you" to your face, it could mean they like you.
Ask their friends. Ask them do they say they "hate you" behind your back as well. If they do...well, chances are, they don't really like you.
 Most people aren't for a few more years and that's totally normal. It doesn't mean you're any less of a young man or woman and it definitely doesn't mean that you're not as grown up as your friends. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

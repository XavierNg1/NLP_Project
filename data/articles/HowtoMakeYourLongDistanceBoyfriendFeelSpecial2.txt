 You can find a silly GIF to send via chat or post a cute meme on their social media. Humor is a fun way to share an inside joke or a smile even when you aren’t together. You don’t always have to try to be “romantic” to stay connected. Sharing laughter is a good way to avoid becoming depressed due to being apart., Pictures are a fun way to include each other in daily life and can be sent instantly. They can also help to keep the other person from getting jealous as they are regularly included in daily life.
 Celebrate the times you are together and countdown to the next time you will visit each other. A slideshow with a special song can be a fun way to save memories.
 This doesn’t need to be something “romantic”, instead a sign that you are paying attention and know him better than anyone else.


As a special way to count down to an upcoming visit, you can also send special gifts he can use while traveling or for the visit. If he is flying send him a survival kit for the flight or a new scarf in his favorite color for a winter visit.

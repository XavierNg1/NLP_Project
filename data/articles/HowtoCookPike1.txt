 Set the oven to convection and allow it to begin warming while you clean and dress the fish. Make sure there’s plenty of room on the center rack.Keeping the temperature of the oven slightly lower will help the fish cook through consistently without falling apart.;
, Lay each pike fillet on a sheet of aluminum foil. You can then add your herbs, spices and other ingredients of choice. When you’re done seasoning, fold the edges of the aluminum foil up around the fillets, making sure they’re completely covered.Baking fish uncovered often causes it to come out too dry.
Add a burst of flavor to baked pike with aromatics like onion, capers, diced bell peppers and oregano, or keep things simple with a little minced garlic and a drizzle of lemon-infused butter., Transfer the aluminum-wrapped fillets to the baking sheet, leaving a little space between each. Open the oven and slide the baking sheet onto the center rack.In addition to heating the fish more effectively, the aluminum foil will also lock in moisture and help the seasonings cook into the meat itself.
 Set a timer to keep track of how long the fish has been in the oven. When it’s finished, it should be tender and flaky with an opaque white coloring all the way through. Let the fillets cool for a few minutes, then plate and serve.You can test whether the fillets are done by cutting into them with a fork.Try to avoid overcooking the fish, as this can cause it to become mushy and bland.

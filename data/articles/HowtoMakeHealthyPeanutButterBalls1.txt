 Combine the 1 3/4 (157.5 g) cup of oats, 3/4 cup (190 g) of peanut butter, 1/3 cup (113.3 g) of honey, and 1/3 cup (60 g) of chocolate chips into a large mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to mix all of the ingredients together until they are well incorporated and sticky.If the dough is hard to work with, use your hands to mix it together.;
, Cover your bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer. Putting your dough in the freezer will cause it to firm up and will make it less sticky. This will make it easier to work with later.
 While your dough is hardening in the freezer, use the time to line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cold peanut butter balls from sticking to the surface of your cookie sheet., Remove the bowl from the freezer and scoop tablespoon sized portion of dough into your hand. Roll the dough into a ball about one inch in diameter, then place it on the cookie sheet with parchment paper., Chilling the peanut butter bites in the refrigerator will cause them to re-harden. Keep them refrigerated until you're ready to serve them. The balls will stay good in the freezer for up to a week.If you are going to store your peanut butter bites for later, you should put them in a ziplock bag or storage container.

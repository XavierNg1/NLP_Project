 You can also use the microwave to make Nutella hot chocolate, though as milk easily scalds in the microwave, you must be sure not to over-microwave it! To begin, pour the 1 ⅓ cup (315.4 ml) of milk into a microwave-safe mug., Place the mug of milk in the microwave and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Don’t microwave for any longer than 2 minutes, as this can cause the milk to scald., After the milk has microwaved for 2 minutes, take the mug out of the microwave and scoop in the Nutella. Begin to stir together the Nutella into the milk with a spoon., As you are stirring, you should see the Nutella beginning to melt from the heat of the milk. Keep stirring until the Nutella has fully melted and is mixed with the milk., If your hot chocolate isn't hot enough, put it back in the microwave and microwave for fifteen-second intervals, checking after every session to make sure the milk doesn’t scald. Then serve and enjoy!

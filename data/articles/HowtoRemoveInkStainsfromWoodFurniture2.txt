 Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is great for cleaning because it becomes a light abrasivewhen combined with water. It's safe to use on wood because it's mild yet effective. To make the paste, add the baking soda to a half cup of water. Put in small amounts at a time until the mixture thickens into a goop.
 Rub it in with your fingers, making sure to completely cover over the stain. You don't have to scrub at it: let the baking soda do the work. If you scrub too hard, you risk damaging the wood's surface. Wait 10 to 15 minutes.
 Use a soft cloth dampened with water to remove the paste. Repeat the process until the ink is completely removed. For bigger stains, you might need to repeat this more times. Once you're satisfied with the results, finish by wiping the surface dry with another soft cloth.

 In the rules of chess, white will always go first. If you were to be the one who goes first, this will take yet another move, or possibly four or five.
 This will help open a path later in these directions.






You counter by moving the pawn on e7 also two spaces up to e5. This creates a diagonal path towards the side of the board.







Move your queen from d8 to h4 along the diagonal path.
 Your move put white's king in check. White can not use any piece to move out of check, and if black were to move his king out into the queen's path, it would be an illegal move. The game is over with checkmate.

 Once youâ€™ve decided on a guide dog school, you will need to submit an application. At most schools, you can either submit the application online or mail it to the school. The application will ask you about your finances, health, travel practices, and orientation and mobility training., After the guide dog program receives your complete application, they will contact you about setting up a telephone interview. During the interview a representative from the school will ask you about your lifestyle, health history, and finances.
 Once you successfully complete the application and phone interview, the school will decide if you are a good fit for their program. If they believe you are, they will arrange to conduct a home visit. During the visit, a school representative will assess your home, mobility skills, and ability to care for a service dog., Guide dog schools require participants to pay fees associated with getting a service dog and attending the on-campus training with your new dog. Some schools are completely free. Other schools can cost several hundreds or dollars. Make sure you talk to the school about these fees before signing up for a program., Once you are accepted to a program, you will need to complete an on campus training that lasts about two to three weeks. During this time, the school will match you with a dog. Then you and your dog will complete an intensive training program. In most cases, you will live on campus during the training.

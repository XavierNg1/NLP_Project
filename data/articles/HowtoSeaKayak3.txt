 For example, a sleek kayak designed for speed has no flotation foam and will sink if punctured by rocks or by a shark. The hard plastic scupper type kayaks, on the other hand, are very durable and can survive such impacts with greater dependability.
 Although a float plan will not prevent an accident, it will allow a friend or relative to know your route, destination, and estimated time of return just in case.
 Not only can these devices save your life but they will also make it easier for search parties to spot you in case you get lost.
 Also, pack high-protein snacks, such as trail mix or protein bars to fuel the high caloric demand.
 If a wave pushes water into the sea kayak’s cockpit, it’s nice to have a quick way to dry the cockpit. A paddling skirt is recommended as well, especially on rougher seas or in colder weather, to close off the cockpit from the elements and to keep your legs and lower body dry.
 You can fashion one from a bucket and a cord made of fabric, plastic, or rope, or you can simply buy one. The current or wind could sweep you 50 yards (45.7 m) away if you stop paddling for more than 5 minutes.
 The surface area of a kayak is huge, similar to a small sail.

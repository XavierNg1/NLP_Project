 The first thing you need to do is find a suit like the one Jay wears, you may look at Goodwill or clothing stores and remember, it has to be a dark colour suit.;
, And a few cobwebs won't hurt either, perhaps a scary but appropriate prop or two could come in useful.
 If you have naturally black hair, you can dye your hair grey but keep a black spot in the middle like Jay does or use baby powder to make it like that, you can also buy a late night host wig.
 The most important feature is the chin, now if you don't have a naturally large chin like Leno does you can use putty or any adhesive and paint it the same colour as your skin and carefully apply to your face.
 Now Jay's eyes are blue but if you don't have naturally blue eyes you can try wearing contact lenses that are blue, or to go for a more demonic look try red or yellow contacts.
 Or carry around a scary prop like a severed Conan O Brian head.
 If you have a friend, have him or her go as a slightly undead celebrity and go together.
 Jay's voice is quite high at times but loud at other times, try watching clips of him in order to get it right.

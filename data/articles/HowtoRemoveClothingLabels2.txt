 Use a sharp pair of scissors for this and take care that you don’t cut into the seam of your garment. A small strip of the label will remain behind, stitched into the seam.


It’s possible that the freshly cut label may be itchy or irritating on the back of your neck. Some of the stiffer, more papery labels can cause this.
After a few washings, that edge will probably soften and no longer bother you. However, if you’re worried about this, avoid cutting the label off.
 You want it to be approximately the width of your label. You need to use iron-on, no-sew hemming tape for this. It can be obtained in any fabric store or department.
 Once it's in place, iron the tape down. Now the label is no longer hanging loose or flapping from the seam of your garment.


This will definitely help you out when you have an itchy label that can’t be removed from your garment without causing any damage.
Do not attempt this if your garment is made of a delicate fabric. The heat from the iron can damage your item.
 If you are working with a super itchy label, try completely attaching the tag to your garment with the hemming tape. Place the two pieces of hemming tape along the two remaining sides of the label. Iron down two additional pieces along the other two sides of your label.


Now your label has no loose edges and is completely fastened to your garment.
Do not attempt this if your garment is made of a delicate fabric. The heat from the iron can damage your item.
 Instead of a tag, the label information is ironed or stamped on the inside of the garment, in the general area where a tag would normally appear.


This info is only visible on the inside of a garment, and it is invisible on the outside of the garment.

 Putty, Play-doh, or modeling clay are all good options, as long as they are clean and new.Roll a small piece of your chosen material into a ball, and press the finger you wish to imitate into the putty.A hot, flattened piece of paraffin wax will leave a better impression, but only after five or ten minutes of pressing.;
, This will keep the impression of the fingerprint as hard as possible while you work with it. Different materials and brands will react differently to cold, and may not be usable as putty afterward â€” but that's fine for this purpose.
 Boil a small pot of water, then add an equal amount of gelatin powder by volume.Stir constantly for several minutes, dissolving as much of the powder as you can. Let the mixture cool.
 Once the gelatin has cooled to a thick gel, melt it in the microwave, then let cool to a gel again. Microwave repeatedly until the gelatin has no bubbles, and when a drop acts thick and rubbery., Once the gelatin is rubbery and bubble-free, melt it one final time, then pour the hot, liquid gelatin into the fingerprint mold you made from putty.
 Put the putty and gelatin into the freezer. Within a few minutes, the gelatin should harden into a solid, rubbery substance. Peel the gelatin carefully off the putty. You now have a fake fingertip, with the impression of a real fingerprint marked on the surface.

You can also say 안녕 when talking to your friends, siblings or someone younger than you. Pronounce 안녕 like: an-yoh. Only use this to start your greeting.
 Pronounce 제 이름은 입니다 like: je ireumeun (your name) imnida. Remember that your name in Korean will sound different, for example: David would be Deibideu or Deibit so don't be surprised if a Korean says your name differently., Pronounce 만나서반가워요 like: mah-na-suh-ban-ga-wo-yo. This means nice to meet you.
 Pronounce 이름이뭐에요 like: ileumi meo eyo? This sentence means, what's your name?--this will help you to get to know the person better.

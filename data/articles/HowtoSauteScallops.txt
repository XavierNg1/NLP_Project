If you are using frozen scallops, the preferred method of defrosting is to place them in the refrigerator the night before, so they slowly defrost. Scallops cook very quickly, so you do not want to defrost them under hot water.;
,, Make sure to cover the seasonings on both sides.


If you want a crust of pepper, add generously to both the top and bottom of the scallop.
You can also season with paprika, which has a slightly sweet, smoky taste and bright coloring.
To create an easy pan-sauce and flavoring, sauté 2 crushed cloves of garlic and 1 finely minced shallot until tender before adding the scallops.
 Add 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) of olive oil.


You can substitute 1 tbsp. (14.34 g) of clarified butter for olive oil, but not regular butter. Clarified butter is milk fat that has been heated to separate, removing the water and the butterfat. The result is a butter that has a longer shelf life and a higher smoking point. Regular salted or unsalted butter will burn when used to sauté at high heat, clarified butter will not.
 You can do this using a set of tongs, or your fingers, since the scallops have not been heated yet.


Once the scallops are placed in the pan, do not move them until they are ready to be flipped over onto the other side.
 The cooked side should be golden brown.

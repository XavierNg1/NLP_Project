 Save the workbook as "Spheroidal Asymptotes and  Skewed Ring", or as you think best. A related file has been previously saved as "THE Garthwaite Curve" since many past problems were solved by it.;

There should no longer be any errors in the Defined Variables Section. If there are any, see ERRORS in the Warnings section below please., See Tip below concerning Inserting New Comments for all original values and formulas. Format Cell Fill Light Blue to make it distinct from other formulas in the same column, since it will not simply be filled down.
Edit Go to cell range A7:A2886 and with cell A7 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula, "=((A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows)))" w/o quotes and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell A7 and Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =((A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows))) down to A2886." That is there in case someone decides to get creative ....
In cell B6, enter the formula w/o quotes "=IF(Spheroids<=24,Base*24/Spheroids,Base*24/Spheroids)" which I realize is redundant, but it used to solve a problem, so it's being retained.
Edit Go To cell range B7:B2886 and with B7 active and high-lighted, enter the formula, "=B6" w/o quotes and do Edit Fill Down. Do Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =B6 down to B2886 as provides the constant value, per the adjusted value in B6." Expand the comment frame to fit.

Thickness is new and so is the formula for Key -- both have solved some previous problems with partial circles and overlaps (or 'superpositioning'). The user may still build the Factor1 formula and Lookup Table from previous wikiHows if so desired."" Expand the comment frame to fit.
Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and with D6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula w/o quotes, "=Thickness*Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down, then do Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =Thickness*Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1)) down to C2886.

Edit Go To cell range E6:E2886 and with E6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula w/o quotes,"=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand" and do Edit Fill Down. Do Insert New Comment and edit in "Original Formula =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand where GM is the Golden Mean which keeps things proportionate and C6 is the ring's cosine at 0, =1, while ShrinkExpand allows the user to modify the graph's size relative to ShrinkExpand2; otherwise this is the formula for a spherical helix from the CRC manual with the z dimension added into the x dimension." Expand the comment frame to fit.
Edit Go To cell range F6:F2886 and with F6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula w/o quotes,"=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)/ShrinkExpand" and do Edit Fill Down.

Expand the comment frame to fit.
Edit Go To cell range G6:G2886 and with G6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula w/o quotes,"=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand2" and do Edit Fill Down.

Expand the comment frame to fit.
 Edit Go to cell range E6:F2886 and from the Ribbon or Chart Wizard, select Chart, All, Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter (use the scroll box -- it's down a ways). If in Chart Wizard, a new Chart Window will automatically open. Otherwise, a chart will appear on the DATA worksheet to be copy or cut and pasted into the upper left corner of the CHART worksheet. Hover the cursor over the lower right hand corner of the chart box area until the double-headed arrow appears, then pull and expand it into a large square. Double-click on the series plot line to bring up its dialog box and select Line Weight 1 and Color Dark Blue, or as you prefer. Set Transparency. Back on the Chart, click in the Plot Area and select Chart Layout from the Ribbon, where you can get rid of gridlines, legend, set or delete axis titles and input a Chart Title or Text Box (with direct editing), do 3-D formatting, Glow, Bevel, Soft Edges, etc.

Click in the Plot Area and hold down the Shift Key and do Edit Copy Picture. Then activate the SAVES worksheet and, still holding down the Shift Key, Paste Picture. The Option Key allows you to paste a Microsoft Office Drawing Object and do other special effects, plus, it remains linked to the data. Change the data now by entering 1.5 in cell F4 (Thickness) and go back and see the effect on the chart. -- more spread out, but a bit less spherical. Go back to DATA and enter 60 for Spheroids in cell C4. Pretty good little spheres. Set F4 to 1 and look again. Too much overlapping. Set F4 to 2. Just right, approximately.
Click in the Plot Area and do the Chart Add Data menuitem. For Range, respond by going back to the DATA worksheet and selecting cell range G6:H2886. Mine comes out an oval and when I click on the new series plot, the formula bar reads, "=SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,4)" which is wrong. Edit the E's to become G's. You may get a diagonal line which has a series of "=SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$G$6:$G$2886,3)" not wanted at all, so delete it from the Formula Bar with a backspace and return.  Activate the DATA worksheet and enter 1 for Spheroids in cell C4 and then check out the CHART worksheet.Go back to DATA and enter a Thickness of 1 in F4 and then re-check the CHART. Click on the Added Data Series and delete it. Grab the lower right corner of your Chart Area and adjust the frame until there is a nice sphere shape, which happens when it's about 5" wide by 4" tall. With the Shift Key down, do Copy Picture and activate SAVES worksheet and do Paste Picture with the Shift Key depressed. Double click in the Plot and Chart Areas (near the edge) and set them to No Fill (transparent) and No Line. Double-click on the sphere and to the lower right of the Picture Styles box is a Brush in a round circle with a down arrow; select it, and choose Shadow Perspective - the one floating underneath. You should see a round shadow if you have set the background to Transparent. Save the workbook.
The Asymptotes Formula Input. Return to the DATA worksheet. Enter 64 for Spheroids in cell C4, 2 for Thickness in cell F4 and 1 for Number in cell E2 (each of which has an effect on the outcome).
 Edit Go To cell range S6:S2886 and with cell S6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula, "=F6" and Edit Fill Down. You may Insert New Comments for these; it would be a good idea.
Edit Go To cell range P6:P2886 and with cell P6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula, "=((R6/(R6-1))*PI()/180)". and Edit Fill Down. Select cell P6 and Insert New Comment, "Original formula =((R6/(R6-1))*PI()/180), which is Neutral Operations; google NeuOps-Graphs01 to learn more".
Edit Go To cell range Q6:Q2886 and with cell Q6 active and high-lighted, enter the formula, "=((S6/(S6-1))*PI()/180)". and Edit Fill Down. Select cell P6 and Insert New Comment, "Original formula =((S6/(S6-1))*PI()/180), which is Neutral Operations; google NeuOps-Graphs01 to learn more. Basically, if we have two numbers a and b, the operators of Addition and Multiplication will be Neutral versus one another when a=b/(b-1) and b=a/(a-1) for a+b=a*b=c where a^2/(a-1)=b^2/(b-1) = c. This is true for F=ma=m-a, E=mc^2=m+c^2, a^2+b^2=c^2=a^2 * b^2 = a^4/(a^2 -1) =b^4/(b^2 -1), ab = a^b, a+b = a^b via modified Newton-Raphson, etc, etc." Expand comment frame to fit.
Inspect cell range P6 to Q2886 and delete all ############ overflows of exceptionally large numbers -- just delete them please.
 If in Chart Wizard, a new Chart sheet will automatically be created. Otherwise, a new chart will appear on the DATA worksheet to Copy or Cut and Paste to the Asymptotes Chart worksheet's upper left corner. Hover over the lower right corner until there appears the double headed arrow and pull the chart open so that it occupies the window,
Double-click on the horizontal axis and set the Minimum to -.1 and the Maximum to .1; then double-click on the vertical axis and set the Minimum to -.1 and the Maximum to .1; Double-click on the series plot lines and change their color and weight to suit your tastes. Shift Key down and Copy Picture and go to SAVES worksheet and Shift Key down Paste Picture and make notes of Data Settings.






Skewed Sphere Ring: Set Spheroids to 12, Thickness to 1.75 and Number to (Hold off). Create a new Chart from the same data with the above changes of Vertical MaxMin ± .6 and Horizontal -.025 and Maximum .01, then Copy Picture with Shift Key and with Shift Key Paste Picture to SAVES worksheet and make notes of Data Settings. Now change Number from 1 to 2. Copy Picture with Shift Key and with Shift Key Paste Picture to SAVES worksheet.
Now double-click the Vertical Axis and reset to MaxMin of ± .05 to see the other series! Copy Picture and Paste Picture with Shift Key and make note of data settings.

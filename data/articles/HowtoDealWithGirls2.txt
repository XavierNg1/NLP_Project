 Girls are more likely to be attracted to a person who is confident in who they are.


Smile and be in control of yourself. Even if you are nervous, a smile will show that you are friendly and approachable. Try not to fidget or show that you’re nervous.
Stand up straight and make eye contact. Standing up straight will make you feel stronger, and eye contact lets her know that you are paying attention.
 Asking her questions about herself is a good starting point.


This will show your interest and get the conversation flowing. Try asking her if she likes sports, if she’s seen a new movie, or how her day has been.
Think about some things you’re interested in, and ask if she’s interested in these things too. You might find that you like the same soccer team, or both love hip hop.
Ask to borrow something, like a pen, even if you don’t need it, to get her talking., Genuinely hearing and responding to what a girl says lets her know that you care.


Pay attention to how the conversation is going. If you are doing most of the talking and she is barely responding, she may not be interested., If you like the same kinds of books or even have the same classes, talk about it!


If you both take Spanish, ask her to help you with that day’s assignment. If you both have dogs, offer to go to the dog park together.
You probably already like her because you have some things in common. Having the same favorite book or movie will make a girl feel more connected to you.

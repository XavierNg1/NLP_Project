 The best way to protect your graduation cap from damage is to not take it out any more often than you have to. Stash the cap in the box it was packaged in when it’s not in use and set it on the top shelf of a closet where it won’t get crushed or bent. This will keep it from being exposed to dust, sunlight and moisture, as well as other potential dangers like pets or small children.


Handle the mortarboard carefully. Always grip it lightly by the edges whenever you’re picking it up or setting it down.
As soon as you receive your cap and gown, place them on a hanger to work out the wrinkles., As your cap gets moved around, the strands of the tassel may get hung up on one another. Run your fingers through the strands before putting on the cap to separate them and keep them looking neat and orderly.This should be done just before you put the cap on so you can walk down the aisle confident and tangle-free.
 There will probably be no need to clean your cap prior to graduation, but if for some reason you must, do it with a gentle steaming or ironing. Never put the cap through the washing machine, have it dry cleaned or allow it to get wet, as this can easily ruin the fabric or cause it to lose its shape.Brush loose dust and dirt from your cap and gown by hand rather than using an implement that may damage the material.
Don’t leave your cap sitting out where it may get something spilled on it.

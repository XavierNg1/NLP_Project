 You may have to do a bit of digging before finding a proxy that hasn’t already been blocked by your school. A web search for “web proxies” will lead to all sorts of options. If your school blocks sites that list proxies, use a network outside of your school to make a list of several web proxy sites to try. Proxy.org is a great site to find a current list of web proxies.


Using a web proxy will help you get around web filters but won’t affect your other apps. If you’re trying to use an app that your school has blocked, you’ll have better luck with a VPN.
Web proxies can be a bit slow, so be patient while things load.;
, In your browser, navigate to the web proxy and look for the box that asks for a URL or web address. It will be near the top of the screen. Enter the address of any site you’d like to visit.
 As long as you do your browsing through the web proxy website (not another tab or browser window), you’ll be able to access the sites blocked by your school.

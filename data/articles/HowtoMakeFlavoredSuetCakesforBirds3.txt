 Squares, circles, rectangle, stars... anything! Do bear in mind that the more complex the shape, the harder it may be to shape; for example, the stars may be a little more difficult to keep together.
 Feel free to make more than one, by the way. You only need to fill it about an inch (2.5cm) because this will be the thickness of the cake. You can pop it into the fridge overnight to harden it and make it more cake-like.

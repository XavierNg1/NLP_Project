 The Internet Crime Complaint Center, also known as IC3, is a special agency set up by the FBI, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) to investigate fraudulent online activities, including emails and websites. When filing a complaint on the IC3’s website, be prepared to provide the following:


A detailed report of the scam and your experience with it.
Your name and some basic contact information.
The name of the fraudulent party and any relevant contact information you may have.
 You can visit the BBB’s Scam Stopper website to file a complaint about a particular company or employer, and to check for any other similar complaints.
 If you think you’ve found a website that imitates another established website, or that pursues any other fraudulent activity in order to steal money or information from Internet users, you can report it.


You can report the site to Google using its “Report Phishing Page.”

 Fishing in cover such as weeds, submerged timber, or large rocks calls for heavier tackle than does fishing in open water with comparatively little cover. Clearer water also calls for lighter tackle than does dark water because light penetrates to a greater depth.

Heavy-tackle rods for plastic worm fishing typically run 5 1/2 to 6 feet (1.65 to 1.8 m), with a medium to heavy action. (Some anglers, however, favor rods as long as 7 feet/2.1 m.) They can be paired with a spinning, spincasting, or baitcasting reel with lines ranging as light as 8-pound test (4 kg class) to as heavy as 20-pound test (10 kg class).






Light-tackle rods for plastic worm fishing can run from 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) and feature a softer action than heavy-tackle rods. Typical fishing lines for light-tackle fishing run from 4-pound test (2 kg class) for ultralight fishing to 8-pound test (4 kg class) and are more likely to be fished with spinning or spincasting reels than baitcasting reels, as lighter lines are more likely to slip behind the spool of a baitcasting reel.






If you can afford it, buy a rod with a graphite blank instead of a fiberglass one. Graphite is more sensitive than fiberglass, providing you with a better feel of how your lure is performing and also better enabling you to detect when a fish takes the bait.

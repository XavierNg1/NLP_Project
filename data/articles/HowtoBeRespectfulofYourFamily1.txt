 You don't like it when someone demands you do something without asking nicely. In a family situation, it's easy to forget that, though and leave off the niceties. Try to always remember to say "please," "thank you," and "excuse me" when appropriate, even to family members., This step goes hand in hand with saying please and thank you. That is, nobody likes to be ordered around.It's important to pay attention to the tone you're using when talking to family members.


For instance, instead of demanding in a rude tone, "Get me some juice!" you could say, "Would you mind getting me some juice, please?"

, One way to be respectful and polite is to clean up after yourself. If you leave a mess for someone else to clean, that shows you don't respect his or her time. Put your toys and items away, and put away dirty clothes. Clean up after yourself in the bathroom, and do your share of chores in the house.

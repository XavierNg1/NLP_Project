 If possible, gather all the gentlemen you’re hoping will be your groomsmen and break the news in a celebratory manner. For instance, invite them over for a pot of your world-famous chili and a couple of hands of poker.Before they arrive, relabel a few bottles of beer with customized “Groomsman” labels and set them in each spot at the table with a koozie covering the label.
Once everyone sits down, propose a toast and have everyone remove the koozies simultaneously.
Verbalize your excitement by saying something like, "It'd really mean a lot to have you guys as my groomsmen."

, It's not everyday you get to buy your friends roses. If they'll appreciate the humor or are just into flowers, consider sending a bouquet with a card saying something like, "Alexander.... be my groomsman?" Even better, send the bouquet to their home or, if you know they'd be okay with it, to their place of work., If your potential groomsmen are all over the country and you’ll be sending out snail mail requests, consider going the April Fool’s route. For instance, write, “Notice of Mandatory Attendance” on a formal looking envelope. This may get them scratching their heads as they nervously open your request, only to be relieved by the exciting content.Another idea: Send a plain envelope that reads “Important Instructions” on the exterior. Inside, include directions on how to tie a tie, as well as your folded request.
Whatever you do, make sure the letter doesn’t look like spam. Hand-write their address. You don’t want them accidentally throwing it away!

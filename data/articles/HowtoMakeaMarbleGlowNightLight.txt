 You may need to give it a good scrubbing if the label leaves debris behind.


Make sure you allow ample dry time for the wine bottle before proceeding to the next steps.;
, You will want to drill a hole large enough to string lights through. Donâ€™t forget the protective gear before drilling/cutting the hole.


The hole will be located on the backside of the bottle so take that into consideration before making the cut.
 You can either apply glue directly to the bottle or add marbles or to the marbles and place on the glass.


Pack the marbles tightly on the bottle so you can barely see the glass bottle.






Allow marbles to dry before moving to the next step.
 Holding the first light, begin to thread the lights through the drilled hole toward the bottom and fill the bottle with lights.


Continue stringing lights until the bottle is filled. The plug should still be outside the bottle.

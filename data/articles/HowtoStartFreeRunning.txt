 During your first few months it is recommended that you condition your body every day and practice small techniques repetitively to build muscle coordination and confidence. Performing some form of Calisthenics & a bit of weight training goes a long way.;
, Do a quick search on freerunning in your country or state. If you train with an experienced free runner they should be able to guide you and give safety advice.
 This will mentally prepare your mind for when you go out and train. Think of the muscles you will be working. (This is known as muscle-mind connections.)

, Practice that vault 100 times, practice that wall-run 100 times, practice practice practice. That is the secret to success in freerunning - repetition and practice. You will not wake up one day and be able to jump 12 feet (3.7 m). But if you've been practicing your 6 feet (1.8 m) jump continuously you will find that in a few weeks a 7 feet (2.1 m) jump is within your reach. Soon 8 feet (2.4 m), and so on and so on.
 Safety is a huge priority in free running. Always check your surroundings, always listen to your body, and never attempt anything to "show off". Freerunning is following your own path - you do not need to please others and get yourself injured, it is about pushing yourself to be better than what you were before and learning how to move fluidly and gracefully.
 Getting injured isn't cool. What are you going to tell your mom then?

 As many balls go down the middle of the field, you need especially solid defense in that area, particularly your catcher, center fielder, your shortstop, and second baseman.The catcher is especially important. The catcher will help throw people out on base, catch balls to get people out at home, and even call pitches. Your catcher needs to be steady and consistent., If possible, study how the other team's players bat. For instance, maybe one player always pulls to the left or right. If so, you can compensate by shifting your players that direction, making it easier to field a hit., Certain pitches will lead to certain kinds of hits, such as ground balls. If you're pitcher is inclined to create a certain type of hit, you can adjust your defensive strategy to match., When balls come flying between two fielders, teach them to call who's going to get the ball so you don't have collisions.
 For instance, set all of the players in the outfield, and use a ball thrower at home plate. Designate base runners, then play out different scenarios to help your players prepare for games.

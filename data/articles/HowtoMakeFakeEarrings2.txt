 They can be pretty beads, buttons, or even rhinestones. Choose something that is about the size of your earlobe and not too heavy.


If you are using coat buttons or stud earrings, snip the prong or loop off using a pair of wire cutters. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.
 Make sure that the magnets are all the same size, and just a little bit smaller than your jewelry pieces. Try to use magnets made specifically for earrings; you can find them in the beading section of an art store. If you can't find them, any small, round magnets will work. Regular black magnets will be the least painful to wear, but they won't be very strong. Silver, "rare earth" magnets will be stronger, but they may also more painful for some people.


If you have sensitive ears, do not use the silver-colored, "rare earth" magnets. They are too strong, and can pinch your ears., Set the other magnets aside for later.
 Position them so that you can't see the magnet sticking out from underneath. Because the magnets are round, it doesn't matter if you glue your item upside down or right side up.
 This should not take more than a few minutes, but you may want to refer to the glue bottle for specific drying times. Make sure that you keep the magnets far enough apart so that they don't attract each other and stick.
 Pick up an earring, and hold it against the front of your earlobe. Pick up one of the plain magnets and hold it behind your earlobe. If the magnets don't stick, flip the plain magnet around. Once the magnets stick, let go and put the other earring on.


Check your earrings in the mirror, and make sure that they are facing the same direction before showing them off.

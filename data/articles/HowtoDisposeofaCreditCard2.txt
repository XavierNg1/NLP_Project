 You can dispose of your card more safely by throwing away the various pieces of it separately. You don’t need to put each fragment in a separate trash bag, but don’t put them all in the same one. If you spread the card fragments around a few different bags, it would take an awful lot of work to recover all the pieces.If you are throwing away any related documentation, such as account statements or receipts, don’t put these in the same bag as any card fragments., If you are closing an account, you may want to destroy documentation related to it. This includes statements or receipts which include personal information about you and your account. Use a cross-shredder if you have access to one. This is the most thorough way to destroy papers.You can then recycle the shredded paper, but remember that recycling is no safer than the ordinary trash.
Be sure to shred papers before putting them into recycling., If you want to be completely sure that your card and all the related documentation is completely destroyed, you can always incinerate it yourself. It is generally not advisable to burn the card itself, as the materials it is made from may contain harmful substances which will be released when burns.Burning papers and bills is a way to guarantee that nobody will be able to read them.

 Not all meshes come with shooting strings built in. If that is the case, you'll need to lace your own. You can use nylon shoelaces. Thicker is better.
 Loop the shooting string through the mesh near one sidewall, with one end in front, and one end in back.


Pull the strings so that they are even.
 Push the back string through the mesh to the front, and then the front string to the back.


Repeat the weaving process across the basket. When you reach the other side, slip the string through the sidewall, and tie a knot to secure it.
Add 2 more, and you're good to go!

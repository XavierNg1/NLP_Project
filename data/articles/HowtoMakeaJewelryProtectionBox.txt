 First draw three squares, measuring 3" x 3", (7.62cm x 7.62cm). Go to the middle square, and draw two other squares off of it, measuring the same. You should now have five squares, all the same size.;
, Make sure you don't cut too close, and that you don't cut too far. Missing the edge by too far can alter the measurements, and could affect your project. If you mess up, remember: there's another three cereal box sides.
 Simply use a permanent marker to trace the outline on the fabric of your choice. Then cut the outline out. Keep the fabric nearby, because you'll need it again soon.
 Fold each square so it sticks up, and fold the side with two squares up twice. The second square will be the top of the square.
 Make sure you don't tape the top down, and that you put the tape on the inside, not the outside. The box shouldn't come apart now.
 Before it dries, press on the fabric you cut out. It should fit evenly, if you traced correctly. It is best to take this one square at a time. Give it about fifteen minutes to dry and cool off.
 They don't need to be large, but they should be made at an angle. You can cut it with a special incision maker, or with the edge of your scissors. Make sure it's a clean cut.
 The chain should be wedged in the two incisions. The top of the jewelry should be on the top of the foam, and the bottom should be hanging down the side.
 Make sure the jewelry is on the top of the foam, and is visible when lifting the top. You're done!

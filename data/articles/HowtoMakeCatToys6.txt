 Basically, cats like anything that moves, so bubbles are a great way to have fun with your cat. Children love bubbles too, so this can be great entertainment for both cats and children at once.
 Put your hand under a blanket and move it randomly. Your cat will attack your hand! This can also work for putting your legs under a blanket at night when cozying up on the couch, so be careful!

, This provides hours of free entertainment because cats love to interact with themselves in a mirror. Kitty might become interested or frightened with her reflection. Not all cats will react to a mirror but if your cat does, watch the fun unfold!

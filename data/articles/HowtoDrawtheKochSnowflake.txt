 You can draw it with a compass or protractor, or just eyeball it if you don't want to spend too much time drawing the snowflake.


It's best if the length of the sides are divisible by 3, because of the nature of this fractal. This will become clear in the next few steps.;
, This is why it is handy to have the sides divisible by three.
 Measure the length of the middle third to know the length of the sides of these new triangles.
 You can see the 2nd generation of triangles covers a bit of the first. These three line segments shouldn't be parted in three.



Note how you draw each next generation of parts that are one 3rd of the mast one.
 It will become harder and harder to accurately draw the new triangles, but with a fine pencil and lots of patience you can reach the 8th iteration. The one shown in the picture is a Koch snowflake of the 4th iteration.
 You can colour it, cut it out, draw more triangles on the inside, or just leave it the way it is.

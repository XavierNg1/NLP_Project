If you only have a mobile phone, you can also call your wireless provider to see the rates on international calls. In general, calling internationally on a cell phone is more expensive than land line calling, because you cannot use a calling card.
If you have a smart phone and you have Internet access, you can use your smart phone to download an application that will allow you to make calls more cheaply. Try the Google Voice calling method below on your smart phone.
 If you do not see a country code, use a search engine to find the international calling code for that country.
 Type a 1 to indicate you are dialing internationally. On some landlines in hotels, you will need to dial a different number before dialing 1 to call outside of the hotel.
Dial the international country code next. For example, to call the United Kingdom from the US, you would dial 1 and then 44.
Dial the regional number. This is the start of the longer set of numbers. In the United States, we would call it an "area code," but it can be longer or shorter than a 3 digit number in other countries.
Dial the local number. These are the last digits in your number. Wait to hear the sound of ringing on the other end.

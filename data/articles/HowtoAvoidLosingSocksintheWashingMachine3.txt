 As soon as you recognize that one of your socks isn’t in a pair, put it in a small basket on top of the dryer, designated for unmatched socks. Hopefully your single sock will be reunited with its match after the next cycle., Reach inside the washer and dryer and run your hands along the bottom, corners, and crevices after each use. Once in a while, you’re sure to find some strays left behind., Count your socks before and after each load to make sure you’ve got everything you started with, and retrace your steps after you’ve carried the load away from the dryer to make sure you didn’t drop anything while transporting your clothes.

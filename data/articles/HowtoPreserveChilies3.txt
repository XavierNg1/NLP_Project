 Discard any damaged chilies, since they won't keep well in the freezer., If you have small peppers that you'd like to freeze whole, you can simply put them in a freezer bag. Use a straw to suck out the excess air, then seal and label the bag before placing it in the freezer.


Pack the bag as tightly as possible, so there's little extra air in the bag. Air will make the peppers spoil faster.
Freeze for several months. When you want to use the peppers, simply leave them out to thaw or blanch them in boiling water for a few seconds.
 Bigger peppers can be sliced into strips or chunks you can easily use in a recipe later on. Slice them lengthwise or into chunks and remove the seeds.


Lay the pieces on a baking sheet and freeze them for an hour. This is called flash freezing.
Put the pieces in a storage bag and remove the extra air.
Store in the freezer for up to several months.

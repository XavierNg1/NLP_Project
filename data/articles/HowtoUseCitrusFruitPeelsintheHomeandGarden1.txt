There are many types of citrus, including orange, mandarin, kumquat, grapefruit, lemon, lime, pomelo, citron (citrus apple), tangerines, etc.


Always wash the peel extremely well before use. If possible, prefer organic sources rather than those which have been sprayed, especially for any food or internal use. If you can't get organic fruit, use a very good fruit and vegetable scrub to remove chemical traces.
See "Warnings" below for the possibility of dermatitis and allergic reactions to citrus peel.;

Use the peel of a kumquat to make marmalade. Just cook the chopped peel with sugar-water until it's like a syrup â€” use your favorite marmalade recipe.

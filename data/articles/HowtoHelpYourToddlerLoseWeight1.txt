 Most toddlers will eat a variety of fruits, so try incorporating them into the daily diet as breakfast and snacks. Use vegetables in every lunch and dinner, and set a good example for your child by eating vegetables yourself as well.;
, Children should have regular sources of lean protein, such as yogurt, fish, chicken, and some whole grains. Work within your child’s preferences but make it clear that protein is an important part of mealtime.
 Toddlers need fresh, healthful food to achieve and maintain an appropriate weight.


If your child often eats take-out or packaged foods packed with fat, salt, sugar, and other non-nutritive ingredients, swap them out for carrot sticks, applesauce, strawberry slices, string cheese, and Cheerios.
 Toddlers need about half the calories of adults, so size portions accordingly. Try dividing the plate into segments: 1/2 vegetables and/or fruits, 1/4 whole grains, and 1/4 lean protein.
 Many toddlers love to drink fruit juices, but these are often loaded with calories and limited in nutritional value.


If your child drinks a lot of fruit juice (or any other sweetened drink), swap it out for milk or water. Juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks can add hundreds of calories to your toddler’s diet each day.
Do not give your toddler drinks that serve as dietary supplements, such as PediaSure. These drinks are formulated for children with difficulty gaining weight or with restrictive diets. If your child eats well and is overweight, avoid high-calorie toddler drinks of this nature.

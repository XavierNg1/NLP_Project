 It will run in a continuous ridge around the model and is usually easy to find. In addition to the mold line, there will usually be metal tags known as "flash", also from the casting process, which can be found as small bumps or long tags particularly on the extremities of the miniature. If you cut the model from a metal sprue, (a metal frame which metal models can be attached to for easier shipping), then you may also want to locate the areas on the model where you clipped it from. Sprue is created by the molding process, which filled the injection channels into the mold space.;
, For the clippers, wire cutters are not suitable as they will not give you as clean a cut, or as precise, as you will need. Suitable model clippers are available from most hobby or model stores. A range of metal files is also recommended as different parts of the model may benefit from a different shape. Additionally, you may wish to use a magnifying glass to better see the model. A dust mask should also be worn if the area you are working in is windy as the metal dust may get disturbed.
 Be careful not to clip off actual parts of the model. There are usually a few metal tags on every model in addition to the mold line.
 Only do this after all metal tags have been removed, as it makes it easier to handle the model.
 Do not keep the file in one place for too long. Move it along and through the mold line until it has been removed.
 Some parts of the model may be more delicate than others, so take care and adjust the pressure you are placing on the file. Remember, the mold line goes the whole way around the model and links back up to where you started, so the mold line will only be removed when you reach the part of the model where you began the process.
 The miniature or model is now ready for painting or preparing as needed.

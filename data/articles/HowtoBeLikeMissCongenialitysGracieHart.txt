 Take self-defence classes so you can beat up even the beefiest of men if you need to. Remember Gracie's SING self-defence (kicking your assailant in the solar plexus, instep, nose and groin).;
, Gracie does lots of exercise for her job, and it pays off. Try to go jogging or go to the gym every day.
 Read up on the news, and be observant.
 Be happy to hang out in your baggiest of clothes and have a laugh with the guys.
 Gracie always eats whatever she wants, whenever she wants. That's not to say you should pig out on junk food all the time, but make sure you get at least three healthy meals a day.
 Gracie is friendly to everyone she meets, and ends up with many friends at the end of the films as she is kind and caring and genuinely values her relationships with others.
 Gracie risks her life to save others, as she is a kind and selfless person.
 Gracie always wears clothes that cover her body, and when she had to enter the swimsuit competition, she didn't enjoy it! Make sure your clothes cover up everything they should.
 In Miss Congeniality, Gracie learnt to value her appearance, but then learnt the hard way in the sequel that caring too much about how she looked could be a bad thing. Embrace your natural beauty, and just use a little makeup to accentuate it if you want.
 This is the most important part of Gracie's character - she doesn't care what other people think - she's just happy being herself. Love yourself for who you are, and surround yourself with people who love you for you.

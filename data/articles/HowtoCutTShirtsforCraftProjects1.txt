 You can buy a new t-shirt, use an old shirt or buy t-shirts at the thrift store.;
,,,, Your t-shirt will now look like a tank top.
 Gather the bottom of the shirt with your hands.


It can be bunched up, but the ends of the shirt should be even with each other.
 Use a ribbon, strong twine or another strip of t-shirt material.


If you would rather sew the bottom of the bag, align the bottom edges when the t-shirt is inside out. Sew the 2 sides together. You can also use a ruffling foot to gather the 2 sides of the t-shirt together.
 Double and triple knot it when you are assured it is tight enough that nothing can fall out.
 Now it will appear gathered at the ends.
 Glue the ends together with super glue.


You can use leather from an old belt or faux leather trim from the fabric store.
 Place items in the bag.

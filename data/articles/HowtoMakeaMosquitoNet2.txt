 It is very important that any stitching used interlocks the join between the pieces, so that mosquitoes cannot get through any gaps., The pieces should be as follows:

4 x 48” (1.2 metres) (legs)
2 x 55” (1.4 metres) (frame widths)
2 x 75” (1.9 metres) (frame lengths).
 Use 2-inch (0.78") nails to nail together the pieces of wood., Use 2-inch (0.78") nails again to attach the legs at each corner of the frame., It must surround the bed completely., Adjust it to ensure that it is sitting evenly over the frame and that there is equal drape of the netting on each side. The mesh sheet should be well centered.

Ensure slack so that the sheet drapes onto and a little across the floor, forming a barrier that prevents mosquito entry from under the bed. About 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.4cm) of the mesh sheet must touch the floor, each side.
 Nail through a plastic/rubber washer or bottle cap to stop the sheet from tearing on the nails. Use a one-inch nail for each leg., To use the mosquito net, lift up a sheet on either side of the bed and get into bed. Drop the sheet back to the floor so that it sits completely on the floor with no gaps. Sleep tight.

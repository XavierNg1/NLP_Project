 Bottle fed toddlers may be crankier and cry more often than breastfed ones because there is no natural way for bottle fed babies to self soothe. If this is the case with your child, consider giving your child something to soothe himself with during or after bottle feeding.


Soothing items can include something to suck on, like a pacifier, or something soft, like a blanket or stuffed animal.
 Dealing with a screaming toddler can be very frustrating and stressful. Try to remember that your toddler is also going through a stressful time; his body hurts, he’s tired all the time, and he doesn’t understand what’s happening to his body. To help your toddler cope, try to remain calm and collected when you are around him.


If you show your frustration to your child, he can feed off of your emotions and become crabbier or more upset.
Stay calm and think about some activities that you can do together instead. When you are feeling like screaming yourself, begin playing with your toddler, singing to him, or reading a book. You could also go outside and let him run around in an attempt to burn off some energy.
 Crankiness goes hand-in-hand with growth spurts. While your child’s crankiness may seem endless and harrowing, your child will quiet down once the growth spurt is over. During the growth spurt, try to reassure your child that everything is ok, and that you are there to comfort him. This may help to ease his crankiness a bit.


Cuddle, hug and show affection towards your child during this time. Playing with your child and taking him outside may help to distract him from his crankiness.

 While there is no way to prevent friends from tagging you on their Timelines, you can manage tags on your own Timeline. Click the down arrow icon in the upper-right corner of the Facebook page and select "Settings".
 This can be found in the menu on the left side of the Settings page, beneath the "Privacy" option.
 Find the section titled "How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions?" and click the "Edit" link next to "Review tags people add to your own posts before the tags appear on Facebook." This will expand the option.
 Click the drop-down menu that says "Disabled" and select the "Enabled" option. You will now be prompted to review any tags that people add of you before they appear.

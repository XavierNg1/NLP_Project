 Whether you need to get up for work or just want to sit down to a nice breakfast with your family in the morning, identifying your reasons for getting up on time can help motivate you to wake up when your alarm clock rings. Take a few minutes before you go to bed to write down your reasons and keep them somewhere immediately visible to you when you wake up. , If you can easily hit snooze in the morning, you will be less likely to get up on time. Set your alarm clock somewhere that you cannot reach it without getting out of bed, like on top of a dresser. , There are all kinds of interesting alarm clocks available that make it more difficult to stay in bed past your wake up time. From blender alarm clocks, to alarm clocks that run away from you, to alarm clock puzzles, to talking alarm clocks, there are plenty of non-traditional alarm clocks to help you get out of bed in the morning.
 Go to bed 30 minutes earlier than you normally would when you need to wake up early. Make sure that you will have enough time to get your recommended amount of sleep. Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep per night, teens need 9-10, and children need 10 or more. , Hitting snooze will not make waking up any easier. In fact, hitting snooze will make you feel groggier and may set the tone for a less productive day overall. Instead, try to get up after the first time your alarm rings. , Although hitting the snooze button has been shown to reduce your overall daily productivity and does not provide you with good quality rest, just in case you do end up hitting the snooze button once or twice, you are better off leaving yourself a little extra time.

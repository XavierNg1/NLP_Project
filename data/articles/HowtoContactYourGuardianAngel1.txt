 There is a wealth of knowledge in websites online and in books at your local library. Even though many religions believe in guardian angels, they hold very different opinions about their nature.


While most faiths think that angels are a separate kind of being different from humans,others believe that people become angels after they die.Catholics believe that every person is assigned a guardian angel.Muslims think that every believer has two guardian angels, one to go in front and one behind.There are many conflicting views of guardian angels in Judaism. Some scholars assert that people do not have individual guardian angels but that God may send one or many angels to a person at a time of need.Others believe that every mitzvah a person does creates an angel companion.Still others say that an angel called Lailah watches over a person from conception to death.;
, If you're very young and not sure which religion your family belongs to, ask your parents for help. Ask them what they believe. Tell them about your attempts at contacting your guardian angel and make sure that they are fine with you doing that.
 Ask your parents if they will help you meet with a local religious leader to ask him or her about guardian angels. If you're old enough, you can go on your own. If you don't have a regular place of worship, you can try contacting local ones that interest you. Most religious organizations are happy to educate people about their faith when asked, even if you don't believe the same things.

 The secondary source is the work using the quote that you want, known as the indirect quote. If you are going to include some of the secondary source’s writing, choose the most important segment that makes a dynamic comment about the indirect quote.;
, Before quoting the secondary source’s passage, introduce the author.


For example, write: According to Hoffman…

, Indicate the secondary source using double quotation marks.
 Within in the secondary source’s passage, there will be quotation marks that indicate the quoted portion. Use single quotation marks to identify this portion.


For example: According to Hoffman, “Roberts indicates that ‘new research confirms past theories,’ but he fails to point out that new research does not measure the same indicators.”

, Add a citation for the secondary source after the author’s last name.


If you’re using the American Psychological Association (APA) citation style, include the source publication year after the author’s name. Add the page number at the end of the quote. For example: According to Hoffman (2010), “Roberts indicates that ‘new research confirms past theories,’ but he fails to point out that new research does not measure the same indicators” (p. 103).
If you’re using the Modern Language Association (MLA) citation style, add the page number after the author’s name. For example: According to Hoffman (103), “Roberts indicates that ‘new research confirms past theories,’ but he fails to point out that new research does not measure the same indicators.”

, A works cited list is a list that appears at the end of your paper. This list will contain every source for which you’ve included parenthetical citations in the body of your paper. In the case of using an indirect quote, only list the secondary source on your works cited list.


For APA style, write: Hoffman, S. (2010). Book title. City of publication: Publisher.
For MLA style, write: Hoffman, Samuel. Book Title. City of publication: Publisher, 2010.

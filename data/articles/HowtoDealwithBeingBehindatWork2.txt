 Choose a few projects that can be completed by someone else and really don’t require your special attention. It is best if these are jobs that are fairly straightforward and don’t require a ton of explanation. Then, approach a coworker or employee and ask for their help.Only approach those people whose work you actually trust. The quality of their final product could reflect poorly or positively on you, so consider that when making your choice.
Offer a type of work exchange. You could say, “If you can finish these jobs up for me, I’d be happy to return the favor when I catch up on everything.”
Keep in mind that delegating can be a great way to give other employees opportunities to complete work and gain experience that they may not have access to otherwise. It can be a win-win situation for everyone.
 If you are struggling with a particular project, find a coworker who you respect and talk with them about your issues. Having these types of conversations will not make you seem lazy or incapable. Instead, it will build camaraderie with your colleagues and you might even get some good tips out of the talk, too.For example, you might say, “I’ve been working on this project for a few days and can’t quite wrap my head around this final part. Do you mind if I run it by you to see what you think?”

, While some deadlines are strict, others are more flexible. If you are feeling overwhelmed, assess which projects’ deadlines can be moved. Then, ask your boss if you can have an extension. Extending some deadlines may relieve some of your stress and allow you to complete your more urgent projects.When asking your boss for an extension give them as much advance notice as you can. Briefly explain why you need the extension and offer to submit portions of the project that are already done.

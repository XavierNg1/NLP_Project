 If you notice a stain on your felt hat, use a gum eraser or clean makeup sponge to remove it. Gently dab the stain (or smudge) to try to remove it. Alternatively, purchase a dry cleaning sponge from a hardware store (designed to absorb dust, dirt, and soot) to remove stains., If you notice a grease stain on your hat, sprinkle some corn starch directly onto it (approximately 0.5 tbsp - 0.25 oz). Rub it into the stain gently. After 5-10 minutes, brush it away to see if it has absorbed the stain., Use a cloth dampened with fabric stain remover to wipe stains. For a gentle stain remover, purchase Woolite fabric stain remover. After treating stains, rinse the cloth and re-wipe stains to remove stain remover from the hat.

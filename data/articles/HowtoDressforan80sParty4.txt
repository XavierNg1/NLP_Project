 Fingerless gloves were very popular, especially when paired with a more punk look with denim and lace.Lace gloves are preferable, but any gloves will work.
 The earrings do not have to match each other. Wearing two different large earrings—for a man or a woman—was quite popular.If they are a bright color that either matches or contrasts your outfit, even better! If no chunky colorful or feather earrings are available, gold hoop earrings will work.
 Repeat. Layering on many different chunky necklaces will help create a punk 80s look. Thick chains or beads were popular, and the inclusion of a crucifix was common as well. The more necklaces, the better. You may also want to layer on several different types of bangle and chunky bracelets in contrasting metals.
 Large sunglasses with plastic rims were very popular in the decade, even indoors or at night. Cheap children’s sunglasses with bright earpieces are very similar to popular 80s sunglasses. Gold-rimmed glasses were also popular and can often be found at party stores., Classic 80s makeup included dark lipstick (for women and for punk men!) and very bright eye shadow.The eye shadow can be applied over the entire lid of the eye, to the eyebrows. Some 80s celebrities experimented with multiple eye shadow colors at one time, making two to three blocks of color.
 A wide sweatband over your hair (preferably over a mullet) will give you an 80s look. This accessory works best with the 80s workout attire: either a matching velour sweatsuit or leotard/tights/legwarmer combination.

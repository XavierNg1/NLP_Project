 Fertilizer that comes in granular form is easy to sprinkle around the lawn and garden. Since you don't have to work it directly into the soil, it has to be reapplied every few months. To help the fertilizer last longer, use a garden rake to sift it into the soil in your garden beds.


Commercial fertilizers are labeled with an N-P-K ratio noting the level of each substance they contain. If you're just fertilizing grass, choose a fertilizer that is particularly high in nitrogen, since that's the nutrient that helps plants grow lush and green. If you're fertilizing flowering plants or bulbs, choose a fertilizer high in phosphorus, since it helps flowers bloom.For a vibrant lawn, use granular fertilizer just after planting new grass seed. You can sprinkle it by hand or use a dispensing tool to spread it evenly across your yard.
Controlled release granular fertilizer can be useful if you have a large lawn that you don't want to worry about fertilizing more than about twice a year. The granules are designed to release fertilizer slowly and gradually.;
, Fertilizers that come in spray or pour bottles are convenient for all potted plants.


Pour or inject the recommended amount around the roots of the plants. The plants will absorb it immediately and you should see the results within a few days.
Too much liquid fertilizer can be harmful to plants, so don't use more than the amount recommended on the bottle.

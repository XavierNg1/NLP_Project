 Mix ½ cup (117 milliliters) white distilled vinegar or a specialized cleaning vinegar with one gallon (3.7 liters) of warm water. Fill your mop bucket with this solution and mop the floor with it.








If you don’t have vinegar, you can substitute rubbing alcohol.
 If mopping has not adequately cleaned your ceramic tile, mix warm water with an equal amount of scouring powder. Scouring powder is a cleaning agent designed to help you clean hard surfaces like ceramic tile. Smear the mixture onto the stain using a dish cloth. Let the mixture sit on the stain for five to 10 minutes. Remove the dish cloth and use a soft brush to scrub the tile. Finally, rinse the area with a damp dish cloth.








Repeat the process if the stain remains after one scouring session.
 If the ceramic tile you wish to clean is on your floor, you could use a steam cleaner to remove serious stains. A steam cleaner works much like a vacuum cleaner does. Simply fill the water tank and turn the machine on. Roll the steam cleaner over the portion of ceramic tile you wish to clean.You can rent steam cleaners from many hardware or home repair stores.
 Muriatic acid is a corrosive mineral acid. Mix the muriatic acid in a solution with one part acid and five parts water. For instance, you might mix one tablespoon acid with five tablespoons water. Apply the solution to ceramic tile you wish to clean. Scrub the area vigorously with a soft bristled brush or old toothbrush. Wet a paper towel and use it to wipe the area after scrubbing.








Dry the area with a dry paper towel or dish cloth.
When using muriatic acid, wear a face mask and thick rubber gloves. Take care not to get it on your skin.

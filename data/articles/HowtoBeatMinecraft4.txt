 Each stronghold has exactly one End Portal. This is what you will use to get to The End.
 You activate the portal by filling the "frame" with Eyes of Ender. To do this, equip the eye, then use an empty block on the frame. Repeat this until all twelve blocks contain eyes.
 This will take you to The End.


You will not be harmed by the lava under the portal when you are jumping into an activated portal, but if it is not activated you will likely burn to death and lose all your equipment!

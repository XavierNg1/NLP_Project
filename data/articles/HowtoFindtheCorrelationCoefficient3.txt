 Using a handheld graphing calculator, enter your calculator’s statistics function and then select the “Edit” command.Each calculator will have slightly different key commands. This article will give the specific instructions for the Texas Instruments TI-86.

Enter the Stat function by pressing -Stat (above the + key), then hit F2-Edit.
 Most calculators will keep statistical data until cleared. To make sure that you do not confuse old data with new data, you should first clear any previously stored information.Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to highlight the heading “xStat.” Then press Clear and Enter. This should clear all values in the xStat column.

Use the arrow keys to highlight the yStat heading. Press Clear and Enter to empty the data from that column as well.
 Using the arrow keys, move the cursor to the first space under the xStat heading. Type in your first data value and then hit Enter. You should see the space at the bottom of the screen display “xStat(1)=__,” with your value filling the blank space. When you hit Enter, the data will fill the table, the cursor will move to the next line, and the line at the bottom of the screen should now read “xStat(2)=__.”Continue entering all the x-data values.

When you complete the x-data, use the arrow keys to move to the yStat column and enter the y-data values.

After all the data has been entered, hit Exit to clear the screen and leave the Stat menu.
 The correlation coefficient is a measure of how well the data approximates a straight line. A statistical graphing calculator can very quickly calculate the best-fit line and the correlation coefficient.Enter the Stat function and then hit the Calc button. On the TI-86, this is .

Choose the Linear Regression calculations. On the TI-86, this is , which is labeled “LinR.” The graphic screen should then display the line “LinR _,” with a blinking cursor. 

You now need to enter the names of the two variables that you want to calculate. These are xStat and yStat.

On the TI-86, select the Names list by hitting . 

The bottom line of your screen should now show the available variables. Choose (this is probably button F1 or F2), then enter a comma, then .

Hit Enter to calculate the data.
 When you hit Enter, the calculator will instantly calculate the following information for the data that you entered:y=a+bx{\displaystyle y=a+bx} : This is the general formula for a straight line. However, instead of the familiar “y=mx+b,” this is presented in reverse order.


a={\displaystyle a=}. This is the value of the y-intercept of the best-fit line.


b={\displaystyle b=}. This is the slope of the best-fit line.


corr={\displaystyle {\text{corr}}=}. This is the correlation coefficient. 


n={\displaystyle n=}. This is the number of data pairs that were used in the calculation.

Reefing points are 1, 2 or 3 horizontal rows of cringles (reinforced grommets) and reefing lines (attached ties) on the mainsail. From the foot of the sail up, each row of reefing points shortens the sail a little more.



This system runs a special set of lines through the reefing points, so you can reef the sail by tightening just one line.



Boats with roller reefing have gears that allow you to shorten the mainsail by turning a crank that furls the sail around the boom or the mast.



Larger boats, and those used in racing, may be equipped with automated reefing systems. These are essentially push-button versions of roller reefing systems. In the most sophisticated systems, the boom or mast may have a specially constructed hollow into which the mainsail is furled.

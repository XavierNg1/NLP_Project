 If you do not have a light box, you can use any transparent surface with a bright light behind it. You can try a window, glass table or clear plate with a flashlight or bright light behind it. The objective is to be able to see the outline of your stencil through the paper.






;
, The light from the lightbox will shine through the stencil so that you are able to trace around it with ease. To keep the cardstock stationary as you work, tape the stencil to the front of the cardstock or tape it to the lightbox.
 You do not need to press over all the open area, as pressing along the edges will create the embossing.









With the embossing stylus pen, trace the edges of the shape that are lit by the lightbox. The fine point of the stylus is ideal for small areas, while the larger side is great for large areas.Using the embossing tool to trace around the stencilâ€™s edges will cause the paper to stretch and subsequently achieve the raised, embossed effect.

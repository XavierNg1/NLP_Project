 This is an easy method to create nude Sims.
 Use the boolprop cheat. Hold the "Shift" key and click on a Sim. Choose "Spawn" and click on "Sim Modder". Turn them into an adult. Repeat this for the other teen you want to get married. Then get them to fall in love and get married (you can do this quickly by shift-clicking the mailbox, clicking "set pregnancy relationships with" and clicking on the desired Sim's name). Then use the Sim Modder to turn them back into a teenager or a kid or a toddler, and they will still be married.
 Drag the lifetime and daily relationship meter up to 100 on 2 different Sims. Drag the outgoing meter up to 10 and click try on clothing at a clothing store. Have the Sim choose "woohoo" and have them go in the changing room with the other Sim.

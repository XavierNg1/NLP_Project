 To do this, click on the "Finder" icon in the dock.
 After clicking on your hard drive (most likely called "Macintosh HD"), double-click on the "Library" folder to open it. Then, double-click on the "PreferencePanes" (not "Preferences") folder. All third-party System Preference items should be stored in this folder; they will have a ".prefpane" file extension.


Make sure you are in the computer Library, not your User Library. To find out which you are in, right-click any folder in the Library and choose "Get Info." Under General>Where, it should say "/Library." If it says "/Users/(your username)/Library," you are in your user library.
 After locating the unwanted item in the folder, click on it and drag it to the "Trash" icon in the dock to delete it. This will remove it permanently from the System Preferences menu.

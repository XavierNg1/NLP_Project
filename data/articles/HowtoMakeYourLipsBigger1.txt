 Lip-plumping products come in many forms: glosses, balms, sticks, gels, and pots. Applying these to your lips can temporarily make your lips look fuller, often by irritating them.The plumping effect will only last for a couple of hours, but you can renew it by reapplying the product to your lips.
Note that the effects won’t be as drastic as those achieved through cosmetic surgery.;
, Ingredients like cinnamon, ginger mint, wintergreen, and capsicum will boost blood flow to your lips, causing them to redden and swell — i.e., to look fuller., If you wish to combine your lip-plumping product with a lipstick or gloss, apply the plumper to your lips first for maximum effectiveness.
 Dermatologists recommend against overusing lip-plumping products, as these may cause your lips to become dry and scaly.Try to save the lip plumpers for special occasions.
 If you want more from your lip-plumping products, consider trying a treatment plumper. Manufacturers claim that treatment plumpers can stimulate your lips into producing more collagen and elastin, making your lips fuller for a longer period of time.


Treatment plumpers are available for purchase online and in person at shops that carry beauty products.They may be more expensive than traditional plumpers.
Common ingredients in treatment plumpers include peptides, marine collagen, and human growth factors.

 You should regularly monitor your credit and banking accounts. Go through your monthly statements and check for any purchases or withdrawals that you did not authorize. If you want, you could sign up for online access to your accounts. In this way, you could check with greater frequency.


If you notice a purchase made that you didn’t authorize, then contact your bank or credit card company quickly. You have only a limited amount of time. For example, you must report an unauthorized purchase within 60 days of the date the statement on which the charge appears is mailed to you.You also have only 60 days to report an unauthorized debit charge.See Dispute a Debit Charge and Dispute a Credit Card Charge for more information on disputing unauthorized charges.
 If an unauthorized purchase is made on your credit cards or debit cards, then you should cancel them and request new cards. Also create new PINs for your cards as soon as you receive them.
 If your passwords were stolen, you should immediately change them. You should change passwords for any website that contains financial or sensitive personal information, such as bank accounts, credit card accounts, or retail sites.You can also change your passwords to social media accounts, although you might not have to do it immediately.
Make sure that the new password is strong. A strong password should have a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols. Also use both upper-case and lower-case letters, which will make your password harder to guess.For example, “$WiK4!w” is harder to guess than “wikihow.”

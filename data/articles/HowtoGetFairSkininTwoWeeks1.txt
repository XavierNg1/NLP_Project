 The vitamin C in oranges is essential for healthy skin. It is also a great bleaching agent due to citric acid. Mix two tablespoons of orange juice and half a teaspoon of turmeric powder together. Apply the balm to the darkened areas, or all over your face, if you like. Leave it on overnight and rinse it off with water the next morning.


Use this every day for the best results. Make sure that you completely cover the areas you want to lighten.
Keep in mind that turmeric has a staining effect, so your skin might appear orange or tan after using this mixture, which is probably the opposite of the effect you're going for. Don't worry, once that effect fades, your skin will be subtly fairer because of the fruit acids and turmeric.;
, This makes a mask that you can use to lighten the skin of your face over-all. You'll first need to dry out an orange peel. Then, grind the peel into a fine powder and mix it with plain yogurt. Smooth the results over your face and leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Wash it off with water afterward. Repeat this two or three times per week.


The lactic acid in yogurt and the citric acid in the orange peel are natural bleaches.
 Apply the mixture to your skin and leave it on for about 10 of 15 minutes, then rinse it off in cold water. Use this mask every other day.

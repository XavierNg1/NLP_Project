When you pump gas for your car, always use a wet wipe to clean your hands when you get back in your car.

Flush the toilet with your foot, not your hand. Cover the flush in your dirty shoe germs for the next less paranoid, normal person.
If there are no seat covers in a bathroom, cover the seat with toilet paper. Hover over rather than sit on the seat and give yourself a bladder infection from not emptying it properly.
Use the paper towel that you just used to dry your hands, to turn off the faucet, and also to open the door.
 Thousands of people have touched that same shopping cart and you never know where their hands have been.
 Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold). Apply soap, lather well, and rub your hands for at least 30 seconds. Rinse well, and dry your hands with a clean or disposable towel or air dryer.If you are not able to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol., Germs cannot penetrate skin, but they get into your body through open wounds, your mouth, eyes, nose, ears, and other body openings. If you do not allow contaminated items, food or otherwise, to come into contact with these parts of your body, germs cannot harm you.

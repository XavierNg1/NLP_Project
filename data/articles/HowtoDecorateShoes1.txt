 To decorate shoes with paint you'll need to use canvas tennis shoes. You can buy canvas shoes in white, black, and many other colors at department or drug stores. Get a few pairs to try out different designs, or just stick with one pair for your masterpiece.


You can choose canvas shoes with or without laces - both will work just fine.
Paint an old pair of canvas tennis shoes if you don't want to buy a brand new pair. Painting shoes is a great way to bring new life to shoes you've already worn.;
, Fabric paint is designed to adhere to the type of fabric that is used to make canvas shoes, and in many cases it is even waterproof. Using fabric paint will help your designs last through a lot of wear. Go to an art supply store and choose paint in as many colors as you want.
 Draw draw your design on a piece of paper before you get started. Plan what to paint on the tops of the shoes, the heels, and the sides. Decide whether to make both shoes the same or do something different with each one.Here are a few ideas:


Choose a pattern and a background color. For example, you could paint the shoes with a star pattern against a purple background.
Do two-tone shoes. Make the toes and heels one color and the middle of the shoes a contrasting color.
Make one interesting shape. Paint a pair of lips or a watermelon slice on the front of the shoes.
Make a silly design. Paint a banana on one shoe and a monkey face on the other, or paint one shoe to look like an alligator foot and the other too look like a bear paw.
 Outline your design first, so that it will be easier to paint it neatly. If your drawing doesn't look right, you can just erase it and try again.
 Pour the different colors of paint into separate containers. Use a small paintbrush to apply the first color. Rinse the brush and apply the second color. Repeat until you've completely finished filling in the design you drew.
 Wait several hours for the paint to dry before you wear your newly-decorated shoes.

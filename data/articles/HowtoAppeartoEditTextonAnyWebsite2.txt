 In Chrome, navigate to the website you want to appear to edit. If you want to edit text, highlight the words you want to change, and right-click them; if you want to edit a photo, just right-click it without highlighting.To appear to edit a photo, you will need to upload the photo with which you want to replace an existing one. You have to be able to replace the URL in the original code with a new URL.
 When you right click, a menu will pop up. Click “Inspect Element.” A new window with lots of HTML will pop up inside the current one.If you are using Windows, you should also be able to open Inspect Element by pressing F12.
 If you are editing text, the words you highlighted on the original website should also be highlighted here. If you are editing a picture, a larger chunk of text will be highlighted, with an underlined URL at the end.
 If you are changing text, simply overwrite the words you highlighted with whatever you want to replace them with. If you are changing a photograph, replace the URL with the desired new one, leaving the rest of the code alone.


If you make a mistake, just press Command+Z on a Mac or Control+Z on a Windows to undo it.
 Click “Enter,” and close “Inspect Element.” The website should now appear to have the text or image you changed. You have not truly edited the website, of course, and these changes will disappear when you refresh the page.

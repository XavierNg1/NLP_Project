 Another way to register to be an organ donor is to register online at http://donatelifewisconsin.org. You can enter your information on a secure form that should only take a few minutes to complete.When you register on the Donate Life website, you automatically are listed on the donor registry maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.
You also can print off a registration form from the Donate Life website to fill out by hand and mail in.
 This state department operates a state donor registry with the names and contact information of all Wisconsin residents who want to donate their organs.To add your name to the registry, go to https://health.wisconsin.gov/donorRegistry/public/newSearchDonorRegistry.html and follow the instructions.
Registration isn't required to become an organ donor, but it is an added assurance that your intentions will be fulfilled. The donor registry is accessible by hospitals throughout the state.
 You can return to the donor registry website at any time if you need to add new contact information, or if you have decided for whatever reason that you no longer want to be an organ donor.Changing the registry doesn't change any of the information on your license or state identification card. You can request a duplicate license if you want to change the information there as well.

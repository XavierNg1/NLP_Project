, Look for a service with a 100% tenant placement fee. As a landlord, you may love the fact that the service does all of the work outlined above.


Here's how it works: The landlord lets the service know when the unit is coming available. The service takes the photos, inside and out, does all of the advertising and hand shows each and every potential tenant the unit available through appointments. Once they are interested, the service collects the first month's rent and the deposit (made out in the owner's name) and runs their background check, credit check, employment verification and rental verification. If all comes back great, such a service may even go so far as to create a lease and e-send it to both parties for signature. The landlord will sign, the tenants sign and then all receive completed copies for his/her files. Such a service may even meet the tenant at the home on move-in day, to be sure all utilities have been transferred, provide them with a walk-through form they can give to the landlord 7 days after move-in.
 Your contract needs to be "non-exclusive", meaning that if you rent it (or a friend, etc.) before they do, then no fees are due. They simply assist you in renting your property. If there is no tenant brought to the table, then no payment is due.

 It’s common to forget to tell those we spend the most time with how much we appreciate them. An easy way to do this is to write a thank you note. Have your children write their grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, or parent a note that lets them know just how much they mean to them.


For instance, in the note, the child could write, “I just wanted to thank you for being a part of my life. You do so much for me and are a great influence. I love you and appreciate all that you do.”, If you’re looking for a simple random act of kindness that your child can perform and will also encourage your kids to get along, this is the one for you. Talk to one of your children about perform a sibling’s chore as a surprise. This is a win-win for all involved, as it helps to keep your home in order, may promote peace among your children, and makes both kids feel good., After a hard day at work or home, being treated to dinner is such a special treat. If you aren’t able to make the meal yourself or have it delivered, simply place all of the ingredients in a basket and leave it on your loved one’s doorstep, with a recipe included. Having most of the work done and simply having to put the ingredients together is a major help, especially to grandparents or relatives with young children.


Have your child place the ingredients in the basket, and then draw a picture or leave a note for the recipient. This child-friendly task not only adds a special gift for the loved one, but gets your child involved.

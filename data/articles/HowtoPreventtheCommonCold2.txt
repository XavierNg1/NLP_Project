A cold virus can be contagious for up to 2 weeks. If a friend has a fever with cold symptoms, he is more than likely contagious. Even if your friend says he feels better, he might still share the virus with you.
If someone is on antibiotics for his cold, he can still spread the virus. Antibiotics do not treat the viral infection.
 The cold virus can be dormant for 24 to 72 hours before symptoms begin., Places where there are a lot of people are going to have more cold germs. If you are concerned about getting sick, stay away from these types of places as much as you can., While you may do everything you can to prevent getting a cold, you may still risk exposure if your kids get sick. Young kids are prone to catching colds from school or daycare. Reminding your kids about hand-washing may reduce the risk of them getting sick too.

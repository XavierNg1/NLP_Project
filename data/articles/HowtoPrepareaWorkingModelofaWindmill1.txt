 Cut each sheet of paper into a 14 cm square. Glue the 2 squares of paper together—make sure the patterned or colored side of the paper is facing out. Allow the glue to completely dry., Retrieve your ruler and pencil. Place the ruler on a diagonal between 2 corners. Lightly draw a diagonal line from 1 corner to the other. Lightly draw a diagonal line between the remaining 2 corners to create a “X.” Make a 5 cm cut along each line—from the corner towards the center., Carefully fold 1 corner at a time towards the center. Dab a dot of glue on the center of the pinwheel and adhere the corner. Hold the corner between your thumb and forefinger until it dries. Fold and glue the remaining 3 corners., Once the glue has dried, position the plastic straw along the center of the backside of the pinwheel—the top of the straw should not poke out above the top of the pinwheel. Secure the straw to the pinwheel by inserting the thumbtack through the center of the pinwheel and the plastic straw., Remove the pinwheel from the straw.


Place 3 to 4 strips of masking tape over the center of the pinwheel.
Insert the shaft of a small motor and cover the end of the shaft with a cap, piece of cork, or a small blob of clay.
Connect the motor wires to the light bulb with alligator clip leads.
Hold the pinwheel in front of a fan and witness the lighting of the bulb!

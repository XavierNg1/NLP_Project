 Depending on your career/job outlook, your career portfolio will take on different looks.


How will you use this portfolio? Will you take it with you to show in an interview? Will you send it with your resume or job application?;
, This is a very important step because, if you don't already know it, presentation is everything.
 What have you done? Can you get screen shots of it? Start with that and get screen shots and put them into a document and save it. Then print it out, preferably in color, to put in your notebook that you will be assembling.
 You want your potential employer to believe that you are the answer to their employment dilemma. The meticulous attention to detail that it takes to create a good portfolio shows them initiative and preparation.
 They should be the very best examples of your work.
 If you're looking in multiple fields, have multiple portfolios.
 Don't expect a prospective employer to sit there and read a fourteen page report, even if you did a great job.


Prefer visual examples of your work if they are available. Drawings, photos, diagrams, etc. won't compete for attention with you. Consider making screencasts.
Use smaller samples of larger works if they will take less time to explain. If someone is really interested in knowing more, you can send more later. A smaller piece can still be a great talking point.
If a written work is the best way to showcase your skills, you can send it, or portion of it, ahead to be read in advance. Alternatively, have it with you and describe it, summarizing what's inside and why it was important and valuable.
 Look at what the job description is seeking and select your work samples based on that.
 This way you'll stay always prepared for urgent interviews and will be able to update your portfolio quickly.

 Sweep with the grain of the wicker and not crosswise to avoid scratching the wicker reeds.;
, You can use an old soft toothbrush on the smoother portions of the wicker. In the weave around the legs, you may want to use a new, soft paintbrush with an inch cut off the ends of the bristles. This gives you a slightly stiffer brush yet gives you enough bristle to reach into corners and hard to reach areas.
 You might need to use an ice pick or other sharp object to pry out embedded materials. Be careful not to poke a hole into the wicker, if you use this type of object.

 In this case, identify the example duplicate, "Alan." Make sure that the records you are trying to delete are actually duplicates by entering the SQL below.;
, In the instance of a column named "Names," you would replace "column_name" with Names.
 If you were trying to identify the duplicate by a different column, for example the age of Alan rather than his name, you would enter "Ages" in the place of "column_name" and so on.

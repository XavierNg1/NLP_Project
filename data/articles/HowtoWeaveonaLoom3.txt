 Select a needle with a large eye. Thread a piece of your weft yarn through the needle’s eye. Attach the top two rows together by sewing a zig-zag pattern across the weaving. This will prevent the top two rows from slipping.
 Remove the dowel from the bottom. Retrieve your fork. Use the fork to push the bottom wefts towards the wefts above.
 Retrieve your needle. Thread the large-eyed needle with a piece of your weft yarn. Attach the bottom two wefts together by creating a zig-zag pattern across the bottom of the weaving.
 Snip the warp threads that are connecting the weaving to the loom. With a needle pull the tails of the first and last weft rows into the weaving. Trim all other side tails to between ¼” to ½” long. Flip the weaving over and cut any loose threads you see.

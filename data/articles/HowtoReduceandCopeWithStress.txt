In some cases, stress may be somewhat self-inflicted. For example, stress over work deadlines may be a result of a procrastination habit. If you can identify the reasons for your tension, you may be able to make changes to your situation that create a more stress-free environment.;

According to the Mayo Clinic, studies have shown a link between positive thinking and one's health and well being. Positive thinking does not come naturally to everyone, but it is a habit that can be learned. The first step is to practice self-talk (thoughts that run in a continuous stream through your mind) that transforms negative thoughts into positive ones.
 You can also list the reasons for your stress in order to more effectively identify stressors and deal with them at the source.
 Physical activity releases endorphins, known as "feel good" hormones, into the body to elevate your mood naturally.
 These foods provide nutrients necessary to reducing tension, boosting the immune system and lowering blood pressure.
 These relaxation techniques help focus the mind, relax the body and relieve tension.



Some of the easiest ways to reduce stress include learning to say "no" when someone asks for a favor you don't have time to do and avoiding people and situations that create more anxiety and stress in your life. If factors like the news or discussions over hot-button topics induce tension, avoid those as well.



A healthy diet and sufficient sleep work effectively in combating the results of stress. By the same token, avoid behaviors that can contribute to tension, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeine and taking drugs.

For high end audio production, consider investing in software like Pro Tools.
 The basics would include: microphones, a mixer, and headphones. This equipment tied with recording software will ensure a high sound quality and enhance your recording experience.


Look for usb microphones that plug directly into your computer.
Have enough microphones to support your cast and any guests that would come on.
A mixer can provide greater control over individual audio channels and audio effects.
Headphones are important when you incorporate a mixer so that you can listen to adjustments that the mixer will make.
A pop filter can help reduce audio pops that can occur when consonants are punctuated loudly.
Make sure your recording equipment are all compatible to work together.

 Students learn more effectively when they feel a friendly connection with their tutor. Build this rapport by greeting your student with a friendly smile, asking how they are doing, and truly listening to their answer. Take everything they say seriously, and respond thoughtfully.This doesn't mean that you should chat through your whole session. It just means that you should show interest in your student as a person, and let them see you as a person as well.
 Once you know your student better, you can tailor lessons to their interests and abilities. Start out by asking your student what they know about the subject. Listen for gapsâ€”this is where you'll begin to fill in material they'll need to know.Involve your student's interests in your lesson. For instance, if your student is really excited about a sports team, you can use that team's financial struggles as the basis for your math lesson.
If you notice your student responds better to certain kinds of teaching, such as talking, reading, or hands-on practice, you can modify your lesson plans to favor this.
 Come in every day and make it very clear that you want to be there, you want to teach them the subject at hand, and that you know they can learn the material. Have confidence in yourself as a tutor, and have confidence in them that they will learn grow during the session.


Make sure you thoroughly understand the material your student is learning even if it is not obviously interesting. If you pay attention to how something works, you will gain interest in it.

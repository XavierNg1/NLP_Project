 You can create a website for your book, or just a website for yourself as an author, which will allow readers to quickly and easily access your work. Make your website easy to find and navigate, and allow your readers to view and maybe even comment on your poetry.


Choose a simple format. Make sure that your poems look good on the online page and that the line breaks and font meet your standards.
You can decide whether every poem will be published on one long page, or if readers can simply view a table of contents and click on the poem they want to read.
Remember that a website is a great form of advertisement. Use your site to not only display your writing, but to promote your writing.
 A blog lets you release each poem individually and quickly get reader feedback as your blog readers leave comments, and it gives readers an easy way to keep up with your poetry by subscribing to your blog feed. You get no payment up front, but it's the easiest way to get reader feedback.


Research the various blog hosts and pick the one best suited to your needs and budget.
For a blog, set up your site appearance, URL, subscription options, and any custom web coding necessary to make poems display properly.
Once you build a readership, add advertisements to your blog if you want a source of revenue; or, release your poems as an e-book or physical book that can be purchased––added value in such a compilation may include illustrations and a special foreword from you.
You can also easily edit a blog, so you can go back to make changes, or even add some poems to your collection.
Just be wary about online reading attention span. Someone who reads your poetry on your blog may not be planning to give your work as much time and attention as someone with an e-book of your work or a physical copy of the book. If you feel that confining yourself to this attention span spoils the creativity, avoid using this outlet for your poems.

 Suppose you deposited $1,500 into a bank account.  The account earns 4.3 percent interest annually. The interest is compounded annually, or one time per year.  Suppose you want to find out how much compound interest you will have earned after six years.
 The formula for annual compound interest is −P{\displaystyle -P}, where P = Principal, i = interest rate and n = number of compounding periods. For this example, P = $1,500, i = .043 and n = 6 (because if the interest is compounded annually, then in six years there will be six compounding periods).

Calculate the interest paid in six years with the equation −$1,500{\displaystyle -\$1,500}


$1,500∗1.287−$1,500{\displaystyle \$1,500*1.287-\$1,500}


$1,931−$1,500=$431{\displaystyle \$1,931-\$1,500=\$431}

The amount of compound interest paid in six years is $431. 


,  Suppose you deposited $1,500 into an account that paid 4.3 percent interest that was compounded quarterly, or four times per year.  To calculate how much interest you would be paid in six years, you would use the formula −P{\displaystyle -P}, where P = Principal, i = interest rate, n = number of compounding periods per year, and t = the number of years for which the money is invested.

In this example, P = $1,500, i = .043, n = 4 and t = 6.

You would calculate −$1500{\displaystyle -\$1500} 


($1,500∗1.29)−$1,500{\displaystyle (\$1,500*1.29)-\$1,500} 


$1,938−$1500=$438{\displaystyle \$1,938-\$1500=\$438}.

The amount of compound interest paid in six years is $438.

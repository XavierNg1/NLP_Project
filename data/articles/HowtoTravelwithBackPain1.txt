 Staying hydrated can help alleviate many aches and pains, including back pain. Dehydration tends to make joint stiffness work. Make sure to have a water bottle in the car or with you on an airplane.You should also make hydration a priority in the days leading up to your trip. If you go into the trip well hydrated, you're more likely to avoid back pain.;
, How you sit when you're driving makes a huge impact on your likelihood of experiencing back pain. Sit back in your seat with your shoulder blades pressed against the seat.Allow for your lower back to curve inward slightly as it naturally does.
Your knees should either be the same level as your hips or lower than them.
Keep your inner core contracted throughout the trip. This keeps your core from weakening, which can prevent back pain.
 Evenly distribute your body across your weight and spine. This can help prevent back pain when sitting for long periods on an airplane.Keep your spine straight, while maintaining the natural curve of your lower spine.Extend your mid back to lift your chest slightly.
Squeeze your shoulder blades together and lengthen the back of your neck by tucking in your chin.
 Your lower back and neck need extra support when sitting for long periods. Seats in cars, trains, and planes often don't provide adequate support. To prevent back pain, bring your own supplies.You can buy a lumbar pillow, which is a special pillow designed to support your neck and back, online or at a store.
If you don't have one, a rolled up blanket, sweater, or jacket can also work.
An inflatable pillow that fits around your neck can be a great way to eliminate back strain when sitting for long periods.

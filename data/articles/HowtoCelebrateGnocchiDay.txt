 When people got paid on the first of every month in South America, money was always tight by the end of the month. Since there was little money available, Ñoquis became a good way to enjoy a hearty, inexpensive meal on a meager budget. Ñoquis are cheap since all you really need are potatoes and flour and hence a way of dealing with low funds to eat at the end of every month became a tradition; that's right, people all over certain parts of South America get together on the same day every month (29th) just to eat Ñoquis.;
, You can also choose to eat it on the day before pay day. The idea is to get together with friends and family and enjoy a filling meal together even though pockets are emptier than usual. There are many variations of gnocchi that you can experiment with.
 If you can get your hands on South American currency like a peso coin, put one under each plate as the South Americans did for good luck and prosperity. To keep the spirit of Gnocchi Day alive without exchanging your currency, put the coin or bill of your choice under each plate.

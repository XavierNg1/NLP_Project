 The first thing you'll need to do is select all data you wish to examine for duplicates.
 This begins the selecting process.
 The final cell is in the lower right-hand corner of your data group. This will select all of your data.


You can do this in any order (e.g., click the lower right-hand box first, then highlight from there).
, This section includes tools to manipulate your selected data, including the "Remove Duplicates" feature.
 This will bring up a customization window.
 This will verify all of your columns have been selected., The default setting has all columns checked.
 This will prompt the program to label the first entry in each column as a header, leaving them out of the deletion process.
 When you are satisfied with your options, click "OK". This will automatically remove any duplicate values from your selection.


If the program tells you that there aren't any duplicates--especially if you know there are--try placing a check next to individual columns in the "Remove Duplicates" window. Scanning each column one at a time will resolve any errors here.
 If you're satisfied with your revisions, you have successfully deleted duplicates in Excel!

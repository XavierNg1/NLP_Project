 Grab two pieces of bond paper and a pencil. Use scratch paper whenever possible; it saves paper and helps the environment.;
, If possible, have someone help you hold your child still as he or she steps on the center of your first piece of paper.
 Make sure your pencil is upright – not at an angle – and trace around the entire foot. Pass around twice so the lines are as vivid as possible.
 Using your second piece of paper, repeat the process for the other foot.
 Carefully cut both outlines from your papers. You’ll have two paper models of your baby’s feet.
 When you go to purchase shoes for your baby, hold each outline against the bottom of its corresponding shoe to make sure the size is right. Ideally, the shoe should be just slightly larger than the paper model.

 Getting a DNA sample from a cat requires getting up close and personal with the cat’s mouth. To protect yourself from bacteria and from getting bite, wear medical gloves when you take the sample.You should also have the cotton swab within reach so it’s easy to insert into the cat’s mouth.
 If the cat tends to dislike having its mouth open, try relaxing it before you take the sample. Say calming words to the cat and pet the cat. Position the cat between your legs so it can relax against your chest. This may make it easier for you to then insert the swab in the cat’s mouth.


If the cat gets agitated or annoyed, trying placing a towel over its head. This can help to calm it down.
 Once the cat is calm, carefully open the cat’s mouth. Then, insert the swab between the cat’s cheek and gum. Twist or rub the swab against the cat’s cheek a few times to collect cheek cells.Do not rub the swab on any other part of the cat’s mouth. This can contaminate the sample.
 Once you have collected cheek cells on the swab, gently remove it from the cat’s mouth. Place the swab into a plastic sleeve to protect the sample. You can use a plastic bag if you do not have a plastic sleeve for the swab.If you are using a swab that came from a DNA testing service, it usually comes with a plastic sleeve to protect the sample.
 Ask your vet to recommend a DNA testing service for the cat or look up services online. You can then mail the DNA sample to a DNA testing lab for analysis.


For a small fee, the DNA testing lab send back an analysis of the sample with the genetic makeup of the cat as well as the breed. This can be useful for cat breeders or for cat owners who want to know the breed of their cat.

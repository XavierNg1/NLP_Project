 In a food processor or blender, mix together 2 cups (450 g) of canned pumpkin, 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of low-fat vanilla yogurt, 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of honey, and 1 teaspoon (5 g) of pumpkin pie spice. Puree until the mixture is smooth.Pumpkin is loaded with antioxidants and vitamins A and C, which help to moisturize and soften the skin.
If you aren’t a fan of the scent, you can omit the pumpkin pie spice.
 When the mask ingredients are fully combined, use your fingers to gently massage it into your skin. Make sure to coat your entire face in a fairly thick layer, and let it sit on your skin for 10 to 15 minutes.If you don’t want to apply the mask with your hands, you can use a flat makeup brush, such as a foundation brush, to smooth it over your face.
 After the mask has sat on your face for at least 10 minutes, rinse it off with warm water. Use a gentle microfiber cloth to help remove the mask if you’re having trouble.

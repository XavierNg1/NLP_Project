 To bring the other person down to your level, have them sit on a bar-style stool. This will bring them closer to your height without making you have to bend over. Sitting in a chair may make them too short, but depending on the height difference, this could work better for you., Having both of you sit on the couch may be one of the easiest ways to overcome the height difference. If you are still much shorter than them, fold your legs under you to give you a little boost. Move closer to your significant other and give them a kiss.
 If you both are comfortable with it, sit in the taller one’s lap. This will naturally elevate you and bring your face closer to their face. You can do this at home or wherever you feel comfortable with public displays of affection.
 Stand on the taller stair to give you a height boost. This is a great and convenient way to become closer to each other’s level. Lean in and wrap your arms around them to show your affection.

 It's easiest to give a cat a shorter name. This way, the cat will recognize the name easily. It will also be simpler for you to say when calling your cat. One to two syllables is ideal.If you love a name that's on the longer side, you could always use that name but use a shortened nickname when calling your cat.
For example, a cat named Harrison could be called Harry on occasion.
 Cats respond to particular sounds. You want your cat to be able to recognize its name. Therefore, choose sounds that are easily detectable to a cat's ears.Cats tend to respond well to the long "ee" sound. A name that ends in that sound may be a good option. For example, Molly, Daisy, Lucky, Charlie, etc.
Cats also respond to harder consonants. A name with "K," "D," or a "T" sound is easier for your cat to recognize. For example, try a name like Trudy, Tommy, Dusty, or Katie., If you intend to have your cat follow basic commands, do not choose a name that sounds like a command. This can be confusing for a growing kitten. For example, the name Sun may suit your cat's personality. However, it also sounds like "come," so your cat may get confused coming when it's called.Kittens are rambunctious by nature, so be careful to avoid names that sound similar to words such as "No," "Down," and "Off." You'll likely need to use these words often. While a very fuzzy kitten may look like it should be named Puff, this sounds very similar to "Off."

, Make sure the name you choose doesn't have any negative connotations. You may need to use it in public, in places like the vet's office. You should also be careful not to pick a name that can be misheard. Be sure your name does not sound too similar to a curse word or negative word.

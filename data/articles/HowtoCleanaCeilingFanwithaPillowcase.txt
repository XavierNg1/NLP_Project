 Unless the blades are somewhat within reach you will most likely need to use a low step stool for cleaning.


Make sure stool is firmly planted on a hard, flat surface. Donâ€™t use a stool that may not be completely safe and/or may be positioned on top of an item (which could cause it to tip over).;
, The pillowcase should be encasing the blade (almost like you are going to stuff the blade into the pillowcase).
 Slide the pillowcase away from the fan base, so the dust is captured inside the case.

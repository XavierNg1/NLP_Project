 "Gray water" is a term for water that has already been used in showers, bathtubs, sinks or dishwashers. This water is certainly not fit for human consumption, but it is clean enough to be used in gardens and on plants around the house. Bathwater or shower water is best, but water that has been used to wash dishes is also okay, as long as there's not too much grease or food left on the dishes before they go into the washer. Water may be collected manually by scooping it out of the bathtub, or drainage pipes can be re-routed to a small storage tank.
 13,000 gallons (49,210.4 L) of water are used by each person each year in developed countries to flush away only 165 gallons (624.6 L) of waste! To make water usage more efficient, some water can serve two purposes before it leaves the home. Since it's not necessary to flush a toilet with clean water, pipes can be re-arranged so that gray water from the bathroom sink will fill the toilet's tank.
 Just place a barrel at the bottom of a downspout and collect rainwater there. The EPA claims that a house with a 1,500 square foot roof in a region that gets at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) of rain a year could potentially collect 18,680 gallons (70,711.5 L) of water annually. This water may then be used for watering lawns and gardens.

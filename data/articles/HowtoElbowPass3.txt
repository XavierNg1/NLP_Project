 Find the teammate you want to pass the ball to and position your hips in their direction. The bent elbow pass is meant to pass the ball quickly in a defensive hole, and you'll want to see where your teammate is so you can pass it to them., Once you find a hole in the defense, you can throw the ball by swiftly driving your hand down and releasing the ball. This pass is best used in high-tempo games and in games where you're being smothered by the defense.

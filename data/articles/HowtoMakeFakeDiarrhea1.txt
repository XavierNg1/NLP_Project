, You want to make about 1.5 cups of kibble powder. If you have a mortar and pestle in your kitchen, you can use that to grind the kibble. Many people don't have one, though. If that's the case, just pour the kibble into a ziplock bag and seal it, making sure to get as much air out as possible. Put it on the ground and step on it, crushing the kibble until it becomes a powder.
 Pour the kibble powder into a large bowl, then add about a cup of cocoa powder or mix and a packet of instant oatmeal. Stir the dry ingredients together with a spoon to mix them all together.
 Start with 3-4 tablespoons, but you can adjust that amount. Look at the consistency and decide if you want to thicken the mixture up at all. Keep in mind, though, that diarrhea is supposed to be very thin. You'll add soda water to get the perfect consistency in the next step.


If you don't have queso on hand, you can use mashed up ripe bananas or a thick mustard. Grainy mustards can work well to give the diarrhea an especially gross appearance.
 As with the queso, start small and add more liquid as necessary. You can always add more water, but you can't take it out once you've poured it in. Keep mixing the ingredients together with a spoon until it reaches a runny consistency that look like diarrhea.


If the mixture gets too runny, you might add some more dry ingredients to give it back some texture.
 Get ready to make a mess! Pour the diarrhea from a little bit of a height â€” just above the rim of the toilet bowl. This will cause it to splash a bit, spreading the fake diarrhea up the sides of the toilet bowl. It'll look both gross and realistic.


Make sure to clean up the fake diarrhea from any places that would be unbelievable. If someone actually had diarrhea, it couldn't get on top of the toilet seat or on the lid.

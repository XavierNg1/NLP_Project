Wash your tresses prior to braiding your hair.
Mist your hair with lukewarm water.;
, Frizz and snarls will ruin your efforts to achieve natural looking waves. Combat frizz by applying a leave-in-conditioner or setting mousse to your tresses. Thoroughly brush through your hair to remove any tangles or knots., The number of sections you will divide your hair into depends on the thickness of your locks. Thin hair requires fewer sections and braids than thicker hair. Use a comb to divide your hair into one to five sections.


For uniform waves, divide your hair into even sections. For random-looking natural waves, divide your hair into uneven sections.Experiment with dividing your hair into one, two, three, four, or five sections until you achieve your desired results.

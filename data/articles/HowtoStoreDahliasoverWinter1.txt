 In order to properly overwinter your dahlias, you will have to dig them up at the right time. Check your dahlias regularly; when their stems and leaves have turned black you can dig them up.


This will generally occur a few weeks after the first frost.;
, Digging up the dahlias after the first frost allows the plant to use its stems to feed the tubers for the coming season. The absorption of nutrients must occur for the plant to have a good chance of surviving the winter.


Once the leaves and stems are fully black, cut them back to within a few inches of the ground, leaving only the primary stems behind.
 Dig a circular hole more than a foot from the stem of the plant to begin the digging process. Use a fork turner to lift the plant out of the soil, rather than pulling on the stem. Pulling on the stem could harm the tubers.
 Once free from the soil, remove any loose dirt and debris from the tubers but don’t use force; the plant’s tubers are extremely delicate. Try to avoid damaging or breaking the tubers when you dislodge the dirt.


You can also rinse the dirt off with water if you are concerned about breaking or damaging the tubers.
 Once the tubers are clean, hang them to dry in a covered area. Make sure to hang these tubers upside down to encourage proper drying.


You can hang the tubers to dry in a shed, garage, or other cool, dry space.

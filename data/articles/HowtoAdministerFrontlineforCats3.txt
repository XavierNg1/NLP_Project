 But even extended time alone in their own backyard can increase your cat’s risk for fleas and ticks, since these bugs can be found anywhere, especially during spring, summer, and fall.
 Vitamins C and B are the most effective at keeping your cat’s skin healthy.


Feed your cat a chewable vitamin B or C (available at your local pet store), or add a liquid vitamin supplement to their water.Avoid feeding your cat meaty cat foods, as these are usually made with low-quality meats that are unfit for human consumption.
You could also add a spoonful of coconut oil to your cat’s food or water to keep their skin healthy.
 Pay attention to prolonged scratching, chewing, or licking behavior that might indicate the presence of fleas or ticks.


After walking about outside, you should also check your clothing for fleas and ticks to avoid bringing them in with you.
Wash your cat regularly. After drying them, comb them thoroughly with a flea comb to remove potential bugs. Place any fleas you find in a jar, then seal the jar and place it in the freezer to kill them.

 But not always! Sometimes someone who is a natural at photography and is just getting started in the business can give you great headshots for a low price! But always look at their samples first, because you don't want to spend even $20 if what you are getting back is absolutely useless.;
, You can email them but it's a much better idea to call because you want to get an idea of what kind of person they are by talking to them over the phone. Do they have time for you? Do they even care? Don't work with them if they don't seem to be interested in talking to you, or if they seem to busy to want to deal with you. They probably won't end up giving you as good results as someone who really does care about giving you the most for your money.
 This goes for any professional you might be working with: if they take more than two days to respond, that's not a good sign. You need to always feel comfortable knowing that they are prepared and ready to serve you. You're paying them, so why should you be worried that they might not show up?

, But many photographers are very busy and can't offer their time like that. If it is an option, however, it can be good to get to know them better and see if you get along well. The photographer should be able to make you laugh and you should feel comfortable around him/her, as it is the only way you will get good pictures.

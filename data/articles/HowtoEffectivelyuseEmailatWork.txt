 If you don't stay in control of checking your e-mail, you may end up wasting too much of your work day checking it. Try to respond to emails immediately.;
, Effective use of work email includes deleting emails you know you won't need as you read them and filing those that you will need in specified folders. If you organize your e-mails on a regular basis, you won't clutter up your inbox, thus causing anxiety every time you open it.
 This way you won't have to keep adding it manually, risking the possibility of misspellings or even forgetting the information altogether.
 Just like most website content, paragraphs should contain approximately 20 words for easier reading on the part of the recipient. Long emails can be daunting and exhausting to look at, never mind read.
 Refrain from using emoticons such as smiley faces and always re-read and spellcheck your message before sending it. Your credibility is behind every email you send.
 Communicating via email is not an excuse to abandon some old-school writing etiquette. Address the recipient as you would in a formal letter and always add an appropriate salutation, such as, "sincerely," "regards," and "best."

, For example, typing in all capitals is considered yelling in email language. Try to stick to one color, preferably black, a plain text, and an easy to read font. This will ensure that your recipient will be able to read your emails without problem.
 Even in this Internet age, there are times when email is just not appropriate and writing a formal letter the old fashioned way or even calling the person you wish to communicate with is more suitable. Confidential letters and documents should always be written in letter form, whereas emails should be reserved for shorter correspondences.
 By doing this, the recipient will know what your email is about and will be able to file it accordingly, and find is easily at a later date, if necessary.

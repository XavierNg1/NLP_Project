 Make sure it is a "puppy only" class, and that the instructor uses POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT only. This class should meet weekly. An easy obedience course like this will help your puppy learn how to react in a new environment, and how to react with other dogs and people. Eventually, you can enroll your puppy in higher obedience courses so that you can maybe even compete, although this is not necessary.
 Call your friends up and schedule a puppy play date with their dog and your puppy. Make sure that their dog is current on all vaccinations. This will help your puppy learn to play and interact with other dogs in a non-threatening environment.
 First, you need to make sure that it has all its shots, or it could pick up a disease. Bring your puppy with you to pick your kids up from school, when you go to work (if it is okay with your boss), and maybe even to a couple of dog shows. This will help your puppy feel easier in new environments, and to enjoy car rides.
 You need to introduce your puppy to livestock at a young age so that it will not panic when you start training.
 (this is optional).
 I don't know any groomer/breeder/handler/trainer who wouldn't stress this! Introduce your puppy to all grooming tools at a young age so that it will enjoy it in the years to come. Groom it gently each day for 10 minute intervals.

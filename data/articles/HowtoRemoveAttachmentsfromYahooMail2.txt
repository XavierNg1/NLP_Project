 Just below the subject line is the Attachments header. Tap on the down arrow to open it. All the attachments will be displayed in thumbnail view, with an “X” icon at the top left corner of the image.
 Go over the list of attachments, and choose which one(s) you will be removing.
 Tap on the “X” or the image of the attachment to remove. A confirmation window will pop-up. Select “Remove” from this window, and the attachment will be removed.


Keep doing this for all the attachments you want to remove.
For now, there is no “Remove all” option for the Yahoo Mail app.

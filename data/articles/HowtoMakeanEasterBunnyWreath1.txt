 You can purchase wicker wreaths at any department store. You will need four different wreaths in three different sizes. Purchase the following wicker wreaths:Two six-inch wreaths
One eight-inch wreath
One ten-inch wreath;
, Take the two six-inch wreathes. Use your hands to squeeze them into diamond shapes. These will be your bunny ears on the wreaths. Wicker wreaths are not very strong, so you should be able to push them into the right shapes using your hands.Wicker wreaths do have pointy parts. It's a good idea to wear thick gloves while shaping your ears.
 Use floral wire to tie the eight-inch wreath and ten-inch wreath together. This will be the body of your bunny. Wrap the wire around both wreathes several times. Make sure the wreaths are securely together before proceeding., Use floral wire to tie your bunny ears on top of the eight-inch wreath. This is your bunny's head. Make several loops using the floral wire so your wreath is completely secure.How close together or far apart you want your ears is a matter of personal preference.
 Take your silk flowers. You want flowers with longer stems and smaller flowers. As this is an Easter wreath, pastel colors work best. Place your flowers over all four wicker wreathes and hot glue them onto the wreaths. This will give your bunny shape a pleasant spring-like appearance.You can use as many flowers as you want. How flowery your wreath is comes down to personal preference.
 Take a piece of ribbon and tie it into a bow. Hot glue the ribbon onto your wreath between the eight-inch and ten-inch wreath. This makes it look like your bunny is wearing a bow tie.You can use any color ribbon you want, but pastels match well with the season.

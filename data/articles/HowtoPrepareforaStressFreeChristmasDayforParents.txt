 Don't worry about the packaging and whether it will go back in the box in which it came. Check that all the parts are there and nothing is broken.;
, Take your time. Read the manual and you won't have to worry about the children handling sharp tools from your toolbox, as you can actually assemble the toy before Christmas when they are in bed! Have a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and relax; the hard part - actually braving the Christmas crowds and buying the toy - is done.
 Perhaps the garage, your bedroom, or a relative or neighbour's home?

, Normally it's a simple push-fit assembly and no tools are necessary. Use the assembled toy to gauge the size you need. Attach your gift wrapping paper to the perfectly straight edges that the frame provides. Within minutes, you have a perfectly gift wrapped cube that looks great!

, Go down and see what gifts they have got. Don't worry about the time; no doubt it's early but you'll be able to relax soon enough. Watch them rip open the gift. It's just what they wanted and they can play with it right now, because you've already assembled it! Whether your toy needed an initial mains battery charge, assembly, or was just a really difficult shape to wrap, you'll be sorted.
 It's fun when they first get the gifts. But then to stop boredom and wandering, have them help gather up the wrapping paper and put it in the recycling bin. Also, task them with specific duties to help prepare for the Christmas meal. If they whine, tell them they can return to their toys when they have finished helping out.

 While you may not be able to entirely prevent scars from forming, you can take some measures to limit them.Cover the cut with a bandage
Keep the cut moist with an antibiotic cream to avoid drying and scabbing
Apply pressure to the cut when it's healing. This will prevent the collagen in the scar from raising up.
Massage the affected area when the new skin has grown. This will keep the skin loose and make the scar far less noticeable.
 Ultraviolet rays impede the healing process and will discolor a scar, making it far more noticeable.
 If you're looking to hide scars, then here are some other things to consider:


Wash your skin with an exfoliating scrub to remove dead skin cells and soften the scarred area
Moisturize the affected area to keep it smooth and receptive to other products
Try using camouflage makeup that's traditionally a little more formidable than standard cover up, and be sure to find a color that most closely matches your skin tone.
Consider applying a finishing powder to prevent the makeup from "slipping" throughout the day.

 A pardon restores your civil rights such as the right to vote and the right to serve on a jury. However, it doesn't necessarily restore your right to bear arms or expunge the crime from your record.In some professions you cannot be licensed unless you are fully pardoned. If that is the case, provide the Board with a letter from the licensing authority indicating that you are otherwise eligible for a license but won't be granted one unless you receive a full pardon.;
, The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles does not consider pardon requests in certain cases, such as if you have a prior federal conviction or a prior felony conviction in another state.The Board lists several examples of circumstances in which it will consider a request for a full pardon.

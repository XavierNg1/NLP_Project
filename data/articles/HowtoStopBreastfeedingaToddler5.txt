 Keep in mind that healthy can still be yummy, so avoid unhealthy substitutes. Remember that your baby received his nutrition and immunity from your breast milk and weaning requires added nutrients to keep your baby healthy.
 Often, breastfed babies refuse to drink from a bottle. Offer the bottle at times other than nap times. Your baby is accustomed to falling asleep in his momâ€™s arms while sucking on the breast and he will not be receptive to replacing mom and the breast with a bottle. Instead, offer the bottle when your baby is preoccupied, such as when he is going for a stroll in the carriage. This will allow your baby to adjust to the bottle with out giving it much thought on his part or expecting mom to cuddle with him.
 A baby with a full belly is less likely to want to nurse. Keep food substitutes on the healthy side and refrain from bribing him with unhealthy treats.
 Yummy snacks are a distraction to your baby, and he may easily forget his desire to nurse at the moment if he sees his favorite snack get pulled out of the cabinet.

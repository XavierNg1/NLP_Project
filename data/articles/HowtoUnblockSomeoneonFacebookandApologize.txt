 You should start apologizing in a sincere and kind way. The person you blocked should understand how sorry you really are.;
, You should think about why did you block the person. Is there a reason you blocked the person?

, You should come with a really good reason. The reason should be favorable to you. Don't make up something so far fetched that the person won't believe you.
 Is it a friend, ex-lover or just family. You should think about the importance of the person you blocked.
 Maybe you might get away with this excuse. It depends on the person you blocked.
 Sometimes you can say you blocked them and they might not really care. You should not make a big deal about something when it's really not.

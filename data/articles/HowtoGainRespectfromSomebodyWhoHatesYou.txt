 You'll never get on the good side of someone by trying to insult them. Try not to respond to any mean comments.;
, Don't get into trouble by being late or not completing your tasks. They will have no reason to hate you unless you give the a reason.
 This will show them you're a good person. Plus, volunteer work will look great on a resume.
, For example, if they drop some papers, help gather them back up again, or if they need someone to help on a project (even if it's just moving some chairs) help them do it. They may not thank you, but a good respectful silence and eye contact (or even a nod) should help you understand if they really are secretly thanking you.


Don't invade their personal lives to figure out where you can help. If they hate you, they don't want you doing that. Do the obvious things.
 If you do so consistently, it is sure to help. Nobody likes being stranded with nobody to back them up, so you can become the person that cares enough to back them up.
 Make small talk, or talk about something else relevant. It might get you into a small friendly chat before the hate returns. Be sure to not dominate the conversation.
 For example, don't play loud music, keep your pets quiet and so on. Try to notice and avoid acting upon pet peeves - actions that make them highly uncomfortable or which create resentment.

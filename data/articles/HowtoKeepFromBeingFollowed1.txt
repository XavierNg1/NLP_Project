 Casually scan people behind you, possibly on the other side of the road-and make a rough note of anyone within distance, especially things such as height, color of clothes, type of coat, etc.; also look for anyone you recognize from earlier. Stop again after a few hundred meters and take a look around, is anyone there?;
, Use your ingenuity. Stop and look in store windows, or pause to admire a shiny car or van (Choose Dark Colored ones, because you can see the reflection of anyone behind you. Or pull out a comb and peer into the side mirror of a parked car or motorbike, as though about to comb your hair-is there someone that you recognize their reflection?

, At the same time, make a plan for losing him or her.
 If you have a blue cap on, stuff it in your coat pocket; if you have sunglasses on, put them away.
 Do this not by quickening your pace, but by lengthening your strides. If your pace is 1 foot (0.3 m) long, and you lengthen it to 16 inches (40.6 cm), in 100 yards (91.4 m) you will have traveled an extra 33 1⁄3 yards (30.5 m).
 Enter a large shop and immediately leave by another exit; go down a narrow alley and, while out of sight, sprint around a corner and double up your tracks. As a last resort, hide. Wait until you're out of your tail's sight. The moment you are, duck into a deep doorway crouch behind a parked car - in short, anywhere that he or she will hurry past hoping to catch up with you again. Remember, that your tail, in his/her state of mind, will probably miss something right under his/her nose.

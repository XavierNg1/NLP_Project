 Identify the people in your life who encouraged you to live a clean life. Then identify those people who encouraged you to commit crimes or committed crimes themselves. You want to avoid the second group of people.


Living positively requires that you surround yourself with people who are also committed to living a clean life. Limit contact with those people who encouraged your criminal behavior in the past.This will probably be difficult. When you are released, you might not have anywhere to go. You will feel tempted to stay with the people who knew you before you were sent to prison. It’s very easy to fall back into the old lifestyle.
Instead, you should talk to prison officials who might know where you can stay once released. Look in a phone book and find the nearest shelter. You’re probably better off in a shelter than living with people who are criminals.
 Building a life after prison isn’t easy. You will probably be released with no money and no transportation. Many ex-cons are tempted to commit petty crimes to make a little money.One thing you absolutely cannot do is commit another crime—no matter how dire your circumstances. You’ll likely get caught and end right back at prison.
Regularly check in with your parole or probation officer. They are a good resource to talk with if you are having problems.
 Stay focused on your goals. You can expect many setbacks and challenges once you are released. Look at them as opportunities for growth. Remember that you have already gone through your darkest days—the ones in prison.Pay attention to the language you use when you talk to yourself. Instead of saying, “No one will give me a chance,” think instead, “This is a difficult challenge. But I’ll learn from it.” In this way, you can control your anger and stay positive.

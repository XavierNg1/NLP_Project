 For this recipe you will need a variety of liqueurs: orange, pineapple, and amaretto almond. You also want to grab some unflavored vodka and a small amount of pineapple juice that you can splash in at the end. You need a half shot, or 3/4 of an ounce (22 ml), of each.


The original liquid cocaine shot was also very fruity, containing these ingredients: triple sec, amaretto almond liqueur, peach liqueur, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, cranberry juice, and lemon-lime soda.;
, For a sweet yet potent treat, chill the ingredients for the fruity liquid cocaine shot in the refrigerator before mixing them in your cocktail shaker.


Alternatively, you can place room temperature ingredients in the shaker, allowing the ice you add later to chill them.
 Pour the half shots of orange liqueur, peach liqueur, amaretto almond liqueur, and vodka into a cocktail shaker., Add the splash of pineapple juice to the liqueur and vodka mixture.
 Fill the cocktail shaker halfway with ice, on top of the liqueurs, vodka, and juice.
 Place the lid on the cocktail shaker and shake the mixture until it is well chilled.


Shaking the mixture in a cocktail shaker is recommended for both sufficiently mixing the ingredients and chilling them. If you donâ€™t have a cocktail shaker, you can mix the ingredients in a blender and pour over ice, or mix them by hand with a spoon or whisk and pour over ice.
 Pour the mixture through a strainer to remove the ice. It works best to strain the drink right from the cocktail mixer into your shot glasses.


You can purchase a cocktail strainer that is specially designed, or get a cocktail shaker with a built-in strainer. In a pinch, you can just use a normal kitchen strainer, although it might get messy.
If you chilled the mixture in the fridge without ice, skip the strainer and pour directly into the shot glasses.
 Serve this cocktail to your guests in stylish shot glasses.

 Follow the instructions about cutting slices described in the sub-section on peanut butter ornaments.
 Create large holes in the center. These holes will be filled with the suet mixture later on.
 Remove any chunks of gristle or fat that start floating in the liquid suet once it melts down.
 Do this carefully to prevent any splashes or spills. Thoroughly mix the two ingredients together until combined.
 A combination of bird seed and cracked corn may also be used. Mix the seed into the suet and peanut butter until evenly distributed.
 The mixture should cool to room temperature before you handle it any further.
 Nonstick foil works best., The squares should be large enough to wrap and tie around your bread rings. Place each square on top of the foil., Center the bread ring on top of the square as best as possible., Pack the mixture firmly into the hole using your fingers. The mix should be fairly thick at this point and may need to be warmed up on the stove over low heat until it becomes soft enough to mold., Tie the square into one or two knots., Continue until you run out of bread or suet., The ornaments must chill and harden for a minimum of eight hours., Tie the other end to the branch of a tree.

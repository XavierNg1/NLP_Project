 Separate your old newspaper into sections and crumple each page into a ball. Dip the newspaper balls into water mixed with vinegar (or a cleaning solution of your choice), which you can then use to clean windows like you would with rags.


The benefit of using newspapers instead of cleaning rags is that you can clean your windows without any streaks.Newspapers also won't leave lint on your windows for maximum visibility.
 If you're a gardener and have trouble with weeds overrunning your garden, use newspapers to introduce a weed barrier.When building a raised bed garden, lay out newspaper sections along the bottom of the bed before filling it with dirt. This will prevent weeds from invading your garden and allow your plants to grow without competition.
 Instead of a log or wild brush in a bonfire, take old newspapers with you while camping and use them as kindling. Newspapers make ideal kindling if you put them into the fire tightly rolled in tubes.

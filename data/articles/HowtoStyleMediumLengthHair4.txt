 Despite what you think, comb overs aren't just for the older demographic - they can also be modern and fun. Try shaving one half of your head, then combing the remaining hair over to the opposite side so it just barely grazes your chin.Grow out your beard and mustache for a rugged, masculine vibe.
If you don't feel confident rocking the razor, ask a friend or hairdresser to shave your head for you.
 If you have medium length hair, your hair is too short for a man bun. However, it's the perfect length to put up in a top knot. Wait till your hair is wet from a shower, then use your hands to run hair cream all over your mane.Use your left hand to grab a fist-full of hair, starting at the top of your head and going back until you reach the crown of your head.
Fold the hair in half so it creates a knot on the top of your head, then secure the knot using a hair tie.
 If you're growing your hair out and need to keep it out of your face, a short ponytail will be your lifesaver. Gather as much hair as you can in one hand, and use the other to tie an elastic band around the hair, securing it on the back of your head.Whatever hair is not long enough to fit in the ponytail can rest on the back of your neck.
This is a great hairstyle to use when working out.

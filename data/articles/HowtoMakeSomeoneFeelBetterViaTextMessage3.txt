 When a friend is grieving a personal loss, it can be hard to know what to say. Lots of times, people are quick to cheer someone up without acknowledging their pain first. The best thing to say could simply be letting them know that you see they’re hurting.Send a text that says, “I know you and Teddy were really close. You must be shocked and upset. I’m so sorry for your loss.”

, It can be painful to watch someone you care about grieve. However, another great way to respond when a friend is grieving is by letting them know you are there for them. It may be uncomfortable, but make sure they know they can count on you, if they want your company.


You might say, “I can’t take your pain away, but I will sit by you and hold your hand. I am here for you.”, A grieving person may be so lost in their pain that they are unable to take care of everyday life things. Anticipate your friend’s needs and try to offer your time or services. This may mean helping with chores, running errands, or making phone calls.Send a text that asks, “How can I support you through this time? Please give me a job to do.”

, People often say empty, meaningless platitudes to others who are experiencing a loss. This may make matters worse. Resist saying things like, “They are in a better place.” Instead, think about your friend’s spiritual or religious beliefs.Find an appropriate quote, verse, or song that offers them comfort.

They may stop completing everyday activities and withdraw from loved ones. They may also stop eating, sleeping, or caring for themselves.If your friend seems to have a hard time getting over their grief, they may need to see a professional.
You might say, "I'm a bit worried about you, Sarah. You haven't been eating or doing your homework. I think it may help if you talk to a counselor."

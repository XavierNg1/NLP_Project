 For example, let x = price of one apple, y = price of one orange.;
, For example:


If 4 apples and 5 oranges cost $2, write 4x + 5y = 2. (Eq. 1)
If 3 apples and 4 oranges cost $1.55, write 3x + 4y = 1.55. (Eq. 2)

, Let's solve for x by eliminating y. The steps are


Multiply Eq. 1 by the coefficient of the other variable (y) in Eq. 2
Multiplying Eq. 1 by 4, we get 16x + 20y = 8






Multiply Eq. 2 by the coefficient of the other variable (y) in Eq. 1
Multiplying Eq. 2 by 5 we get 15x + 20y = 7.75






Subtract the two equations
We get x = 0.25.
Therefore, price of an apple in the example is $0.25






To find the value of the other variable (y), plug in the value of x obtained in any of the equations we had.
Plugging in x = 0.25 in Eq. 1 we get,
4(0.25) + 5y = 2
=> 1 + 5y = 2
=> 5y = 2 - 1
=> 5y = 1
=> y = 1/5 = 0.20
Therefore, price of an orange in the example is $0.20

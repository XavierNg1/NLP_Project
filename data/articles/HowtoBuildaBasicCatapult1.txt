 This basic catapult uses tension to fling its load and can be built using a few simple supplies that can be purchased at a dollar or craft store for under $5. You may already have many of these items lying around your house! 7 craft sticks. You can use either the standard 4.5" craft sticks, or the jumbo 6"craft sticks for this project.
4-5 elastic bands
1 bottle cap
A hot glue gun and glue stick
Ammunition: small marshmallows, beans, and pencil erasers are all great choices!;
, These will form the body of your catapult. Stack 5 craft sticks and secure the stack with an elastic band at each end. Stack 2 more craft sticks and secure the stack on one end only, leaving the other end open.
 Position the stacks perpendicular to one another and slide the larger stack between the two sticks of the small stack. Slide the large stack as close to the elastic band that holds the small stack as possible. Secure the stacks together where they join with an elastic band, wrapped around both stacks in a crisscross pattern.


Consider adding a second elastic band to the joint to make sure it is secure.
 Add a small dab of hot glue to the end of the spring arm, and press the bottle cap into the glue, holding it in place for a few seconds while the glue cools.
 Load your ammunition of choice into the bottle cap. Hold the catapult frame securely to the table with one hand. Pull down on the lever arm with the other hand, and then let go!

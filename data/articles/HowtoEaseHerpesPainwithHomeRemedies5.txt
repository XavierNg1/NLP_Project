 Always wear cotton loose clothes, especially underwear. Cotton is natural and soft, gentle on your skin and doesn't irritate the skin any more than it already is. Cotton will allow your skin to heal and breathe.Other synthetic materials can't absorb any of your sweat and can inflame, trigger and worsen your genital herpes. This goes for all synthetic materials, such as nylon, as well as silk.
Avoid tight clothing, as it will trap sweat and further irritate your skin.
 Make your personal hygiene a priority. Take frequent showers, especially during summer or on hotter days. Change your clothes when you are sweaty or dirty.


Use detergent soaps to wash your affected areas and hands, especially after each bowel movement, after applying your topical creams, after getting in contact with other people, and before eating.
 If you have a herpes outbreak, avoid partaking in any sexual activities to avoid infecting your partner. While you may infect him or her when the virus is dormant, it's much more likely to happen if you have an active infection.Always have protected sex by using condoms to prevent the contact of fluids with any possible cuts in the skin. Any unprotected sexual activity can put those you are with at risk.
 As an outbreak can happen due to stress and sickness, it's incredibly important that you take care of yourself to make the current outbreak go away faster and to prevent future outbreaks. Here's a few things to keep in mind:


Get 7-8 hours of sleep daily. Being fatigued wears down your immune system.
Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, like apples, cabbage, spinach, beetroot, bananas, papayas, carrots, mangoes, etc. Avoid sugar and junk foods. Drink only in moderation.
Manage your stress levels. Consider taking up yoga or meditation to banish the potentiality of stress causing your next outbreak.

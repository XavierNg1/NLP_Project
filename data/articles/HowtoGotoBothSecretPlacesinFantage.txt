 It is Dr. Finkelstein's lab! Let's begin with this secret place. Go to the lighthouse.


When you get there, you will see a blue sign with shapes on it near the entrance to inside the lighthouse. These match the shapes that are near the bushes. (Diamond, star and circle).;
, The shapes on the blue sign is a pattern. Let's say the pattern is star circle diamond. You will click the stick (near the bushes) with the star first, the stick with the circle 2nd and the stick with the diamond last.
 The bushes will then reveal a black elevator. Click the elevator to go inside.


You are now in Dr. Finklestein's secret lab!

, This secret place is at the enchanted grotto at the forest.


Going here is the exact same thing as going to the lab, except with candles and the shapes are a bell a leaf and a circle. The pattern is behind the duck boat.
Let's say the pattern is circle bell leaf. You would click the candle with the circle first then the candle with the bell and the candle with the leaf last.
 The duck boat should sparkle and be able to be ridden on. To ride it and enter the fairy place, click the duck boat. And you are done!

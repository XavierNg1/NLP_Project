 If you can't take it anymore, don't. Avoiding haters doesn't always resolve the problem. Find a moment to speak honestly with these people, and try to explain where you're coming from. Speak with each hater as a mature and conscientious equal no matter how rudely the other person has been in the past. This is especially important for passive haters who may not insult you directly.


Try telling your hater: "I've been getting a lot of negative energy from you recently, and I'd appreciate it if you kept those thoughts to yourself. It's childish, and I don't want to have to deal with this anymore."
Try to understand why your hater is acting this way. Ask him or her: "Have I done something to personally wrong you? You seem to be taking a lot of negativity out on me, and I don't understand why."

, Haters feed on your emotions. If you respond quickly and emotionally, there's a good chance that you won't be able to make a strong point. If you lash out, you will only give them more reason to make fun of you. Do not let your words be clouded by anger and frustration. Give yourself the time to cool down before you respond.
 Resolve conflict with measured words and confident maturity. If hatred is fire, be like water and extinguish it. Be cool and collected. Fighting fire with fire doesn't work.


While you should never start a fight, don't let a hater hurt you. Learn self-defense and protect yourself. Turn your attacker's strength against him or her.

 The entrance to the Happy Home Showcase is located on here, so go to Main Street by running to the north edge of your village and crossing the train tracks there.;
, Digby is a dog that is found just north of where you enter Main Street. Talk to him by facing him and pressing A.
 In the conversation with Digby, he will ask if you want to view the HH Showcase. Choose the answer “Yup!” in order to proceed into the Showcase.
 The HH Showcase is an entirely different zone in the map, so speak to Digby when you are ready to return to your town.


You will see the player characters of anybody that your 3DS has successfully made a StreetPass with in the area when you first enter. If you have StreetPassed with a player multiple times, you may speak with their character to get a special item from them. These items include balloons, pinwheels, and bubble wands, and will be visible in the character's hand if they are obtainable.
There are other areas to the west, north, and east that hold the houses of the players you have StreetPassed. There are sixteen spaces for houses in each area, making a total of 48.
Take a look inside the houses. You can order up to a total of five pieces of furniture per day from any of the houses. Special furniture, event furniture, or furniture that has been customized by Cyrus may not be ordered, however. Also be aware that the item will cost more than if you obtained it from the Nooklings' store.
If there isn't much to enjoy in your HH Showcase, carry your 3DS around with you to gain more StreetPasses. Putting your system into sleep mode will aid the process. Ensure that you have StreetPass enabled for Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

 Do so before connecting your iPod in order to avoid recognition problems.
 Make sure that you are not accidentally using a USB port that is not part of the computer such as a keyboard USB port or an external USB hub.


Be sure that no other USB devices are occupying any of the other ports.
 Be sure you are using the Apple Dock Connector to USB port cable that came with your iPod touch.


If your computer has USB ports on the front and back, connect to a port on the back of the computer.
If iTunes does not recognize your iPod when you connect it, try closing and re-opening iTunes.
If it still does not recognize your iPod, restart your computer entirely and start over., Sync it to your computer so that you have a copy of all of your iPod touch data and settings saved on your computer.


Right click on your iPod name in iTunes and select "Back up." iTunes will automatically back up your iPod.

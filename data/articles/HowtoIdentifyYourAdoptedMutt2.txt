 Find a reputable company that sells genetic dog tests. They will send you a kit to help you test your DNA.Two of the major companies are Wisdom Panel and DNA My Dog.While these tests can provide some information, they aren't foolproof. In fact, getting tests from two different companies may show a different mixture of breeds.See if you can find out which company has the widest database of dog breeds on file and choose the company with the most breeds. They will have a wider reference range and will be better able to more accurately identify your dog.
It's especially difficult to identify breeds if your dog has a larger number than other dogs; if your dog just has a couple of breeds, it may be easier to identify., The kit will come with two cotton swabs. All you do is rub it on the inside of your dog's cheek. Let them dry out, and stick them back in the envelope., Some websites, such as Wisdom Panel, require that you activate your kit online at this point. You'll be given a code to write on your sample sticker., Many kits come with the shipping label included. All you have to do is stick the kit back in the mail., The company will mail back the genetic makeup of your dog. Some panels claim to go back as far as great-grandparents in identifying the breeds that makeup your dog.

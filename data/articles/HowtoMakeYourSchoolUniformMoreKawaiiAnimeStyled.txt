For example, uniform colors are typically: black, navy blue, red, green or white; or a combination of these colors.;
, The colors must be: white, black or navy blue.
 For example, Mary Jane shoes, ankle boots, flats, or any shoes that match the school colors and stop at the ankle or shorter.
 Make sure the cardigan or sweater is an inch over the end of your shirt/start of your skirt. Also wear a tight fitting (not too tight) shirt that is tucked in or short (not so short that when you lift up your arms, people can see skin).
 Try hairbands, high buns, low buns, braids, hair ribbons, ponytails, or low pig tails. Whether you have thick hair, straight hair, or curly hair these suggestions will work for you:


high buns
low buns
low pig tails
ponytails with ribbons
braids
wear your hair down
ponytail with ribbon.
 They'll just not fit properly. Also avoid them if you have sensitive temples, as you'll end up with constant headaches.


Only treat headbands as a cute accessory, not as something that actually works well.
, Also cover up pimples. Remember less is more!

, This will always make your eyes appear larger and more kawaii.
 For the kawaii look, apply preferably colored eyeliner to wear under eyelashes. Apply from the outside corner and make a line following the under lashes about the width of a pencil eraser.


This look might make you feel uncomfortable, so you can always make the line smaller. If you make the line bigger, you will make your eyes look smaller.
To make your eyes even more bright add white eyeliner on the water line and inner corner.
 For example, a pastel pink or a lavender pink. Maybe a light red.
,, Don't swear or talk meanly about others. Respect your elders (unless you don't want a Senpai). Respect your classmates––don't call them stupid or get annoyed at them (don't show that you are annoyed).
 Let go of things you will be more innocent, light-hearted and more fun to be around (kawaii).

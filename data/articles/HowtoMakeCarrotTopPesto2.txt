 Gather 2 to 3 large handfuls of carrot tops from a few bunches of carrots. Wash them thoroughly and dry them. You can dry them on a kitchen towel or use a salad spinner. Discard any large tough stems and put the rest of the carrot tops into a small food processor.While you can use the tough stems, your pesto just might not be very smooth.
 Slice an avocado in half and scoop the flesh from one half into the food processor. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze all of the juice from one half into the processor. Add 2 garlic cloves and 1 teaspoon of olive or avocado oil. Put the lid on and blitz the pesto until it's smooth.For a lower calorie pesto, you can leave out the olive or avocado oil.
 Remove the food processor lid and toss in 1 large handful of walnuts. Put the lid on and blend the pesto until the nuts are completely processed. Take off the lid and stir in salt and pepper according to your taste.You can store the avocado carrot top pesto for up to one day. The lemon juice will help prevent the avocado from browning quickly.

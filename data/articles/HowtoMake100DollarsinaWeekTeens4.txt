 Many teens have clothes lying around that no longer fit, or are a style they wouldn’t wear. Put together a box you think you could sell, and approach your parents. Let them go through your box and tell you which items are ok to sell and which you need to return to your closet.
 Just like clothing, teens outgrow their hobbies. Look around for items you haven’t used in years, like child-friendly telescopes, toys, or dolls. You should be able to sell a few of the items for a decent amount of money (or a ton), especially if your room is cluttered., Selling your games can be done at a store or online. Try not to wait until the game system you’re selling is obsolete, because it won’t have nearly the same value. The right video game, however, could net you far more than $100 if you sell it at the right time., Once you have gotten a few boxes of clothes and toys together it’s time to sell them. You may have seen signs for yard sales in your neighborhood before. Put up a few signs with large, easy-to-read letters, break out the tables, and get enough change to for when you start to sell. Maybe you can get your family or multiple families involved for a community garage sale!

 Too much eye contact can come across as aggressive or dominating. If you don't make eye contact at all, the speaker will think you aren't paying attention to them.One rule of thumb is to make eye contact about 30-60 percent of the time, depending on the situation.
People who seek eye contact are usually thought to be more confident, competent, and honest.
Eye contact creates an automatic natural connection. Babies lock eyes with their parent instinctively, to get their attention and ensure they will be protected and fed.;
, Show the speaker that you are still with them by nodding your head now and then when they make a point., Remember to use friendly facial expressions, to help make the speaker more comfortable. Smile as much as you can without it seeming forced., Turn your body at a slight angle toward the speaker, not exactly full frontal. Standing at a slight angle is perceived as less confrontational, and makes you seem more accessible.If you motion with your hands while talking, be sure the palms face upward. If you speak with your palms facing down, it may seem like you are lecturing or scolding.
Angle your chin to face forward – if your chin is facing up, it looks like you are looking down on someone. Face forward so you appear to be equals.
Turn your head at a slight angle to the right or left. This sets a casual and relaxed tone.
 Make the speaker feel their thoughts are welcome by making encouraging sounds and comments. Coaxing them to continue speaking will reassure them that they are not boring you or taking up too much of your time.Encouraging sounds should be along the lines of, “Mmm,” “Yes,” and “I see.”
For longer pauses, you can say, “Please, go on,” or “I can't believe it – what did he say next?”

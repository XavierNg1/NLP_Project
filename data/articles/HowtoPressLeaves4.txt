 Microwave presses are made with two pieces of microwave-safe material, such as ceramic, thick cardboard, or books. You can buy these at a craft supply store or make your own. This is the procedure to make your own


Gather either two large ceramic tiles or two pieces of heavy cardboard.
For a ceramic press, cut two pieces of cardboard and some pressing papers For a cardboard press, cut pieces to the same size.
Find a couple of strong rubber bands large enough to wrap around the ceramic tiles or cardboard.
 Lay a ceramic tile or cardboard on your work surface. Lay a couple sheets of pressing paper on the tile or cardboard. Arrange your leaves and then cover them with a couple more sheets of pressing paper, a piece of cardboard, and the second tile if using tiles. Band the press together with the rubber bands.
 Place the filled press in the microwave and set it on low for no longer than a minute. Remove the press and open it to let out steam. Once it cools, put it back together and put it back in the microwave for 30 seconds. Continue microwaving the press in 30-second increments until the leaves are dry, venting and cooling after each zap. Always vent and cool to avoid cooking your leaves. The idea is to dry them flat, cooking is never a good idea.

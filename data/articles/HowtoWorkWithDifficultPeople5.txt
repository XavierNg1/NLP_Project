 Perhaps there was some kind of miscommunication, and one of you did not realize what the other needed. This can be worked out through calm, direct communication.Try to understand your client on a person-to-person level.
Ask your client, "What expectations do you have moving forward?"
Follow up with the question, "What can I do differently?"
If necessary, set reasonable limits on what is or is not acceptable. Again, remain calm and professional, but communicate your concerns.
 The best way to manage your client's expectations is to exceed the promises you've made. You can't do that if you aren't meeting your goals., That way, if an issue arises, you can calmly refer your client back to an earlier conversation.Keep track of dates, details, and what was said by whom.
 Remember that managing your client's expectations is part of your job. Act professional, and take criticism in stride.

 Look for the app on your mobile device. The app icon has the Yahoo Mail logo on it. Tap on it.
 Enter your Yahoo ID, or username, and password on the sign in window. Tap on the “Sign In” button, and you will be brought to your Yahoo Mail. Skip this step if you’re already using Yahoo Mail app regularly since you won’t be asked to sign in.
 Tap the folder button on the top left corner. A left panel window will appear with all your folders.
 Tap the Trash button from the window to access your Trash folder. All the deleted emails, as long as they haven’t been permanently removed, are found here.
 Swipe through the emails from the left panel and find the one that has the pictures you want to recover. Tap on it and the email will load on the right panel. See if you got the right email with the pictures.
 Tap the checkbox of the email from the left panel to select it. A toolbar will appear on the right panel. Tap the folder button with a downward arrow from the toolbar. This will open a window with your other folders. Tap “Inbox” from here. The deleted email will now be moved to your Inbox folder.


You can also move the email to another folder, instead of your Inbox, by tapping the appropriate folder name.
 You’ve now recovered the email, with all the attached pictures. It can now be access from your Inbox folder anytime, as long as you don’t move or delete it again. You can view and download the pictures from here.

 This works on any version!, It is made by putting two iron ingots on the workbench in a diagonal fashion.


You do not need a workbench to craft shears. You can also use the inventory 4 by 4 (4x4) crafting grid.
 Sheep spawn in Plains, Taiga, Savannah, Forest, and many other biomes. So they are easy to find.
 Once you have found a sheep or two, right click with the shears in your hand, and the sheep will drop wool on the ground. Pick it up and you're done!

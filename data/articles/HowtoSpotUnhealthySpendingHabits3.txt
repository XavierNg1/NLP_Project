 Otherwise known as “emotional spending,” it's possible to become addicted to spending. If you find yourself buying new outfits or eating out impulsively, consider seeing a psychologist to help identify ways to address this issue.Indicators that you may have a spending addiction include any unnecessary purchases beyond your financial means.
For instance, if you're buying new shoes on credit because you don't have the cash, especially when you already have plenty of shoes, this is a sign you need to get your spending habits under control.
 In addition to your purchases, you may be spending a considerable amount of money on fees and interest if you use a credit card. Paying your bill late, for instance, is not only expensive - it's also a sign you're spending beyond your means.Keep in mind that paying off your credit card every month is extremely important for your long-term financial standing.
 Another unhealthy spending habit is overdrawing your accounts. If you consistently do so, this is a certain indication that you are spending too much. Fortunately, you can avoid the fees associated with overdrawing accounts at most financial institutions by setting up “low balance” alerts at a specified amount.For instance, set up your online account to send you a text when your balance falls below $50. Contact your financial institution directly to find out what options you have.

 Preprinted (also known as “reprinted”) autographs are high-quality photo scans of an authentic signed photo. They are often sold by celebrities or licensed to collectibles shops to save the celebrity time that would be used to sign multiple copies of a photo. Reprinted autographs are therefore part of the photo itself, and will appear to lie below the glossy surface of the photo.Hold the autograph close to a bright light. A handwritten autograph will reflect differently than the rest of the photo.
 If you can feel the texture of the ink on top of the photo, it could be fake. You might need some practice running your finger over signed photographs before you can identify reprint autographs.To familiarize yourself with the fine variation in texture of a photo that has been autographed, locate an old photo that you don’t mind damaging. Sign it with a similar (or identical) sort of ink. Run your finger along the surface of this “practice autograph” several times.
When you’ve familiarized yourself with the difference between the photo’s surface and the ink’s surface, run your finger over the autograph you’re evaluating.
Touching the photo could cause the ink to smudge and transfer oils from your skin that will, over time, cause the photo to degrade.
 Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and try to erase a bit of the signature. If you’re looking at a preprint autograph, you won’t be able to remove the ink. This method is not ideal, of course, because if you do have an authentic autograph, you will have erased some portion of it.

 If you aren’t interested in being friends with people at school, consider friends or acquaintances outside of school. This may be a cousin or neighbor. You may also look for friends or acquaintances at any out-of-school activities.For example, you may meet people at a music or computer class in the community. You may consider getting a tutor through the Boys and Girls Club or with a local college kid who can teach you a skill.
 You don’t have to join clubs or organizations through the school. You can instead find a club or organization to get involved in through the community. You may do things through the library, with a religious organization, or through a volunteer group.Many communities have after school clubs you can get involved with.
Doing things through a community organization allows you a chance to be a loner while still enjoying doing things.
 You may not want to be friends with most of the people at your school, but you may find other loners and shy kids you can connect with. Maybe there are other kids who are sitting by themselves that you can talk to or work with on projects.You may also look for shy people or introverts in any clubs or organizations. These people may have similar interests as you.

 In order to become a midwife you will need a graduate degree, so you must start by getting a bachelor's degree. Look into midwifery graduate programs to find out exactly what prerequisites you'll need. You should have a solid foundation in the following areas:


The sciences. Take courses in chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology and health.
The social sciences. Take courses in psychology, sociology, and anthropology.
Humanities courses such as women's studies and literature. If possible, study the history of the midwifery profession. Asking midwives about their views and experiences will help you gain more perspective on your planned field.
 If possible, get an internship at a birthing center, or offer to volunteer. Contact midwives in your area and ask for informational interviews. Ask midwives what steps they took to achieve success in their profession.


Keep up with the trends in midwifery. This will help you figure out what types of programs to consider.

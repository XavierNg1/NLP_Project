, Place the bacon in the bowl and toss with two forks until it is coated in the mixture.
 Sprinkle leftover sugar over the top of the bacon.
 Take a second baking pan and lay it on top of the bacon. This will flatten the bacon flat as it cooks.


If you don't have a second baking sheet that fits snugly into the first one, use another oven-safe pan or two.

If you don't have aluminum foil, parchment paper will also work.
 Check the progress of the bacon by lifting the aluminum foil or parchment paper.


If the bacon is brown and crispy, remove it from the oven.

If the bacon is still pale and not crispy, let it continue cooking at the same temperature.

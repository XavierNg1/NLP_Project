 Most frequently, your cat will only see the carrier crate just prior to a trip, which may cause anxiety and stress. It is important for all cats to become accustomed to their carriers, but this is particularly beneficial for nervous cats. Leaving the crate out in the open will help prevent your cat from solely associating it with transportation.Place your cat’s food or treats inside the crate. This will offer a positive association with the crate; if there is yummy food inside, it surely can’t be a bad place!Placing comfortable bedding and familiar and favorite toys within the crate can also set your cat’s anxieties at ease., When the day of travel arrives, place a towel in the floor of the crate. This will help clean up any accidents your cat may have during travel and will keep your cat clean., If your cat does not freely enter the crate on the day of travel, place the crate on its end with the door facing toward the ceiling. Pick up your cat with one hand holding his or her front legs as the other hand supports the bottom., Slowly lower the cat inside the crate, bottom first.This will help prevent a nervous cat from feeling that they are being forced inside or are being trapped., Once the cat is inside, cover the carrier with a towel or light blanket. This will help keep the cat calm and prevent motion sickness.

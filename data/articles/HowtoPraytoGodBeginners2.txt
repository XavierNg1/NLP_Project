 Show respect by humbling yourself before God. Dress plainly (if you can), do not show off your prayer pridefully to those nearby, and pray on your knees with head bowed (if you can).
 You may want to begin by reading a passage from the Bible which has significance and meaning to you. This will open your heart to His word and show him your devotion.
 Thank God for all of his blessings. Thank him for the things that make you happy, that make your life better, or that make the world a better place. Understand that these blessings are God showing his love for his people and should be celebrated and appreciated.
 Ask God's forgiveness for the mistakes that you make. Keep your heart open and remember that we all make mistakes: nobody is perfect. Though you may have trouble admitting it or thinking of a mistake you have made, you will find some way that you can be better. Be sincere and you will know in your heart if God forgives you.
 Ask God's guidance. He isn't a genie or some magical granter of wishes...He is merely there to guide you on the path you are meant to follow. Ask him to lead you and show you the right decisions and the ways to better yourself as a person, as well as the world and people around you.
 Pray for those who you feel need prayers. You can pray for your family, for your friends, or for strangers. Ask God to show them His love and to also help them find their way when they are lost. Do not cast judgement on them or their problems: God is the only Judge and He will do what is right.


Remember that people are not the Devil or demons; they are souls, just as you are, and can be led by God. Don't ask for them to be struck down, ask for them to realize their mistakes and seek forgiveness just as you do.
 Close your prayer in whatever way you feel is appropriate. The most common way is to say 'Amen'.

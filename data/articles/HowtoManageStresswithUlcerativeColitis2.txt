 Ulcerative colitis causes fatigue, so getting enough sleep is important to help prevent flare-ups. Sleep helps renew your body and mind. Too little sleep causes stress due to your body and mind being run down. Getting enough sleep every night can help reduce stress and keep you healthy and energized. You should get on a sleep schedule to ensure quality sleep every night.Adults with UC need eight to nine hours of sleep each night. Try to fall asleep and wake up at the same time every night.

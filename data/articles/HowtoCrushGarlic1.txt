 Place the garlic clove on a cutting board and use a knife to trim off the tip of the root.









Do not cut away too much, or else you will lose good, usable garlic. Only remove the tip.
Removing the root end will make it easier to remove the skin later on.;
, Make sure that it is near the edge of the board, on the side that is nearest to you.
 Make sure the blade is facing away from your hand.
 The clove will easily crush under your weight. Use a rocking motion to crush it thoroughly.


The sharp blade should face out and away from the hand used to strike the knife. If holding the knife with your right hand, the blade should face right. If holding the knife with your left hand, the blade should face left.
 The skin of the broken clove should be loosened and easy to peel away with your fingers.
 You may crush it further, chop it, or mince it. To make a paste, strike it with the broad side of your knife until a paste forms.








You should remove the exposed green shoots in the middle of the garlic clove. These shoots can be plucked out with your fingers. It is recommended that you remove them because they can taste bitter.

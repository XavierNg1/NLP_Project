 Be realistic about the amount of money you are requesting. Explain how you determined the amount. Include relevant quotes. For example, if you are purchasing equipment, include quotes for equipment and supplies. If you are expanding, provide quotes for building costs. Explain how you will use the loan and why you need it., Describe the terms you hope to receive. Include the interest rate and term you expect to receive. Provide sales and cash flow projections to demonstrate that you can make the payments. Realize that interest rates and terms will be negotiated by the lender. They will base their loan terms on their risk assessment of your business., Most loan programs require collateral. Collateral secures the loan because it can be sold in the event that the business cannot repay the loan. Most lenders require at least two forms of loan repayment. The first is cash flow generated from the business. The second would be collateral that is pledged to secure the loan.

 When your dog produces its puppy, the puppy will be covered in a thin membrane (the placental sac). This is the sac that it grows in while gestating inside your dog. Your dog should instinctually remove this membrane from the puppy. However, if your dog doesn’t remove the membrane almost immediately, the puppy could suffocate. Watch the situation and remove the membrane yourself if necessary.To remove the membrane, simply wipe the puppy’s face with a damp cloth. The membrane is not unlike plastic wrap, and tears easily. Wiping your puppy’s face will poke a hole in the membrane and allow your puppy room to wriggle free. If your puppy remains partially stuck in the membrane, manually pull bits of it away until your puppy is free and clear., If your puppy is coughing, it might have placental fluid in its mouth. Check its mouth and throat for fluid. If you see any, use a bulb syringe to remove it. Gently open your puppy’s mouth with one hand and squeeze the bulbous end of the bulb syringe with your other. Insert the pointed end of the syringe into your puppy’s mouth and gently release the bulbous end of the bulb syringe so that it sucks up any liquid in your puppy’s mouth., If your pup is making a raspy noise, swing it with a gentle rocking motion. This rasping is caused by fluid collecting in the puppy’s lungs. To remove this fluid, place the puppy in the palm of your hand with its face cradled snugly between your middle and index fingers. Cup your other hand securely over the puppy’s body and make a downward swinging motion with the puppy still in your hands. This will allow the fluid to clear from the lungs.You might need to do this several times to help the puppy stop rasping.

 Thermal reconditioning (otherwise known as Japanese hair straightening) is a process that straight up breaks the bonds of hair. You'll be left with pin straight hair that will not curl. It's most effective on medium or wavy curls, not kinky hair.


Still interested? The process could set you back anywhere from $500-$1,000, depending on your salon., This is a difficult process to maneuver effectively. You do not want to undergo this with a student who's never done it before. Scope around your town for a stylist that could do it in her sleep.


If things go awry, your hair could get seriously, seriously damaged.Don't cut any corners with this one. Your hair can't afford it.
 You could be there for an entire work day (8 hours), depending on your hair type and how much hair you have. When you go in for touch-ups, that'll take 3 or 4. During this time, the stylist will saturate your strands with a chemical solution, rinse, wash, blow dry, and flat iron until the cows come home.


So bring a good book! Or even better, a friend.
 Basically, your hair needs to be left as is. Nothing that will put a kink in it or take away from the powers of the chemical. Easier said than done, huh?

, Don't bother getting a curling iron or hot rollers -- they won't work. But you will have super straight hair in all weather at all times! Like a miracle, ain't it? Roll outta bed, shower, and you're ready? The others will be green with envy.

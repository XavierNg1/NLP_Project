 Place the toe of one foot on top of the ball. Make sure your body weight is resting with your back leg. Balance your foot lightly and keep the ball still.Switch feet so that your other foot can rest lightly on top of the ball. This is especially important to alternate feet, since many people have a dominant foot or leg that they will favor. Practice your balance for both feet.
 Once you’re able to balance with one toe resting on the top of the ball, start doing little hops with your other foot. Keep your foot resting lightly on top of the ball while you hop.Hop 10 times and then switch legs and try the exercise again.
 Lightly rest the toe of one foot on top of the ball. Remove this foot and put the toe of the other foot on top of the ball. As you get the hang of it, switch your feet at a quicker speed. The goal is to move quickly so that only one foot is on the ground at a time and you’ll add a little hop to switch feet back and forth.

 If you don't have access to Super Mario Galaxy, you'll need to unlock and beat Mirror Mode. Mirror Mode is unlocked after getting a Gold Trophy in every 150cc Cup. 150cc is the fastest mode in Mario Kart Wii and the AI gets much tougher, which means getting Gold Trophies on all the Cups can be pretty difficult. Click here for some tips on performing advanced techniques in Mario Kart Wii.


Beat the Mushroom and Flower Cups to unlock the Star Cup.
Beat the Shell and Banana Cups to unlock the Leaf Cup.
Beat the Star Cup to unlock the Special Cup.
Beat the Leaf Cup to unlock the Lightning Cup.
 Mirror Mode takes all of the regular tracks and reverses the turns so that rights become lefts and vice-versa. Star rankings are determined by a number of factors as you complete the four races in each cup. Basically, race as fast and as cleanly as possible and you shouldn't have much difficulty getting a single Star, but keep the following in mind:Avoid hitting walls and obstacles (you can hit a couple per race and still get one Star).
Avoid going off-road.
Don't fall off the track. Falling off twice during a cup will essentially guarantee no Stars.
Stay in 1st place as much as possible.
Avoid using items to catch up.
Get at least 50 points by the end of the Cup.
 If you've gotten your Star for all of the Cups, but Rosalina isn't appearing, exit the game all the way back to the Wii main menu.
 You'll receive a notification that Rosalina is now available. If you don't get this message, then you likely did not get a Star on at least one of the 150cc Mirror Mode Cups.

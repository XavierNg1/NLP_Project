 Progesterone and estrogen are two widely used medications for hormone replacement.


Progesterone and estrogen combined therapy is used during the perimenopause or phase one of menopause.
Progesterone "only" therapy can be used by women who have their uterus.
Estrogen "only" therapy is used by women that had a hysterectomy or removal of the uterus.
Estrogen "only" taken by women that haven't undergone a hysterectomy have a greater risk for uterine cancer.;
, Generally, a physician prescribes HRT for the following conditions:


Hot flashes - A sudden and temporary increase in body temperature. Sometimes this is referred to as night sweats if it occurs at night.
Vaginal dryness - Hormone contributes to the natural lubrication of the vaginal walls. Lubrication decreases or diminishes with menopause or age
Osteoporosis - HRT has been proven to lower the risk of broken bones
Mood swings - Hormone therapy has been proven to lower the episodes of anxiety and depression in women
Colon cancer - Studies have shown with HRT, colon cancer rates are lower
Dental care - Because the risk of bone loss has decreased, tooth loss has been lowered as well.
 Hormone replacement comes in several forms. The forms are creams, patches, sprays, pills, tablets, vaginal rings and gels.


Pills, gels and creams are time released for the best benefit and are taken or applied daily
Patches are applied one to two times a week

, As with any medication, there are benefits and risks. Studies have shown that the major risks for patients taking HRT are high blood pressure, strokes, headaches, nausea, mood swings, bloating, blood clots, gallbladder disease and water retention.
 Most insurance companies cover the cost of HRT with the exception of the normal co-pay that is paid by the patient. The costs will range from $5 to $40 per month depending on the method used, manufacturer and your health prescription plan.
 There are some medications that have a harmful effect if combined.

 Use a large, flower-shaped cookie cutter to trace flower shapes onto colorful cardstock. Cut the shapes out with a pair of scissors when you are done. How many shapes you trace is up to you.Don't use construction paper. It won't be sturdy enough. If you can't find cardstock, use poster paper instead.
You can draw simple flower shapes instead. You will need 5 to 6 petals for each flower. Make sure that they are big enough to hold your chocolates.
 Draw a line of hot glue down the center of the flower, from top to bottom. Press the stick into the glue, so that it sticks out of the bottom of the flower. You want the stick supporting the entire back of the flower, otherwise it will flop over.If you don't have hot glue, you can use tape instead.
If you can't find green florist sticks, get some short, thin dowels or wooden skewers, and paint them green instead.
 You can also use a glue dot instead. You can find rolls of glue dots in an arts and crafts store. Do not use actual glue for this., Use a small chocolate that is no larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) Small, chocolate squares work the best for this.Use the same color for each petal, and a different color for the center.

You can match the color of the chocolates to the paper, or you can use a different color.
 You don't really have to do this, but it will make the flowers look more interesting. Cut some leaf shapes out of green cardstock, then glue 1 to 2 leaves to the center of each stem., If you need to, use a serrated knife to trim the foam down so that it fits into the vase. If you can't find floral foam, you can use vase filler or regular Styrofoam instead., Arrange the flowers in staggered rows. Push the ones in the first row as far down into the foam as you can, and the ones in the last row just a little bit. This will give your bouquet some varieties in height.

 Once cooled, finely shred the potatoes. You can use the food processor, making sure to use the grating attachment, or use a box grater to grate the potatoes by hand.

How finely you shred the potatoes is up to you. Traditionally, tater tots are finely shred, but if you want more textured tots you can either grate them for less time in the food processor or use a coarse box grater to grate the potatoes., Place the grated potato pulp in a large piece of cheesecloth or inside several paper towels and bring up the corners to make a sack. Use your hands to squeeze the sack of potatoes to drain them until liquid stops dripping out.Potatoes naturally retain a lot of water. Draining the shredded potato will help your tots get crispy.
 Once drained, transfer the shredded potato out of the cheesecloth or paper towel to a large mixing bowl. Add in the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, dill and salt and pepper. Then mix with a large spoon until all the ingredients make an even paste.If you want neutral tasting tots, leave off the garlic powder, onion powder and dill. If you want your tots to have a slight edge, use the garlic powder and salt and pepper but the other flavorings.
 Scoop the mixture out onto a clean cutting board or counter. Pick up small scoops of the mixture and use your hands to shape it into cylindrical tots that are a little shorter than the length of your thumb.

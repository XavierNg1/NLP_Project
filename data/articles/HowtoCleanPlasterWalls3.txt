 If there is a large chunk of excess crayon hanging on the wall, you must first remove the chunk before getting to the underlying stain. Use the knife to pry underneath the crayon and lift. Be careful not to scratch the wall in the process.Do not use a sharp knife.
 Wet a Magic Eraser and rub the wall with it in a gentle, circular motion. This should remove any remaining chunks of crayon., To pick up the last bits of stain, wet a sponge in hot water. Squeeze excess water out of the sponge. Then rub the stain in a circular motion.Consider placing a towel on the ground to absorb any spilt water.
 Use a soft towel or a dry sponge. Rub the wet area with a gentle circular stroke. Stop when the wall is no longer moist.

 The best den to use for a birthday party is the Small House. Bigger dens can be hard to fill up, and the smaller the den, the bigger the party seems!, You don't want your guests to go hungry! The feast table from Epic Wonders works well. If you're a nonmember, just get a big table and cover it in different nonmember food items., Most birthday parties have cake. There are tons of cake items in AJ. You could use the AJ birthday promo code cake because they are interactive and fun. Using one of these is popular, but there are different, purchasable den-item cakes, and even huge cupcake displays! If you don't have access to cake, you can always get ice cream, cookies, or other desserts.

AJHQ (Animal Jam Headquarters)Â  releases promo cakes once a year, to celebrate the aging of the game. The promo cake codes can be found on the AJ blog called the Daily Explorer.

Around the start of September, they will release a new code. The code is usually AJBDAY with a number on the end (e.g. AJBDAY6).
 Balloons, streamers, flashy lights are awesome to use! Every birthday needs balloons-and there are even more balloon items than there are cake! Get plenty, and scatter them around your den., This step is almost totally up to you. You can make a pile of items you like, (plushies work well for this) or, you can hunt down a Jamaaliday present item. There are plenty of those-big, colorful piles of gift bags and boxes.

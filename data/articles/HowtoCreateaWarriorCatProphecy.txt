 How did your cat find out about about the prophecy? Did he/she see it in a dream, go to the Moonstone/Moonpool and share tongues with StarClan, receive an omen, or (if they are a leader) see it at their nine lives ceremony?
, Who are the cats mentioned in the prophecy? Which cat or cats must receive the prophecy? Also determine the cat or cats who give the prophecy. This will usually be a StarClan cat, one whom was important to the cat(s) in question., Every prophecy needs a main message or meaning. For example, in the books, the prophecy "Fire alone will save the Clan." (Erin Hunter), serves a great purpose. Say there's a cat named Rosethorn, and she is destined to save the forest. This is a useful example to follow through with., Just saying that Rosethorn will save the forest is dull and lacks emphasis. Make is seem more mysterious and cryptic. Maybe you could try something like: "The flower will bloom, and become the light that shines from the stars and break through the darkness of shade".

Do not make the prophecy obvious. Include twists that are not immediately apparent to the reader or the cat.
 They will include hints about their meaning but will be vague and open to interpretation. They are also usually highly symbolic. For example, if the characters are Icetalon and Whitefire, don't say "The ice will beat the white", instead, say something like: "Frozen talons may be strong enough to rip apart the white destruction.", How will the cat fulfill the prophecy? Do they need to find, rescue or kill another cat? Locate the Clans safely across unknown paths? Do they need to die themselves? Maybe go against the forces of nature? Or maybe even go against the warrior code and abandon their clans?, Say that Rosethorn gets this prophecy. She could be told by her mother who died and went to StarClan.

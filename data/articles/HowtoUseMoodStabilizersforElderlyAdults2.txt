 When you start taking mood stabilizers, you should start slow. Your doctor will put you on a small dose at first and slowly increase your dosage. This help prevent having too much of any of the mood stabilizers in your body due to a decreased metabolism.


You will start at one dose for a week or two and then increase your dose slowly until your doctor gets you to the dose needed every day.
This will vary for each medication, so make sure you follow your doctorâ€™s orders about how much of your medications to take., If you have a hard time keeping what medications you take a day straight, consider getting a weekly pill box. This can be especially helpful when you are working towards the recommended dose for your mood stabilizer. You can fill the pill box up as soon as the week starts with the correct medication dosages from your medication information.


This will cut down on the possibility of missing a dose or forgetting what dose you need to take each day., Many of the mood stabilizers have harsh side effects. Some of these can be hard on you during the day. Instead of taking your dosage of medicine during the day, consider taking it at night. This can help you avoid some of the symptoms because you will sleep through when they are most likely to occur.


Make sure this scheduling for your mood stabilizers is okay with your doctor., There are certain health issues that can arise if you are taking mood stabilizers. If you are taking most mood stabilizers, you should have your plasma levels checked regularly. You can end up with toxic levels of the medication in your blood, which can cause severe health issues. This can also help you check for anemia, which is a common symptom of carbamazepine.You should also keep a check on your kidney function while on mood stabilizers. Your kidneys filter your blood and urine and they can be affected by new medications. You should keep a close watch on your kidneys if you have had any renal dysfunction or disease in the past.

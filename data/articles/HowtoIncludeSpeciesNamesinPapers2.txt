 In the biological classification system, the classifications go from more general to more specific. “Species” is considered the most basic grouping of biology; members of the same species look like one another and are biologically similar. Also, they can reproduce with one another. For instance, humans belong the kingdom Animalia and more specifically, to the phylum Chordata.


From there, the classifications keeping going down: class Mammalia, subclass Theria, infraclass Eutheria, order Primates, suborder Anthropodia, family Hominidae, genus Homo, and species sapiens. Each category narrows down the members.






For instance, thousands of species belong in the Animalia kingdom, but currently only one living species belongs in the genus homo. Therefore, “genus” is broader than “species.”







, Find a high quality site to help you find the name of the species you are looking up. Sites like Britannica will have that kind of information. Search for the animal or plant by the common name it is normally referred to as.


For instance, to look up the species of your house cat, you’d search for domesticated cat, since they belong to the larger cat family. The species of a house cat is “catus,” while the genus is “Felis.”







, Sometimes, you will have to narrow down to the species name carefully. For instance, “crepe myrtle” refers to the genus Lagerstroemia. The genus has over 50 species in it, so you will have to choose the correct species. However, knowing the common name will help you find the species name.

 Though this method is likely to get you in trouble, it will definitely get the girl's attention -- and will make her more likely to say yes. Find the person who does the morning announcements at school and slip him a 20-dollar bill for asking the girl if she'll be your prom date at the end of the announcements. She'll be guaranteed to hear it and will be flattered by all of the attention.
 Take out your old Legos or borrow some from your kid brother, and spell out "Prom?" will the blocky letters. You can place them in a hallway after school, where the girl will be sure to see them, or you can even lead her outside and then ask her, "Hey, what's that over there?" Wait for her to approach the letters and break into a smile., Write, "Will you go to prom with me?" on a piece of paper and cut it up into several "puzzle pieces." Place them in a small bag and ask the girl to put the puzzle together for you. Once she solves the puzzle, she'll be impressed that you took so much time to put together your prom proposal., Take some sidewalk chalk and ask her to go to prom with you in writing in a big, open place. It can be the sidewalk in a park, or in her driveway or your own -- as long as your parents don't mind. If you spend a lot of time and effort on making the letters, then she'll be truly impressed.
 If you know her class schedule, you should sneak into her next classroom a bit early, and write, "Will you go to prom with me?" on the board. You can write your names on the board as well. This will work whether you're in the same class or not. Just be careful -- it'll definitely make her blush!

, Stick a post-it with the letter "P" on her locker. When she sees it and takes it off, sneak up and stick one that says "R" on it. Keep going until you've individually stuck on post-its that spell "P-R-O-M?" and you reveal your identity.

 If you've got lectures at 5pm and you had three hours sleep the night before, the chances of you being alert are very low. Take a nap before the lecture if needs be but try to stick to a good sleeping schedule all through term.;
, Eat well and choose healthy, nutritious food for the majority of your snacks as well as meals. Eat slow-burning foods to give you sustained energy through a lecture; use energy bars if needed.
 This might help to wake you up and keep you alert for the duration of the lecture.
 This can be a good method for creating the focus that you might not otherwise have. Spend time highlighting parts that you find are particularly relevant or should be remembered/looked up after the lecture. This type of focus will help the lecture to pass quickly.
 This means listening attentively and having done your homework beforehand.

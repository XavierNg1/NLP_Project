 You will need to program the voice mail number into your phone if you want to access voice mail from your unlocked cell phone.


Contact your GSM carrier directly to determine the number for the voice mail system. If your carrier is T-Mobile, the voice mail number will be +1-805-637-7243.
 This will prevent you from having to enter the number manually each time you want to listen to your voice mail messages.


Refer to your manual to determine how you can add phone numbers to your contact list or program your voice mail number into your speed dial.



Dial your voice mail number to verify you can access your voice mailbox. Depending on your voice mailbox settings, you may need to enter a password to access your voice mail.

 When you encounter an abandoned baby raccoon in the wild, it is very likely that he is dehydrated. Before you can offer him any food, you must offer a hydration solution (or Pedialyte). Offer this in an eye-dropper or pet baby bottle.Look for plain, unflavored, unsweetened Pedialyte.
 Mix ½ teaspoon salt + ½ tablespoon of sugar + 2 cups of water. Warm this mixture slightly to dissolve the sugar and salt. Use this only until you can get to the store and purchase Pedialyte., Take your bottle of rehydration solution and submerge it in a container of hot water, until the solution warms to body temperature. Your baby raccoon is more likely to drink it if it mimics the temperature of his mama’s milk. It will also be more easily absorbed into his system this way., Using a warm washcloth or feather, you will need to stimulate the anus and urethra of your baby raccoon until he begins to urinate. Continue to offer rehydration solution until your raccoon is producing light yellow urine., When you feel that the baby is adequately hydrated, begin to integrate milk replacement formula (KMR or Esbilac). Start slowly, including small portions of milk replacement into his rehydration solution, and work up to full formula.3 parts rehydration solution, 1 part milk replacement for two feedings.
2 parts rehydration solution, 2 parts milk replacement for two feedings.
1 part rehydration solution, 3 parts milk replacement for one or two feedings.
Pure milk replacement.

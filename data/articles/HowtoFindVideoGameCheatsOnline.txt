 Is it a PC, or is it one of the console units (such as Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, or Sony's PlayStation 2/3/4)? Make a mental note of your gaming platform as sometimes the codes are different across platforms, even if they're for the exact same game.;
, It helps to be as specific as possible. For example, are you playing "Zelda," or is it actually "Zelda: Majora's Mask?" Make a note of the specific game you are playing. This is especially true if the game you are playing is part of a series. Just searching for "guitar hero cheats" may not get you to where you want.
 Type in the name of your game, the gaming platform, and the word "cheats." For example, if you are playing "Halo 2" on Xbox, type in Halo 2 Xbox cheats. If you want to go one step further, you could also search directly into a cheat website such as gamesradar.com.


For games that are available on more than one console, include the console in your search criteria.
 Choose a site that offers cheat codes for your game and platform. More often then not, one should jump out at you immediately. If it doesn't, there's a chance that there are just no cheats available for your game.


If you find a particular cheat website that you really like, you might want to bookmark it for future use, too.
, If you're really struggling, try looking for some sort of cheat menu, perhaps within the main menu or settings of the game.

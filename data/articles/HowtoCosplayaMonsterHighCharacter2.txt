 Frankie is friendly, sweet, and polite with a clumsy streak. Since Frankie's new, she likes to try out different things, don't be afraid to try different foods and after school activities. Cheerleading is a recommended after school activity you can join. You can be like Frankie by being nice to everyone, and having an upbeat attitude even in sad situations. Never give up!

, Frankie wears a lot of plaid, skirts preppy clothes. For Frankie's basic look, wear a plaid skirt, a polo shirt and Mary Janes. For her Dawn of the Dance look, wear a black and/or white dress, a pink jacket or feather boa, and silver jewelry. For the Gloom Beach look, wear A black and yellow swimsuit with a plaid wrap.
 Frankie has black hair with silver streaks. Again, buy some silver and/or black clip-on highlights. Wear your hair long and loose, if you're more of the Girly type, wear bartered or you hair up in a poof.
 Because of her monster heritage, Frankie has green skin, you don't have to, though. Use some green and/or blue eyeshadow, blush and red lipstick and/or lip gloss.

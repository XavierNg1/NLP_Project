 Most cellular and landline phone carriers offer a permanent line block that will prevent your caller ID information from being transmitted to the receiver for every call you make. There will likely be a fee for this service, but you won't have to punch in an extra code before every call.


Most North American cellular providers can be reached by calling 611 on a mobile device.
Some callers have automatic rejection systems set up that will decline calls from blocked numbers. Your phone provider will have a code that will allow you to temporarily disable your caller ID block on a per-call basis in case you need to contact these numbers.
 Most mobile phones provide the option to turn caller ID on and off, and this should usually allow you to get through to phones that have blocked your number as well. Phones are configured differently and can even vary between carriers, but for cell phones that offer this feature:


On iPhones: go to Settings > Phone > Show My Caller ID. Then turn off caller ID. This will work for many carriers but not all; for example, Verizon requires that you change these settings on their website rather than on the phone itself.On Samsung phones: go to Apps > Settings > My Device. Then select Call, and from there Call Settings > Additional settings > Caller ID. Then select Hide Number.On HTC phones: from the Menu, select Settings > Call > Additional Settings > Caller ID. Select Hide Number.On LG phones: from the Phone application, select Call Settings. Find and select Caller ID, and then select Hide Number.On Blackberrys: from the Phone application, select the Blackberry button > Options > In-Call Settings. Under Restrict My Identity, select Always. Press the Blackberry button > Save.
 There are several apps for mobile phones that will block your caller ID if your cell phone doesnâ€™t offer the option to turn it off. From your application store, look for apps such as CallerID Blocker.

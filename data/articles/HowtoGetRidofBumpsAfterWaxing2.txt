For example, after you wax your eyebrows, wash your face with an everyday, gentle facial cleanser., You can soothe freshly waxed skin with a gentle application of witch hazel. Dip a cotton ball in with hazel. Then, smooth it across the area that was waxed. You can purchase with hazel at your local drug store or online., Lotions, oils, and other types of moisturizers can clog the pores of freshly waxed skin. Avoid applying these products right after a wax. If you find your skin needs extra moisture, try aloe vera gel instead., One way to cut down on the bumps some people get after waxing is by icing. Apply ice to the waxed area to help reduce inflammation. Make sure the ice pack or bag containing ice is clean so that you do not inadvertently introduce bacteria and dirt to your waxed skin., Tight clothes can trap dirt and sweat, contributing to the appearance of post-wax bumps. Try wearing loose, breathable clothing after a wax. This will allow your skin to breathe and may help prevent the appearance or exacerbation of unsightly bumps.For example, you should avoid wearing tights after a bikini wax. Instead, opt for loose fitting pants or a skirt.

 Many governments recommend that people eat more oily fish every week for the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, and there’s evidence that consuming actual fish benefits pregnant women more than taking supplements does.Examples of oily fish include mackerel, salmon, trout, herring, anchovies, and sardines. Tinned/canned tuna, cod, and haddock are, in contrast, not oily fish.A serving size of oily fish consists of 3.5 ounces (100 g).
 Though farmed salmon does indeed contain omega-3 fatty acids, it’s overall less nutritious than wild salmon—for example, it contains only an eighth as much vitamin D, and only a third as much vitamin A. It’s also fattier, meaning that it collects and stores significantly more contaminants and toxins than its wild counterpart does.Many places, such as the E.U. and the U.S., require manufacturers to label farmed and wild fish, as well as to identify whether or not dye has been added. In other places though, like Canada, this explicit indication is not required by law., Mercury exposure can disrupt and destroy neurological and organ health, and it’s particularly harmful to young children and fetuses. Indeed, the U.S. government estimates that as many as 75,000 newborns each year are at higher risk of developing learning disabilities later in life due to mercury exposure in the womb. You can limit your exposure to mercury by cutting out your consumption of predatory fish, such as shark, king mackerel, and tuna.Even if you’re eating wild salmon, don’t eat more than two portions a week, as it can still contain pollutants harmful to you and your baby, such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
 Raw fish (such as sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio) and refrigerated smoked seafood should be avoided due to the risk of food poisoning or listeria poisoning. Make sure that all fish is refrigerated promptly after purchase and consumed within one to two days. Always cook seafood to an internal temperature of 145°F (62.8°C).

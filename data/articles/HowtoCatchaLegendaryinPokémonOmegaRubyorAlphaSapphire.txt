 It's always recommended to save your games before big battles so you can restart if you knock it out, accidentally use a Master Ball, or get a spawn with terrible moves.;
, Most legendary Pokémon spawn at level 50, so make sure you're prepared to fight. You may want something to inflict a status effect on the Pokémon, such as Sleep Powder. Avoid poisoning the Pokémon, as poisoning it may accidentally knock out the Pokémon, and you will have to restart and try again.


If possible, have the move False Swipe so you can get the Pokémon's HP down to one. The lower the health, the higher the catch chance. Status effects, such as sleep and paralysis, also help to increase your chances of catching the legendary.
 Once you've sufficiently lowered the legendary's HP, throw an Ultra Ball at the Pokémon. Be sure to have plenty on hand, as if you run out mid-battle, you may have to flee, or use a Poké Ball that you didn't want to use!


If the battle lasts for more than 30 turns, you can also use Timer Balls on it. Timer Balls work better the longer the battle goes on.
Dusk Balls will also work well if you're playing during the nighttime.

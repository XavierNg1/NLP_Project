Click the Discord app (a light blue icon with a white smiling game controller) in the Windows menu (PC) or the Applications folder (Mac). If you’re not already signed in, sign in now.;
, Servers are listed as icons along the left side of the screen., It’s at the top of the second panel. A slide-out menu will appear., It’s the last option in the menu., You are no longer connected to the Discord server.

You can join the server again later if you have an invitation URL. To get one, ask another server member or search for one online.

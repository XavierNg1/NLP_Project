 The labels will often provide useful insight on how to remove stains from a specific article of clothing. Additionally, the information provided on the tag will ensure you do not mishandle or damage your clothing with improper washing technique.;
, Before you begin washing, always pre-soak the clothing and keep the stain wet using cold water. This will prevent the stain from drying, thereby "setting" and becoming far more difficult to remove.


If possible, keep the stained area completely submerged in water.
If it is impossible to submerge the stain, blot it with water. Never rub, because rubbing the stain can spread it around the fabric, creating a larger stain than you originally had.
 Heat will speed the setting of most types of stains. Therefore, avoid placing the stained material near any heat sources or in direct sunlight, and use only cold water and solvents when treating it.
 Don't vigorously press the fabric or scrub forcefully. You want to avoid grinding the stain deeper into the fabric, beyond the surface level.

 Brush gently to remove all tangles. Part your hair as usual. The fewer tangles in your hair, the neater the look turns out.;
, Take one very small section of your hair from the front, near your hairline. Twist it three times. As you do this, bring it back toward the crown of your head.


If your hair has trouble with volume, grab a larger chunk of hair instead. Tease it up with a teasing comb and hairspray. Lightly twist the end once and pin it down.
 Push it slightly forward to create a small bump, about 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) high. Pin this section to the crown of your head.
 Make a ponytail out of the remaining hair. Secure it with a hair tie near the nape of your neck.
 Take a lock of hair from under the ponytail and wrap it around the 'tail, covering the hair tie. Bobby pin it in place. This looks really cute with a bump in front.


This works best with a high ponytail.
 To ensure that your twisty bump stays in place, secure it with hairspray. Enjoy your new, bouffant look.

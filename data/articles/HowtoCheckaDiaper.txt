 Sometimes it may be time to change their diaper, once they begin crying. You may know that you have to change a nappy, if the baby cries. Maybe if you're babysitting or something like that, the baby will burst into tears. Remember to focus on other reasons before ripping the nappy open.;
, Turn the baby around and take a good whiff, if you are brave enough! Just hold up the baby, smell and let your senses do the rest. If you are close to passing out then yeah, the baby needs changing.
 REMEMBER, this is only for the brave hearted, or if you feel comfortable enough doing this. however the nappy is soft and plump so this step might not get you far.
 A diaper that moves like jelly is mostly wet and will need to be changed soon (or immediately)., and take a look for yourself. But do this in hygienic places. Not in the middle of the street.

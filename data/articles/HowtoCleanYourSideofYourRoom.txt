 Pick up your clothes from the floor, under your bed, or even on the other person's side (it happens somehow).


Put the dirty clothes in your hamper.
Put the clean clothes in your drawers or hang it up.
Don't get them mixed up! Your side should look at least a tad more cleaner.;
, The ones you know the vacuum won't suck up. A trash bag would really help. If there's something on your side that's the other person's, just give it to them.
 Also, vacuum the corners, there might be small trash in them.
 By now your side/floor should be clean!

,,,, Sit back and watch as the other person struggles to clean their side.

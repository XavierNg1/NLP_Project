 Before you begin measuring, stand still with your arms at your sides. Hold your arms slightly bent, with your fingers tucked into your front pockets.
 Begin at the middle of the upper back, slightly below the nape of your neck.
 Measure the length from the middle of the upper back to the stitching located at the shoulder of the shirt. Write this measurement down, as you will need it later.
 Measure the length from the top stitching on the shoulder to the bottom of the wrist. Aim for hitting your wrist bone with the measuring tape. Be careful not to measure too high above the wrist, or the dress shirt's sleeves will come to be too short.
 Add these two values together to find your sleeve length. The value should range anywhere from about 32 - 37 inches (81.3 - 94 cm).

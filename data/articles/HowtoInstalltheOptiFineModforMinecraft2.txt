 Visit optifine.net/downloads to see the list of available files. OptiFine comes in a single JAR file.


If you keep Minecraft updated to the latest version, you can simply download the OptiFine file from the top of the list. If you run an older version of Minecraft, you'll want to scroll through the list until you find your Minecraft version, and then download the latest release for it.
 This will open the OptiFine installer.


If you cannot open the JAR file, you may not have Java installed. You can install Java for free from java.com/download. See How to Install Java for more instructions.
If you have another program associated with JAR files, such as WinRAR, right-click on the file and select "Open with." Select "Java Platform SE binary" from the list of available programs. You'll need to have Java installed for this option to appear.
 This will install the OptiFine files to the correct location automatically.
 To use OptiFine, you'll need to select it from the Profile menu.
 This will launch Minecraft with the OptiFine mod.
 You can adjust OptiFine's settings in-game by opening the Options menu and selecting "Video Settings." You'll see all of the additional OptiFine settings that you can adjust to get the best performance possible.

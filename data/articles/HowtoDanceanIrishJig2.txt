 This is stance as described in the previous section. Your right toe should be pointed outward and your hands at your sides.
 Lift up your pointed right toe for a hop. Move around to the right side, doing a double hop on your skip, and place your right two down on 2, back toe down on 3. Keep your toes up the entire time, both feet turned out.
 You should be circling counterclockwise, about halfway around in a circle by this juncture. As you move around, make sure your toes are always pointed and your heel off the ground.


Straighten your knee when doing the skips and bring it back fully toward your butt on the return. Keep your torso steady as you use your leg's full range of motion. You should land with your right foot forward on 3.
 Only this time, lead with your left. It should end crossed in front of your right foot, still on your toes.
 Do this with your right leg, lifting your knees high. The first step is a normal hop, but the second two are hops back. The second hop back is with your left leg, landing on the ground on 2, shift weight forward to the right on 3, and back to the left on 4.


When you do your hops, try to bring your foot above your knee. The higher, the better. When you're skipping, try to touch your butt with the back of your foot before you bring it forward.
 Now that you're halfway around, repeat the same steps, but this time starting with your left foot pointed out in front of you. Return to the position on the floor at which you started.


That's it! You've mastered the Lead Around!

 For your deep conditioning mask, you'll need 1 egg-white, 1 avocado, a tablespoon of olive oil, and a tablespoon of honey. These measurements can be altered depending on how long and thick you hair is., Using a blender or food processor, add all your ingredients and blend them on high until a creamy consistency has formed. If you don't have a blender, you can mash the ingredients together manually, but it will take a bit more time., Scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips, and spread it throughout your hair, focusing primarily on the ends of each strand. When you've used all of the mask, you can wrap your hair up in a shower-cap to prevent the mask from rubbing off on your clothes., Leave the mask for 20-30 minutes to allow time for it to soak into your hair. You can leave it on for longer if you would like, but make sure that you wait at least 20 minutes., Remove your shower-cap and run your hair under warm water in the shower. Using just the warm water, wash out all of the remaining mask. If you need to, you can use shampoo, but try to avoid it because it will dry out your hair again. When you're finished washing your hair out, dry your hair with a towel., You can apply this mask to your hair 1-2 times a week for the optimal results. Otherwise, apply this avocado mask to your hair whenever it starts to appear dull, frizzy, or is dry and damaged to the touch.

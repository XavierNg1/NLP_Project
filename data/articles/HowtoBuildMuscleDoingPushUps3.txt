 This type of push up involves elevating your feet. Start by elevating your feet about 10 to 12 inches from the ground. Then do a normal push up.Use a stack of books or another type of platform to elevate your feet.
The higher you elevate your feet, the harder the push up will be.
 Get into the normal push up position. Make sure your back is straight, your feet are shoulder width apart, and your elbows are tucked into your sides. Then lift one of your legs and perform a regular push up.Do a number you are comfortable with. Then repeat the push up, lifting your other leg.
 Position your hands in front of your chest on the floor. Press your thumbs and fingers together to form a diamond shape with your hands. Make sure your legs and back are straight. Then do a normal push up.Diamond push ups are great for working out your triceps.
 For this push up, place your feet wider than shoulder width apart. Place one hand more to the center of your chest. Place your other hand behind your back. Then lower yourself and push up. Make sure to keep your elbow close to your body as you do your push ups.If one-handed push ups are difficult for you, then start training your body by doing a regular push up, but with your hands close together like a diamond push up. This will help you progress from the regular, two-handed push ups to the more difficult one-handed push ups.
 Get into the standard push up position. Lower yourself to the floor as you normally would while doing a regular push up. As you extend back up, push up as fast as you can and with as much force as you can until your hands become airborne. Then go back to the starting position and repeat.Challenge yourself by clapping your hands while they are airborne in between push ups.

 This can be said in a number of ways. The most basic is "Hola!" (OH-lah), which you probably learned from Dora as a kid.


Although this is short and simple, longer words may be used to spice it up and make you seem more educated. Try using, "Buenos días!"(BWEH-nos-DEE-as), which means "Good morning!". Also, you could use, "Buenas tardes!" (BWEH-nas-tard-ehs), which means "Good afternoon!", depending on the time of the day.;
, (COH-MOH-teh-jam-as).
 To say, "my name is _____", say "me llamo _____" (m-eh-JAH-moh_____). The blank below is for your name, such as "me llamo Teresa".
 Say "Mucho gusto" (moo-choh-goos-toh) for "nice to meet you", literally meaning "much pleasure". Someone could then respond either "Igualmente!" (IG-wall-men-teh), or "El gusto es mío" (EL-goos-toh-es-MEE-oh). The former means "Nice to meet you, too" (literally "likewise"), and the latter means "The pleasure is mine".
 Someone will usually ask this question with "¿De dónde eres?" (DEE-don-day-air-es).
 You or the other person will answer "¿De dónde eres?" with, "Yo soy de ______" (YO-SOY-DEH-). The blank would be your country. The US is ( Estados Unidos ).
 This is asked using "¿Cómo estas?" (COH-MOH-est-ahs) for "how are you?"

, There are multiple answers to the above question. You use "Yo estoy" (I am _____). Options for the blank are: "bien", meaning good, (BEE-en), "feliz", meaning happy, (fel-LEASE), "mal" meaning "bad", "cansado", meaning tired, (con-sods-oh), and enfermo, meaning sick, (en-fer-MOH).
 To ask this, you would say "¿Cuantos años tines?", literally meaning "How many years do you have?". It is pronounced: "KWAN-tos-an-YOS-TEE-en-ehs".
 You would answer that question with a number, obviously. For a list of numbers, see Count up to 10 in Spanish, Count from 10 to 19 in Spanish, Count from 20 to 39 in Spanish, and Count from 40 to 100 in Spanish.
 Someone would ask this by saying "¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?" (KWAN-doh-es-TOO-coom-PLEH-ahn-YOSE).
 You would say your birthday by answering "Es el ____ de _____" (Es-el) and (DEH). The first blank would be the date, such as the second (dos), the thirty first (treinta y uno) or the nineteenth (diecinueve). See Count up to 10 in Spanish, Count from 10 to 19 in Spanish and Count from 20 to 39 in Spanish, for a list of numbers. The second blank would be the month, such as July (julio), August (agosto), or March (marzo). See Say the Calendar Months in Spanish for a list of months.
 Most people know how to say "Bye" in Spanish. "Adios!", or (AH-DEE-OHS). If it is evening or night, say "¡Buenas noches!", or "Good night!", pronounced (BUEN-AHS-NO-CH-EHS).
 Try to do this without the help of anything but your own memory.

 Set a price range for yourself and stay within it. Opals can be purchased to be set as rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets. The size of your opal will be determined by how you want to wear it.


For example, if you are buying opals to set as earrings, you will be choosing smaller stones than what you’d choose for a pendant or bracelet.
If you are shopping for a highly valuable opal, you’ll want the setting to also be of high quality., The range of colors exhibited when viewed from different angles (known as the play of color) is one aspect of this. Highly valuable opals will feature a range of brilliant hues that change and flash, depending on your perspective. The more play, the higher the price. The pattern of color is another factor. An opal without a full play of color can still have striking and unique patterns that increase their value. Patterns to look for are color ribbons, harlequin, rainbows and other variations.


The rarest visible color in opals is red, making it the most pricey, followed by orange, yellow, green, and blue. Blue is the most common visible color in opals.The most common pattern is the “floral” pattern, which can be described as colors that are randomly spread throughout the face of the stone., Opals can range from transparent to opaque. The value of the clarity level depends on what kind of opal it is. A crystal opal of high value will feature extreme clarity and transparency. On the other hand, black opals are considered more valuable if they are opaque.


Cloudy or milky stones are considered to be the least valuable.Clarity can also be disrupted by flaws like fractures, surface blemishes, cracks and pits. All of these will decrease the value of an opal.

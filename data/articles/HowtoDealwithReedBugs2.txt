Take everything out of your case and thoroughly vacuum it.
Make sure you vacuum any small corners and spaces because there might be some bugs that are hiding amidst the cloth.
 Then freeze them overnight.

Make sure you freeze them with the case on, because there might be bugs hiding in the case.
Don't leave them in the freezer for more than 12 hours because it may change the shape of the reed and affect your playing.
When you finish freezing your reeds, you can defrost them by rinsing them in tap water.

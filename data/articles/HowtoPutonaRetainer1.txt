 This is made of plastic and wires. The plastic piece is shaped to the inside of your mouth. The wires should fit around the front row of your teeth (usually the front six), with more wires in the back to hold it firmly in place over your back teeth., You will need to know whether the retainer is for your top or bottom row of teeth. The plastic arch in the center should be pointing up or down toward the row of teeth it will hold in place. Make sure the metal strip is pointed away from your mouth., Make sure it is close to the right row of teeth. Don't hold it there for a long time â€” this is a quick step to make sure you push it on all at once.


Don't use too much force as you may hurt your gums if you didn't place it correctly. Check the position in a mirror while opening wide your mouth.
 Do this quickly after placing it in your mouth. Make sure the plastic arch fits perfectly into the roof or base of your mouth, that the wire in the front fits perfectly around your front teeth, and that the wires in the back fit around your back teeth. If your retainer does not fit properly, call your dentist or orthodontist, as it probably needs an adjustment. This could be either the wires around your teeth, or the plastic in your mouth.
 Use your fingers to push it into place if need be. Do not bite the retainer into place, as that may damage it. You should hear a click when it fits into place. If your retainer is falling out, or not staying in place, you may not have anchored it properly, or you may need to see your dentist or orthodontist to adjust the retainer.

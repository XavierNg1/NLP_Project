 Find a maple tree or a grove of maple trees. Walk around and collect the seedpods, also known as whirligigs because of the way they whirl when they fall from the tree. The seedpods look like brown wings or helicopter propellers.During the spring and summer, the seedpods are immature. Consequently, they are green and still attached to the tree’s branches. Pluck them from the tree and bring them home. Place them on a windowsill to ripen and dry out until they are brown.
 The paper will be used to catch the silver hairs that are attached to the wing part of the seedpod. The silver hairs are what cause the itching sensation.To protect your hands, put on a pair of rubber gloves.
 Use scissors to detach the wings from the actual seed. Also, cut away the spine that runs along the edge of the wing., Take two wings and rub them against each other until the silver hairs begin to fall off. Do this until the majority of the silver hairs have fallen off. Repeat this process for all of the wings until you have about 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of silver hairs.Alternatively, you can use a razor blade to remove the silver hairs. Run the blade against the wings to remove the silver hairs.
 Pick up the piece of paper and slide the hairs into a sealable plastic bag. Store the hairs in a dark place, like a cupboard, for two to three days to dry them out further. This will increase their itching intensity.You can also store the hairs in a glass vial.
For cautionary purposes, place a label on the bag that says, “CAUTION. DO NOT TOUCH OR THROW AWAY.”

 Take the liquid you want to purify and pour it into the distilling flask. Only fill the flask between half and two-thirds full, so the liquid does not take too long to evaporate., You can use a stand to hold the flask above the burner or heat source.


You may also want to use a basin filled with sand to rest the distilling flask on instead of directly over the burner. This will prevent the liquid from boiling too violently.
 Attach one end of the condenser to the vent at the top of the distilling flask. The condenser should be angled downward to help the water flow toward the collection flask.The condenser has two tubes, one inside of the other. The condenser will transfer the vapor to the collection container and help to cool it back into a liquid form.
 Place the cup or flask beneath the opening on the end of the condenser. The liquid will drip out as the vapor cools and collect in the cup below.


You can also choose to connect the collection container directly to the condenser if you have the materials to do so.
 Bring the water to a boil.


Monitor the temperature. You may want to use a thermometer to monitor the temperature and keep the water just above the boiling point so it doesn't heat too quickly. Adjust the burner level if needed.
 Turn the heat off once the distilling flask is mostly empty. Do not heat the flask until dry as you could damage the glass. Let the liquid cool in the collection flask.


If you want the collected liquid to cool faster, you can place the collection container in a bath of cold or ice water.

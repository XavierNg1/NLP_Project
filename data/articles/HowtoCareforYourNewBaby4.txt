 Babies do sleep a lot but not for very long periods of time. Each child will have it’s own natural sleep rhythm which you will learn with time. Try to accommodate it and plan your own sleep schedule as much as you can.
 Your baby may need help falling asleep, so know some basic ways to help your baby. You can hold your baby in your arms or up on your shoulder and either walk with them or rock them in a chair. Babies respond well to repetitive sounds, so make cooing sounds or you can sing them a lullaby.
 Swaddling is a method of wrapping up a baby in a blanket so that they don’t move. While it might seem strange to an adult, it is extremely comforting for a baby as it makes them feel secure. It will also keep them from surprising themselves if they move in their sleep. Watch the video below to learn how to swaddle your baby.
 SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, is a very mysterious condition which you will want to protect against. No one particularly understands what causes it and some question whether it exists at all, but there are a few practices which seem to be related to the deaths. Avoid these and your baby should be fine:


Protect your baby by always putting them to sleep on their back
Don’t put a pacifier into your baby’s mouth
Use a firm mattress in your baby’s crib
Remove soft or fluffy bedding and stuffed animals

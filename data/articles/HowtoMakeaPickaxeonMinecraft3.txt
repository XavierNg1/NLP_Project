 One of your first priorities for mining will be to make a stone pickaxe. Mine three stone blocks with your wooden pickaxe to get cobblestone, then select the stone pickaxe recipe. On the computer edition, just follow the same recipe for a wooden pickaxe but replace the planks with cobblestone. These are the advantages to a stone pickaxe:Breaks blocks faster than the wooden pickaxe

Can mine iron ore (beige-flecked stone) and lapis lazuli ore (dark blue-flecked stone)

, Iron ore is usually not hard to find with a short mining expedition or visit to a shallow cave. Mine at least thee of these beige-flecked blocks of stone, then turn them into a pickaxe as follows:



Craft a furnace our of eight cobblestone.
Place the iron ore in the top slot of the furnace, and coal or other fuel in the bottom slot.
Wait for the furnace to smelt the ore into iron ingots.
Craft an iron pickaxe from three iron ingots and two sticks.
An iron pickaxe can mine all types of ore, including gold, redstone, diamond, and emerald ores., This is probably the least useful of the pickaxes, since it's weaker than iron. If you just like the shine, you can mine gold ore, smelt it into ingots, and craft it into a pickaxe. The process is identical to the iron pickaxe instructions above.


Gold ore is usually found about 32 blocks below sea level or lower.
 Diamond is an extremely rare ore only found far below the surface. If you manage to locate this light blue-flecked stone, you can craft an extra-strong, extra-durable diamond pickaxe out of three diamonds and two sticks.


There is no need to smelt diamond ore. The diamond will drop as soon as you break the block.

 Place them near your regular main garbage bins, so you won't be tempted to just trash recyclables out of laziness.


If have to sort your recyclables, you can save time by getting multiple or sectioned bins so you can sort as you throw each item away.
 If your facility requires it, separate paper and cardboard, plastics, glass, and cans. This can be annoying, but like any household chore it gets easier if you make a weekly habit of it.
 Many recycling programs no longer require this, but you may need to separate out the seven different categories of recyclable plastics.
 You may not need to do this for your program, but it helps to wash out residue and remove labels.
 This way the bottles don't build up and the task of sorting them doesn't become too intimidating.


If your recycling center is out of the way, try sorting recycling once a week but storing it for one big drop every month or so.

If your sister is injured, grab her a bandage and help her clean out her wound.
If she is sad, you could bring her a favorite stuffed animal to keep her company and bring her comfort.



Keep hugging your sister until she has finished crying or wants to talk.
Even holding her hand or patting her on the back will make her feel loved.



If the answer is no, say something like, 'That's OK. If you change your mind you can talk to me anytime.' If the answer is yes, give her your full attention and don't make suggestive comments or give advice unless she asks for it. If she chokes up, tell her she doesn't have to go on if it makes her too uncomfortable.



Tell your sister 'Its going to be OK' or 'I love you and I'll always be here for you no matter what' and give her another hug. Just this small reassurance could help brighten her spirits and let her know you really care.



Grab her favorite board game, or take her to her favorite ice cream place. Anything that will make her happy and hopefully take her mind off of whatever made her sad in the first place.

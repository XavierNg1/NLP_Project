 However, note the exception for the first leg of a transfer.

People usually cluster near the doors, for a variety of reasons that have been the subject of psychological study.The areas farther from the door, which may be in the middle of the car or at the ends (depending on the car design) may therefore be a better place to stand.Keep in mind one downside of this: if you are farther from the door, there is a larger mass of people to wade through when exiting the train. If the train is likely to be crowded at the time you exit, you need to weigh that downside.
If this is a short first leg of a trip (i.e., you intend to transfer to another train) it may be preferable to stay close to the door so that you can exit faster and make it more quickly into the other train.
As a general rule, it is easy to move within the train if the passageway has a single column occupied and can accommodate two columns, or has two columns occupied and can accommodate three columns. If this is true at your point of entry and exit, but the train becomes more crowded in between, these strategies are worthwhile.
 On such systems, it is recommended that you travel light. Some people follow the practice of wearing the backpack on their front so as to minimize the risk of theft and separation from their property.Make sure to hold on to handrails. Crowds can get more frustrating if you keep bumping into people when the train changes direction or stops or starts suddenly.
Avoid making loud noises or otherwise drawing attention to yourself as that can get you into fights with others in the crowd and ruin your day. This is particularly important in very crowded transit conditions and at high temperatures.

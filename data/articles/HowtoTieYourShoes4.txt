 Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe.If you’re demonstrating this technique to someone, point the toe side of the shoe toward them so they can see your hand movements.
 Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.
 Use your thumb and forefinger on your right hand to grip one of the shoelaces. Your fingers should be facing toward you.








Make sure your pinky finger is also gripping the shoelace.
You should be making a half rectangle shape (or lobster claw shape) with your thumb and forefinger, as you grip the shoelace., Use your thumb and forefinger on your left hand to grip the other shoelace. Again, your fingers should be facing toward you.








Don’t forget about your pinky finger. Make sure it is also gripping the shoelace. You should be making a half rectangle shape (or lobster claw shape) with your thumb and forefinger.
 Twist your fingers so they are facing each other.








It should look the the two halves of the rectangle or the two lobster claws are coming toward each other.
You should be forming an “X” shape with the laces., Pinch the laces between your fingers and pull them tight. As you tighten the laces, you should now have two loops on either side of the shoe and a nice, clean tie in the middle of the shoe.

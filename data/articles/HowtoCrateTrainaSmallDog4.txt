 To discourage your dog from relieving itself in its crate, try to take it out to eliminate as soon as possible after long crating periods. This will build your small dog's confidence that its needs will be met if it cooperates. This should not be difficult, as dogs have as a natural instinct a reluctance to soil their sleeping area., If your dog has developed an affinity for its crate during training, consider keeping it as a fixture in the house. Remove the door and place it in a more discrete area, if preferable. Given the size of your small dog's plastic crate, it can be moved easily from one room to the next, and used as a carrier for car rides., If you have exhausted all efforts in trying to crate train your dog, reach out to a professional for help. Search online for listings of dog trainers in your area; visit the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT) website to search for trainers by zip code.Be sure to ask potential trainers about their credentials, methods, and services before you hire them, and don’t hesitate to ask for references. Some key questions to pose to them are:”What are your credentials?”
”What services do you offer?”
”Do you assist owners with crate training?”
”Do you have a list of clients I can contact for references?”

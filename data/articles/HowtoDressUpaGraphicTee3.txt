 It can be a wide-brimmed fedora, but doesn’t have to be. Pop on some sunglasses to pump up the chic factor!


Try matching your fedora to another part of your outfit. For example, wear a light gray fedora with light gray pants, or match a black fedora to black pants and/or shoes.
Wear long, metallic necklaces, such as long gold, to compliment the tee and fedora.
 Tastefully, of course. Wear a statement necklace, chunky bracelets, or both.For a very pulled-together look, match the shade of your shoes to the metal of your jewelry.Try a collar necklace with sequin or bead details, or a necklace with crystal and resin flowers.
In lieu of a statement necklace, layer long necklaces.
 Whether it’s a large metallic purse or a blinged-out clutch, mixing an evening bag with your graphic tee is sure to dress it up. Match the bag to your shoes and/or jewelry for a purposely tasteful vibe.


Try mixing instead of matching. For example, carry a small magenta clutch with a monochromatic outfit. Or, add a silky, leopard-print bag to a bright red skirt and tucked-in tee.
 Double up an infinity scarf, so that your tee is still on full display. Choose a bold-colored scarf, like apple red.Look for scarfs with dressy accents on the fabric. For example, a scarf with fabric flowers that add texture, or a scarf with fancy beading or stud details.
Wear a bright-colored scarf with a tee that’s less loud in color, or vice versa.

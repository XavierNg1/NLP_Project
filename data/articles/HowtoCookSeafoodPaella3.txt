 Distribute the pieces evenly around the pan, so that each area has an equal amount of lobster meat and a liberal portion of peas. , Line them up around the edge. Some cooks like to make a patter with the mussels for a pretty effect; you could also scatter them evenly around the paella dish.
 The lobster and mussels will cook in the hot paella once it is covered. Let the seafood steam for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and check to make sure the seafood is completely cooked.


The lobster meat should be opaque and tender when it's finished cooking.






The mussel shells should be open; if you think the dish is finished cooking, but some mussels remain closed, discard them.
 Place the big paella dish in the center of the table so that guests may serve themselves. Offer slices of lemon to go with the dish.

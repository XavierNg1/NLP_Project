 One way to make money in the game is to take advantage of the game's professions system, where crafting skills can be honed into money-making opportunities.One such profession is a weaponsmithÂ . In this profession, you make weapons of all types from found items and sell them. This can be very profitable.
 Like the weaponsmith, an armorsmith creates items to be sold. However, instead of weapons to be sold, an armorsmith makes armor (I bet you already figured that out, though). Both of these job tracks are especially helpful for Dragon Knights and other armor-reliant classes, as making your own armor and weapons can make you money by saving you money, in addition to the money you make from selling stuff you don't need.
 Enchanters are those with the magical gift to bind spells to items. All sorts of items can be enchanted, from armor to jewelry. In the Elder Scrolls universe, enchanting works by trapping souls in gems, and then using those gems to power the spell on an item, so you'll need to be capable of killing higher level creatures if you want to enchant more powerful (and thus more expensive) items.
 Alchemists make potions from ingredients they find or purchase. This may be one of the more profitable professions, once your skills are high, as alchemical ingredients are easily found and turned into potions.
 A provisioner makes food and other supplies in the game, which have effects similar to potions. Food ingredients and wood, like alchemical ingredients, are fairly easy to find.
 In true MMO fashion, you can go fishing in the game! Basic bait is easy to find, but the better the bait, the better the catch! Or, at least, certain types of bait attract certain types of fish.

 Hopefully, housekeeping has been doing its job and cleaned the room thoroughly in advance of your arrival. But you might feel more comfortable and at home in your hotel room if you wipe down areas and objects most likely to be sticky or filth-ridden. For instance, use alcoholic wipes to rub down the TV remote, telephone, door handles, and the handle on the mini fridge.You might also feel more comfortable if you run a wet hand towel or paper towel across dusty surfaces that housekeeping missed.
Be sure to check for bed bugs by lifting the sheets to check the mattress. If you see small brown or red specks dotting the mattress, ask for another room or just ask for a refund and find a better hotel.
 If you’re in a smoking room or if your room has a weird scent, you might be glad you brought along a portable air fresher. For instance, the GermGuardian GG1000 or the Hayata Mini-Mate are both effective at reducing odors.The GermGuardian plugs into an electrical socket and cleans the air as it removes the odors.
The Hayata is a rechargeable device and can be worn around the neck or placed on your nightstand.
Alternatively, you could bring a travel-size linen spray or scented candles.This will replace a hotel room’s disagreeable stink with a more refreshing odor.
 Slippers are like shoes, but are usually worn without socks and are meant for indoor use only. If you bring a pair of slippers to the hotel, your stay will be more comfortable, especially if you’re staying at a hotel during the chilly winter season. Plus, slippers will keep your feet off the sometimes grimy hotel room floors.

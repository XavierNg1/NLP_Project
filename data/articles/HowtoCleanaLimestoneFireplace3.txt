 Mix in small amounts of hydrogen peroxide little by little until a thick paste forms. You want the paste to have a toothpaste-like consistency. The paste, also referred to as a poultice, will pull the stain out of your limestone.Alternatively, you can purchase a commercial poultice from your local hardware store to remove the stains.
 Use a sponge or cloth to do this. Let the poultice dry. It may take one to two days for the poultice to completely dry.You can use a baby gate or another type of barrier to prevent children and pets from getting near the fireplace while the poultice is setting.
 You will need to use a scraper to do this. Use a soft-edged scraper or a soft plastic scraper. Gently scrape the paste off of your limestone slowly and discard.You can find soft-edged scrapers at your local hardware store.
If the stains remain, then repeat steps one through three again. Try using a commercial poultice; these may be more effective.
 Wet a microfiber cloth with warm water. Squeeze out any excess water. Wipe the limestone to remove any remaining pieces of poultice. Let the limestone air dry, or wipe it down with a dry microfiber cloth.


Alternatively, you can use the vacuum to remove any remaining pieces of poultice from your limestone. Just remember to turn off the spinning brush, or remove it if it is an attachment, to avoid scratching the limestone.

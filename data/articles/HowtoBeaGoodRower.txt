Lean your body back slightly. This is called the body rock.
Hold the oar handle to your chest, about the width of a fist above your belly button.
Place your hands about shoulder width apart on the handle, with the outside hand on the edge of the handle.;
,
Feather your blade by turning the handle with your inside hand so that the blade is parallel with the water.
Push your arms away from your body so that your elbows are nearly locked.
Bend your body forward at the hips until you are leaning slightly forward with your arms extended. Remember to keep your back straight throughout the entire stroke.
Pull your body forward along the slide until your shins are vertical. As you do this, remember to keep the blade of your oar a few inches above the surface of the water.
Square your blade while you come up the slide by gradually rotating the oar handle back into its original position, with the blade perpendicular to the water. Make sure to square early before the catch as squaring at the catch in a race can cost you valuable time!

, You should be as far forward as possible on your slide.
Make sure your blade is squared, or perpendicular to the water.
Drop the blade into the water by lifting your arms a few inches.
Make sure the blade is submerged just under the water. Try to keep the blade just below the water and the shaft as dry as possible.
 You must drive yourself with your legs
Pull with your back by leaning back from the forward position it was in (your back should end up at the same angle as it was at the Finish position) when your legs are almost fully extended.
Pull your arms back into your chest (the width of a fist above your belly button) so that you are back in the Finish position. Be careful to keep your arms straight when pulling them into your chest.

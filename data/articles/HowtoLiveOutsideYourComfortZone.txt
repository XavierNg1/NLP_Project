 Dig it out! There will most likely be some wild and crazy ideas on there that would spice your life right up. Don't have a bucket list? Write it! Here are some example ideas: 1) Follow a stranger for an hour and see if you can figure out their life2) Go to your local department store and ride around on the bikes till you get yelled at3) (If you are single) Ask everyone you would even consider dating for their phone number, just for a day. This might create some great relationships!;
, No matter how embarrassing they are, who you run into, whatever, this will be a fun experience that you will remember for a long time.
 Now find a way to face them. ALL of them. Arachnophobic? Next time you see a house spider, deal with it yourself. Without killing it. Claustrophobic? Ask yourself what small space freaks you out the most, and you spend a half an hour there without breaks.
 Whether it be, "Hello," or, "Okay," or anything, really, find a synonym for it and replace that word for one day. This may seem very small or stupid, but it is very hard and, in a way, entertaining to do.
 Make sure this isn't a day at work or school. If you choose your favorite fictional character or your role model, copy their personality and style for a day. The way people react will make it all worth it.
 Don't take these failures as a sign you should give up. In reality, it means you should keep trying. If you are good at something naturally, than great. If not, you can work to be the best. Just do what you enjoy and keep finding new things to do.

 When you are playing with the baby, find a soft, cushioned, or padded area. If the baby accidentally slips or falls, they will land on the padded play area. A couch, bed, or carpeted floor may be suitable. You can also roll out a tumble mat or lay down some pillows to provide extra protection., If the baby falls a long distance, they may become injured. It is better to remain close to the ground or a padded surface when playing with the baby. Sitting on a couch, carpeted floor, or bed can help reduce the chances of a bad fall.
 While rough and tumble playing, you do not want to accidentally hit your babyâ€™s head on a table corner or other sharp edge. When playing, make sure you are in a clear area that is free of clutter. Remove any objects that your baby could accidentally hit, fall upon, or trip over., If you are not holding the baby during play, you should watch them at all times. If they are crawling, make sure that they do not fall off a couch or bed during play. Prevent them from crawling into another room by closing the door. A playpen or baby gates can safely confine the baby while they crawl and play.

 Use a drill bit large enough for your nylon rope to fit through. Drill four holes at equidistant points along your hoop. Think of it in terms of a compass, with one hole at north, south, east, and west., The larger your binder ring, the easier this will be. Starting at one end of your first shower curtain, pass the ring through the curtain’s first hole. Bunch the curtain up and hook the second hole onto the ring. Continue until all holes have been hooked, then begin again with the second curtain. Close the ring when finished.This can be tough, so if you need more than two hands to keep the curtains bunched up as you work, ask for help.
 Cut four equal lengths of nylon rope, one for each drilled hole in your hoop. Thread each one through the hole. Then pull half of the length through.Exact length doesn’t matter. You just want them short enough to keep the shower curtains from bunching up on the floor when your tent is hung.
 First, pinch all the loose ends from your nylon rope together. Thread these through the binder ringer from underneath the bunched curtains. Once the rope’s free ends pass up through the binder, pull them taut and twist them together to form one big rope. Use this to tie a knot, while leaving enough rope above the knot to hang your tent from a ceiling hook., Install a hook in your ceiling. Twist the loose ends of rope back into one big rope and tie it into a second knot, as close as you can to its very end. Hook a second binder ring through the rope underneath this top knot. Close the ring and hook that over the ceiling hook.

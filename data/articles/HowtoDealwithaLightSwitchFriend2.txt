, Do you like her? How would you do without her? What makes your friendship special?

, How terrible is your friend? Did they ever make you cry very hard? Was is really serious? (Abuse, serious harassment, etc.)

, It's a tough decision, but we all have opinions, and you will slide a little more to one choice. You might regret it, it might be too late you think. But you can only trust yourself in situations like this.

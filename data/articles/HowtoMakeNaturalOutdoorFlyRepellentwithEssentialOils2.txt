 This fly repellant spray has been used for centuries to ward away bugs, and it really works. It has a strong smell when you first spray it on your body, but the smell will fade as the mixture dries. Here's what you need:


1/2 cup witch hazel
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
30-50 drops of essential oils. Choose any combination of citronella, clove, lemongrass, rosemary, tea tree, cajeput, eucalyptus, cedar, catnip, lavender, or mint.
 You can use an old one that has been cleaned out with soap and water, or buy a new one from the drugstore to reserve for this use.
 Shake the bottle and spray it on your hands, arms, legs, and other uncovered areas. Allow it to fully dry, and reapply when necessary. Avoid getting repellent in your eyes or mouth.


You can use this formula on most clothing as well. Test on a small section first to make sure it won't discolor the fabric.
Do not spray this on children or pets without verifying the safety of the oil involved. For example, tea tree oil is very toxic to cats.
Remember, never apply undiluted essential oil to your skin. Make sure you mix it with a carrier liquid to dilute it first.

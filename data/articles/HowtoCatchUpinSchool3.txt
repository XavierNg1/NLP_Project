 Once you get caught up, you can probably ease up a little on your work schedule, but you should maintain the same organization and discipline. Keep using a planner or calendar to keep track of work deadlines.Sometimes people get behind because they just forget when things are due. Keeping a planner or setting reminders in your phone can prevent this.
 Being caught up doesn't mean you can go back to the way things were before. The fact that you got behind in the first place probably means you weren't setting aside enough time for school work.


As before, establish a certain time each day to work on school work, and stick to it.Evaluate the activities you are part of outside of school and figure out which ones are most important to you. That way, if you have to let something else slide in favor of school work, you know what you're willing to skip or drop out of., Many students find that studying with other people not only allows them to pool their knowledge, but also helps them be more organized and accountable.If you've agreed to meet with people to work at a certain time, that creates social pressure that doesn't exist when you are just working alone. If you decide not to work on your own, you are failing to live up to your own goals, but if you decide not to meet with your study group, you'll be letting other people down, too.
 Devise a system of small rewards to motivate you to get work done. Whenever you get a project in on time, give yourself one of these rewards.This rewards can be anything that you enjoy. It could be your favorite candy, a new article of clothing, a song purchased online, or an activity like a trip the mall with your best friend of a little time spent playing your favorite instrument.
These rewards are motivating because they create a positive association in your mind with getting things done on time. Your brain will start to understand that completing a task leads to something positive, and this can help you feel more motivated to work.

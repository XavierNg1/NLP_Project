 Keep a door or window open when you’re showering. Alternately, run a dehumidifier or portable fan after showering. If you have a vent fan, run it before, during, and after your shower.For example, turn on your vent fan before a morning shower, and keep it running until you leave for the day. Even when the mirror is no longer foggy, there can still be moisture in the air.
Mold and mildew thrive where it’s warm, airless and damp.
 Dry wet grout thoroughly after using moisture in the kitchen or bathroom. Keep a squeegee in the bathroom and squeegee the walls and floor after showering.Using a squeegee after showering will cut down on surface buildup.
 Add ten drops of tea tree oil to a clean spray bottle filled with water. Keep the spray bottle in the bathroom and use the “mist” setting to spray tiles and grout after showering.You should perform this on a small test area first to make sure there is no negative effect.
 Spread out any wet or damp towels so they can totally dry. For rooms that face a lot of moisture, such as kitchens and bathrooms, opt for synthetic materials, since they hold less moisture.For example, choose polyester or vinyl for items like bathmats and curtains.
 Spray the grout monthly with an anti-fungal solution. For example, fill a spray bottle with one part water to one part white vinegar. Spray and wipe down the grout. Let the solution dry naturally rather than rinsing it off.


If your grout is in a bathroom, clean soap scum weekly.

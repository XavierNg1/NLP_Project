 Another way to tell a kitten from a cat is to look at your cat’s teeth. Up to the age of 6 months the kitten is losing its baby (deciduous) teeth and gaining its adult (permanent teeth). At the age of 3 weeks until the age of six weeks the kitten’s primary (baby or deciduous) teeth are erupting (coming through) the gums. These sharp, thin teeth remain in place until around 3 months of age when the adult (permanent) teeth start to come through the gums. Up to the age of 6 months a kitten will lose its primary teeth and gain its adult teeth.


If your cat is willing, try to open up her mouth a bit and look to see if she has all of her teeth. Note the appearance of the teeth as well. If they appear small and thin, then your cat may still be a kitten. A young adult cat will have very white adult teeth. As the cat ages the teeth will become brown stained and may start accumulating tartar and plaque.
 When cats are growing and changing, their attitude does too. Kittens are known for being very playful, naive, clumsy, and adventurous. While all cats sleep a lot, kittens are often more energetic and alert than adult cats.Keep in mind that some breeds of cat still contain those kitten characteristics in adulthood, while others don't. Many adult cats will be more laid back and calm, or they may not care for as much energetic exercise.
 Your veterinarian may be able to determine your cat’s age based on several features and other indicators such as whether or not your cat has been spayed or neutered. Cats reach puberty between the ages of 4 to 10 months of age.Veterinarians usually advise cat owners to get their cats spayed (females) or neutered (males) at around 5-6 months of age in order to keep them from breeding or becoming pregnant.


Make sure that you make a veterinary appointment for your new cat (or kitten) as soon as possible. No matter what your new pet’s age, he or she will need a check-up to ensure good health.

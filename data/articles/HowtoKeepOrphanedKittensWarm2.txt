 Line the bottom of a high-sided cardboard box with clean, dry towels or a blanket. Keep the box away from drafts, air conditioning vents, or other sources of cool air.Cardboard is an insulator, so it makes a great kitten nest.
Change the bedding at least daily to maintain a clean environment.
 Place half of the box onto a heating pad. You can also place the heating pad in the box beneath the bedding. Your goal is to create a heated zone in half of the box and a cooler zone in the other half.The kittens will move from one side of the box to the other to warm or cool themselves.
 It’s best to use a heating pad specially designed for pets.If you don’t have a pet heating pad, you can use one meant for humans as long as you ensure it won’t burn the kittens. Keep it on a low setting and wrap it securely with a thick towel to make sure the kittens can’t access the pad itself.Check the pad and its wrapping regularly to make sure it’s not too hot.
 You should routinely check the nest’s temperature using an air thermometer. The ideal ambient temperature for kittens up to two weeks old is around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 30 degrees Celsius). Ambient nest temperature for three and four week old kittens should be between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius).Keep the kittens in the nest and routinely monitor the ambient temperature for four to five weeks.

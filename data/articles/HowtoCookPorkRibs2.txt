, When you're ready to cook the ribs, get the pan ready. Choose a large pan with 2-inch sides that can comfortably hold all of the ribs in a single layer. Stacking the ribs will result in unevenly cooked meat. Cover the pan in a sheet of aluminum foil with the ends hanging off the short sides.









It's important to make sure the pan you use is deep. Ribs produce a lot of juices, and you don't want them to run out of the pan.
You can use a glass or metal pan.
 This will keep the meat moist as it cooks and prevent the bottom of the meat from burning. Pour it directly over the aluminum foil.
 The arch of the ribs should face up, and the bones should be against the foil. Make sure the ribs aren't overlapping.
 First bend in the ends of the first sheet of foil, then add a second sheet to form a tent. Scrunch the foil around the handles of the pan to keep it in place. Make sure there are no holes.
 Keep the ribs covered during this first hour. The ribs are ready for finishing when the meat falls easily from the bone when it is poked with a fork.

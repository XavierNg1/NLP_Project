 The size of your magazine will determine the size of your tree, since its height will be judged by the page length.
 Take the top right corner of the first page and pull it down to the middle left side, so that it makes a right angle. Crease it well with your thumb, ruler or bone folder.


The first crease will not go down to the bottom of the page. It will be in the middle.
 Fold it down with a thumb, ruler or bone folder. This is called the "tree fold" because you will repeat this to make your tree.
 This will allow the tree to neatly stand on its own.
 Fold every page of the magazine in the same manner. When you get to the end, rip off the outside covers of the magazine.
 You can spray paint it or decorate it or leave it as it is.

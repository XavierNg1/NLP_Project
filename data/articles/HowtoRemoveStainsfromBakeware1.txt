 The best way to gauge how much baking soda you’ll need is to just sprinkle a light, even coating of baking soda across the bottom. The best way to gauge how much soap you’ll need is to squirt your liquid soap along the inner edge of the pan, then apply three or four evenly spaced stripes of soap from one end of the pan to the other.


Use an antibacterial liquid soap.
This method also works on enameled bakeware like ceramics.When cleaning enameled bakeware, use one quart of water and two tablespoons of baking soda for your mixture. You shouldn’t need soap.;
, If you have a lot of water in the pan, you might end up with a big mess later when you scrub it, since the water might splash back. Wait 15 minutes for the baking soda, soap (if cleaning glass or Pyrex), and water to mix and loosen the grime on the glass bakeware.
 Place the dish in the sink so that any water that splashes up over the sides of the dish will drain down the sink. Depending on the severity of the stain, you might use a regular dish sponge, a green scrubbing pad, steel wool, or even a toothbrush. Use vigorous circular motions to remove the stains.


Some people like to use balled-up aluminum foil to scrub stains off their glass bakeware.Add more baking soda to spots that are especially stained.
Don’t be discouraged if your stain doesn’t come out immediately. It often takes several passes for stained glass bakeware to look truly clean again. Some people advise giving the dish a preliminary scrubbing, letting it sit for 30 minutes in soapy water, then going at it again.
Once you’ve removed the stain, wash and rinse your bakeware out with soap and warm water.

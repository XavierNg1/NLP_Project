 He wants you to beat a high score. You'll be able to do this, because the name under Greg's on the game Thunder Volts, is "Is an Idiot".
 When bumped, the cars will drop tokens. Don't be alarmed, as this is very easy.
 This part is very tricky. You have to beat the score 800000, which "Is an Idiot" put out there for you.
 However, your opponent doesn't shoot at you (which means they'll just charge towards you or go in a straight line). It's okay if you can't defeat them. The bosses are harder, but not impossible. Just kept moving around, and shooting like crazy.

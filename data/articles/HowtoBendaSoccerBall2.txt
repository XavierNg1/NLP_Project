 For a right-footed kick, this means approaching the ball and aiming just to the left of your target.
 Aim your planting foot to the left of your target. Your planting foot is going to be farther back and farther away from the wall than you would be trying and inside-bend shot.


Keep your planting foot stationary as you prepare to kick the ball and then eventually kick it. Moving your planting foot will interfere with the continuous motion of your kicking foot, leeching power from your shot.
 Again, having a hand out for support and balance is important here. Your hand doesn't need to be all the way up in the air but it shouldn't be completely on the side of your body.
 If you're putting a cross (+) on the ball and you're approaching to hit with the right foot, you're going to want to hit the bottom middle, or bottom left, of the ball.
 The motion is similar, but the results are different because you're striking the ball with the outside of your foot.


Right-footed players are trying to get the ball to spin clockwise by hitting it on the outside of their foot and then moving the foot left, across their body.
Left-footed players are trying to get the ball to spin counter-clockwise by hitting it on the outside of their foot and then moving the foot right, across their body.

Because this method will delete your saved greetings, messages, and settings, it should only be used to disable your voicemail permanently.
 You can dial *611 from your iPhone, or your service’s toll-free number from any device:T-Mobile: 1-877-453-1304

Verizon: 1-800-922-0204

AT&T: 1-800-331-0500

Sprint: 888-211-4727

Once your voicemail is disabled, your unanswered or rejected calls will be routed to a recording that states that your mailbox is inactive.

 Molly is the leader of all of the Perfs after Casey drops out from the band and stops being friends with them. Make sure that you can sway most of your friend's decisions (though this is a bit manipulative and mean so don't try this very often).


Become alpha of your clique.
 Kacey says in the president episode "Perfs win every year". Get your campaign on! Try your hardest to win. If you are allowed to, hand out items to make people vote for you, and if that fails then make a glittery poster.


If you're in year five or eleven, run for next year's school captain.
Hand out cute things to make people vote for you, or make pretty posters with lots of glitter.
 Get with the popular girls and try to lead them.

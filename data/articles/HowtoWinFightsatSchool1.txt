 Being the first to attack will only cause the blame to fall upon you. However, there is nothing wrong with defending yourself, especially if your opponent proves to be a threat to your safety. Keep an eye out for signs of aggression or a possible attack.;
, If you wish to avoid the fight, scream "fire" or some other attention-seeker at the top of your lungs. You could also seek the closest school staff member for help. Running away from a fight is another option. Although many people may view escaping as a cowardly behavior, it is essential if it means saving your life.
 If your opponent refuses to throw the first punch, walk away. Starting a fight will only earn you trouble, and you endanger your life in the process. The consequences of fighting someone may include a detention, school suspension, transfer to an alternate school, or permanent exclusion. This will hurt your record and your potential chances at being accepted into a college or job.

 Don’t be afraid to be completely open and honest with your teenager about the concerns and expectations you have for him. Make sure he understands that he can come to you with any questions he may have. Explain that you understand that he is more grown up now, but that his food allergies are still something that he needs to pay careful attention to.
 Listen to him when he tells you his concerns about privacy and about having his independence. Even though you may really want to get your points across, it is important to not dismiss these concerns. Privacy and independence are very important during teenage years and if you ignore these needs, your teenager will be more likely to tune you out.
 What if an allergic reaction happens when he is away from home and around his friends? By discussing these potential situations, it can help you and your teen to better understand these concerns and anxieties about their food allergies. This may also help to build trust between you and your teen by helping you to see that your teen may already know the answers to some of these “what if” questions.
 By displaying your confidence in your teen, it will help him to follow the guidelines he needs to follow when it comes to his food allergies. Letting him know that you are confident in his ability to handle things on his own, lets him know that you are willing to work with him to keep him safe when he is away from the comfort of his own home.

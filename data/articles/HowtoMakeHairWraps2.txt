 Pull the first piece of colored thread clockwise tightly around the braid until you are ready to switch colors., Wrap with the first color thread until you have gone about an inch or so down the braid. To switch to a new thread color, tie a knot around the wrap with the first color, then lay it down with the other strands and pull out another color. This will secure the wrap at the color change.

The tightness of the first color will hold down the next color so you don't have to worry about it becoming loose. You can wrap down about an inch again or vary the length to create a alternating design pattern of colors.
 Keep wrapping until you use up all the colors in your original bundle. You can get more creative by using two colors of thread and wrapping them at the same time to get alternating colors.

To get even more creative, you can use three colors of thread wrapping them in together (which creates a alternating color scheme).
 Wrap one color using your knot choice down approximately one inch but instead of tying it off with a final knot you will loop the thread through itself and secure. Then take the additional two strings from the top of that one inch section, and make criss-crosses over the top of the one inch section you just created with the first color of the three. Secure all three strings at the bottom with a double knot.









HINT: This is often a great place to add a decorative charm or bead. Use clear fishing line to tie the charm or bead into the thread bundle.
 To finish the wrap, pull the current thread through the loop of the final wrap to make a knot. Double it with the other threads to make the knot extra secure. Trim any excess thread from the bottom.

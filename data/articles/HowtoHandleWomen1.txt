 Great communication is important to any healthy relationship, regardless of whether or not it is a professional relationship or a personal relationship. Effective communication occurs when both parties actively listens to the other and understands what is intended.Sometimes when a woman is communicating a problem, she does not necessarily want your advice on how to solve it, she simply wants you to listen.
Use body language and gestures to demonstrate that you are paying attention. For example, using good eye contact and leaning forward are ways to communicate that you are interested in the conversation.
Never interrupt because it can appear as though you do not value what is being said.;
, If there is a misunderstanding, do not assume that she is being deceptive. Instead of making assumptions, listen to what she has to say about what has occurred.


To make sure that you are clear on what has happened, repeat what she has said to ensure that you are on the same page.
 In order to avoid misunderstandings, it is a good idea to communicate your understanding of the relationship. If you are just friends without any type of commitment, that should be communicated. If you feel like you are more than friends, then that should also be communicated.
 During your communication with women and anyone else, it is best to say what you mean and mean what you say. Being straightforward will alleviate unnecessary drama and hurt feelings.

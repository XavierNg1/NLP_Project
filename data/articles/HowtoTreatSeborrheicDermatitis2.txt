 Your doctor may recommend one of several prescription-strength substances to apply to the affected skin.These shampoos and creams may include: hydrocortisone, fluocinolone, or desonide. They are easy to apply and effective for seborrheic dermatitis, but extended use for months can lead to thinning skin or streaking.
Desonide (or sometimes DesOwen) is a corticosteroid applied to the scalp or skin.
 Your doctor may simply add the scalp medicine to your existing routine, but follow their advice precisely.For example you may have a shampoo with ketoconazole that you already are using regularly. But your doctor may then add a medicated scalp product such as clobetasol (Temovate) for you to apply twice a week.
 Sometimes your doctor may prescribe an antifungal medication to fight condition from the inside.A prescription used for this situation is sometimes terbinafine (Lamisil).
This is not a common recommendation because of the higher risk of side effects from the drug including liver problems and allergic reactions.
 These are higher risk medicines that alter the skin's immune defense system to reduce allergic reactions that cause irritation.Your doctor may prescribe creams, topical lotions, or similar medicines that contain a class of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors. They are usually tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel).
These topical drugs may be at least as effective as corticosteroids, and with fewer side effects. They do have an increased risk of cancer, higher purchase cost, and can't be used by someone with an already weakened immune system.
 Your doctor may prescribe one of these until you see your condition improving.Your doctor's prescription may include metronidazole (MetroLotion, Metrogel) to use once or twice a day.

 Kinetic energy is the amount of energy in the form of motion. Like any unit of energy, it can be express in units of Joules.

Kinetic energy is equivalent to the amount of work done to accelerate a stationary object to a certain speed. Once it has reached that speed, the object retains that amount of kinetic energy until that energy transforms into heat (from friction), gravitational potential energy (from moving against gravity), or other types of energy.
 For example, we can measure the kinetic energy of a bicycle & bicyclist. Let's say the cyclist has a mass of 50 kg, and the cycle has a mass of 20 kg, for a total mass m of 70 kg. We can now treat them as one 70 kg object, since they'll be traveling together at the same speed.
 If you already know the bicyclist's speed or velocity, just write it down and move on. If you need to calculate it yourself, use one of these methods below. Note that we care about the speed, not the velocity (which is speed in a certain direction), even though the abbreviation v is often used. Ignore any turns the bicyclist makes and pretend all distance traveled is one straight line.

If the bicyclist moved at a constant rate (didn't accelerate), measure the distance the bicyclist traveled in meters, and divide it by the number of seconds it took to move that distance. This will give you the average speed, which in this scenario is the same as the speed at any given moment.

If the bicyclist is accelerating at constant acceleration and doesn't change direction, calculate his speed at time t with the formula "speed at time t = (acceleration)(t) + initial speed. Use seconds to measure time, meters/second to measure speed, and m/s2 to measure acceleration.
 Kinetic energy = (1/2)mv2. For instance, if the bicyclist is traveling at 15 m/s, its kinetic energy K = (1/2)(70 kg)(15 m/s)2 = (1/2)(70 kg)(15 m/s)(15 m/s) = 7875 kgm2/s2 = 7875 newton meters = 7875 joules.

The kinetic energy formula can be derived from the definition of work, W = FΔs, and the kinematic equation v2 = v02 + 2aΔs.Δs refers to "change in position," or the amount of distance traveled.

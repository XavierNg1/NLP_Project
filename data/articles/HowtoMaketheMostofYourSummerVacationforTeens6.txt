 Take a nice bath, put on some pajamas, and curl up on the couch with a great book and a snack. Rent a movie or two and spend some time with yourself.
 Pretend that you're in a magical world and that you can do anything you want to do there!

, Yoga is a great way to keep calm and be patient. Round up some of your friends and try out a yoga class. You don't have to go to yoga classes; you could also find a book or search in the Internet to practice and try out basic and easy yoga skills.
 You don't even have to wear shoes, so once you get outside, take them off! Being barefoot is perfect for relaxing, especially in the summer.

 Start with clear boxes. Fill the bottom with green candy, such as green jelly beans or other jelly candies. Add a toy fairy to the box, and a few flower-shaped or flower-colored candies to the box. You can also throw in a fairy-themed cupcake for the attendee to take home, such as a red cupcake with white dots made from candy (toadstool) or a cupcake topped with rose., Using large pieces of glitter paper, cut a wing out of each sheet. To attach them, make a large loop out of ribbon for each wing, big enough to stick an arm through. Glue one to each wing. Use a piece of fabric, felt, or ribbon to attach the wings to each other. You can add flowers or a bow in the middle for extra decoration., Start with sturdy wire that's wrapped in brown or green, found at most craft stores. Cut a length that's big enough to go around the person's just over two times. Twist the wire around itself, making a circle the size of the person's head. Glue some felt or fabric around the ends of the wire to keep it from scratching the person. Hot glue flowers on the front or use florist's tape to wrap them on.You can also use ivy instead of flowers for a green crown.
For a less-permanent crown, just use a loop of sturdy paper to make the crown.

 If the files has been deleted, there's still a chance that the data is still there, but has just been set to be overwritten by new data. By not accessing the SD card, you increase the chances that the data will not be overwritten.


Until you're ready to try recovering files, it's best to remove the SD card from any device.
 The full version of ZAR requires a purchase, but the demo version allows you to recover image files only. Only download ZAR from the developer's website.


On the ZAR website, click the "image recovery" link towards the bottom of the page. This will allow you to install the free demo that can recover images.
 Insert your SD card into your computer using an SD card reader, or by putting it in your camera and connecting the camera via USB.


Your computer may prompt you to format your card or say that it's not readable. Do not format your card according to this prompt, as this can write over where your pictures are saved on the card.
 Start ZAR and click Image Recovery (Free). In other programs, look for a similar button. Some programs may skip this step altogether.
 In the "Disks and partitions", select your SD card. It should be labeled as an SD card. Click Next to start the recovery scan.
 You will see a list of images that the software found on your SD card. Select the images that you want to recover, or select all to restore all the lost images. You may not be able to preview them, and the filenames will most likely be lost.
 If your SD card has been damaged, don't save them to the card. Instead, choose or create a folder on your computer to save the pictures to. This will keep your pictures safe if anything happens to your SD card again.
 Click Start copying the selected files to restore the pictures. The files selected file will be saved to the location you specified.


Some pictures may not be able to be fully restored. Even if the thumbnail looks okay, the picture itself may be partially or fully damaged.

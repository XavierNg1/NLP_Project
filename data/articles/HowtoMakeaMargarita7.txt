 Recommended salts are kosher and sea salt, as the larger grains are more pleasing both to the taste buds and the eyes. Aim for a 1/4-inch thickness of salt.For a tasty savory-sweet salted rim, add some sugar to your salt mixture before salting the rim of your glass.
 A popular way to do this for margaritas is to cut a slit into a lime wedge, place the lime on the glass as if to garnish it, and then run the lime around the glass’s rim.


Be careful not to squeeze the lime too hard as you move it around the glass’s rim, otherwise its juice may drip down into the glass.

One method is to simply place the mouth of your glass onto the saucer and give it a twist — as you would use a cookie cutter.


The other method is to hold the rim of the glass parallel to the saucer and, letting it lightly touch the salt, turn the glass in your hand so that only the outer rim is covered in salt. This method ensures that the salt only ends up on the outside of the glass so that no additional salt winds up in your drink.

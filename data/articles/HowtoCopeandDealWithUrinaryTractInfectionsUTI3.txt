 If you suspect that you have a urinary tract infection, call your doctor right away. Don't ignore it — if left untreated, the infection can spread to the blood stream, which can develop into a more serious potentially life-threatening situation. Your doctor will need to get a urine sample and perform a culture to be certain that it is a UTI and not something else. Some common symptoms of a UTI include:


Feeling a burning sensation when you go to the bathroom
Having the urge to urinate often, even if little or nothing comes out
Feeling pain or pressure in your back and/or lower abdomen
Producing cloudy, dark, bloody, and/or strange-smelling urine
Feeling tired and/or shaky
Having a fever and/or chills
Confusion (in older adults)

, If your doctor diagnoses you with a urinary tract infection, then you will need to follow your doctor’s treatment plan to ensure a quick and full recovery. Your doctor may prescribe anti-biotics, recommend a certain fluid intake, or advise against certain activities.
 In some cases, a UTI may not respond to treatment and may require a more aggressive treatment or even hospitalization. Some people are more susceptible to UTIs and may get one after another.Let your doctor know right away if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse.

 This mic allows a sound engineer to raise the volume much higher when mixing the sound. In addition, a dynamic mic can handle a much higher sound pressure level (SPL).


An instrument mic, such as a Shure SM57 or an Audix i5, is ideal for live performances because their pickup patterns are very directional, resulting in less bleed from other instruments and amplifiers. "Bleed" is a term for sounds the mic picks up from the crowd or other instruments.
A SM58, which is traditionally used as a vocal mic, will work fine for a live saxophone performance, but you might experience some bleed from the side due to a wider pickup pattern.
You can also use a clip-on microphone. Many serious saxophone players and engineers have their own mic that clips onto the bell of the saxophone. This type of mic allows the musician to move about freely.;
, Place the microphone about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) away from the bell of the saxophone, pointing down at a 45-degree angle.


When using a dynamic mic on a stand, the saxophone player has to be conscious of where the microphone is and play directly into it. Clip-on mics are a specific distance away from the bell at all times, depending on the model's clip size.
 Use your ear to adjust the sound.


You don't want the saxophone to be to abrasive and overpower the other instruments on stage. Saxophones tend to have a lot more high-mids and highs, so "rolling off," or lowering, these frequencies may be beneficial.
You can also try adding a little low-mids around the 250 Hz range to achieve a more substantial, thicker tone. Adding some reverb can warm up the sound and tame some of its abrasive qualities.
You can also try adding compression if it's available. Compression will ensure that the saxophone can be heard consistently, especially if the player is very dynamic.

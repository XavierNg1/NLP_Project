 Cut lines through the ivy along the ground in order to divide it into large sections. This will make it much easier to remove the ivy from the ground. Pull the sections apart from one another as you cut. Work carefully around plants and saplings you want to keep.


If you're working on a hill, cut vertical lines from the top of the hill to the bottom to create sections that you can roll downhill.
 Lift the edge of one section of ivy and roll it forward on top of itself. Keep rolling the ivy forward until the entire section has been rolled up into a big log of ivy. Move the log to a separate area and continue rolling up sections until you've cleared the area.


Mulching the ivy rolls is the best way to dispose of them and ensure they won't take root in the area again.
 English ivy is difficult to kill with herbicides alone because the plant's leaves contain a waxy barrier that is difficult for products to penetrate. Therefore, the most effective method is to combine manual removal with the use of a herbicide. Glyphosate is the chemical that works most effectively to kill English ivy.Spray the area of ivy you wish to kill, but be careful the glyphosate doesn't reach other plants you want to keep.
Herbicides are slow-acting, and must be reapplied every six weeks or so.
 If you have a patch of ivy you want to preserve, but you'd like to prevent it from spreading, you can use mulch to keep it contained. Simply cover the border of the the ivy you want to keep with several inches (about 7 to 8 inches) of shredded or wood chip mulch. You will need to give this method some time; leave the mulch on the ivy for at least 2 seasons. You may need to add new mulch one or more times during a growing season.


Another option is to trim the ivy back to contain it. Use a weed eater or edging tool to cut the vines along the border.

 As your children get older, you should talk with them about what pet responsibilities they feel capable of performing. Make sure that you give them something that they can handle. They will feel more empowered and better able to care for the dog if they complete an easy chore regularly as opposed to a more difficult chore less frequently.Kids under the age of five can help with some small aspects of caring for your dog but they should always be supervised.
Children between ages 6 and 10 can assume many dog-related tasks like grooming and cleaning up after the pet.
Kids over the age of 10 can perform all aspects of caring for your dog on their own.
 Positively reinforcing your child’s responsibility will help it become a recurring behavior. Whenever your child helps care for your dog, you should let them know how much you appreciate it. As they get older you can limit the amount of praise you give them, but you should still congratulate them from time to time.You might say things like “Thank you for feeding the dog. I really appreciate that, and I know that Rufus does too” or “Thanks for walking Sparky. He appreciates the exercise.”

, One way to turn your children off pet-related chores is by associating punishment with caring for your dog. If your child does something wrong, do not punish them by assigning them extra dog-related chores. Ultimately, the child may become frustrated and resentful towards the dog.

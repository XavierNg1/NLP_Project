 Get two large chair and place them across from each other, so that they face outwards. Drape a large blanket or a sheet over the chairs, creating a hidden from sight area between the chairs.
 Set something heavy on top of the blanket on the chairs. This way the blanket will stay in place.
 You could also get four chairs and put a blanket over them. This will make a larger clubhouse.
 Maybe include a lamp for light, or something that serves a table.

 There are instances that even though you’ve closed an app, it may still be running in the background. These running apps consume your system memory and can contribute to Farm Heroes Saga freezing or crashing in the middle of your game session.


If you’re using an iOS, double-click the Home button of your device to see a list of all the running apps.
Checking for running apps on Android requires more taps: Open the Settings (gear icon), and scroll down and tap “Applications” or “Application Manager.” You’ll be shown a list of Downloaded apps; swipe to the left to see the list of Running apps.
 Closing some of the apps you’re currently not using can make your device run faster and better. Be careful that you’re not closing system apps though! You might end up stalling the device instead.


To close running apps on iOS, swipe up on each of the app in the list that you aren’t using.
On Android, tap the app you want to close to open its information page. Tap “Stop.” Repeat for other running apps you want to close.
 You don’t really need to, but restarting your iOS or Android device can help refresh the device and start up with the new changes implemented.
 Look for the game app on your device and tap on it. You can now resume your game play, and there shouldn’t be any crashes happening. If you’re still experiencing problems, try another method.

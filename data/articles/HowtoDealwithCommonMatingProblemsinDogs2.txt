 If you are having trouble mating your dog, it is possible your dog could be suffering from brucellosis. Brucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease that affects dogs. It can cause spontaneous abortion in pregnant dogs, and it can cause sterility in both male and female dogs.Symptoms include lethargy, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty walking, vaginal discharge, and swollen testicles.
 It is not uncommon for male dogs to suffer from prostatic problems. These issues are one of the major contributing causes of infertility in male dogs. Ask your vet to examine your dog for prostatic problems that might affect its ejaculate volume and sperm mobility.Symptoms include difficulty urinating, lethargy, difficulty walking, and bloody discharge from the penis.
 Female dogs often do not produce puppies because of hormonal imbalances and the medical issues associated with such imbalances. Examples include persistent estrus, split heat, and hypothyroidism. Ask your vet to conduct tests to determine if your female dog is suffering from a medical condition resulting from hormonal disturbance., While some mating problems in dogs, such as poor timing, are easily remedied, others require extensive testing or treatment. If your dog is having reproductive issues that cannot be easily solved by you or your vet, consider taking your dog to a reproductive specialist. Veterinary teaching hospitals, for example, often have such specialists.

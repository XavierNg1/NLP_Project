 Cats don’t need to be bathed that often. They generally keep themselves clean. However, long-haired breeds may need to be bathed more regularly than short-haired cats due to the length of their fur.This long and silky hair can become greasy if they do not get bathed enough.
 Even if you want to bathe your cat regularly, make sure you don’t bathe them too much. Bathing your cat too often can remove all their natural skin oils, which keeps their coats healthy.At the most, you should only bathe your cat once each week.
 Sometimes, wiping your cat with a wet cloth or cat wipe may be a better option that bathing them. However, if your cat got into mud or dirt, or if they are have fleas or dandruff, you may need to bathe them. Older cats that have mobility problems may also need bathing more often.Some cats can develop skin issues that lead to unpleasant odors or skin irritation that may need to be taken care of by bathing.
 If your cat needs bathing often due to certain problems, like allergies or odors, take them to the vet. Your vet may recommend certain types of shampoos specifically for your cat’s problems that won’t dry out or irritate their skin.

 In some cases you may want to do a simple criss-cross pattern or you could use small cookie cutters and top with small dough cookies instead.


Make sure you create a pie dough topper with a slit or room to allow steam to seep out. If you plan to completely cover the top with dough, a simple slit or two on the top will suffice.
 Since you may be storing these little pies in the freezer you will need to firmly screw the lid on top.
 Sprinkle each pie with sugar for extra sweetness.

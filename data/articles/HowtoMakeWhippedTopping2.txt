 Like traditional whipped cream, coconut whipped cream works best when the coconut cream is very cold. The chilling process also helps to separate the coconut cream from the water, which is important because you only need the cream for this recipe.


Refrigerate the can of coconut milk for at least eight hours, but 24 hours is ideal.
It’s important to use full-fat coconut milk, because light coconut milk doesn’t have the right fat content to whip up., About an hour before you plan to make your coconut whipped cream, place a glass or metal bowl in the fridge, along with the metal beaters from a hand mixer.


When the bowl and beaters are cold, they won’t transfer heat to the coconut cream, and this will make it easier to whip air into it.
 Once it’s thoroughly chilled, remove the can of coconut milk from the fridge. Do not shake or agitate the can before opening it, otherwise you will reincorporate the water and cream. With a spoon, carefully scoop out the solidified top layer of coconut cream. Place the cream into the chilled bowl.The remaining liquid in the can is coconut water, and you can drink this, use it in baking, or add it to smoothies. Place it in a storage container and reserve it for another recipe., Using the chilled beaters, whip the coconut cream for about eight minutes, until stiff peaks begin to form. The stiff peak stage means you can pull the beaters out and the cream will hold a peak on the end of the beater.
 When the coconut whipped cream is at the stiff peaks stage, add in the sugar and vanilla. Beat the cream for another minute to incorporate everything.Serve coconut whipped cream as you would traditional whipped cream. You can use it on desserts, in hot chocolate, on ice cream, or even just enjoy a spoonful on its own!
If you have any leftovers, transfer the cream to an airtight container and refrigerate for one to two weeks.

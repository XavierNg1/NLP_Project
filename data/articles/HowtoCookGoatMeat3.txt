 You can roast any cut of goat meat by cubing it and threading it onto skewers. If you'd rather roast a whole leg, that's fine, too. You need two pounds of goat meat, not including the weight of the bone., In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, orange juice and all of the spices. Add the goat meat to the bowl and coat it completely with the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it overnight, or for at least four hours.
 This lower temperature will cook the meat slowly, allowing time for it to tenderize.
 Place the meat in the middle of a sheet of aluminum foil. Gather the edges to create a roasting pouch that won't leak. This will trap moisture against the meat so that it won't dry out. Place the pouch in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet.
 When the hour is up, check the meat to see whether it is fall-apart tender. It should come apart easily when poked with a fork. If it holds together, return the meat to the oven to roast for another half hour.
 This traditional Caribbean dish tastes delicious with classic rice and peas or another starchy side dish.

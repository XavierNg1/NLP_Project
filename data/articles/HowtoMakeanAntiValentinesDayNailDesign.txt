 Dip your dotting tool into the red polish and drag it down in the middle of your nail. Do the same to the other side. If you don’t have a dotting tool, you can use a bobby pin, the end of a needle pin, or the end of a pencil for the heart(s). There are a lot of household items that you can use if you don't have the dotting tool.
 This depends on how big or small you prefer the heart to be.

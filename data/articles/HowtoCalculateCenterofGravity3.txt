 The datum is an arbitrary starting point placed on one end of the see-saw. You can place the datum on one end of the see-saw or the other. Let's say the see-saw is 16 feet long. Let's place the datum on the left side of the see-saw, close to the first child.
 Let's say the children are each sitting 1 foot away from each end of the see-saw. The center of the see-saw is the midpoint of the see-saw, or at 8 feet, since 16 feet divided by 2 is 8. Here are the distances from the center of the main object and the two additional weights form the datum:


Center of see-saw = 8 feet away from datum.
Child 1 = 1 foot away from datum
Child 2 = 15 feet away from datum

 Dulcimers can have anywhere from 3 to 12 strings, but the vast majority have three, four, or five strings.The tuning process is fairly similar for these common dulcimers, but there are a few differences worth noting.


A three-string dulcimer has one bass string, one middle string, and one melody string.
A four-string dulcimer has one bass string, one middle string, and two melody strings.
A five-string dulcimer has two bass strings, one middle string, and two melody strings.
When there is a set of strings (two bass strings or two melody strings), all strings in that set should be tuned in the same manner.
If you have a dulcimer with more than five strings, you should take it to a professional to have it tuned since there are too many variations in string placement and sound.
 Before you can tune a string, you need to know which knob adjusts which string and where each string lies.


When the front of the dulcimer faces you, the knob or knobs on the left are usually your middle strings. The lower knob on the right is usually the bass, and the upper knob on the right is usually your melody.
If in doubt, adjust the knobs carefully and observe which string is tightened or loosened as you make the adjustment. If you are still unable to determine which knob adjusts which string, ask an expert to help you.
Note that the bass string is usually referred to as the "third" string even though you will tune it first. Similarly, the melody string is usually referred to as the "first" string even though you work on it last. This is because the bass string is the furthest from you and the melody string is the closest to you.

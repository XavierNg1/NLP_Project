 Visualizing your next day’s events can help you prepare mentally. This also helps you decide which time-consuming tasks need to be done tonight.


Make note of any appointments or meetings—on paper, smartphone, or other device.
Write a list of any important reminders such as errands or general things that need to get done.
 If your mornings normally involve a lot of tasks that slow you down, do them the night before to save yourself time and stress in the morning.


Pick out your clothes and shoes.
Fill the kettle or set up the coffee machine with timer.
Cook and pack any food you need to bring with you.
Pack your bag with everything you normally carry along.
Lay out your car keys, bus pass, or whatever essential items you need for getting to your destination.
Shower before bed to save time in the morning.
 For people who have trouble sticking to an exercise routine, it can be helpful to plan your physical activity the day before. This makes you less likely to skip it if it’s part of your daily plan.


Choose the time, duration, and place for your exercise.
Touch base with any friend(s) who may go with you to confirm the date.
Pack your gym bag or other necessities the night before.

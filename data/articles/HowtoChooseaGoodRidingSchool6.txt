 You will be investing a lot of time and money into your horse-back riding education, and it is not worth trying to get an education at a school or stable you do not feel comfortable around. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:


Does this school teach the style of riding I would prefer to learn?
Do I feel comfortable around the instructor/stable hands?
Do I feel comfortable on/around the horses?
Does this school have ample facilities to accommodate my interests?
Do I like the other students and do I feel comfortable spending large quantities of time at this stable

 In addition to summarizing the main points of your paper, your conclusion should point towards how your findings will be relevant in the future. You can achieve this by refocusing the topic within a larger context, and inviting the reader to reflect on how it will play out within a bigger picture. Use a thought-provoking question to communicate that the issue deserves further thought, which will assert the importance of your research.E.g. "What will happen to small businesses as different industries continue to go digital?"

, Establish the importance of your essay's conclusion by challenging your reader to do something about it. Turning your final findings into a real life challenge will emphasize the relevance of the topic and your hypothesis. It will also engage your reader in a memorable way.For example, "Being environmentally responsible is a necessary step for all people, in order to save the parts of nature that we have left."

, If your essay has presented a hypothesis about how something is bad, create a picture of how things could be better. The optimistic focus will not only re-frame your arguments in a more positive way, but improve your reader's relation to the text. The possible solutions to the issue your have arguments have established gives merit to your thesis without undermining the structure of your paper or altering the arguments you made.E.g. "If this competitive nature of school work were replaced with a more community-based learning approach, we might see happier, healthier children."

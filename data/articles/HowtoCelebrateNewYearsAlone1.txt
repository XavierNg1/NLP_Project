 Just because you’re alone doesn’t mean you should stay home. Put on your best outfit and head out for some adventure. Being alone can be an advantage on busy nights, considering single tables and bar seats are not usually as occupied. You could even make friends with a fellow solo celebrator.


Tell a friend or family member you are headed out alone and perhaps even where you’re headed. Going out alone is exciting, but it can also be dangerous when the right precautions aren’t taken. Consider downloading an app like Companion, which notifies designated people of your location and/or that you’ve made it to your destination safely.;
, Many large cities produce fireworks shows for New Year’s celebrations that can be seen across their areas, and viewing is normally free! Research the one closest to you, pack up some snacks and drinks, and journey to the celebration. Even if you live in a colder climate, there are usually places to park and view the show from your car as well.


Before watching the event, research music streaming apps with New Year’s themed stations. You can listen to it in your car or with headphones if you’re headed to the event on foot. This will add a lot of value to your viewing experience and set the celebratory mood.
 More people than ever are researching traveling alone over the holidays.This is the perfect time to pick a place you have always wanted to visit and do things you have always wanted to try without asking or planning with anyone else. Celebrating in a new area allows you to experience new traditions and cultures as well.


If you want to add a little more spontaneity to your journey, you can plan a trip with surprise travel agencies like Pack Up + Go, which allow you to pick a budget and dates and the company plans a surprise trip for you. You learn where you’re going right before you leave for your trip!

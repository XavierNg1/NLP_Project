 Guys love girls that will smell good, but don't spray too much - "less is more". It's recommended to be sprayed on the neck, wrists and if you want, all over your chest. Fun fact: It's scientifically proven that boys are attracted to the scent of vanilla!;
, Because it will be okay! Nothing bad is going to happen. Plus it's "your" choice that you're doing this, nobody else's. You can always say no if you want to. But once you get into the kissing - you'll enjoy, and will be fine!

, Never just go in for the kiss unless you want to and you know your partner is okay with it too. This will ease any nerves you have too.
 Start giggling gently and look into his eyes, this will ease his nerves because he knows that you're comfortable. Maybe take his hand and give it a squeeze.
 And then look back up at his eyes. This is hinting you'd like a kiss.
, Say something or giggle. Maybe squeeze his hand again. Or create a sudden goodbye. You could nicely say, "I've got to go now, but I'll speak later."

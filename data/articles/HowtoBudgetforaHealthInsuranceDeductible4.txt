 You might get a subsidy to help pay your deductible if you purchase health insurance on the government exchanges. The Affordable Care Act (also known as “Obamacare”) created subsidies for out-of-pocket expenses. These subsidies are called “cost-sharing reductions.”You can easily calculate if you qualify for cost-sharing reductions by visiting the website: https://www.healthcare.gov/lower-costs/. Provide the requested information.
 You only qualify for cost-sharing reductions if you purchase a silver-tier plan. Silver-tier plans are usually more expensive than bronze plans. However, you’ll probably also get help with your premiums, called a “premium tax credit.”Accordingly, the overall cost of your health insurance should be lower.


When you shop for insurance, the exchange website will ask you how much medical care you anticipate needing. Based on your answers, the website will estimate how much you’ll pay out of pocket for the year.
Generally, your deductible will be thousands of dollars less if you qualify for cost-sharing reductions. This amount will probably offset the higher premium of your silver-tier plan.
 You can only purchase health insurance through the government exchanges during open enrollment, which begins November 1st and typically runs through January 31st of the next year.Accordingly, if you want to buy health insurance for 2018, you can begin shopping on the exchange on November 1, 2017.


However, if you move, or if you lose your job, then you might qualify for a special enrollment. Visit the marketplace website and submit an application: https://www.healthcare.gov.

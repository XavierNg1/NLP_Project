 There are the obvious spots, like near fishermen or fishing boats, where bait, injured fish, and blood and guts are plentiful and may attract sharks.Other potentially dangerous areas include:


River mouths and channels. This is where food, dead animals, and fish that are flowing down-stream enter the ocean, making them great spots for sharks to hang out.Areas where sewage enters the water. The sewage attracts fish, which will attract sharks.Deep channels, near sandbars, or where the reef or sand drops off steeply. Sharks lurk in these areas to catch fish that wander out of the shallows.Where large groups of shark prey hang out. If there are seals pupping nearby or a population of other marine animals in the area, sharks may be hunting nearby and could easily confuse you with prey.;
, If sharks have recently been sighted, there should be warnings posted on the beach - heed them. If the beach is closed, come back another day., Sharks generally feed at dawn, dusk, and night, so stick to late morning or afternoon sessions., Most shark attacks occur because the shark confused a surfer with prey. Visibility is low in cloudy water, making it more likely a shark will confuse you with a seal and attack.Water can be especially murky following storms or heavy rainfall. Rain can also stir up baitfish and attract sharks., Some sharks, especially adult great whites, tend to avoid kelp forests., Again, it's highly unlikely you will ever see a shark, but some experts believe that some sharks migrate closer to land during October, possibly to give birth.So, if you're really anxious about having a run-in with a shark, maybe wait until November to break out the wetsuit.

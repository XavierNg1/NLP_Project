 Silicone sheeting is a medical device used to reduce the formation of chronic scarring. It can alter the way scars form and even reduce the thickness and roughness of the tissue.


Silicone sheets keep healing wounds moist, while reducing bacterial growth. They also reduce general itching., Normally, your doctor will tell you to apply the silicone sheeting after the wound has fully closed. If you apply them earlier, you could promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria under the skin, which will lead to greater infections. The sheet is worn on the area for 12 to 23 hours a day depending on the severity and placement of the scar. This treatment may be prescribed for up to three months., This mixture can be applied to the injured area in either a gel or a pad form. This compound is also found in silicone sheets. It will help soften the scar tissue and decrease the redness associated with the formation of a keloid scar., In burn cases, pressure garments are often used to treat specific areas. These pressure garments are worn 23 hours a day for up to one year. These dressings do not cut off air to the tissue and can be customized to the specific injury. Pressure dressings are anecdotally effective in management of hypertrophic scars and burn scars.However, there is no evidence to support the use of pressure dressings to improve the appearance of normal post-surgical scars.

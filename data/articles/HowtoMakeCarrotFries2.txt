 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to roast the carrot fries, set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully. Next, use canola oil to lightly grease a large baking sheet.You can substitute olive or vegetable oil for the canola oil.
 For the fries, you’ll need 1 pound (454 g) of fresh carrots. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin and then slice the carrots into ½-inch (13-mm) sticks with a sharp knife.You can cut the carrots into fries in any size that you like, but be aware that you may need to adjust the cooking time. Fries that are thicker than ½-inch (13-mm) will need to cook longer, while fries that are thinner will likely require less cooking time.
 Place the carrot sticks into a large bowl. Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of olive oil and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt, and mix the carrots well to ensure that they’re evenly seasoned.You can add any other seasonings that you like to the fries. Black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and paprika are all tasty options.
 Once the carrot fries are properly seasoned, place them on the greased baking sheet in a single layer. Set them in the oven, and allow them to cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are as crisp as you’d like.The carrot fries should be crisp on the outside but still tender on the inside just like traditional potato fries.
 When the fries are finished cooking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Transfer them to a plate or platter, and serve while they are still warm.While the carrot fries are delicious on their own, you can also serve them with a dipping sauce. Ketchup, herbed mayo, and garlic aioli are some tasty options.

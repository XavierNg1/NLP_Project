 When you select an image for warping, a gridded mesh should automatically appear over it. Clicking and dragging any part of this mesh will cause the image underneath to deform in the direction you drag it. This can take a little getting used to, so you may want to practice before you save your work.


You can click any of the control points (the dots highlighted on the edge of the grid), one of the intersections of the grid lines, or an area inside the grid — any will work.
 When you bend or curve your image with the warp tool, you will see short line segments with dots at the end appear in the grid. Clicking and dragging these "handles" allows you to fine-tune the curves in your warped image.
 You don't have to warp your image by free-hand — you can also warp it to one of several preset shapes. To do this, once your image is selected for warping, look for the Warp pop-up menu in the Options bar. Here, you can choose a warp style that fits your needs., In the Warp pop-up in the Options bar, there are several more options that can help you modify the warped image. These are:Change Warp Orientation: The button looks like a curved grid next to a down arrow and a right arrow. This turns the warped section between vertical and horizontal orientations.Change Reference Point: The button looks like a black square surrounded by a border of white squares.

Define Warp Numerically: Enter numbers in the Bend X and Y boxes to set precisely how much to warp the image.
 When you're satisfied with your image, confirm the changes you've made. There are two ways to do this:


Simply hit the ↵ Enter key (⏎ Return on Macs).
Click the check mark button in the Options bar.
To cancel your work, press Esc or click the cancel button next to the check mark button.

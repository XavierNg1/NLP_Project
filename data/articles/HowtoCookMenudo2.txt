 Place them in a large stockpot and top it with 2 gallons (7.6Â L) of water and the remaining garlic. Bring the water to a boil. Skim the foam from the top of the water as the ingredients cook.
 Cover the pot and keep cooking the meat until it's tender, about 3 hours.
 Strain the excess water from the pepper mixture. Add the strained peppers to the stockpot.

 Put one to two teaspoons of baking soda in a large plastic bag. Then, place the insoles in the bag and shake the bag. Make sure you get the baking soda all over the insoles.Let the insoles sit in the bag overnight. Then, take them out of the bag and use a clean cloth to wipe off any remaining baking soda on the insoles.
 Leave the insoles in the shoes. Then, cut a dryer sheet in two and place each piece in each shoe. Let the dryer sheet sit in the shoes overnight to remove odor in the shoe and the insole.This is a good option if you are in a hurry to remove odor from the insoles and want a quick solution.
 You can take the insoles out of your shoes to do this or spray them while they are still in your shoes. You can find shoe cleaning spray online or at your local shoe store.Many shoe cleaning sprays have antibacterial properties. They will usually be quick drying and non-staining.

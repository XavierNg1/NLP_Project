 A quick search using an ID number, login/password, or similar unique identifier can tell you how many miles youâ€™ve accumulated.
 Airlines vary on how many miles they require per flight. The time of year you decide to fly will also factor into the miles cost of the trip. Peak season travel may require as many as 20 percent more miles than traveling during low season.
 As an alternate option, some miles distributors will permit members to purchase additional miles, thereby allowing them to make up the difference between the miles they have and the miles they need., Speak to either your miles provider or your airline to cash in your miles for a ticket. Even having a fraction of the miles required to make your trip will result in savings you otherwise would not have enjoyed.

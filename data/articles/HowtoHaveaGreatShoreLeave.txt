Every port town has a town or city website, which is usually run by the local council or city tourist office. Websites that are run by the tourism board are often the most up to date and contain calendars of upcoming events.
The official town and city websites are always a good starting point to research places of interest and will often link to outside sites for more information about specific locations.;

Check to see if there are any cultural or entertainment events that coincide with the dates of your visit. Prioritize special events over local attractions that you can visit anytime.
,, Don't over-schedule your time off the ship.



Pool resources with your shipmates to see where they will be going and see if you can visit attractions in small groups.
Your fellow shore leave companions may have the inside track on a good place to visit or have friends who can show you the sights a little off the beaten track.

 Ticks can attach themselves anywhere on your horse’s body. However, ticks usually attach themselves to places on the horse’s body where there is longer hair, for example, in the horse’s mane and tail or around the ears. Ticks also like to attach themselves to the horse’s fetlock. The fetlock is the area on the back of the horse’s hoof, or the heel, so to speak, where longer hair grows on some horses.Don’t forget to check the warm and fleshy areas of your horse’s body, such as the girth, armpit, and flanks. Ticks can crawl into these places to feed.
 Removing ticks from your horse, especially from the horse’s back area, like its tail or hind legs, can cause your horse to become anxious. Therefore, before you begin the procedure, make sure your horse is calm and trusts you by talking to it in a reassuring voice while rubbing its head. You can also give your horse its favorite snack, like carrots. This will help keep the horse calm throughout the procedure.


If your horse begins to become anxious in the middle of the procedure, stop what you are doing and proceed to calm your horse again. Because it is an action your horse is familiar with, you may also try brushing your horse’s mane or tail in order to calm your horse.
 If your horse’s skin develops a reaction to the tick bite, i.e., by turning red or swelling, call your veterinarian. Also, if your horse is severely infected with ticks or if there are ticks in your horse’s ears, it is advised that you call a veterinarian right away to remove these ticks.

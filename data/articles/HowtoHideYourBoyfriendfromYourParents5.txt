 Try to understand the underlying communication issues between you and your parents. Perhaps you don't want to tell your parents that you're dating someone of the same gender, or someone from a different ethnic or religious background, or someone significantly older than you. Maybe your parents have forbidden you from having a boyfriend, period. Give yourself a clear picture of the situation so that you can decide how to move forward.


The longer you date this guy, the more likely your parents will be to find out. Your life will be much easier if you don't have to sneak around.
Consider whether your parents would be okay with it. Perhaps you're projecting your own worries onto them. If you aren't sure, ask a trustworthy sibling or relative for advice.
 Your parents might be suspicious of any new guy who comes into your life, but this may just be because they care. Don't tell your parents the moment that you start dating this guy. Give it at least a few weeks (or months) before you break the news, and try to

, If your parents learn to trust him, they may be less hesitant to say "no". Consider that your parents may have forbidden you from dating based on the abstract idea of a boyfriend a new and potentially-threatening male presence in your life, but that they might be a bit more lenient if the male presence is a friendly face.


This can be a great way to "hide" your boyfriend in plain sight. You will need to be especially careful, however, not to let your parents interacting with him in a romantic way. Try to bring him around in groups, and don't be too affectionate.
 Weigh the consequences of such a conversation. If your parents wouldn't react well (would disown you, forbid you from seeing your boyfriend, etc.), then it may be safer to wait. If you don't feel comfortable telling your parents, consider asking a teacher, a relative, or a community member to sit in as a moderator.

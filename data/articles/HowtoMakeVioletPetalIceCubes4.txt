 Here are some suggestions:

Add a rose petal for each violet flower as well, to make a combined flower ice cube.
Use fruit juice in place of water for children's drinks.
Use coconut milk for an exotic ice cube, ideal for alcoholic drinks.
Use iced tea in place of water, and a little squeeze of lemon juice.
Use viola or pansy flowers in place of violet flowers.Heartsease or v. tricolor is a good choice.These flowers are larger and might make an interesting combination with smaller violet flowers. Note that they may add a mild pea flavor to the drink.

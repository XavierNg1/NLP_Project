 Attach a safety pin to the seam of your pants or at the back neck of your shirt. The metal of the pin discharges the electrical build up in your clothes, preventing static cling and electrical shocks.Attaching the pin at a seam allows you to hide the pin, but still reap its static reducing benefits.
 Run a metal hanger on the surface (front and back) and inside of any article of clothing. This will reduce the electrical charge of the item of clothing, by transferring the electron charges on the clothes to the metal hanger., Always keep some piece of metal on your person, whether itâ€™s a coin, a thimble, or a keychain. Use any of these items to touch the grounded metal surface before you touch it with your skin.This is also know as grounding yourself, so you never accumulate electrical charges, but the charges are instead transferred to the metal object.

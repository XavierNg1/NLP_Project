 Using a large mixing bowl, mix together the following 4 ingredients. You may also substitute any chocolate syrup for a brand that you prefer.½ cup (125 ml) Chocolate syrup
¼ cup (60 ml) peanut butter
¼ cup (60 ml) milk or cream
1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla

, Gather about 8 cups (half a gallon) of fresh snow and mix it in immediately with the peanut butter mixture. Time is crucial as you do not want the snow to melt. Mix until you have your desired consistency of ice cream.
 Whether you enjoy peanut butter bar chunks or sprinkles, add whatever you desire., The ice cream may be fairly soft. After you have mixed everything together, cover your ice cream and place it in the freezer or outside if it is freezing temperature. This will give you a harder consistency.

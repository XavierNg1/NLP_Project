 You can design a simple website that promotes your business and your skills for as little as $20 per month on web hosting platforms such as GoDaddy, Yahoo and FatCow. These sites include templates and you only need to provide the information.
 These will include business cards, postcards, fliers, brochures and even some inexpensive things you can give away, such as pencils.


Include all of your business contact information on your materials. You should have a telephone number, email address and a website.
 You can use yard signs to promote your business when you are working on a particular property.


Ask your customers if you can leave your signs in their yards for a day or 2 after you complete your work. A discount might encourage them to give you that extra exposure.
Make the sign noticeable. It should be 36 in. (91 cm) wide and 30 in. (70 cm) high. The name of your business and your contact information should be easy to read for people who are walking or driving by.
 This is mobile advertising that will go with you any time you drive.
 Starting a Facebook page and a Twitter account will allow you to promote your handyman business in the digital space.


Post links and share relevant information. For example, you could share articles and videos on how to keep your gutters clean, how frequently to change your air filters and safety features on various tools.
Consider writing a blog. Publishing information and tips will establish you as an expert in your field. You can share your blog on your website or any of your social media platforms.
 Post ads on sites such as Craigslist, PennySaver and USFreeAds. You can also list your handyman business on Google Places for free.
 Attend local events, meetings and other activities that will give you the opportunity to meet leaders in your community. You can introduce yourself and explain the services you offer.
 You will have access to marketing resources and opportunities for work in your community.

 Make sure the sock is tidy and good-looking before you start, and clean. Choose a cute sock, as it will be teddy's PJ's "fabric".
 This will make two pieces, measuring the same size.
 Cut a small hole on one side, large enough to fit on your teddy's arm. Cut another small hole on the opposite side, again of a size to fit the arm. These should be in the same place, only on opposite sides. Pull over the teddy's head and push the arms into the new holes. This is now teddy's new PJ's.

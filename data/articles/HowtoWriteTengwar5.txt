 As only one piece of writing exists in Black Speech (the One Ring inscription), most of this mode is fan speculation. Tolkien himself never really developed the Black Speech.
 The tehta is read before the tengwa. Therefore, vowels are placed on the letter after them. Also, in this mode, the tehtar for u and o are swapped.
 If you have an r followed by a vowel, use the left tengwa. If you have an r followed by a consonant or at the end of a word, use the right tengwa.
 A diphthong is a pair of vowels pronounced as one sound. All other vowel combinations are pronounced as individual vowels. The diphthongs for Black Speech are pretty speculative.
 The above table shows the values for this mode.

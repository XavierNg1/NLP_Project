 You may want to reconsider placing a burlap flower on a silk blouse. Hold a piece of burlap up to the material you want to use it on and make sure they match.
 Sometimes bigger isn’t always better so make sure you are sizing your flowers appropriately for your project. Fabric that is one and a half inches wide by 30 inches long, or about four centimeters by seven and a half decimeters, is a good size to start with. The longer strips of burlap you use the more petals you’ll have., Lay your strip of burlap flat on a table and fold it in half lengthwise. If you are working with a strip that’s one and a half inches (almost four centimeters) wide, it should be three-quarters of an inch (a little less than two centimeters) wide after you fold it.
 Pick up one end of the folded strip and begin rolling it inward. Continue rolling several more times so you have approximately two or three center layers This will create the center of your burlap flower.
 As you hold the rolled center with one hand, start folding and twisting the burlap down and around the centerpiece. Do not keep the rest of the burlap folded in half anymore. Continue to roll and twist the burlap around the center and restart if you need to.
 Hold in place for several minutes or until dried so your flower doesn’t unravel once you start working on the base.
 Place hot glue on the bottom of the flower and along the sides to ensure it is fully contained. Cover the bottom with a felt center and hold both pieces together, until the hot glue is dry and set.

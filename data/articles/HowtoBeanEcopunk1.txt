 Environmentalism isn't cut and dry. For example, leather kills cows but pleather is made from petroleum. Which is better? That's up to you to research and consider.;
, Many environmentalists believe that without an end to capitalism the ecological destruction will never end. Try to learn about the different socioeconomic systems and make a decision about whether capitalism is compatible with environmentalism. If you make the conclusion that capitalism must end, try to learn what socioeconomic system should replace it.
 Be an individual and pick the best economic system.
 Simply changing your lifestyle will help improve things somewhat but without actively recruiting others and engaging in activism you will not bring much social change.
 Your choices could influence other people's choices.

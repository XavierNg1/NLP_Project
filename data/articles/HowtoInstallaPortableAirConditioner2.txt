 The installation will be similar to that for a window. However, you will probably need to buy a piece of Plexiglas to fill the gap between the exhaust hose and the top of the door. It will also make using the door very inconvenient.



In office environments where outside windows are not present or accessible, portable air conditioners can be vented through a drop ceiling. Commercial ceiling vent kits can be purchased online or from your local HVAC retailer.
There are a number of potential risks and inefficiencies involved with this procedure, so be sure to check with your building's maintenance personnel before proceeding.
It is also possible to vent a portable air conditioner into an attic, however to avoid property damage or inadvertently heating up other parts of the house, it is advisable to get professional advice from an HVAC specialist before proceeding.
 If a window is not available, and a long term installation is desired, a licensed contractor can cut a hole through an exterior wall and install an exhaust port for your portable air conditioning unit.
 In homes that have chimneys, it is possible to vent a portable air conditioner through a fireplace.


Use the supplied window adapter kit, or custom-cut Plexiglas to fill in the gaps around the exhaust hose and the fireplace opening.
Make sure that your chimney is clean and not obstructed by soot, and that the flue is open.

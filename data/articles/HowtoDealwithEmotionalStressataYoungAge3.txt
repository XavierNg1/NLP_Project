 If we are not feeling well physically or mentally, this could increase the amount of negative thinking we have. Exposures to high levels of stress over time can increase the risk of certain diseases and health conditions (such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes).So, it is important to take care of yourself especially during difficult times.


Eat a well-balanced diet. Eating healthy means filling your plate with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
 Quality of sleep can help reduce stress.If you are having trouble sleeping first look at what might be bothering you. Is it too cold or too hot? Is it too noisy? Try to fix these situations first.If you are 8-16 years old you may need about 9-10 hours of sleep per night.If you are older than 16, you may need at least 8 hours of sleep per night.
 Exercise is a great way to increase positive emotions and distract yourself from negative thinking. It changes your mind and body to make you stress less.Some of us may have difficulty getting our exercise in because we are so focused on our phones and social media (Instagram, SnapChat, Facebook). Try putting your phone down for just an hour a day (maybe hide it in your room) and do something active instead.
Try fun activities like: dancing, playing handball, basketball, jumping rope, or skipping.
Exercise is more fun when you do it with other people. Invite a friend to go swimming, biking, or skateboarding.
If you have access to a game console (such as a Nintendo Wii), you can play active games like bowling or boxing with yourself or your friends.

 Now depending on the school you're at, there could be more subjects and you'll have more classrooms! One for EVERY subject. Be ready to move around. To survive this, remember what classrooms they are in and where are they, and meet the teachers to make a good impression.;
, There are usually harder classes, strict teachers, and more classrooms! Don't worry: there are some advantages! More friends, a locker (hopefully), more freedom (hopefully!) and possibly a new hobby or experience! There will be a lot of differences, so go along with it and don't feel stressed about the change.
 Keep all your books and little fun things in there! You'll (normally) go there after each class to get your stuff for the next!


Have a small mirror for your locker. Preferably a magnetic one. Without a minute to spare between classes, it's going to be quite useful!







, If you have strict teachers, try to stay on their good side, hand in your homework, and be thoughtful.
 Don't mess with drama! If they do try to threaten you or anything, tell an adult you trust to help you with it.
 Try to make at least one new friend in every class and try to eat healthily on your first day.
 Do your homework. Make sure you study for tests! You don't need an "A" for everything, but a "F" on everything is not good! Put aside a good hour to study for before a big test, and take notes during class.
 Just be careful on who you're looking at! If you aren't too interested in dating now, don't worry about it for a while. Take your time and know that your person will come to you (but make an effort yourself if you want to date, too).

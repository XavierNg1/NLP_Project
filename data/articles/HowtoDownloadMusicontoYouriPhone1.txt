 You can access all of your iTunes music purchases directly from the Music app on your iPhone.;
, This will display the different options for browsing your music library.


Your library includes music you've purchased from iTunes, music files you've synced from your computer, songs added to your iCloud Music Library, and music you've added from Apple Music.
 Tap the various categories in the Library tab to find the music you want to download to your device.


You can stream any of the music in your Music library if you'd like instead of downloading it. Just tap it to begin playing.
 This may appear in the list of songs, or it may appear below the album or playlist name. The button looks like an iCloud logo with arrow pointing out the bottom. Tapping this button will begin downloading the song, album, or playlist to your device.


If you see a "+" instead of an iCloud Download button, tap it to add the music to your library. This will reveal the iCloud Download button. You'll see the "+" button if you are an Apple Music subscriber.
If you see a silhouette of an iPhone with a checkmark on it, the music is already downloaded to your iPhone.

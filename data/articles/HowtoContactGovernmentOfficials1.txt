Contact federal officials such as your United States Senator or member of Congress if you have an opinion on a national issue, such as Social Security, Medicare or defense.
Get in touch with state and local officials for questions or problems specific to your region, or to share concerns about the local legislation. Most states have an assembly or a legislature as well as a state senate. You can also appeal directly to the governor, mayor, and city or town council.
 For example, if you are a farmer with an interest in promoting your organic farm, contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture rather than the president or your senator.
 This can be found online, by searching sites such as USA.gov and Congress.org, in your local printed directories and in government buildings such as post offices and libraries.
 Your U.S. Senator and member of Congress will have a local office as well as an office address in Washington, D.C.



Be sure to sign your name and include your contact information. The government official you are contacting might need to get in touch with you for more information or to offer you assistance.
Keep your letter brief, on point and professional. Rambling letters that go on for pages and pages are less likely to be taken seriously than succinct, well-written correspondence.

 To keep your oven glass looking great, perform a regular baking soda cleaning once a week. Put a reminder on your calendar to help make it a part of your weekly cleaning routine., If something messy splatters in your oven, try to clean it as soon as the oven glass is cool. This will keep your mess from getting baked on many more times over, which will ultimately make it more difficult to clean.
 If you have an oven with a self-clean setting, run it once a month to keep your oven grime-free. This ultra high heat setting will help neutralize oven messes and ensure your oven functions its best.

 Add in guidelines for the face.;
, Draw a curvy "M" shape for his nose. Give Mojo Jojo an evil smile with spiky teeth. Draw his ears with half circles.
 They should curve inwards, some of them connecting to create points in the middle of his helmet. Draw a few ovals on the rim.
 Sketch in his boots, with points and heels as shown.
 The cape is a defining element of Mojo Jojo's appearance, so try to draw it as dramatically as possible.
 His arms are thick and furry, and his fingers curl inward, like he's perpetually angry.
 Make sure no excess guidelines remain. You've just drawn the super-villain Mojo Jojo!

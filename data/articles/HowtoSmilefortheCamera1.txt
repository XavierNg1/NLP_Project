 Studying old images of yourself is an easy way to identify your signature smile. Flip through a photo album, click through your social media pictures, or thumb through a stack of photographs of yourself. Note your favorite pictures and consider why you like these images of yourself:


Is your head tilted in a certain way?
Do you have a toothy grin or are your lips closed?
Are your eyes focused on the camera or staring off in the distance?
Is your face relaxed, with wrinkles around your eyes and mouth?
Does your smile look natural or forced?;
, While standing in front of a mirror, try to replicate your favorite smiles.


Replicate your body position in the photos—tilt your head and angle your shoulders as they appear in the photograph.
Recall the moment captured by the camera and note your emotions.
Channel these memories and feelings; embody them with your smile., To master your signature smile and flash it on command, you must devote time to practicing your grin. Continue to practice your smile in front of a mirror—recall the memory, recapture the emotions, and produce your signature smile. Gradually, your muscle memory will improve and it will become more natural to flash your signature smile.

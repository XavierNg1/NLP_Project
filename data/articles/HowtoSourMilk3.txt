 The most common use for sour milk is in baking recipes that require buttermilk. You can easily substitute the tang that buttermilk provides with sour milk in cakes, scones, and biscuits.Sour milk also works well in pancake and waffle batter.
You can also use the sour milk to replace yogurt or sour cream in baked goods.
 If you’re cooking a cut of meat that you want to ensure is tender, soak it in sour milk. Mix up a flavorful marinade for chicken, steak, or fish by combining the milk with herbs such as rosemary, thyme, garlic, and/or black pepper.In savory recipes, you can also mix sour milk into dishes like potato bakes, casseroles, or stews that have a creamy or cheesy consistency. You should just be careful that the tangy flavor of the milk doesn’t overpower the dish.
 With sour milk, you can whip up rich homemade cottage cheese. You’ll need to heat the milk on medium until it’s 185°F (85°C), remove it from the heat, and mix in some vinegar. Next, pour it through a colander lined with cheesecloth, rinse the curds, and mix them with salt and a little milk or cream until you get the consistency you like.Keep your cottage cheese refrigerated, and eat it within a week.

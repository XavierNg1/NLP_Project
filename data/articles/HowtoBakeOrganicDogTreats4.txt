 Get 2 cups of organic carrots, a quarter cup of dry oats, 1 apple, 3/4 cups of organic wheat flour, and 1 cup of organic flax seed. Core and shred the apple while making sure that you remove all seeds. Mix the ingredients in a large mixing bowl with a quarter cup of water until you have a thick batter., Spray non-stick spray onto a cupcake or muffin tin and then pour the mixture into the divots. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then bake the muffins for 15 minutes. Remove them and check if they’ve browned. If they haven’t place then back in the oven for another 5 minutes and repeat until thoroughly baked., It should only take 10-15 minutes for the muffins to cool. This recipe should make about a dozen muffins so store the leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator. You can reheat them in a microwave for 20 seconds.

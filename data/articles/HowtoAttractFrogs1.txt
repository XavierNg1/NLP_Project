 Frogs drink and breathe through their skin, which needs to be kept constantly moist in order for them to perform these basic life functions. Thus, the most essential requirement for attracting frogs is an accessible source of fresh water that’s out of direct sunlight.If you don’t have a pond or other built-in water source in your yard, simply place some large, shallow dishes of water in a shady area of your lawn or garden. Be sure to clean the dish and change the water weekly so that it doesn’t stagnate.You could also try sinking a shallow plastic tub into the ground to provide a makeshift pond.
Frogs also spawn in water. Ideally, your water source or sources should be large enough to accommodate adult and young frogs.;
, Frogs are generally more active at night since too much exposure to the sun puts them at risk of dehydration. Create a simple shelter for frogs that will offer them a safe, cave-like space to rest during the day. It should be out of the sun and predators’ reach.You can create a simple shelter using an overturned ceramic pot propped up by some rocks. Place it in a shady location near to a water source, and leave just enough room between the rim of the pot and the earth for frogs to slip in and out.
 If you want frogs to show up in your yard or garden, you need to provide them with adequate food. The best way to do that is plant a range of seasonal flowering plants that will attract insects throughout the year.Aim to always have something in bloom during the spring, summer, and fall. That way, nectar-eating bugs will flock to your yard.
 The bugs that are attracted to a compost heap and mulch also make great food for frogs. Compost and mulch can also provide the damp conditions where frogs love to live.Do not remove leaf litter from some areas in your yard. Leaf litter provides shelter for frogs and some of their prey also prefers areas with leaf litter.

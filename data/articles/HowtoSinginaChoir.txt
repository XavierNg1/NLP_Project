 Whether you like traditional choral music, barber shop, gospel or show music, there will almost definitely be a choir out there which suits you.;
, Ask around and search the internet to help find some local choirs you could join. Also, pay attention to advertisements in local meeting places, as it may be possible there is something going on there.
 Depending on the choir you have chosen, you may have to audition, but many choirs are happy to let anyone join.


It also may be a good idea to check at this point whether or not you will need to pay for membership, uniforms, or music.
 Being in a choir is a commitment - only going to half of the rehearsals will let down the other choir members. If you don't have the time, don't join.
 The friends you make at choir can be friends for life, so don't forget to socialize.
 You should pick this up as you go along, so don't worry about it too much. If you're having difficulty, ask somebody who sits near you to point you in the right direction; they will probably be more than happy to help.
 Unlike solo singing, the point of singing in a choir isn't to stand out, but to blend in. If you're singing too loud or out of tune it will be obvious. Listen to the people around you and try to match your singing to theirs.
 Choirs can give you some of the most amazing experiences of your life and help you achieve things you could not have done alone. Music is intended to be enjoyed by both listener and performer, so if you're not enjoying it then it probably isn't right for you. Don't feel you have to stay if you don't like it.
 Always come to rehearsal on time, practice at home, and if you can't hit a high note, don't worry, you can always mouth the words if you have to.

 This is the basis of the game.;
, The hand symbols are as follows:


Rock - form a fist.






Scissors - hold the hand out, with the pointer and middle finger separated; all other fingers must be in.






Paper - hold the hand out, extending all fingers.






Lizard - have the fingers out and cupped, thumb below them, to look like a sock-puppet mouth.






Spock - perform Spock's traditional Vulcan salute!







, Each method can be remembered as a "rap", in the order that follows with the steps:


Scissors cut paper






Paper covers rock






Rock crushes lizard






Lizard poisons Spock






Spock smashes scissors






Scissors decapitate lizard






Lizard eats paper






Paper disproves Spock






Spock vaporizes rock






And as it's always been, Rock crushes scissors

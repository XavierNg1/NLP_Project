 Watch the movie and listen to the songs. If you're doing a "junior" version, you might want to consider watching that version on YouTube so that you know exactly what your show will be like.;
, Or, think of characters you would do a good job portraying. Remember, not everyone can be the lead, but don't let the fear of getting a small part keep you from making it your goal to get the lead. You never know! Once you've chosen a few characters you could play well, analyze those characters. Take note of their traits, feelings, motivation, etc.
 Many of the junior Disney shows are licensed by MTI Broadway. Go to their website www.broadwayjr.com and click on the show you're doing. You'll have access to a sample of the songs, a synopsis, and some audition materials for different characters to get you prepared.

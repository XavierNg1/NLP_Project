Lay newspaper or butcher paper flat on the floor. Set the back of the chair on the ground over the paper.
Draw around the back of the chair.
Draw a second line around the original line. The second line should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) wider than the original line. This will ensure that you have enough material to cover the chair.
Draw the second line more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide if the chair is already covered in a thick fabric.
Cut along the outer line of the pattern.;
,

Place two lengths of fabric on top of each other on a flat surface. Lay the paper over the fabric. Pin the paper to both pieces of fabric. Use safety pins or stick pins.
Cut around the outside of the paper. Ensure that you cut through both pieces of fabric.
Unpin the paper from the fabric.


Place the pieces of fabric together. The right side of each piece should face the other. Pin together the pieces of cloth.
Sew the cloth together with a sewing machine. Do not sew together the bottom edges. The bottom edges need to stay open to slip over the top of the chair.
Hem the open edges. Fold up the bottom edges of the fabric. Glue them together. Make a hem as long as needed, depending on the desired look of the chair cover.
Finish the seams. Cut off the extra fabric from the seams you have sewn together. The seam should be between 1/4 and 1/2 inch long after cutting.
Turn the cover right side out. The sides of the fabric that will be on display should now be facing outwards.
 Cut four pieces of string or ribbon to the desired length. Sew or glue one string to each of the bottom corners of the chair cover., Slip the cover over the chair back. Tie together the two strings on each side. Fasten the strings as tightly as needed for the cover to fit snugly over the chair.

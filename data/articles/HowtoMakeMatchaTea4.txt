 Place a strainer over a cup and measure out the matcha powder into it. Gently tap the side of the strainer to sift the powder into the cup. This will get rid of any lumps and give you a smoother latte.
 You will be adding the hot water next, so it is better to add the sweetener right now. The hot water will help dissolve it much better than cold milk will. You can use any type of sweetener you wish, such as agave nectar, honey, maple syrup, sugar, etc., The water must be very hot, but not quite boiling—about 165 to 180°F (75 to 80°C). After you have poured the water in, briskly whisk it using a zigzag motion. You can use a chasen (bamboo whisk) for this, or you can use a metal whisk. Keep whisking until the matcha dissolves and there are no lumps or clumps. You will end up with a thick, green paste., You can add as much milk as you'd like, and you can use any type of milk. Many people find that almond milk complements the flavor of matcha tea exceptionally well. Keep whisking the milk until it is combined with the matcha paste. There should be no streaks or swirls; you'll get a light green beverage.
 To prevent the latte from getting watered down, consider using ice cubes made from milk. You can also omit the ice if you don't like your iced lattes as cold.
 If you wait too long, the matcha powder will settle to the bottom of the cup.

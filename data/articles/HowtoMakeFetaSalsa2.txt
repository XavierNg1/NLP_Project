 Wash 2 plum tomatoes and trim away the stem ends. Chop the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces and put them in a serving bowl. Slice one avocado in half and remove the pit. Scoop the flesh out and chop it into pieces. Add this to the bowl along with 1/4 cup (40 g) of finely chopped red onion. You'll also need to add 1 clove of minced garlic.If you don't have plum tomatoes, you could substitute one large tomato.
 Use kitchen shears to snip fresh parsley and oregano. Or use a knife to mince enough of the herbs to get 1 tablespoon of each. Place the herbs in the serving bowl along with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar.You can use red or white wine vinegar. Avoid using balsamic or apple cider vinegar, since these could add unwanted flavors to the salsa.
 Use a large spoon to gently toss the salsa together. Try not to stir too roughly or the avocado might become mashed. Stir in 4 ounces (113 g) of coarsely crumbled feta cheese until it's just mixed in., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and place it in the refrigerator for 2 to 6 hours. This will give the flavors a chance to develop before you serve it.Consider serving the salsa with tortilla chips or toasted flatbread. It's also a great topping for hamburgers.

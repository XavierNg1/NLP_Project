 Once you cut power to the engine, you will lose your ability to steer the boat. Point the boat in the direction that you would like to go. Make sure that there are no people or structures (e.g. docks) in your path., When you put the engine back into neutral, the propeller will stop turning. This stops the thrust that pushes your boat forward. Keep in mind that the engine is still running even when it is in neutral., Turn the key to the off position to stop the engine. If your engine does not have a key, close the throttle. Once your engine is off, you can remove the kill switch cable from your wrist.

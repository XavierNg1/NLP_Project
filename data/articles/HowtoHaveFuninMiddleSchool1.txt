 It isn't going to be any fun when your teacher is giving you a hard time about not having your homework completed. It can be extremely embarrassing when your teacher yells at you.;
, There might be something fun going on tomorrow, but you can't go when it is required that you have a signed permission slip.
 If you don't make lunch, be sure to bring lunch money. What fun is middle school going to be when your starving because you forgot your lunch? Not much fun. Also make sure that if your packing your lunch, that it is healthy and provides energy. You need energy to have fun in middle school, don't you?

, You won't be having much fun when you show up late to middle school. The bus is a good idea, as long as you make it to the bus stop on time. If you can't do that, consider carpooling.
, You do not want to wake up late to middle school, because you will feel stressed, and you won't want to have any fun.
 At least eight hours of sleep. You won't be having fun when your grouchy and tired because you went to bed late.

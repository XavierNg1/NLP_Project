 Whisk the three ingredients together in a small bowl and transfer to a 1-gallon (4-liter) resealable plastic bag.


You can also use a glass dish covered with aluminum foil instead of the plastic bag.;

If using a glass dish, turn the fillets in the marinade several times to coat all sides, then cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
 Place the bag with the marinade and salmon fillets in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.


Salmon, like all fish, is not as dense as red meats and poultry. As a result, it does not need to be marinaded for long in order to absorb flavor.
Remove the salmon from the refrigerator at least 10 minutes prior to cooking. Doing so raises the temperature, allowing it to cook more evenly throughout.

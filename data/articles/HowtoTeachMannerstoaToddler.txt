 Children who cannot speak yet are still able to communicate these words by learning a little sign language. For example, when you say "please," make the sign for it at the same time. This reinforces the sign and the verbal word while giving your pre-verbal child a way to communicate back. As you repeat this often, your child will pick up the sign and begin to sign "please" when she asks for something.;
, This means once you introduce manners, stick with it and rehearse the trait several times a day. Make it a part of everyone's behavior. It may take time, but young ones are smart and will get it. Teaching manners early in life will pay dividends long after they’re out of the house (not that you want to think about that yet!).
 Children make you better people because they mirror the way you act.
 Let them know how polite and thoughtful their actions are to others.
 Remember that teaching manners is often the first step in getting young ones to think beyond themselves. Some families have "anti-manners" dinners where all rules are thrown out the door. Try sticker charts to reinforce positive behavior or a "manners" month for those who may need a refresher. It won’t happen overnight, but when you see them in action, you’ll be so proud. It’s not uncommon to first see the fruits of your labor when you’re out of the house, around others, or visiting Grandma and Grandpa.

 The point will not be on the given line, and can be above or below it. Label the line m{\displaystyle m} and the point A{\displaystyle A}.
 To do this, place the compass tip on point A{\displaystyle A}. Open the compass so that it is wide enough to reach beyond line m{\displaystyle m}, then draw an arc that sweeps across the line at points B{\displaystyle B} and C{\displaystyle C}.
 To do this, open the compass a little wider. Set the compass tip on point B{\displaystyle B}, and draw an arc that sweeps directly across from point A{\displaystyle A}.

If the given point is above the line, you should draw this arc below the line. If the given point is below the line, you should draw this arc above the line. 

The arc does not have to be very long, as long as part of it falls directly under the given point.
 To do this, keep the compass set to the same width. Set the compass tip on point C{\displaystyle C} and draw an arc that intersects the previous small arc. Label this point D{\displaystyle D}
, Label this line line n{\displaystyle n}. Line n{\displaystyle n} is perpendicular to line m{\displaystyle m} through points A{\displaystyle A} and D{\displaystyle D}.Remember, a perpendicular line is a line that creates a 90 degree angle.
 To do this, place the compass tip on point A{\displaystyle A}, then draw an arc that sweeps across line n{\displaystyle n} at points E{\displaystyle E} and F{\displaystyle F}.
 To do this, open the compass a little wider. Set the compass tip on point E{\displaystyle E}, and draw an arc that sweeps directly across from point A{\displaystyle A}.
 To do this, keep the compass set to the same width. Place the compass tip on point F{\displaystyle F} and draw an arc that intersects the previous small arc. Label this point G{\displaystyle G}.
 This line is perpendicular to line n{\displaystyle n}. Thus, it is parallel to line m{\displaystyle m} and passes through the given point, point A{\displaystyle A}.

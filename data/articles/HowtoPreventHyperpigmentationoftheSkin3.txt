 If you experience hyperpigmentation there are a number of possible treatments for you to consider. These include topical creams including retinoids and corticosteriods.Drugs which block the production of melanin may be prescribed. Treatments which effect melanin formation are currently consider the most successful.Before deciding on any treatments, speak to your doctor or dermatologist to discuss the possibilities and what might be most suited to you.
 Due to the commonness of hyperpigmentation and the potential of the medical treatments to irritate your skin, people have been looking for natural alternative treatments. Some natural ingredients in topical treatments have been shown to have benefits in laboratory tests, such as soy.Natural and home remedies are never completely reliable, but citrus juice and aloe vera are cited as potentially good ingredients to use in topical treatments.Make a mask with aloe vera, seaweed and honey and let it rest on your face for ten minutes before rinsing off.
Alternatively try mixing lemon juice with honey and milk and use this as a face mask., If you are struggling to lighten dark patches on your face, you may want to consider further treatment options that go beyond topical creams and natural remedies. It's recommended that you speak to your doctor or dermatologist who will be able to advise you on specific treatments. One common treatment is a chemical peel. This is a harsher treatment than topical creams and involves you applying a liquid chemical solution, such as glycolic acid, to your skin.A chemical peel may be advised if other treatments prove ineffectual.
Dermabrasion or microdermabrasion treatments may also be recommended.
In some cases an light therapy or laser treatment might be used to target discoloured areas of skin.

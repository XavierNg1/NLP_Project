 if you've connected Zoosk with your Facebook account, you'll want to revoke Zoosk's permissions so that it doesn't appear anymore on your feed. To do this, you'll need to be logged into Facebook.
 You can access this by clicking the inverted triangle in the upper-right corner of your Facebook home page and selecting "Settings".
 This is located in the left menu. Clicking Apps will open a list of all the connected web applications that have access to your Facebook profile.
 Find Zoosk in the list and then click the "X" to the right of the entry. You will be asked to confirm that you want to remove Zoosk. If you want to remove all Zoosk activity from your timeline as well, ensure that the box is checked and then click the "Remove" button.

 Rub your hands together vigorously up and down and side to side for approximately 10 seconds or more prior to holding and using a wand. This will open the energy pathways in your hands,which is crucial to transferring energy to the wand.
 According to most texts, the wand should be held in the right hand while praying or while summoning or addressing spirits.When dismissing spirits, however, hold the wand in the opposite hand. In this way, the wand is a sort of defensive weapon.
 Think of the wand as transferring energy from your dominant hand to your other, receiving hand. Energy should flow from your center, through your arm and hand, and out the point of your wand to the receiving hand., Feel around the wand for a comfortable spot to grip it. Listen to the wand to hear how best to hold onto it.

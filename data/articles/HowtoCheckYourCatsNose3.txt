 There are several herbs that are calming to cats and may help to keep your pet relaxed while you examine its nose. Valerian, for example, causes an active, “high” state usually followed by a sleepy feeling for cats and is safe for them to chew and eat in plant form. Give your cat valerian about a half hour before examining it to allow it to go through the initial period of excitement and settle into a relaxed mode.Catnip, known for eliciting a hyper effect, also induces a relaxed state. Give it to your cat to play with (a pinch in a fillable toy, or in a paper bag crushed into a tight ball) 15 minutes before examining its nose to make it more amenable., Applying gentle, constant pressure to your cat’s torso is a proven way to alleviate anxiety. While examining your cat, have a family member or friend hold your cat firmly, securing its body and putting light pressure on it. For added security, wrap your cat in a blanket and hold it that way.Another option is a ‘’pressure shirt”, a snug garment with adjustable straps designed to apply light, even pressure to the torso to keep your cat calm while it wears it. The “Thunder shirt”, for instance, is available online for approximately $40., Ask your vet about pheromone sprays as a way to relax your cat. These sprays contain a synthetic version of a smell that cats use to bond with each other and loved ones by rubbing up against them.For instance, Feliway, a synthetic copy of cats’ facial pheromones, is available through many veterinarians.

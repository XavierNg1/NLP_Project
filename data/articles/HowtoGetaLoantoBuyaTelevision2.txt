 If you can think of one, that you are on good terms with, and are comfortable with asking them, then try it. Approach the subject nicely and see if they can loan you some money. It could be the whole amount, or half, whatever you can negotiate for.
 This may include interest on the loan, repayment frequency (monthly) in your case. Ensure that you have the appropriate funds to pay them, otherwise you and your friend/family member can lose a lot of money!

, A good method is to set up a regular or automated transfer with a certain amount of money, to occur at a set time every month. This can be done with most bank accounts online.


It's a good idea to write down a miniature contract, so everybody is clear on the terms and has a record of it. Something like "Fred has agreed me to loan $3000. Repayments are to be paid monthly for 12 months, with each repayment consisting of $250, with no interest (0%). Fred ________ (Signature there) and I, Timmy _________ (signature there) both agree to these terms."
The above mini contract is just an idea, it can be useful if one of you forgets the details, and may even be legally enforceable, depending on your local laws.
 Just don't forget to make your monthly payments!

 Let your friend know you care by giving them a call or sending a card after you get the news. Keep checking in with them regularly – texts, emails, and visits in person are all appropriate. Don’t avoid your friend or tiptoe around the subject of their child’s death, even if you’re nervous about saying something wrong.The worst thing you can do is disappear after your friend goes through a tragedy. Be there for them, even if you feel awkward about it.;
, Your friend might appreciate some company right now. Ask them if you can drop by, or invite them to get coffee or lunch with you. Even a fifteen-minute visit can help your friend feel less alone.Ask your friend before you visit them. Don’t drop by unannounced.
Frequent, short visits are often better than long ones.
 Ask your friend if they want to go for a walk or see a movie with you. If you’re both part of any social groups or clubs, keep inviting them to get-togethers and catch them up on anything they’ve missed. Make them feel valued and included, even if they don’t want to socialize much right now.
 If your friend turns down your invitations, don’t push the issue. Keep extending the invitations in the future, though. Your friend may not be ready to spend time around people yet, but they will still appreciate that you’re thinking of them., Christmas, Thanksgiving, Mother’s Day, and Father’s Day are often tough for parents who have lost children. So are the child’s birthday and the anniversary of their death. On these occasions, let your friend know that you’re thinking of them and that you haven’t forgotten their child.Send your friend a “thinking of you” card on their child’s birthday or the anniversary of their death, or just mention that you were thinking about their child.
Don’t forget about second, third, and subsequent anniversaries. Anniversaries never stop being sad days for bereaved parents, but few others even remember them after the first year.

 These come in various lengths, but with a nominal 26-inch (66.04 cm) width. They each have advantages and disadvantages:

, The advantage of the PVC/polycarbonate roofing is the translucency of the panels.They allow daylight to enter through them.


If cost is a factor, PVC is a cheaper alternative to sheet metal.
PVC will block out the heat from the sun much more effectively than sheet metal, which will act like a radiator.
Some PVC is translucent, but filters ultraviolet rays, and comes in a variety of colors.
The disadvantages of PVC are that it's not as durable as sheet metal, is noisy in the rain, and can easily break off during high winds.
 One of the strongest features of corrugated metal is its durability. Modern galvanized steel or aluminum is resistant to rust, and can easily last up to 100 years.

Metal roofing is quieter than PVC when it rains.
Metal roofing resists rot, is not susceptible to insect damage, and is non-combustible (a boon in fire-prone areas).
The downsides include a susceptibility to denting, both in installation and in the case of an during hailstorms. It can also be significantly more expensive.

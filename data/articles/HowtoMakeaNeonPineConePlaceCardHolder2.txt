 Inspect each cone for damage and discard any that don't meet your standards.
 Find an area for the pine cones to dry. Cover the dry area with newspaper too.
 Grab a few heavy duty paper towels. Keep the paper towels on hand in case the paint drips or you need to remove excess paint from the brush.


Excess paint can be removed from the brush by simply pressing the brush against the rim of the plate or bowl before moving the brush to the cone.
 Gently apply paint to the tip of each of the pine cone wedges.
 Allow it to fully dry before adding the place card.

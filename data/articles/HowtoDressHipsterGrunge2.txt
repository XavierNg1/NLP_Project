 This is one area where you can really show your personality. You can pick a pair of shoes that stands out for how well they fit in with the overall outfit, such as black shoes with a black outfit. Or, you can go with a pair that is eye-catching in its degree of contrast and uniqueness. Your shoes can have studs, a boot-heel, or even military touches.


Moto-boots are a nod to the motorcycle trend, which is very present in hipster and grunge culture. Lace-up ankle boots are also quite common and comfortable., You can leave your head bare, or you can go with the stand-by knit cap. Go for one with a tighter knit in a nice fabric to add the hipster touch. A darker ball cap with a branded name is another way to capture the look.If you go with a headband of some sort, take a quick look to see if it appears more hipster or hippie. An industrial fabric, such as leather, will often push it into the hipster-grunge style.
You can wear a knit cap over hair styled into soft, unruly beach waves. Or, a knit or ball cap over short, gelled hair.
 Hipsters love to wear sunglasses, such as Ray-Ban Wayfarers. Sunglasses or eyeglasses with thick rims, retro looks, and dark or tinted lenses fit that style. To add a grunge element, look for sunglasses or eyeglasses with slightly sharper edges and metallic embellishments.You don’t have to need eyeglasses in order to wear them. Simply purchase a non-prescription pair and wear them as you choose.
 You can say a great deal with your accessories, so make sure to choose jewelry items that mean something to you. Large rings with darker stones and metallic finishes work well as hipster-grunge. Layered bracelets with metallic and rubber elements are good too. Unusual, and possibly quite large, necklaces are excellent eye-catchers.Don’t overdo it with your jewelry. It’s generally not a good idea to wear rings, earrings, bracelets, and a necklace all at once. Choose one or two areas to focus on.

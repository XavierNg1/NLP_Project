 Your fingers should be curled around the handle of the knife, and your thumb should be resting on the jicama.
 Don't let the blade come into contact with your thumb. The skin should peel off as the knife travels upward. Be careful not to remove too much of the flesh as you cut off the peel.
 Continue to bring the knife upward. Keep peeling until you reach the top of the fruit.
 Peel away another section. Continue until you have removed all of the peel, and discard the peel in your garbage or compost bin.

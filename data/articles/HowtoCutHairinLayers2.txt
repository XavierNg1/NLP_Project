 Shampoo and condition the hair prior to cutting your locks. Grab a towel and squeeze the excess water from the tresses. Comb through your hair to remove all the snags and snarls.Fill a spray bottle with warm water. As the hair dries, dampen it with the water from the spray bottle.
 Throughout the haircut, you will use 1 stationary guide to measure against every segment of hair. This will produce shaggy layers at varying lengths throughout your hair.


Section off a small segment of hair at the top of the head. Determine the length of the stationary guide—keep in mind that this will be your shortest layer.
Grasp the stationary guide between the middle and forefinger of your non-dominant hand . Slide the fingers towards the ends while pulling the segment straight up at a 180° angle. Stop your fingers when they have reached the desired length. Trim the excess hair with sharp shears.Instead of cutting off too much hair, start gradually. Trim off 1 to 2 inches of hair from the stationary guide and complete the entire hair cut. If the hair is still too long, take another 1 to 2 inches off of the stationary guide and re-cut your hair., Starting at the front of the head, insert a segment of hair surrounding the stationary guide and the stationary guide between your middle and forefinger. Slide your middle and forefinger towards the ends—pulling the hair at a 180° angle—until they reach the length of the stationary guide. Trim the excess hair. Repeat this process, working from to back down the center of the head., To produce even layers, alternate between cutting segments on the left side and the right side. Insert a segment of hair and the stationary guide between your middle and forefinger. Slide your middle and forefinger towards the ends—pulling the hair at a 180° angle—until they reach the length of the stationary guide. Trim the excess hair.Repeat until all of the hair is cut.

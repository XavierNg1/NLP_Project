 There are certain times and locations where others will consider selfie-taking rude, disrespectful, or otherwise antisocial. You should avoid taking selfies here like the plague. Here are some examples:


Funerals and memorials (too solemn)
Bathroom toilet (distasteful)
Driving (too reckless);
, What you think looks right might not to other people. Ask for a second opinion before posting it everywhere.
 You don't want to get a shot with something stuck in your teeth. If you're going to be taking a picture of yourself, you might as well look your best.
 If you frequently add or change pictures, it can annoy others and they may begin to see you as narcissistic and in need of attention.
 They can look okay occasionally, but using them too much makes it seem like you're trying too hard. Black and white/sepia may be useful if the colors surrounding you are too distracting or you have facial features that don't benefit from vibrant color (like acne).
 This gives anyone who comes across your photo something to enjoy or be entertained by. Here are some ideas:


A story about where you are (if you're on a trip/away from home)
Something new that has changed in your life (picture with your new car/pet/house/weight loss)
A new item of clothing you really like (especially if someone gifted it to you)
A famous quote that summarizes something about what you're thinking/expressing/doing/wearing.

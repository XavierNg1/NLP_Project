 Starting simply by having no more than one or two veggies in a single dish will make the veggies more appealing. Slowly introduce dishes that are more complex. For instance, if you know that your child likes broccoli, you can mix it with a smooth pasta sauce and pasta to make a more balanced meal. Don't try adding roasted peppers if you know your child doesn't like it. The sauce may not completely cover the taste or texture., While disguising vegetables can be a real solution, be careful not to hide crunchy, flavorful vegetables that a kid professes a dislike to in a soft dish like stuffing. While they may be perfectly willing to eat the stuffing, for instance, chomping down on an onion may make them pause before eating the dish again. The same thing goes with sauces and salsa. Any professed dislike for a vegetable due to texture that is not properly blended will likely cause a similar reaction to eating the vegetable alone., Kids are more sensitive to textures in foods than adults. Whether it’s sliminess or a “wet-crunch,”kids (and adults) can be sensitive to food textures. Going with soft, but not slimy, or pleasantly crisp vegetables (like carrots), can make eating vegetables fun for kids., Adding lemon juice or cheese to broccoli can help make the veggies more appealing.Honey or maple syrup can make cooked carrots more appetizing. In any case, they will be more likely to try veggies topped with flavors they love.Dips can be a great way to get kids to eat fresh crunchy veggies such as carrots or celery. Ranch dressing works especially well. Plain hummus can also make a great dip that is both kid-friendly and nutritious.
Peanut butter is also useful in getting kids to eat more veggies. Carrots and peanut butter can be a tasty treat.

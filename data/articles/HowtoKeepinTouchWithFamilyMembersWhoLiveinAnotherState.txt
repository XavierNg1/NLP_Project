 Nothing means more than a handwritten letter from a family member. Because they know you better than anyone else, write as if you are talking to them in person. If you have children of your own, always encourage them to draw a picture or write their own letter to be included.;
, Hearing each other's voices makes conversations more touching and brings families together. It is more challenging to have a phone conversation when you are in another timezone, so even if it is playing phone tag, leaving a string of voice mails, or a texting conversation, it's better than hesitating on when the best time to contact them is.
 Nowadays, more families are connecting with each other than before on social media platforms, especially Facebook. Staying in touch online is one of the most easiest methods when you are far away from a family member. Write statuses and upload pictures so everyone can be updated with anything new in your life.
 Be open to install various services, such as Skype or Google Hangouts, to accompany what others already have or prefer to use. Set aside an hour or two a week to connect and chat with them.
 Look for special or unique things in your state that your family member would like that they wouldn't find in their area and fill a box. This is a very efficient and popular choosing for parents to send their college children whom might make requests from home, such as non-perishable snacks.
 As people grow up, their characteristics and traits change over time. Instead of having a perception or view of a family member of what they used to be or act like in the past, look at them of what they are now in the future. Connect with them over career paths, extended families, or other life changing moments.
 Send some dog treats or catnip as a Christmas gift.

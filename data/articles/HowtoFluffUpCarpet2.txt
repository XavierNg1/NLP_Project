 Grab some ice from your freezer and set it in the dents in your carpet. If you have multiple dents, like from the four feet of a couch, place at least one ice cube in each dent. If the dent is more than two inches (5cm) wide, place more than one piece in the dent., Once the dents are covered with ice cubes, leave them alone long enough for the ice to melt. Depending on the temperature of the room and how much ice you put in each dent, this might take 20 minutes or up to an hour or more., When all of the ice in each dent has melted, use a clean towel to soak up all of the water. Press the towel gently so you don’t dent the carpet again. Make sure the towel is clean and white, so you don’t transfer color onto the carpet., Rub the previously dented area with your fingers until the carpet stands up as it should. If this doesn’t fluff the carpet enough, try scraping the carpet with the edge of a spoon or combing the carpet with the tines of a fork.Use a soft brush to even out the carpet once the fibers are fluffed back up.

 Invest in quality grooming tools for your cat to help to keep its coat clean and healthy. Purchase a pin brush for either a short-haired or long-haired cat, and buy a de-matter and thinning shears to remove knots or tangles from a long-haired cat. A grooming glove may also be a good choice to remove loose hair if your cat does not like ordinary brushing., Brushing your cat can achieve many of the same benefits that waterless bathing provides, such as redistributing essential oils through the cat's coat. For short-haired cats, brush once week with a pin brush for basic maintenance, and for long haired cats, brush daily with a wide-tooth brush. Be very gentle while brushing around your cat's chest and belly., To untangle mats in your cat's fur, use a de-matter or thinning shears (both available at pet stores or online) instead of scissors. The long prongs of the de-matter can tease knots out, while the thinning shears can cut out tangles without leaving obvious holes in your cat's coat. Be gentle and cautious when removing tangles to avoid harming your cat during the process., Clean your cat's ears regularly to help contribute to its overall hygiene. Buy an ear cleaning liquid from your veterinarian, or ask your veterinarian what cleaning liquid they recommend to buy from a pet store. Use a cotton ball to apply the ear cleaning liquid to your cat's ear canals, and let it dry and evaporate on its own.Always use ear cleaning liquid to clean your cat's ears instead of water, which can build up in your cat's ear canals.

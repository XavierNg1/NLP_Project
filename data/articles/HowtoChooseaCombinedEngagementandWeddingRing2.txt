 Some brides prefer to wear just the wedding band after they're married, while others wear both the engagement band and the wedding band. If the bride wants to wear them together, consider getting bands that lock into one another. They will be easier to wear, and they will coordinate well., Having a big flashy engagement ring and a big flashy wedding band can be a little too much together. Consider showing off one or the other, and letting the other ring be a bit simpler.For instance, you might have an engagement ring set with a series of diamonds and then have a plain wedding band.
In addition, not getting stones on both bands will save you money.
 While some sets come ready-made, you also have the option of customizing some sets. For example, you may get to choose what stone goes in the engagement ring, which is a way of adding a personal touch to the process.For example, you may want a certain cut of diamond, or you may decide that you don't want diamonds at all.
 A small band, particularly on the engagement ring, will make the diamond or other stone look bigger. Similarly, a small wedding band will help keep the attention on the large stone of the engagement ring.In addition, using smaller bands means less metal, making them cheaper.

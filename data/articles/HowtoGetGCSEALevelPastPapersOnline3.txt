, There should be a section entitled "Specification Finder". Click on "Select a qualification type". A box will come up with all of them - chances are you're looking for A Level (GCE) or one of the GCSE boxes. For these, the year corresponds to what year that specification will first be examined. If you're not sure which one yours is, open them all up and have a look to make sure.
 Once you have picked a qualification type in the first box, upon clicking the second a scroll box should appear with all of the subjects they examine in at that qualification level. Pick yours and you should be taken directly to the relevant page.
 Just under the subject header there should be a couple of options for you to choose from. Overview will give you a very brief introduction to the qualification, Noticeboard will have any notices, and there may also be some resources for older versions of the qualification, denoted by the old specification number - in this case: "6181 materials". These can also be good resources for you to use, but you must bear in mind that those papers aren't a totally accurate representation of what you will get in the exam, as since then the specification has changed.
 There are also more useful things in the options, like the Specification, which will tell you everything that you can be examined on. There are also specimen papers and mark schemes, which are like past papers, except they have never been examined, just set by the examiners as example question papers.
 This is the month and the year in which the paper was examined, usually twice per year - so you can get a set of papers for every date you see there.
 Once the series has been selected, a list of available papers and their associated mark schemes should show up. There may be one for each module that was examined at that time. Upon clicking on the link, the relevant paper or mark scheme will open in PDF format.

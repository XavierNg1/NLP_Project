 Whether it's Notepad or Notepad++ on a Windows PC or TextEdit on a Macintosh, these types of programs can help you add the link to your HTML document.;
,


Build each item on it's own separate line, as listed below.This is the basic structure of an HTML document and is required for all web pages.

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>



, Begin your tag by typing both the starting and end tags. Type out <a href=" "> and followed by </a> to form the link tag which is more properly called an anchor tag, hence the "a" in the HTML tag's name.
 Utilize the site's address as it is listed in the address bar of your browser.
 Type this text directly after the end triangular bracket of your anchor start tag and before the beginning portion of your anchor end tag's triangular bracket.


If you want to, you can insert your own images into this location instead. Follow Insert Images with HTML for this method, keeping in mind that you are just looking to add the <img> tag to the HTML page, leaving the <a href=""> and </a> tags in place to create the link to the other page's trigger.
 To preview in most cases, you'll have to save the file and open the file later.


Although there used to be a Microsoft program called Microsoft Office FrontPage that used to have a preview function before the HTML file was saved that could display a preview of the page in different browsers, this can no longer be done and files must be saved to be previewed (to be checked later). Inconvenient? Well, you be the sole decider. It's only a few extra keystrokes, if done correctly.
 If you don't double check your code, you could be in for a rude awakening if things were written write and the reader sees errors, though this script shouldn't produce any.It should look like: <a href="http:Test link</a>

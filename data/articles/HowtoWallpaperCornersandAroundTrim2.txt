 Smooth it with the wallpaper brush as best you can without pressing it to the edge of the trim.
, Your cut should follow the seam where the two pieces of trim were fitted together at the corner.
 Smooth the sheet, then roll the edges with the seam roller.
 For a door, measure the distance from the frame to the ceiling and cut the sheet so it overlaps the trim as before. For a window, if the sheet doesn't reach the other corner, cut two pieces and hang them separately. Take care to match the pattern with the adjoining sheet.

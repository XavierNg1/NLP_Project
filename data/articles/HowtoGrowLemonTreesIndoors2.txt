 Place a few pebbles or gravel on the saucer and add a little water before placing the container onto the saucer and the pebbles. The water-filled saucer will help maintain a trace amount of humidity around your tree.
 This cloth will prevent soil from draining out of the container's drainage holes when you water.
 The gravel will promote better drainage, preventing the roots of your tree from drowning or rotting.
 Pack the soil in so that it will create a sturdy base for your tree to stand in.
 Rub its roots slightly to help them spread out before placing the tree into the pot.


If you purchased a bare root tree, create a mound of soil and place the tree into the pot with its roots spread over the mound.
 Press the soil down firmly to remove excess air, creating a denser, sturdier set-up to support the tree. Do not allow any roots to remain exposed, and do not cover the trunk. The trunk will begin to rot if kept covered.
 Give your tree enough water so that excess drains out into the saucer. Empty the saucer once the soil finishes draining.

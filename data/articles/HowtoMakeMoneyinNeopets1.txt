 Deposit neopoints in the National Neopian bank as often as you can. Saving up your money will help you accumulate more of it. If you find something you really need to spend neopoints on, it will be worth the extra work to get them out of the bank; otherwise, let them stay.;
, Promise yourself that you will deposit a certain amount of np every day, no matter what. Start small and increase as time goes on.
 Your neopoints will earn interest in the bank. Collect it at the beginning of every day before you do any deposits or withdrawals.
 If you have a hard time saving your neopoints because you always withdraw them, put a limit on yourself. Withdraw 1np, individually, 15 times. The bank will deny further withdrawals, though you can continue to deposit neopoints. If you need np for a quest, go earn it from a game.
 Put your more expensive items in your Safety Deposit Box to keep them safe from thieves like the Pant Devil.

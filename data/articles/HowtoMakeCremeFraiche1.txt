 If you prefer, you can use yogurt instead of heavy cream but the results will be a bit runnier than traditional Crème fraiche., Put the lid on the jar and shake well for fifteen to twenty seconds.
 The cream needs to sit for 24 hours in order to form. Stir one to two times during this waiting period.
 It should be quite thick now, peaking with the spoon. Refrigerate for six hours before serving.
 The Crème fraiche is good for 7-10 days before needing to be discarded. Keep refrigerated in a sealed container.

 This tile opens up all of your contacts stored on your phone and SIM card.
 You can find the all tab by scrolling to the left on your screen.
 Choose any contact that you want to change a ringtone for. Tap on their name, and a contact card will open.
 At the bottom of the open contact card, there will be three icons. On the right is a pencil icon, which allows you to edit information about your contact. You can also add pictures, notes, and change the ringtone.
 A new menu that says “Choose item” will appear.
 You can choose between factory set ringtones or any custom ones you have created.
 Once you've selected a new ringtone, tap the floppy disk icon at the bottom of your phone to save, and you're done!

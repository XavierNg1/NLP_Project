 Using the hand that is on the same side as the eyelid you wish to flip inside-out, make a peace sign using your middle and forefinger. A "peace sign" is when you hold up only your middle and forefinger and spread them apart like a pair of scissors., Place your forefinger above your eye and your middle finger below. Your forefinger should get under your upper eyelashes and then press and hold them above your eye, somewhere between the top of your eye and your eyebrow. Your middle finger should rest at the bottom of your eye., Now, with your middle finger, gently push down into your eye and lift up. The lifting motion should lift your lower eyelid up with your finger while gently pushing your eyeball back. Your upper eyelid should flip inside-out during this motion. This will probably take several attempts to get it right, so don't be frustrated., Follow the same steps you used for your other eyelid and other hand. If you're not ambidextrous, this may feel very awkward, but after a few tries you should begin to get the hang of it.
 After you are satisfied with your friends' freaked-out reactions, you'll probably want your eyelids back in normal, functioning order. Simply look up really hard with your eyes or blink really hard with your eyelids to return your eyelids to normal.

 When it comes to white pants, go with a thicker material like cotton or denim. Thin material, like linen, tends to show every little bump and crinkle. Transparency can also be an issue. Avoid pant pocket linings from showing through (or worse!) by opting for white pants made of thicker fabrics.If you find a pair you adore but they’re more see-through than you’d like, consider taking them to a tailor to have them lined.;
, White capris are a great summer look, but avoid the ones with large cuffs, big side pockets, drawstrings and elastic waistbands. These can unfortunately make you look frumpy or create the illusion of extra weight. Avoid heavy cargo styles for the same reason., Skinny jeans aren’t for everyone, and a pair of wide-legged white pants can look fabulous! Choose a flowy material to create a summery, casual vibe perfect for a beach party. Wear a white button-down in a similar fabric to complete this look., If you’re on the slim side, a loose-fitting pair of trouser cut pants can create the illusion of curves without swallowing up your small frame.

Add a bright-colored blazer to complete the look., Patterns can make white pants appear even less slimming, so try to avoid them. Look for plain white pants with a flat front and no additional detail around your problem areas. Avoid drawstring waists, pleats, large belt loops and big pockets; opt for sleek and minimal.

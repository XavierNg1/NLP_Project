 Let's start with present simple and present continuous:


Present simple is used for facts and habits. If you are describing something that is true or something that happens often, opt for the present simple.

I go to work every day.
She eats breakfast at 7.
China is a big country.


Present continuous is used for things that are happening right now. There are two verbs: a helper and a main verb. The helper is "am"/"is"/"are" (depending on the subject) and the main verb is any verb with -ing:

You are reading.
I am typing.
He is watching TV.
 Once you've mastered the present, get started on the past and future tenses. We're just going to go over the basic ones now:


Use the past simple for any event that happened in the past at a specific time.

I saw that movie last year.
She died on a plane.
We went to the bank yesterday.


For the future, let's keep it simple. Add a future time marker, and just use the present continuous! It can double as a future tense, too.

They are making a cake tomorrow.
You are leaving in May.
I am going at 6 pm.
 Always, always, always put the adjective (the word that describes) before the noun. Always! In fact, there's even an order within adjectives:


There are eight basic types of adjectives: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one, they go in that order. So, it's a "huge, round, metal bowl" or a "small, red sleeping bag."

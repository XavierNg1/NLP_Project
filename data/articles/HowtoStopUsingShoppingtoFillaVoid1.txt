 You can overcome compulsive shopping by recognizing what motivates you to act and working to stop the problem at its root. The most common type of shoppers are:


Compulsive shopaholics shop to assuage emotional problems.
Trophy shopaholics look for top items to add to their collections.
Some shopaholics seek the flashy appearance of material affluence through new things.
Bargain seekers are those who justify purchases based on sales and good deals.
Bulimic shoppers are those who get caught in a guilt cycle of buying and returning.
Collectors who feel they need every item in a particular set to complete a collection.;
, People tend to shop to relieve stress. You can help get to the root of issues by observing your stress level when you choose to shop. It can also help deconstruct that shopping does little to actually relief stress. After all, how stress-reducing is it to worry about whether or not your credit card will be refused, and how much it is mounting up? If you shop when you are stressed, you are more likely to make impulse decisions to stop the feeling.


Take notice of your triggers and emotions. Shopaholics tend to shop in response to certain emotional states, such as negative emotions, boredom, for a thrill, or to fill a void. Triggers, when recognized, can help stop destructive behaviors before they start.
 Shopaholics often use purchases to deal with self-esteem issues. These purchases can be clothing that makes you look better, or new things for the sake of keeping up on appearances. Write down how you feel after making a new purchase. Observe if you feel more confident, or other emotions that address self-esteem issues.


Materialism and competition in a consumer based society can exasperate these issues. Shopping is seen as a more acceptable behavior than other addictions like drugs or alcohol. Avoid using your possessions as a measure of success or to compare to others.

 Curl your fingers around the body of the Bic to keep it steady. Rest the edge of your thumb on the red button so that it is touching the serrated metal sparkwheel. Find a grip that feels comfortable. You may need to experiment with your thumb at several angles before you get it right.This red button is the ignition button that releases the gas from the lighter chamber.
Grip the lighter at least half an inch below the metal portion. The metal gets really hot and you're also more likely to get burned the closer you are to it.;
, Use your thumb. Apply some force to the wheel, as you push it downward, to ensure that you create a spark. Turn the sparkwheel in one quick, decisive motion. If you do it right, a flame come out from the top of the lighter.


You won't see the spark. The spark is generated inside the metal housing of the lighter.
 After you roll the sparkwheel, your thumbnail should rest firmly on the button. As long as you hold this tab, you are releasing a steady stream of gas from the inner chamber of the lighter. The gas feeds the flame and keeps it burning evenly. As soon as you release the button, the flame will cease.


Don't keep the lighter lit for more than 30 seconds. Let off the gas right after you light the object that you're trying to light. The top of the lighter will get hot rather quickly, which can be dangerous.
To get maximum life from your lighter, avoid burning it for any longer than necessary. Most lighters come with plenty of flint to outlast the fuel in normal use, so it is better to relight it than to keep it burning between tasks: e.g. lighting a great many candles. It's unlikely that the flint will run out before the fuel does. When it does run out of gas, you're out of luck.

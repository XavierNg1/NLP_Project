 When making scary movies a lot of make-up and costumes are used, which means the outcome of the movie might be scary but it's fake.;
, Imagine the filming on the set, the actors laughing, the producers and director taking a quick snack and when you think of it that way the movie will be less frightening. Imagine one of the actors reading a script or getting their makeup done.
 It'll help you get your mind off of the movie when you're thinking of something really funny or silly.
 Is an actor in a period film wearing a modern watch? Look for things like that to take your mind off the scariness.
 If you're watching it in a movie theater, grip your seat tightly.
 We watch scary movies for the thrill, but afterwards, it's a nightmare. If you know that you are easily scared, just don't watch it.

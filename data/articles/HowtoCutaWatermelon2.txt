 You can turn your watermelon into rounds by carefully cutting through the watermelon, crosswise, at 1 in (2.5 cm) intervals.
 Carefully slide your knife along the outside of the flesh to cut off the rind. You may also want to remove any seeds at this point.
 You can either slice the rounds into sticks or triangles, or even use a cookie cutter to cut out fun shapes, like stars.

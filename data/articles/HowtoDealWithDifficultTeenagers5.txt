 Changes in the brain during adolescence can result in an increase in risk-taking and propensity toward experimentation with substance use (alcohol and other drugs).Specifically, adolescents are more drawn toward reinforcing stimuli â€“ such as substances. However, the teen might also be more likely to take healthy risks such as trying new activities (sports, games, hobbies, etc).


The adolescent may engage in more risk-taking behaviors.This can sometimes include dangerous situations such as fast-driving, and breaking other rules or laws. Be aware of these warning signs and risky behaviors.
 The ability to control impulses is not yet fully developed in the adolescent brain.Understand that your teen may not yet be able to self-monitor or have delayed gratification.


Teach your child delayed gratification by helping him identify the pros and cons of engaging in a particular activity or behavior.
 Brain changes in the developing teenager can result in heightened emotional reactivity.This can result in teenagers experiencing more anger, sadness, loneliness, aggressiveness, and other negative emotions or behaviors.


Try to remember what it was like being a teenager, and identify a few feelings you had back then that were hard to cope with.
Instead of automatically reacting emotionally, attempt to empathize with the difficulty of the youth's situation.

 When feeding your puppy formula, you need to make sure that you buy the right kind of formula. Puppies have specific nutritional needs, so you need make sure the formula is specifically for puppies.You can get puppy formula from the vet or from a pet store.
There are dry or canned varieties. Either type is fine, but dry is more cost-efficient in the long run.;
, To feed your puppy, you should get a puppy nursing bottle. This holds a small amount of formula. You can purchase one of these bottles at a pet store.When you get the bottle, you will need to put a hole in the nipple. Use a flame-heated needed. Put two small holes in the point of the nipple.
Make sure the holes are only big enough to let a few drops of milk to come out. Holes that are too large can lead to the puppy getting formula in the lungs. Holes that are too small will lead to too much air.
 Toy or tiny breeds may be too small to feed from a bottle when they are first born. If this is the case, you should use an eyedropper. If the puppy can’t suckle yet, you can gently squeeze the formula into the side of the mouth.You can also use a syringe to squeeze the formula into the mouth.
Don’t squeeze the milk directly into the back of the puppy’s mouth. It could lead to choking.

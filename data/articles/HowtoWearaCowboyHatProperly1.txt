 The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.;
, You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back.


Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat.
There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.
 You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during dot days., Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You donâ€™t want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands.

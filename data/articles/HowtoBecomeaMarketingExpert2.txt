 Before you apply to marketing jobs, you will need to craft a resume that reflects your experience, education, and career goals. Make sure you tailor each resume you send out to the specific requirements of the job being advertised.
 You will need to create a cover letter to accompany your resume. The cover letter should speak to your qualifications and experience, and link both to the job to which you are applying. Do not send out a generic cover letter, as this can give off the impression you are not prepared for or interested in the specific job being advertised.


For example, if the job is in content creation, you will want to give specific examples of your experience in content creation in the cover letter.
 When you are beginning your career, or deciding to make a career change, it is important to apply to multiple positions. Send out your application materials to a number of companies seeking candidates with your interests, skill sets, and experience.

You should also have a list of questions prepared for the potential employer. On the day of the interview, dress professionally and be yourself.

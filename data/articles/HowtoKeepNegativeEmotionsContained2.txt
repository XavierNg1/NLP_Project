 The first part of dealing with a negative emotion is to recognize it. Sweeping it under the rug or repeatedly brushing it off will prevent you from handling the emotion effectively. When you experience a negative emotion, take a piece of paper and write it down or say it aloud. Try saying or writing, “I am angry.”If you have a hard time identifying the emotion you are having, try looking at a list of different emotions to help you figure out what you are experiencing.
 Negative emotions often affect our behavior and thought processes in negative ways. Think deeply about your behavior and how the negative emotion is affecting it. For example, you might yell at your child because you are feeling anger toward your boss.


Sit down with a piece of paper and pencil. Make a list of all the ways the negative emotions you are experiencing affect your behavior, thought processes, and relationships with others.
 In order to effectively manage negative emotions, you must be mindful of what is causing you to feel a particular way. Identifying the root of the emotion is key to processing it and moving forward. Don’t blame someone else or yourself for the emotion. Just acknowledge the cause or causes of why you’re feeling a particular way.Keep in mind that it is okay to guess at one cause or multiple causes when you are having an emotion. Practice attributing your emotions and it will become easier to identify the causes over time.

 The conjunctiva is the light pink membrane that covers the whites of your bird’s eyes. When they have conjunctivitis, this membrane gets inflamed. Look for red or irritated areas around the bird’s eyes., Birds that have conjunctivitis may also produce a clear or cloudy discharge from their eye. This causes a crusty, thick build up around the area. It may crush along the swollen membrane, or get inside the bird’s eyes., Another symptom that may occur with conjunctivitis is problems with the eyelid. The lower eyelid may droop or hang down slightly. The bird may also have a prolapsed third eyelid, where you can see the reddish membrane., Birds with conjunctivitis may start to preen more than they used to. You may notice that the feathers around the eyes are wet, or that the feathers on the wing or leg are wet and matted due to increased rubbing., Some birds may rub the eye repeatedly against their cage or try to scratch the eye with their foot or wing. They may even rub the infected eye with the ball of the foot.

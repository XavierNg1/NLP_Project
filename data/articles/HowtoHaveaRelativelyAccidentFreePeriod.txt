 When your period starts make sure you have some in your purse. Always have some handy!;
,, Choose the tampon or pad that suits your flow best: i.e. light, moderate, heavy, overnight.
 Every few hours should be plenty to help you feel fresh and eliminate odors.
 These are made of rubber or medical grade silicone. They fit inside where you'd insert a tampon and, if inserted correctly, cannot be felt. They are able to be disinfected and reused! They're also much more reliable than either pads or tampons, because once you get used to inserting the cup (just as you had to get used to inserting tampons), it can be worn for 8-12 hours without any worries of odor or bacteria cultivation. A couple of brands are available online and at some stores. You can wear panty liners until you're confident that you've learned to insert the cup correctly so no leaks occur. The upfront cost for a menstrual cup is greater (around $30), but you save much more money over the long term, and never have to worry about running out of pads or tampons! Minimize leak paranoia, trips to the bathroom to "check on things," environmental waste, inconvenience, and wasted money by getting a menstrual cup!

, Even if you don't have to go or change, it's good to check if you've leaked. Better safe than sorry!

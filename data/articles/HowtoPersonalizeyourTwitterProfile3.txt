 In the dropdown menu, select the option that contains your name and View profile.
 From there you can click Edit profile on the right side of the page.
 A dropdown menu will give you three options. You may upload a photo from your computer, take a picture with your webcam (if available) or just remove the current profile picture.
 The location you enter will be displayed on your Twitter profile for other users to see. If you do not want to share your location, you can leave this field blank.
 This will allow other Twitter users to visit your blog, website, or other social networking account, such as Facebook. The website field is optional, and can be left blank if you do not want to share links with other Twitter users.
 You can enter any information you want to share with other users, and must be no more than 160 characters in length. For example, if your favorite hobby is working on and fixing up classic cars, mention this in your biography.
 Your profile picture and all other information will now be displayed on your Twitter profile.

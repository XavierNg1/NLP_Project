 Arthritis pain can make life hard for your dog. If your dog looks to be in pain (stiff body posture, grouchiness), take them to your vet for medical treatment.The vet will recommend medications to relieve the pain and reduce joint inflammation.


Medications called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for dogs with arthritis.Steroids also relieve pain and reduce inflammation; however, they can have serious long-term side effects.Do not give your dog any pain-relieving medications without first talking to your vet. Over-the-counter or human pain relievers can do more harm than good in dogs., Some supplements, such as glucosamine plus chondroitin and omega-3 fatty acids, can relieve inflammation and help promote joint repair.With less inflammation and healthier joints, your dog will be able to move around better and have an improved quality of life.


Purchase these supplements through your vet.
 When your vet prescribes the treatments, make sure you follow the prescription instructions. Following the instructions will ensure your dog’s pain is reduced. When your dog is in less pain, their quality of life will improve.


Many pain medications and supplements for dogs are administered by mouth. Pill pockets, which are available at your local pet store, can help you give your dog their pills without much fuss.
Some pain medications are given by injection.If your vet recommends an injectable medication, they will usually do the injections.
If you have any questions about how to administer the treatments, ask your vet.
 Pain medications can have side effects that can make your dog sick. If you notice your dog isn’t tolerating the medication very well, contact your vet. Look for the following signs that your dog’s medication is making them sick:Decreased appetite
Diarrhea
Dark and tarry feces, which indicates intestinal bleeding

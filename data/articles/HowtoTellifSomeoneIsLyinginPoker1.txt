 The common advice is to look someone in the eye to see if they are lying. This is not a tested strategy, however. Skilled players have no problems looking someone in the eye while bluffing.A new or unskilled player might glance away or dilate their pupils some when bluffing, but these are often stress responses. When a player learns to control the stress that comes with bluffing, these signals become easy to control.;
, When a player is trying to bluff you, their natural instinct is to try to look intimidating to encourage you to fold your hand away. Intimidation tactics may include slamming down chips, talking loud, and staring you down.


Staring at you directly in the eyes is often an indicator of a bluff. While there are a number of reasons another play may look you directly in the eyes, someone holding eye contact is often trying to keep focus on them and intimidate you., Stress causes our shoulders to tense up. If you are observant, you may be able to see some of your opponents slightly crunch their shoulders upward and inward. If you see this, it usually means your opponent is scared or has a weak hand.One the other hand, when your opponent drops their shoulders, it usually means they missed their hand. An opponent in this situation will likely not bluff and is no longer a threat to you during that hand.
 When an opponent starts breathing heavily in a deep up and down motion, that is a good sign that something is deeply stressing them out. If your opponent has just made a huge bet and their breathing becomes deeper, chances are they are bluffing.Hyperventilation may also indicate a stressful situation. Shallow breaths and frequent inhalation may indicate that your opponent does not know what to do next or is nervous during a hand.

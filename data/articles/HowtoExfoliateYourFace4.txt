 Make exfoliating your face part of a relaxing spa day. Spas offer many dermatological services during facials from exfoliation to deep cleansing treatments. Every once in a while enjoy a relaxing day of pampering. While you’re there, treat yourself to a massage, too!








, Also referred to as mechanical exfoliation or micro resurfacing, microdermabrasion uses a mechanical suction tube with an exfoliating tip to get rid of dead or dry layers of skin.It cleans out pores and rejuvenates skin, though the process does need to be repeated every few weeks to maintain the positive effects.


While it can be relatively expensive, microdermabrasion is non-invasive and performed in-office by a dermatologist.
A common treatment routine would be every 2-3 weeks with at least 6-10 treatments to achieve lasting results.
Don’t do microdermabrasion if you scar easily or have used the medicine isotretinoin within the past 6 months.If you are on any type of acne medication, ask your dermatologist before getting any microdermabrasion treatments.
 If you do not have dry or sensitive skin, you may be a candidate for getting a chemical peel from a dermatologist every 4-6 weeks. Chemical peel solutions contain high concentrations of salicylic acid and retinoic acid that help to speed cell regeneration. Your skin will peel for a few days after a chemical peel and then it will begin to heal itself and generate fresh, smooth skin.


These treatments usually can cost between $150 for a light peel and $6000 for a deep peel.
Chemical peels can be done at light, medium or deep levels depending on your desired results. Deeper peels take longer to heal.Redness typically occurs after a chemical peel. Other less common risks include scarring, changes in skin color, and infection. Deep peels have a risk for damage to your heart or liver because of a chemical used.Talk to your doctor about your health history and whether you should have a chemical peel. They’re not a good idea for everyone.

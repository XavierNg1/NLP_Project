 Java.com has a test program that will confirm your Java installation. You can run it here. The page will automatically detect which browser you are using.
 Internet Explorer will most likely prompt you with one or two security checks, either at the top of the browser or in a pop-up window. Confirm these in order to run the Java applet.
 If you have Java installed correctly, a green check mark will appear, along with the message “Your Java is working.” Your version will be listed in the gray box.

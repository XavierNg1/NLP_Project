 Stay at home moms, especially ones with new babies, can feel overwhelmed at the thought of running the entire household. You may be exhausted from taking care of an infant who doesn’t sleep at night, for example. Keeping up with kids’ demands all day can make it hard to get things done. Strive to get the basics done.Get the kids up, dressed and fed. Get yourself showered, dressed and fed. These two things will help you on your way to feeling more on top of it.
 Depending on your child’s age, it can be very helpful to have consistent schedules. You know that your daughter wakes up every morning around 6:30 a.m. You know she takes a nap at 10:00 a.m. You know she needs lunch when she wakes up at noon. You may need to pick up your older son from school at 2:45 p.m. Plan a schedule for your kids.


Keep the schedule flexible, so you can accommodate unplanned activities.
As your kids get a little older, adjust the schedule in a way that makes sense for their ages and interests.
 It may be helpful to choose one day of the week to be laundry day, another day for grocery shopping, another for baking. While your family may generate a ton of laundry, saving it for Tuesdays will keep you from feeling like you’re constantly doing laundry.Enlist your kids to help you with chores. Preschoolers can help sort laundry, kindergarteners can help unload the dishwasher, and older kids can make dinner once in a while.
 Make a meal menu for the week. This will help you in knowing what to buy at the grocery store. You can also plan meals around leftovers. For example, you can roast a chicken one night and use the bones for a chicken soup the next night.

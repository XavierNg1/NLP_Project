 If you have a trashcan in your room, don't throw the wrappers away in that. If someone sees candy wrappers in your trashcan, they will suspect that you are hiding candy in your room. Instead, throw the candy away in the kitchen trash.


If you want to be extra-stealthy, throw the wrappers away at school.
 If you brag about hiding candy in your room, someone may go looking for it. If you have any siblings, it might be a good idea to keep your candy stash secret from them. If they get mad at you, they may tell on you. They may also get careless, and accidentally give your secret away.
 Don't get nervous, especially if someone is close to one of your hiding spots. For example, if someone opens the sock drawer where you hid your candy, don't scream "Don't open that!" or "Don't look in there!" This will tell the other person that you are hiding something, and they will get suspicious and look through your sock drawer.
 People tend to look where other people are looking. If someone is with you in your room, and you keep looking at your secret stash, the other person may get curious. They may even try to look wherever you are looking and find your candy.
 For example, if someone does your laundry for you, don't hide your candy in your dresser, wardrobe, or closet. Another example would be a toy bin or a bookshelf that both you and a sibling use.
 The longer something sits in one place, the more likely someone will find it sooner or later. If you plan on hiding the candy in your room, plan on changing the hiding places at least once a week. If there are lots of people going through your room, you might even want to change the hiding places every day.

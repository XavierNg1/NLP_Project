 Tie string between the stakes to serve as guides for digging.;
, You should dig down below the frost line, which is usually about 1 foot (or 30 cm) down. If building a retaining wall on a slope, make sure the bottom of your hole is flat.
 These pieces will make a form to stretch around the whole area of your wall.
 These will serve to spread out the concrete to prevent cracking.
 Make sure it lies level. Secure it the ground with stakes or other weights. It should be secure enough to remain solid when stood upon. Concrete is brittle, like toast. ideally wire a mesh to give flexible strength.
 The type and quantity of concrete mix will depend on the size and nature of your wall.



Keep a fresh batch of concrete mix ready as you go along. Pour concrete as quickly and evenly as you can so that no part of the wall dries much before any other.
If you will be topping your wall with concrete, brush the top surface to create a nice texture. If you will be adding stone or another surface to the top, do so while the concrete mix is still wet.

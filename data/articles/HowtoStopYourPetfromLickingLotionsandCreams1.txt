 An Elizabethan collar is a cone-shaped collar that fits around your pet's neck. Elizabethan collars are designed to impede and prevent your pet from licking themselves, messing with stitches, or other similar activities.


Consult your vet before using an Elizabethan collar.
Make sure the collar is a proper size for your vet.
Secure it snugly, but not too tight.
Apply the cream or lotion.
Monitor your pet to make sure they’re not hurt by the collar and that it works.;
, The best way to prevent your pet from licking lotion or cream off themselves is to cover the area of skin with a bandage. Make sure to:


Apply the cream or lotion to your pet.
Wrap the area with a bandage or some other fabric.
Consider applying extra lotion or cream since the fabric might absorb some.
If your pet needs to have lotion or cream applied regularly, you should change the bandage often. Using the same bandage for more than a day might promote the growth of bacteria or worsen an already bad infection., You should also consider applying lotion or cream to your pet when they’re too tired to lick it. While this won’t always work, it is a good way of preventing your pet from licking themselves. Consider:


Applying lotion or cream shortly after your pet has settled into sleep for the night or even for a nap.
Make sure everyone around the house or around your pet has also settled in and are not doing anything to awake or distract them.
Under the advice of a veterinarian, you may also consider applying lotion or a cream in conjunction with a medication that may make your pet sleepy. This will most likely be the case if the pet has had some sort of severe injury and is recovering from surgery or something similar.

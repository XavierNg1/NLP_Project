 The most common coyote trap is a jaw trap. In order to make a trap set, purchase a no. 3 coil spring trap. This will be the appropriate size to trap a coyote. You can purchase a trap at your local hunting store.
 When setting a trap, you need to dig a trap bed. The trap bed should be large enough so that it can fit the trap when opened and laying flat. It should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep so that it can be covered with dirt and hidden., Set the trap and then place dirt over top of the trap. Pour the dirt through a sifter so that it gently sprinkles over the trap. Try and make the area look as natural as possible. You can also lay larger sticks or mounds of grass and dirt along the sides of the trap. These can be used as guides to make sure the coyote steps on the trap.When placing guides, be sure to make it look as natural as possible. Do not put the sticks in a straight line. They need to look like they fell there naturally.
 Once the trap is covered by dirt, dig a hole about 8-10 inches away from the trap bed. The opening of the hole should be facing towards the trap bed and the hole should be two inches in diameter and dug on a 45 degree angle.The hole is supposed to look like it was dug by a small rodent, such as a mouse or mole and the small dirt pile that is covering the trap will look like the dirt that was removed from digging the hole.

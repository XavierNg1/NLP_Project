 If your recipe calls for a tablespoon of fresh oregano or any other herb, you can substitute it with a teaspoon of the dried herb.Dried herbs have a more concentrated flavor, so remember to use less of them than the recipe calls for fresh herbs.Fresh herbs are often used to give the dish a lively and fresh flavor, so be aware that using an herb substitution will make the dish taste different. The flavors will be more concentrated but you wonâ€™t get the liveliness offered by fresh herbs.;
, Remember that dried sage has a more concentrated flavor, so you should use a third of the fresh sage that the recipe asks for.
 Rosemary is often used in baking, sauces, and on meats in Mediterranean dishes. If you run out of fresh rosemary, you can always use the dried variety.Remember to only use a third of the amount of fresh rosemary called for in the recipe.
 Mint is a wonderful addition to savory dishes and is used in many desserts as well as drinks like tea or a mojito. If your recipe calls for a tablespoon of chopped fresh mint, add a teaspoon of the dried variety in its place.
 Dried cilantro does not work well if the dish is calling for a cilantro garnish but should work fine if the cilantro is integrated into the main dish.

 Do you want to raise them for eggs, meat, breeding or just as a simple pet? Quails need a diet depending on their purpose as you'll need to choose a feed that suits them. The four main different types of feeds are:


Starter
Developer
Layer
Finisher

, The finisher feed will help sustain the quail, until they reach the certain age to be killed at. The finisher feed is higher in fiber than other feeds.


Start the quail off with a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a finisher mix after 6 weeks of age. Continue feeding the finisher diet until the time comes to sell or slaughter the quail.
 This diet is also suitable for quail being kept simply as pets. The developer feed differs from the finisher in that it contains more protein.


Start the quail on a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a developer mix after 6 weeks of age. Continue until 16 weeks of age.
 Quail being used for breeding and laying eggs need a special feed when the time comes for them to lay eggs. If they are not given the proper feed, their eggs may turn out too weak or fragile.


Feed most quail breeds a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a developer mix after 6 weeks of age. Continue until 20 weeks of age. Finish off with a layer mix at 20 weeks and older.
Feed Coturnix (Pharaoh) quail a starter mix from shortly after hatching until 6 weeks of age. Transition to a layer mix after 6 weeks of age. There is no need for a developer mix.

Start by cleansing your mind and body with some slow deep breaths. Visualize the air removing all your thoughts and all the negative energy from your body, as you breathe out. Just relax and allow yourself to let go.
 Tighten the muscles in your feet for a couple of seconds and then let go, releasing all the tension. Feel how relaxed they become.
Now focus on your legs and thighs. Tighten the muscles in your legs just as you did with your feet. Hold it for a couple of seconds and then let go. Notice how heavy they feel. They sink deeper in to the soft bed beneath you.
 Clench your hands and then let go. Take a moment to notice the difference.
Now, tighten the muscles in your arms as much as you can. Hold it and then release the tension, making your arms fall deep into your bed.
 Hold it for a couple of seconds and then let go. Feel how heavy your body is. It makes you feel tired.



Last step is your shoulders. So loosely tighten the muscles in your shoulders. You donâ€™t want to tightened them too much, as this can create headache and maybe even more tension. When you let go, let your shoulders drop and then take a moment to observe your entire body. It will feel like your body has sunk deep into the bed and you feel much more relaxed and drowsy.

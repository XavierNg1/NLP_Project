 In warmer climates, you may need only 30 to 35 BTU per hour per square foot to heat your house adequately. In colder climates, you may need up to 50 to 60 BTU/h/ft2. In general, the further from the equator you live, the greater the number of BTU/h/ft2 you need, but weather patterns and geography modify this somewhat. A map of climate zones for the United States and Canada can be found at http://www.acdirect.com/systemsize.php.


Many product labels abbreviate "BTU per hour" (BTU/h) as "BTU." You do not need to do any calculations to turn this into BTU/h.
 Newer homes tend to be better insulated than older homes because of revisions to building codes over the years. Better insulated homes need fewer BTUs per hour per square foot than older homes. If your home is new or well insulated, you can use the lower of the two numbers for your climate zone; if it is older or poorly insulated, use the higher number of the range.
 If you live in a 2,500 square foot home and a climate zone with a heating factor of 40 BTUs per square foot, you need a furnace with an output of 100,000 BTUs per hour.
 Furnaces are rated not by the actual BTU output you receive but by the amount of heat they generate. How much of the heat a furnace generates (input heat) that actually reaches you (output heat) is a measure of how efficient the furnace is. The efficiency is expressed in percentage as a ratio of the output to input heat. Most modern furnaces are rated as either 80 or 90 percent efficient.


In the example above, a 100,000 BTU/h input furnace would not be enough to heat a home needing an output of 100,000 BTUs per hour. An 80% efficient furnace would deliver an output of only 80,000 BTU/h (100,000 x 0.8). To find an 80% efficient furnace that does provide enough power, divide the goal by 0.8. In our example, 100,000 BTU/h รท 0.8 = 125,000 BTU/h, so you'd need a furnace rated to 125,000 BTU/h input.

 After you've already covered your cake with a layer of frosting, use a squeeze tube of icing to add a design or text.


To change the color of your icing, add food coloring and stir well. Add more food coloring until you get your desired shade.
 Use a stencil or free-hand to sprinkle chocolate chips, non-pareils, or sprinkles in a heart-shape on top of your cake.


A heart-shaped cookie cutter is also a useful guide for outlining heart decorations.
 You can either pipe decorative flowers with frosting or use real flowers for a natural touch.
 Take nice satin ribbon and run it along the bottom edges of the cake. This will create a finished look, especially if it's for a special occasion. Be sure to remove the ribbon before cutting the cake.
 Berries can add a pop of color and a little extra sweetness. Place whole berries on the cake, or slice larger berries and lay them decoratively.
 Take a piece of parchment paper and cut out a heart. Place the heart on top of your cake and sprinkle powdered sugar or cocoa completely over the stencil. Remove the stencil to reveal the heart shape.

 Picking and focusing on one favourite class will allow you to master all of the class's aspects and different weapons. With this approach, you can gain a certain understanding of their respective abilities, finding something that suits your gaming style, rather than bouncing around from class to class. The available classes are:


Light Assault
Heavy Assault
Combat Medic
Infiltrator
Engineer
MAX;
, How you play will depend a great deal on your environment:


When in the open, play using RPGs, tanks , aircraft and sniper rifles (long range weapons ).
In close quarters, light assaults can be used to flank enemies. Heavy assaults with their over-shields activated are guaranteed to win most one-on-one battles.
You can use engineers to place turrets at key locations, like a door, to get a huge number of kills (provided someone watches your back).
 Having teammates in all different classes will benefit everyone.


Medics can revive and heal you.
Engineers can resupply your ammo.
Infiltrators can keep you safe from a distance.
Light assaults can cover your flanks and provide suppressing fire.
 Using vehicles can be extremely profitable and you should learn how to make good use of them. A perfect place for you to do that is the VR map, where you can test all weapons .
 This will help you re-acquire the feel of the game before you launch yourself into a 300 men battle., Most people set their sensitivity too high resulting in a lack of aiming. A good default would be that a 360 turn takes about 20-30cm movement of your mouse.

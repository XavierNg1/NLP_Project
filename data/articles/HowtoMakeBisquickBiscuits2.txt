Mix the ingredients loosely in a large bowl â€” you're looking for a roughly uniform mixture, but it's not necessary to spend lots of time mixing here.



To get an even mixture without having to combine the ingredients too thoroughly, first make a "well" in the middle of the bowl by pushing the dry ingredients to the sides.
Pour the milk into the "well." Fold the dry ingredients into the well several times to mix well.



As mentioned above, it's a good idea to avoid stirring more than necessary to preserve the light, fluffy texture of the biscuits.



Unlike the biscuits above, here, we're going for a slightly crispier, denser product. Instead of rolling the dough thin, use a spoon to grab balls of dough and drop them onto the sheet a few inches apart from each other.
Though the balls of the dough can vary slightly in size, you're aiming for each ball to use about a tablespoon of dough for each.

To save time, combine these ingredients while the biscuits are baking.



Take the biscuits out of the oven when done and transfer to cooling rack. Before eating, use a brush or paper towel to give each a thin coat of the butter/garlic mixture.
Sprinkle biscuits with parsley flakes before serving.

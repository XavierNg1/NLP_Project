 Many people, and especially women, have personal names in their passwords. Most people wouldn't put their own names in a password, but you could try those anyway. Here are some other names to try when you're guessing a password:


The name of the person's significant other or spouse
The names of the person's siblings
The name of the person's current or favorite pet
The name of the person's (especially a male's) favorite athlete
The person's childhood nickname or current nickname

, You can also guess a password by thinking of the person's hobbies or interests. Here are some tricks to try:


Try combining a man's favorite athlete with his favorite sport. For example: "Tigergolf" or "Kobebball."
Guess the name of a woman's favorite TV show, or the name of a favorite character on that show.
Guess the name of a person's favorite athletic hobby. If the person loves to swim, try "Swimmer" with some numbers after it.
 Many people use numbers in their password, indicating a date or a lucky number. Some people even make their whole password consist of numbers. You can try these numbers on their own, or add them to the end of one of the words that you guessed. Here are some ways to guess a person's password based on numbers:


Guess the person's birthday. For example, if the person's birthday is 12/18/75, type in "121875" or "12181975."
Try the person's street address. The person's street address, such as 955, could be a part of the password.
Try the person's lucky number. If the person has been vocal about what his lucky number is, try it.
If the person played a sport, try his jersey number as part of the password.
Try a part of the person's phone number.
Try the person's graduating class from college or high school.
 You can also guess the person's password by guessing from a number of the person's favorite things. Here are a few favorite things to try:


The person's favorite TV show.
The person's favorite movie.
The person's favorite food.
The person's favorite book.

 It's best to do so when the car is stopped on a level surface, with the engine cold.;
, On most cars with hydraulic clutches, the clutch fluid reservoir is located near the brake master cylinder at the back of the engine bay but is smaller than the brake fluid reservoir. If in doubt as to where to look, consult with your car's owner's manual.
 The reservoir should either be filled to the top, or filled to between the minimum and maximum lines shown on the reservoir, depending on the car in question. On most newer cars, the reservoir will be made of translucent plastic, while older cars may have metal reservoirs, requiring you to remove the reservoir cap before you can see the fluid level.
 Pour the fluid carefully into the reservoir, wiping up any spills.


Hydraulic clutches use the same type of fluid as hydraulic brake systems. Use the fluid with the DOT specification recommended in your car's owner's manual.
 Be sure the gasket on the cap seats correctly.

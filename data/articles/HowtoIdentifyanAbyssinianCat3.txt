 Abyssinians have been extensively bred in Europe since the nineteenth century and in the United States since the 1930s, and ample documentation on the Aby’s breeding heritage should be made available by any responsible breeder. If your heart is set on acquiring a show-quality, purebred Aby, do your homework, visit potential breeders, and study the documentation provided.A good breeder typically makes Abys available at around twelve to sixteen weeks of age, as separating the kitten from its mother earlier may lead to health risks and behavioral issues.
 If you have no documentation of a cat’s breeding heritage, but suspect that it’s an Aby based upon appearance and personality, genetic testing can provide further evidence. A fifteen-second cheek swab can provide you with a wealth of information regarding the genetic heritage of your cat.As with DNA testing for humans and dogs, there are a growing number of options when it comes to finding a laboratory that does genetic testing for cats. Typical tests require you to take a mouth swab from your cat using a provided kit that you mail back to the lab.
 While Abys are generally healthy cats, they do have a somewhat greater risk for certain illnesses and conditions. If your cat has one or more of the following conditions, it may be more likely (but certainly not guaranteed) that it’s an Abyssinian:Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) — an inherited anemia that can be identified through genetic testing
Hyperthyroidism
Retinal atrophy (i.e., eye problems)
Kidney failure

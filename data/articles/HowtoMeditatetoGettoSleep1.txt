 In guided meditation, you listen to an audio track of a person reading meditation instructions to you, and simply follow along with your thoughts. This is an excellent introduction to meditation for those who have never done it before and don't know where to start.;
, There are many free guided meditations for sleep available on the internet as downloadable audio files, podcasts, and YouTube videos. You can also purchase sleep meditation CDs at any major bookstore, or online.


Look for a guided meditation CD or file that has good reviews, or comes from a reputable source, such as MIT Medical, which provides a number of audio file downloads designed to help you fall asleep. If you download a free file, it is a good idea to listen to it once before bedtime to make sure the file is intact and doesn't include any hidden surprises, like advertisements at the end.
 Get ready to sleep, and set up the device you will be using to play the guided meditation next to your bed. Adjust the volume settings beforehand.


Be sure to set the device's sleep mode or power saver settings so that the device will turn itself off after the recording has finished.
It is not advisable to use headphones for a guided sleep meditation, since ideally you will fall asleep before the recording is over, and you don't want to get tangled up in the cords in the night.
 Put on your pajamas, darken the room, and get comfy in bed before you hit play. Then relax and listen, and prepare for a night of restful sleep! If you don't fall asleep after the first play-through, take a few deep breaths and begin again.

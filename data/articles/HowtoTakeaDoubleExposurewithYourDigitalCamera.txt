, While the whole process is somewhat serendipitous, you can have some control over the result with careful planning.
 You want the majority of the scene to be blown out and your subject silhouetted.
 This photo will be filling in the silhouette for the most part. Maybe, photograph a fire, flowers, etc. Whatever triggers your 'muse'.
 Quite a few cameras will do that, or there could be a hack for you to do it.

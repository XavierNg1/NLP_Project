 If you happen to spot your ex being affectionate with someone else in public, this is pretty solid indicator that your ex is moving on. If your ex is comfortable enough to make public displays of affection, this shows that they may be in love with someone new.

PDA is more than just kissing. If you see you ex out with someone, try to notice their body language.
Are they touching one another? How close are they sitting?

, If you hear rumors that your ex is in love with someone else, take these rumors seriously. You may be tempted to ignore or disbelieve such murmurings, but just remember that rumors are often based on some measure of truth.If you suspect something, ask around.
Consider asking your ex's friends directly.
 If your ex tells you point blank that they are moving on, you should believe them. If they explain that they’ve fallen for someone else, you should try to accept this fact and move on yourself.
 If you are still Facebook friends with your ex, you may notice if they alter their relationship status. A status of “in a relationship” is a very clear message that they feel strongly about someone. Even a vague relationship status like “it’s complicated,” may mean that they have fallen in love with someone new.You might also keep an eye out for romantic-looking images on Facebook.
You may also watch out for flirty posts.
 Rather than pining away for your ex, and playing gumshoe to determine whether or not they are seeing someone, consider having a direct conversation with them. Figure out, honestly, whether or not the two of you have a future together, and if it seems like you do not, set your sights on moving on.

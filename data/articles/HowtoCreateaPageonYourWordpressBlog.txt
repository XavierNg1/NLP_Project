 You will need to go to your blog and log in as an admin.;
, Either one will take you to the same place.


With this screenshot, you can see the initial view that you will see when you first go to the page.
 This is a good place to let others know about you.
 On the sidebar, you will see under, 'Pages', 'Add New'. Click on that to add a new page.






This will bring you to a new edit box for creating your new page for your blog.
 You just fill in the various parts of it and say what you think needs to be said.
 That would be a page that would go under a parent page. Like if under 'About Me', there was 'My Hobbies', 'My Likes', etc., those would be the subpages.
 Once you have finished, click on Publish and it will be part of your site.

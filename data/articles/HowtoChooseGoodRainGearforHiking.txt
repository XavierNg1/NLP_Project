 Is it going to be warm or cold rain? Will there be snow also? Warm rain requires water protection without warmth. Cold rain and/or snow requires both water and heat protection.;
, Bring various layers to protect from rain and cold, but not plain cotton. For cold weather, begin with a thin thermal layer in a synthetic fabric or silk. Then add light wool or fleece, and top it with a heavy Gore-Tex or similar jacket with hood.
 Start with a light synthetic layer that will remove sweat from your skin, and add the lightest nylon shell for water protection. Pit zippers (under the arms) allow your body to breathe while working up a sweat in the rain.
 Especially for warm rain, a wide-brimmed hat may be enough with a light shell. Be sure the hat is a fast-drying fabric like nylon or water-resistant cotton. Even for cold rain, a hat on top of your hood may help to drip rain away from your face.
 These nylon pants work well over light shorts in warm rain, since you will sweat. For cold rain or snow, add them over the other layers as on top: wicking long underwear, fleece pants, and rain pants. Do not wear jeans as they dry slowly and get heavy.
 Hiking boots with a Gore-Tex layer and high tops (at the ankle or higher) are good for swollen streams, puddles, snow, and mud. Add two layers of socks, liners, and thicker woolen trekking socks. For warm rain, the boots are still critical, but you may wear a lighter hiking sock over liners.
 Carry one in your day pack and you can always use it if you are caught without anything else.

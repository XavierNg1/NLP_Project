 you think you said something stupid, I would rate that on my scale as a 2 or you cheated on your partner, I would scale that as a 8. This is all depending on the details of your situation.


If you have a regret under 5, it's probably not such a big deal and all you really need to do is think about it calmly. Remember, we all make mistakes and it's in our nature, if you just take a look around you will soon see there are plenty of people who mess up.
If it's something from 5 - 10, you have to calm down, sit with yourself and decide if it's something you can deal with or if you need some professional help.;
, You can learn from any situation and improve on them, but most importantly it shows you what you were like through the different stages of your life and how you've grown.


Just like tattoos, you got that memory of that phase in your life with you forever. You can always remove it but the scar will be there, so you might as well learn to appreciate that time, grow and learn from it. What else have you got to lose?

 If you don't live in Australia, you will obviously not find one of these beehives. Other places you may not be able to find them in: Central Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Southern Western Australia and Tasmania.
 If you see many of them heading in a similar direction, the hive may be in that direction. Do this in the late afternoon, when the sun is not in your eyes, or on a cloudy day, so you can see the black bodies against the grey., These bees are not fussy about tree species and will nest inside any type of tree with a suitable hollow, and they may even be found nesting in man-made boxes such as water meters!, Red or orange resin is a telltale sign of a beehive in a tree or other space.
 The stingless bee swarms are different to honey bee swarms. They do not happen when they are founding a new hive, but when they are fighting with another bee colony. If you see thousands of small black bees buzzing frantically, it is a good sign that there is a beehive nearby., The natural enemies of these bees, such as Bembix Wasps and Syrphid Flies may be seen around nests and are larger and more conspicuous than the bees themselves.

 Lucy wasn't named Queen Lucy the Valiant for nothing. Be willing to take risks and stand up for yourself.;
, In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, none of her siblings believe that she had found a magical land. But the professor convinces them to believe her because she has always told the truth in the past. So be really honest.
 Lucy is lovable, so you should be really kind. Also, in the movies, she is a peacekeeper between her siblings, so you should be too. Be really loving towards your family, and don"t start arguments. Also, when Eustace is a brat, she is still always nice to him, so treat others the way you want to be treated.
 Lucy has a special connection with Aslan, but the others don't believe her when she thinks she's seen him. Still, she knows she's right.
 Believe in the supernatural, magical creatures, and Narnia.
 You really have a lot of options for this, depending on whether your going for her description in the book of how she looks, or how she looks in the movies. Also, each movie has a different hairstyle. If your going for book looks, flowing golden hair is necessary. In the movies, though, she has brown hair. Either get it straight and at the chin, straight and just below the shoulder (she wears it half up half down or in braids), or medium-long and wavy with a headband or ribbon (in England) or in a side ponytail (on the Dawn Treader).
 Buy lots of hair ribbons, blouses, cardigans, vintage dresses, plaid skirts, khaki or chino pants, and low heals or ballet flats. Go pretty preppy, but don't wear oxford shirts or polos, because those aren't Lucy-like. Don't wear much makeup.
 Lucy is smart.
 Lucy offers to do things for other people.
 According to Eustace, Lucy reads lots of fanciful novels and fairy tales, and probably romance too.
 This is probably most important.

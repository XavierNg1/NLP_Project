 On the header toolbar, tap the square icon with an arrow pointing up. This will bring out the menu for sharing. A list of apps that can support the PowerPoint file will be displayed. Swipe through them and tap “Open in SlideShark.”

, SlideShark will be launched, and a message box will appear confirming that you want to open the file in SlideShark. Tap the “Upload” button to upload it to your SlideShark account.

For presentations, It is best that you hold your iOS device horizontally so that the presentation will properly appear in landscape.
 All the presentation files you have on SlideShark will be displayed. You can see them with their thumbnail previews for easier identification. The title, upload date, and number of slides for each of the files are also indicated. Swipe through your files and locate the presentation you uploaded.
 Once you find the file to present, tap it. It will be loaded in full screen.
 On any slide screen, swipe up to see all the slides in the presentation. You can then tap on any of the slides there to jump to it if you don’t want to go through the slides sequentially.
 To run the presentation in sequence, one slide after another, simply tap or swipe left on the current slide. Your presentation will advance to the next slide.
 If you want to go back to the previous slide, simply swipe right on the current slide. Your presentation will go back one slide.
 If you need to point on one area of the slide for better focus, you don’t need an external laser pointer anymore. Just tap and hold on the screen with a finger, and a red laser pointer will appear while your finger is on the screen. The red dot will follow your finger as you move across the slide.
 If you want to project your slides using a projector, swipe up on any slide to see a toolbar on the left side. Tap the projector screen icon, and select “Current Slide.” Your screen will be adjusted showing you the main slides being projected, the run time with timers, and all the slides in the presentation. Only the window with the current slide will be projected, so you can safely review your notes and future slides from your device.


You need to connect your iOS device to a projector via VGA/USB or HDMI adapter in order for this to work.
 When you reach the end of your presentation, you will get a blank screen after your last slide. Tap the screen once more to go back to your SlideShark files.

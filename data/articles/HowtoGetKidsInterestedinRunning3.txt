 Playing Frisbee with your kids is a great way to get them running without focusing only on running. Just make sure that you throw the Frisbee a little out of their reach so they must run to catch it. Return the favor by running to catch their return throws., If your kids can’t catch something as oddly-shaped as a Frisbee, try playing catch with a regular ball. As with Frisbee, make sure you’re throwing the ball slightly out of their reach so they have to run to catch it.


Playing catch has the added benefit of improving your kids’ hand-eye coordination.
 Taking kids on a run through the neighborhood can be boring for the kids, but playing a game like I-spy can keep them interested. Take turns giving one another hints about what you’re looking at and guessing what the object is., Red-light-green-light is another game that gets your kids running while improving other motor skills. It also works great with as few as 2 kids or as many as 15 to 20.Set the players at a starting line a fair distance from the boss of the round. This distance can vary depending on the age of the players - if your players are younger, you can start them a little closer. If they’re older, they can start further back.
The boss stands with their back to the players and calls “Green light!” which is the players’ cue that they should start running toward the boss. The boss calls “red light!” and spins around quickly. Anyone still moving when the boss turns around is out of the game.
Whoever touches the boss first wins and takes over as boss for the next round.

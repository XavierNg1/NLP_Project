 As soon as you begin your diet, try to recruit your closest friends and family members. By doing this from the beginning, you can turn potential saboteurs into supporters. Talk with friends and family and individually. Let them know how important your diet and weight loss is to you.For example, “I will be trying a new diet. It would mean the world to me if you were there to support me every step of the way. I know we get dessert every Friday after work, but we can take trips to the park instead.”

, You can always join a support group like Weight Watchers, or an online group, like Weight Loss Buddy or 3 Fat Chicks on a Diet. Support groups are great for finding and making new friends who have the same goals as you., Personal trainers and life coaches are great if you need one-on-one mentorship. A mentor will help you stick to your diet during the most challenging moments. Mentors can also provide encouragement and strategies to help you cope with diet saboteurs.Find a personal trainer at your local gym. Tell them your goals and how you envision them helping you achieve these goals.

Melee Weapons can defeat ranged weapons from up-close. With melee weapons, find cover when you run into a ranged weapon. Wait until the enemy gets closer for you to run and strike. If your enemy doesn't get closer, get farther by a little, then your enemy will get closer and so will you.
Ranged Weapons. If you run into a melee, shoot immediately. If a melee runs up to you, run backwards and shoot at the same time. Ranged weapons defeat melee by a distance.

There are 6 basic weapons in the game.


Your fists. No pros, you just run faster than any other weapon but sword.
Sword. Very mobile, very fast attack rate, very likely to strike, but weak damage. The secret to this weapon is to run at random directions while slashing your enemy while your enemy tells you to hold still, especially when fighting a sledgehammer. Do not fight a bat. 8 hits to kill.
Bat. Normal mobile, normal attack rate, very likely to strike, good damage. Defeats sword. 4 hits to kill.
sledgehammer. Heavy mobile, slow attack, somewhat likely to strike, instant kill. Defeats any melee weapons if used accurately. 1 hit to kill.
Double-Barrel. Heavy mobile, slow attack, likely to strike, good damage, close ranged. Do not shoot at the glock from far distance. 3 shots to kill.
Automatic. Normal mobile, fast attack, somewhat likely to strike, normal damage, normal ranged. Defeats double-barrel from farther range. Do not fight glock from far ranged. About 6 shots to kill.
Glock. Light mobile, fast attack, unlikely to strike, normal damage, far ranged. Defeats all ranged weapons from far range. 5 shots to kill.

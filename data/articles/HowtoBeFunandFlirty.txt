 Don't be dull! Be energetic, outgoing, and happy! Talk to people you've never met, get in touch with old friends. Be random and spontaneous. Strike up a conversation with your crush. You should rarely ever have a dull moment in your life. You should really shine at parties. Make a scene if you're at a party and then, we get to the next step.;
, Wear cute make up and wear cute and bright clothes! This will make you stand out. Use contrasting colors like white and black, you'll really pop, then.
 You should be able to put on a show with your personality. Be bright and funny. Show your talents off to the world! Live your life like a rock star! Smile all the time as if the world was smiling with you.
 This is the most important! Be yourself when flirting, as well as when you're being fun. Nobody likes a person who is just a clone; especially when they only do it to impress someone.
 Use good, and not cheesy pick up lines. Be original, or you'll look like a fool. Flirt a lot, and be fun!

, This helps with being exciting and entertaining. Laugh a lot, tell jokes, and smile!

, When talking and you feel like an awkward moment is coming up, make an excuse to leave and tell them you'll text them. Then they will be waiting for your text and think about you.

 Using your regular shampoo and conditioner regimen, wash your hair as you normally would. Rinse your hair clean of shampoo and conditioner.


Choose a time when you will not be exercising or creating a lot of extra sweat in your hair, which can alter your results.
 Using a hair dryer might change the way your hair reacts in a certain amount of time, so using a towel and air to dry your hair is the best method.


Do not add any products to your hair, as this can alter your results.
 Give your head and hair time (about 8-12 hours) to produce oils, which you will then be able to check.
 In the morning, press a tissue to your scalp at the crown of your head. Do not rub the tissue around; just a gentle press against your scalp will suffice. Press it against your head behind your ears as well.Oily hair: If there is oil residue on the tissue, then you have oily hair.

Medium hair: If you see a trace of oil on the tissue, you have medium hair.

Dry hair: If there is nothing at all on the tissue, then you have dry hair.

Combination hair: If there was no oil from one spot, but a lot of oil from another spot on your scalp, then you have combination hair.
 The weather may affect your hair; if it is very humid, for example, your hair may react slightly differently than on a drier day.

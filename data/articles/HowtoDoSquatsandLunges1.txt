Rather than squatting straight down, you want to hinge your hips so that your butt moves backwards, almost as if you were sitting in an invisible chair.
Keep bending until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Your knees shouldn't extend beyond the tips of your toes.
Your body weight should be concentrated on your heels rather than on your toes. This will allow you to squat deeper.



It is very important to keep your back straight while squatting, otherwise you could put unnecessary pressure on the spine which could lead to a pulled muscle or a herniated disc.
Keeping your chest up and your eyes pointing straight ahead will help you to keep your back straight as you squat. Also try to keep your stomach muscles engaged as you perform the exercise.,


Pause for a moment at the bottom of the squat, then slowly rise back to your starting position. Keep your back straight and push up from your heels.
Squeeze your glutes in tight when you reach the top of the squat.

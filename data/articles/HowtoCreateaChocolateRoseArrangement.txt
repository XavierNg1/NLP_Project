 You can pick up a mold at nearly any craft or baker store and these roses often come in a variety of sizes. Consider purchasing a few molds so you can make several roses at one time.;
, While roses are lovely in a shade of red you don’t have to limit yourself to reality. Try blue or purple roses--they’ll be just as fun and delicious. Even standard chocolate color can hold its own as well.
 Each rose needs a stem so go for the long stemmed roses and get the cookie sticks. You could also use craft sticks but that will produce short flowers.


Look for green-colored cookie sticks if possible or you can wrap each stick with green foil.
 This will hold your arrangement in place. If you would rather display your arrangement in a flower box, purchase a long rose box and plenty of tissue to pad around the arrangement and protect it.

 Remove from microwave and stir. If pieces have not melted, continue heating in 30 second increments. In some cases the pieces are almost melted but a little stirring will blend the chocolate together nicely.

Rinse and clean empty molds by running them under warm water and washing with mild dish soap. Rinse and allow to air dry.
 If necessary cut to fit the vase or basket.

 There should be a label on both sides of the machine, such as "Ice Cold Coca-Cola." If the machine's LED display simply displays the price, the steps below may not work the same as they would on one that doesn't display the costs .;
, The default access code is 4, 3, 2, 1 but the buttons aren't numbered. They will either say nothing or have pictures of Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, and other Coca-Cola products on them.


If the buttons are in rows, they should be numbered 1 through 4 from left to right.
If the buttons are in a column, button 1 should be the top one.
 Again, this will vary slightly depending on the machine. Experiment with different buttons to see various information.


On machines with two panels of six buttons on each side, press 1 to see the total lifetime sales, 2 for the total lifetime items sold, 3 for a breakdown of items sold of each selection, 4 for a breakdown of cash generated for each selection, and 5 for the machine' internal temperature.
 On some machines, the 6 button will close the menu; on others, pressing the select or coin-return button works. If youâ€™re not sure which button to press, leave the machine alone; after a while without input, all machines should return to the normal menu.

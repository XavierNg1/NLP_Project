 Use a solid color, or a combination of contrasting or complementary colors.


For a whimsical look, paint the seat one color, the back another and the legs another. For subtle touches, paint the entire chair a solid color, then apply accents, such as striping or polka dots, using an alternate color or 2.
, Stir the paint thoroughly before applying. Use a brush that's easy to hold and small enough to fit between all of the chair's components. It's typically easiest to turn the chair upside down and paint the legs first. When finished, stand the chair on back on its legs and paint the remainder of the chair.



Use spray paint for fast results. Be sure to shake the canisters thoroughly before applying. Use several light coats rather than 1 heavy coat as this discourages drips.

 Depending on the desired finish, use a matte, satin, or gloss coating. A spray finish is easy to apply, but a brush-on finish offers more control for even application. If you plan to add decorative decals to your newly painted chair, apply them before applying the protective clear finish. Allow the clear coating to dry per the manufacturer's instructions, and apply as many coats as desired.

 Dogs make a positive effort to repeat behaviors that get a reward. Thus if you ask a Chihuahua to "sit" and it rewarded when it does, it learns that doing something which comes naturally(sitting) can earn a tasty reward. The same applies to potty training. When the dog performs a natural bodily function in a specific spot (peeing or pooping) and gets a rewards, it then tries to save up its "efforts" to spend them on that designated spot in order to earn a super tasty treat.


Reward-based training requires you to be on the spot when the desired behavior happens, which means you need to be home to take the dog to the toilet spot regularly.
Find a treat that your Chihuahua loves and adores, and will work hard to earn. Try a range of foods from commercial treats to chicken, cheese cubes, sausages, or hot dogs. If your dog has health issues always check in with your veterinarian first to make sure there is no health reason why it shouldn't have a certain food.;
, You can, and should, start training your dog at about 8 weeks. Training takes time, so start slowly and have patience. Remember that the older a Chihuahua gets, the harder it is to train them. So it will benefit you greatly to get started early.
 When bringing a puppy home, the first place you visit, before even setting foot indoors, is the toilet spot. Ignore the puppy's attempt to play and engage you so that he or she gets down to the business of sniffing around.


If the puppy toilets, make a super big fuss of him or her and give a treat.

 Even if you can only play easy, it is still possible to unlock TTFAF (Through the Fire and Flames).;
, You can always do it the cheating way, but it's not as fun this way and you can't do it on career mode. So it is pointless.
 You can beat it in any difficulty, and if you play in easy you only have to play 3/4 songs in a set, and the encore. Medium and above, you have to play 4 + the extra song. You can do it while completeing all the battles, or just wussing out. Anyway, just get to the last set of songs (Raining Blood, Cliffs of Dover, Number of the Beast, One) and finish them.
 You can tap the beginning on expert, because this is where most people have trouble. Right away when you beat the game, TTFAF will play (you can't fail). Just beat it, and there's the song.

While a mobile Bandcamp app does exist, its functions are limited to Internet streaming. You won’t be able to download music using the mobile Bandcamp app.
 Anything that matches your search will appear on the screen. Each result is labeled with the word “artist,” “song” or “album.”


If you’d prefer to browse through different categories rather than search for a specific song, click “Discover.”
You can also search for a genre, like “punk,” to see a list of all artists, songs and labels that match your search.
 Here you can browse the music the artist has available for download. If you want to hear a streaming free preview of a song before downloading, click the play button.
 The price of the download appears next to the “Buy Now” button.


“Name Your Price” means there is no set price. To download the song for free, type 0 into the price field.
Some artists list a flexible price, such as “$6 or more.” In this case, pay whatever you want for the download, as long as it’s at least $6.
 Depending on whether or not the song is free, something different will appear.


If it’s free, you’ll be asked to enter your email address and zip code. Enter it, then click “OK” to have the download link emailed to you. Click the link in the email to download the song.
If the song requires payment, PayPal will launch. Sign into your PayPal account or click “Pay with a Debit or Credit Card” to complete payment.

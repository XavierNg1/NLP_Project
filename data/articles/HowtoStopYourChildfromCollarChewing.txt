 Chewing a collar is a reaction to a stressor in your child's life. It is often used as a means by which a child can relieve unpleasant emotions, such as shyness, frustration, worry, discomfort, etc. These emotions can arise for a variety of reasons such as being bullied at school, changing schools, moving house, losing a friend, family troubles, etc.;
, Do not harass your child about the chewing. Much of it is akin to a reflex action and your child is resorting to it without being that conscious that they're doing it. Constantly nagging your child to stop chewing, yelling at him about it, or worst still, punishing him for it, will not help relieve it. Rather, such behaviour will become an additional pressure weighing on your child.
 It is far better to find out what is driving your child's insecurities and to alleviate these as best you can. Some life-changing situations, such as moving house, cannot be helped but you can do your very best to be a reassuring pillar of rock for your child, explaining everything that is happening and how very soon things will be back to normal. If the chewing seems to be a reaction to being afraid of situations, help your child to build up his self-confidence by talking through situations, perhaps enrolling your child in karate or some other sport that combines mind and body thinking.
 You can also develop a very discrete gesture to help trigger a reminder for your child that he is chewing his collar again. Nothing loud, bossy or intrusive, just a little "code" between the two of you. It could be tapping his shoulder or pulling at your own collar as a visual cue to stop. No need to make it anything more than this.

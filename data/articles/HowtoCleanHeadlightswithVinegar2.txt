 In a Styrofoam cup or measuring bowl, mix two parts white vinegar to one part baking soda. The two substances will start to foam.








For example, you might use four tablespoons vinegar and two tablespoons baking soda, but this might vary. Add more or less as you need it.
 Dip a clean cloth into the vinegar and baking soda mixture. Rub it onto the headlight. Work your way around the entire headlight, including the edges. Make small, circular motions to help spread the mixture.
 Rinse off the solution with water. If there is any baking soda left, it will leave a white haze on the light. Keep rinsing until the headlight is clear and sparkling. Once it is clear, you can wipe it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel.









You can rinse the headlight using a sponge. Soak the sponge in clean water, and use it to wipe away the baking soda. You may need to squeeze out the sponge and soak it again to help remove all of the baking soda.You can also rinse it by filling a spray bottle with water. Spray the headlight, and wipe the water away until the baking soda is completely gone.
 If the yellow discoloration is severe or if you have not cleaned your headlights in a while, you may need to repeat this process. Apply more of the solution to the headlight, scrub, and rinse.

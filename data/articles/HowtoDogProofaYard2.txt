 For example, tulips, daffodils, azaleas, and amaryllis can all make your dog sick or even cause them to die.Begin by talking to a vet about which plants are toxic to your dog. Different dog breeds are sensitive to different plants.
Make an inventory of the plants in your backyard so you know how many toxic plants you have and where they are located.
Remove the toxic plants or fence them in with chicken wire.
 Garbage cans are a source of many toxins. Common household items such as cleaning supplies and batteries can leave toxic sludge in the bottom of your garbage cans. If you dog gets into the cans, they might get sick.Ideally, you should keep your garbage cans outside of the fenced area where your dog hangs out.
If you must keep your garbage cans in the yard, make sure they have sealing lids and always seal the lids after you throw out the trash.
 If you spray your yard with insecticides or weed killer, your dog may ingest these chemicals if they play in the grass. After treating the grass, keep your dog out of the yard for at least twenty-four hours.You can also use non-toxic lawn products. Ask a sales associate at a lawn and garden stores about pet-safe products.
Read fertilizer and biocide labels carefully to ensure they are nontoxic. If they are not nontoxic read the label to determine how long you must wait before allowing your dog back into the yard after youâ€™ve used them., If you have rodent traps in your yard or along your porch, your dog might get into them. If your dog consumes mouse poison, for instance, it could suffer kidney failure, brain swelling, and other serious ailments. To avoid this unhappy outcome, try planting or sprinkling mint around your yard instead of using rodent poisons.

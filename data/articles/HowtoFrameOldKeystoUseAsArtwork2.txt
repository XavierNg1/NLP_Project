 Especially if the key is old, try to remove any dust, rust or grime from the key before using it in your piece.
 Depending on the number of keys you select and the size of the frame, mark out space for where you will mount the key and include the origin or a small story.
 Part of what makes this piece powerful is the story behind the key, so pay attention to detail. Youâ€™ll need to see how long or big the origin or size will be before you transfer it to the frame, so pre-write it. Or, if you plan to type, print and cut out before you mount, do this now.

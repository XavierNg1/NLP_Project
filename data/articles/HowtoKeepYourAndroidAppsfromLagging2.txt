 Not all apps close when you switch to a different app. As such, these apps can take up memory in the device, unbeknownst to you. To make sure that these apps are all fully closed, press the multi-window button on your device, usually located on the bottom left of the screen.


Many devices don’t have a dedicated multi-window button. For some devices, you may need to hold down the back button or the physical home key to get the same result. For example, the LG G3 does have a dedicated multi-window key available, while most Samsung phones require pressing and holding the physical button at the bottom of the device to achieve the same result. Consult your device’s user manual to learn exactly where the multi-window button is.
 There are two ways to close apps from the multi-window screen:


Tap “Clear all” at the bottom of the screen to close all currently running apps.
To close them one by one, place a finger over the app that you wish to close and slide it to one side.

 Avoid putting expectations on the types of friendships you intend to make. Sure, your standards should be high as anyone who becomes your friend is lucky. However, only wanting to become friends with certain types of people may limit you and prevent a long-lasting and meaningful relationship.

For instance, keep yourself open to the possibility of becoming friends with someone who isn’t deaf or hard of hearing. Additionally, don’t limit yourself by only wanting to befriend someone who has gone through the exact same experiences you have. Keep an open mind and open heart and you may be pleasantly surprised. Many communication options are available so that your hearing friends can stay in touch with you., Walking into a situation feeling less than confident puts you at a disadvantage. Don’t allow your own insecurities to stop you from putting yourself out there and meeting some potentially amazing people. You have a lot to offer and should feel good about yourself.

Consider talking to a professional if you struggle with self-confidence and self-worth issues. They may help you understand why you have this problem and then give you the tools to remedy the situation., Deaf people often feel let down by the hearing world. You believe that you have put up with so much during your life that, as a result, you have put up walls against outsiders. Remember, you can either allow your experiences to isolate you or you can use them to make your life—and others—better.

For instance, let go of these horrible experiences and your feelings towards them, or use them to help others. Holding onto them may stop you from making the friends you want. On the other hand, you may be able to use them to help others heal, as well.If you feel strong enough, choose to share your story with a group of deaf or hard of hearing people. You can speak at an event, submit your story to a journal or newspaper, or blog about it.

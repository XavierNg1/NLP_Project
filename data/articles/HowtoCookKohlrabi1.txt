 Prepare a baking sheet by coating it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.

You can line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of using cooking spray for a mess-free alternative.;
, Slice each kohlrabi bulb into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick pieces and cut each of these pieces in half.

For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger.
 In a large bowl, add together the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper, mixing well to combine.

If you do not have fresh garlic on hand, you could substitute 1/8 tsp (2/3 ml) of garlic powder.
 Toss the kohlrabi pieces into the seasoned olive oil, stirring well to coat each piece.

The garlic does not need to stick to each piece of kohlrabi, but it should still be distributed among the pieces fairly evenly. Break up any large clumps of garlic with your mixing spoon to prevent the garlic flavor from becoming too concentrated in one area.
 Spread the kohlrabi pieces out onto the baking sheet in a single, flat layer.

The kohlrabi needs to be restricted to a single layer. If you end up piling it onto the sheet, some pieces may cook faster than others.
 This should take roughly 15 to 20 minutes.

Stir the pieces occasionally using a spatula to ensure even browning.
 Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the cooked kohlrabi before returning it to the oven. Let roast for another 5 minutes, or until the Parmesan cheese becomes lightly toasted and browned.

Remove from the oven once you see the Parmesan brown.
If you end up using shredded Parmesan instead of grated, you should let the shredded Parmesan melt evenly before removing the dish.
 As soon as the cheese melts and browns, you should remove the kohlrabi from the oven and enjoy the dish immediately.

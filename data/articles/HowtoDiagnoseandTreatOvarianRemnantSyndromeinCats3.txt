 It is possible that your vet will suggest simply observing the development of the remnant ovarian tissue over time. This is often the case if the tissue appears to be very small and is not overly influencing your cat’s behaviors or health. If you choose this approach, then make sure to schedule regular checkup visits with your vet., If the location of the ovarian tissue is rather specific, then a targeted surgical approach can be used. If the tissue has not been located, then exploratory surgery is the only real invasive option. Be aware that a surgery that must navigate through prior scar tissue can be more complicated, so talk over all of the benefits and challenges of the procedure with your vet.Be sure to follow all of your vet’s pre- and post-op instructions very carefully. For example, they may request that you not feed your cat on the day of the surgery., In certain cases, the ovarian tissue, or the cells surrounding it, could be cancerous. To rule this out, your vet will take a tissue sample from the surgery and send it off for testing. The wait time varies widely for these tests, so talk with your vet about the timetable., Laparoscopic ovarian remnant removal is a major surgery, so expect your cat to be on an exercise restriction and pain medications for up to two weeks. Keep your cat confined to a limited area during this period and try to limit any stress-causing factors, such as extra household visitors., Your vet will likely discharge your cat the day after surgery. Then, they will likely want to see your cat for at least one post-op appointment, usually a few weeks later. Another hormonal test may be ordered at this time, just to verify that the levels are now correct.

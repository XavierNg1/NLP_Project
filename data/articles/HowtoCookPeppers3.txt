 Pour 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of cooking into a large skillet. Heat it over medium-high for a couple of minutes.
 Peppers should be cut into rings, strips, or small bite-sized pieces before you stir-fry them. Generally, hot peppers are cut into rings, while sweet bell peppers are cut into strips or bite-sized pieces.


Keep in mind that the size will determine how long the pieces will need to cook for. Strips, large bell pepper rings, and pieces that are over 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size may need a minute or two more than small pepper rings and small chunks under 1 inch (2.5 cm).
 Add the peppers to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for about 4 to 7 minutes, or until the peppers are crisp-tender.


Frequent stirring is very important in this method. You do not want to burn the pepper skins or the pepper flesh, but if you let the pieces stay still for too long, the sections touching the pan are more likely to become charred.
 Stir-fried peppers are usually prepared with other ingredients, but you can enjoy them on their own or use them in any recipe calling for some variety of cooked pepper.


For a quick side dish or a light lunch, you could toss the peppers with cooked rice and a drizzle of your favorite dressingâ€”soy sauce, Italian dressing, and so on.

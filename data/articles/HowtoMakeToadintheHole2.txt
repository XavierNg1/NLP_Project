 You can use a round biscuit cutter or a drinking glass. You can also use a cookie cutter as well; a heart or star shape will give you a nice, personalized touch.


Use something that is 2Â½ to 3 inches (6.35 to 7.62 centimeters) wide., Tilt the skillet from side to side to spread the butter evenly across the surface.
 Save the circle (or heart or star) that you cut out earlier. You can toast it later, after you are done making the toad in the hole.
 Be careful not to break the yolk. Some people find it easier to crack the egg into a cup first, and then pour it into the hole.
, If you can't slide the spatula easily under the egg part, or if the whites are still too "clear," let the egg cook a little bit longer. If you flip it over too soon, the egg is more likely to break and "escape" the hole.


Don't worry if the egg breaks on your first try. It will still be delicious. This technique does take some practice.
 At this point, you can slide the toast and egg across the skillet to mop up any melted butter. The toast is ready when the bread is golden brown, and the egg yolk is set.


For an extra touch, add a slice of Cheddar cheese on top of the egg., If you'd like, you can toast the hole you cut out earlier, and serve it on the side.

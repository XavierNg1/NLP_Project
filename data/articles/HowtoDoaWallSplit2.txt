 Lay on your back with your legs facing the wall and your heels resting on the wall. Bend your knees and place your legs against the wall. At the same time, use your arms to move as close as possible toward the wall. Try to get your butt as close to the wall as possible.


If you experience any discomfort in your lower back, move your body away from the wall. You can place a pillow or folded up blanket beneath your lower back for extra support.If your neck feels strained, place a rolled up towel underneath your neck.
 Slide your legs down the wall in the opposite direction slowly until they can go no further. Breathe as you lower your legs.


Press very lightly on your legs with your hands to get a deeper stretch. However, do not press to the point where you feel pain.
You may be able to spread your legs further apart by creating tension and then relaxing your legs. To create tension, pull your legs away from the wall and lift your head and chest. Relax, create tension, and then relax again. Now press lightly on your legs to see if you can widen your split., Hold your stretch for at least 20 to 60 seconds. Once the time is up, use your hands to gently bring your legs back together and rest them against the wall. Repeat this between 2 and 6 times. Remember to breathe as you hold your split.As you continue to practice, try to increase the amount of time you hold your split.
If you are sore the next day, you may have pushed your body too much. Do not practice your splits anymore until the soreness is gone.

 Makeup applied correctly can be a good way to camouflage jowls. You can do this by applying foundation as you normally would. Apply highlighter to your jowls using a concealer brush, which will make them less obvious.Apply a lightweight concealer on top of the highlighting powder to remove some of the shimmer. Finish by applying the rest of your makeup as usual, and finish the look with a setting powder to keep it in place.
If you want to, you can look for a foundation that is formulated to plump and hydrate, which will help lines look less obvious.
 If you are a man, you can easily hide jowls by growing a beard. Beards are very trendy these days, so no one will find it strange if you decide to grow a big beard.


If you do grow a beard, be sure to maintain it well to keep it looking neat and fresh.
 Wearing a turtleneck or a scarf is one way that you could hide your jowls if you feel self-conscious about them.


In summer, look for light, flowing scarves so you donâ€™t get too hot. In winter, you can try warm turtlenecks and fluffier scarves if you live somewhere cold.

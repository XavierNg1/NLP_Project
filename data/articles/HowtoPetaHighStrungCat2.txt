 You don't want to increase the anxiety in a cat that is already stressed out. If a cat has its hair raised or is hissing at you, it's a good sign that the cat doesn't want to interact with you. At that point you can do one of two things, either walk away and let the cat have its space or you can try to win it over by offering a treat to it at a distance. You should not, however, try to win it over by forcing physical affection. This will only discourage trust and may result in the cat scratching or biting you.


Remember that a cat will rely on the instinct of fight or flight when it feels at risk.Whether it runs from you or fights you, it is doing it out of fear.
You can also look at a cat's tail to judge its comfort level. A tail that is straight up may signal that the cat is fearful, while a relaxed and swishing tail is more likely to signal that the cat is comfortable with you.
 Stop petting the cat at any sign of displeasure. A cat will usually warn you that it is getting overstimulated by a soft bite or growl.If the cat you are petting does this, immediately quit petting it and give it some room.
 Purring is the clearest signal that your cat enjoys how you are petting it.The cats body should be relaxed and it may be pressing into your hand for more pressure if it really likes the petting.


Your cat may also direct your petting toward where it wants to be scratched. This is a good sign that it likes what's going on, the cat just wants it to happen in another location.
 A cat may even be purring and then decide that it is done with what you are doing. When petting a high strung cat, be prepared to stop petting him or her quickly, and be aware that you may get bitten or scratched. This may be the cost of trying to connect with a skittish cat.

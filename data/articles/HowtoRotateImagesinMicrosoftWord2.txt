 Click on the desired image and you will see a slight outline appear around the image. Any degree changes you make will be applied to the outlined image.
 From the ribbon of options on the top of the Word window, select the tab that says Format. It should be the furthest right tab.
 In the third group of icons called "Arrange," click the icon that looks like two triangles next to each other. A drop down menu will appear.


If you have trouble finding the Rotate icon, hover over each icon in the Arrange group to reveal a text box explaining what the icon is.
 In the drop down menu you will see 4 different basic options: Rotate Right 90, Rotate Left 90, Flip Vertical, and Flip Horizontally.



Flip Vertical will essentially mirror the image along the X-axis.

Flip Horizontal will essentially mirror the image along the Y-axis.
 From the same drop down menu, click More Rotation Options. Look for "Rotation." Specify the degree you would like to rotate the image by pressing the up and down arrows or by entering in a number. Positive numbers will rotate the image to the right and negative numbers will rotate the image to the left.


Any degree greater than 360 degrees will be unnecessary since rotating the picture 360 degrees will only return the picture back to its original orientation.
Press OK when you are done to apply the rotation.

 If you get a date request – online or in person – from someone you’re not interested in dating, you should start by acknowledging his effort. It can be really scary to ask someone out, and he went out on a limb by doing so.For example, you can say something like “Thank you so much for asking/messaging me! I know how hard it is to take that first step.”

, Once you’ve acknowledged his effort, you need to clearly say no if you’re not interested in going out with him. Don’t say maybe and don’t say you have to think about it if you don’t.For example, you can say, “I really appreciate you asking me, but I’m just not interested.”

, You might be tempted to make an excuse when you turn him down to ease your rejection. However, doing this can leave your “no” open to interpretation, so try to be as honest as possible.


For example, don’t say "I'm seeing someone" if you’re not or "I'm not looking for a relationship" if you are. The fact that you have an online dating profile suggests you are looking to date and makes these responses sound hollow.You might also be turning him down because you’re just not interested in men. Be honest about it if that’s the case., If you get a date request online or in person, don’t just ignore him. Make sure you that you give him a response, even if it’s short and sweet.You can ignore this rule if you get a date request from a total stranger or if the request itself is overly aggressive or sexually explicit.

 You can still read about celebrity gossip, but begin doing other things with that time. Instead of spending countless hours surfing the web about celebrity gossip read an article on current events or catch up with old friends on social networking sites for a part of the time you would spend obsessing over gossip.;
, Maybe it would be news about events happening in the real world or simply reading fashion magazines rather than celebrity gossip ones.


If you read blogs on the web about celebrity gossip, consider taking that time to read or do other things on the internet, such as editing wikiHow or reading articles on other topics.
If you buy magazines on celebrity gossip, consider buying magazines on other topics that interest you, whether it be beauty or technology magazines.
 You'll save money from stopping those magazine subscriptions. You'll gain time to be more productive or maybe even pick up a new hobby you enjoy equally as much.
 Cancelling these services will make it much easier to stop your addiction. Take it a step further by blocking those websites and avoiding the magazine racks in stores.
 Give new topics a chance to gain your interest. Maybe you think politics is a boring topic? Spend some time learning about that topic and maybe it will interest you.
 You don't have to find other topics to obsess over, instead you can begin a hobby you may enjoy, such as cooking, sewing, or beginning a new collection.

 This ensures you have a nice, slow cook. You don't want to burn the apples. Rather, you slowly dehydrate them, getting them crispy but still retaining a little bit of the gummy, fruity chew.

If you want completely crispy apples, you can get those too. You'll still need the oven at 200ÂºF, however.;
, This is especially important if you're keeping the skin on. After washing, pat them dry as well.
, You want them all to be the same thickness. Slice horizontally, parallel to the stem, and aim for roughly 1







, A pizza screen, baking sheet, or another heat-resistant platter will work, but aim for something with holes and airflow whenever possible. It is alright for the slices to touch, but do not allow them to overlap -- you need them to be exposed to air to dry out.









You can lay your wire rack on top of a baking sheet to capture any dripping juice.
 A little bit of sweetness will take these to the next level. You can use powdered sugar, or mix up equal parts cinnamon and granulated sugar and dust the apples with this. For a lighter notch of sweetness, you could also drizzle the apples with honey.
 Leave the oven cracked open slightly to vent the moisture from the apples. You can safely wedge a wooden spoon in the oven door gap for venting at this low temperature. The time needed will vary based on the thickness of the apple slices; more for thicker slices, less for thinner slices.









Use a spatula to flip the apples at the one hour mark. If you're using a non-mesh or wire baking sheet, where air can't escape the apples from below, turn them every 30-45 minutes instead of just on the hour., Either way, turn off the oven. The chips will be a bit rubbery while warm, but will quickly turn as crispy as potato chips when cooled. If you leave them in the oven as they cool, this will speed up the drying and lead to a crispier, crunchier chip.
 The chips will last several weeks in a cool, dry place, as long as they are in an airtight container.

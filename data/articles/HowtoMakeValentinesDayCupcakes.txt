 Pattern or gold looks cute, but if you only have white you could possibly use the kids to decorate them with non-toxic pens and doodle on the outsides only.;
,, A way to check this is that it should be quite pale; there should be no chunks of butter and the sugar should have magically 'disappeared'.
,, To check, poke a small skewer into a cupcake near the back or sides. If wet mixture comes out then it's not done. Be careful not to burn them.
, Otherwise, it will run down the sides if the cupcakes are too warm still.
, They should almost fill all the cupcakes' tops.
 Then use a little bit of icing to dab gently on the middle of the red heart to stick the white heart on.


If you only have 2 sized cutters, skip to the next step. If you have three, cut out a third heart using the smallest cutter and again, dab a bit of icing onto the white heart and stick it on.
 You're done!

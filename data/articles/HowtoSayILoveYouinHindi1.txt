 Though there are several ways to say "I love you" in Hindi, this phrase is one simplest and easiest to learn. As noted above, in Hindi, men and women say "I love you" slightly differently. As a general rule, most masculine verbs in Hindi end with "a", while most feminine verbs end with "ee". Thus, if you're a male, you'll use the masculine verb "kartha", rather than the feminine verb "karthee" in the phrase above.


Note that this phrase works not just when speaking romantically to a female, but also when expressing your love to a male, like, for instance, a brother, son, friend, etc.;
, If, as a native English speaker, you try to pronounce the phrase above as written, your significant other will probably understand what you're trying to say, but you'll almost certainly mess up some small part of the pronunciation. For the best result, try to pronounce the phrase with proper Hindi pronunciation using the steps below:Pronounce "main" as "may." In Hindi, when the "N" sound comes at the end of a word, it's usually nasal.This means that it's pronounced very lightly — almost imperceptibly — with the nose, so "main" becomes almost like "may."
Pronounce "tumse" as "thumse," with "thum" sounding like "thoom"
Pronounce "pyar" like it's spelled.
Pronounce "kartha" with a light "th" sound. The "tha" syllable shouldn't sound quite like the English word "the." It's more of a cross between "the" and "dah".
Pronounce "hoon" as "hoom/n." The same "silent n" rule applies here as in "main", but the sound is slightly more pronounced and sounds almost like an "M" sound.
 If you've gotten your point across, you may hear your sweetheart say something like this phrase back to you. Congratulations! This means "I love you too!"


In terms of pronunciation, the beginning of this phrase sounds almost like the word "maybe." The next part sounds like "op-say." The rest is basically identical to the way that women say "I love you" in Hindi — see below.

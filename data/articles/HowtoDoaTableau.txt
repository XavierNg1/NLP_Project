 Try your local theater or drama club. It would be best to recruit actors if you want to do this in public, since a tableau requires expressive positioning and realistic facial expressions. But if you just want to have fun, doing it with your friends would be the best option.
 Focus on the limitations of tableau--Hamlet's "To Be or Not To Be" speech is an especially moving moment in literature, but without any words, you would just see Hamlet with his mouth open. Scenes involving action are best, especially if what is happening is complex and might be missed in a movie. (e.g. a war scene with large armies) The audience should be able to get at least a rough idea of what was happening before your scene and what will happen after., What are you specifically doing? Remember that the audience must be able to tell what you are doing because you can't tell them through motion or speaking. Exaggerate the action as much as you can without being cheesy. Since you can't see yourself, ask for feedback from your friends or those around you., Props and costumes are especially important to tableau. These tell the audience who is who (the king has a crown) and what's going on (light sabers out = a tense moment, a battle is about to take place). If your tableau is not taking place in a normal world (ex: Wonderland), then you should assemble a set as well., This is when you find out what works and what doesn't. Correct any problems you come across. If you find making eye contact with someone makes you laugh, for example, try looking at their forehead instead. This is a good time to discover how long you can hold your position, and hence how long the tableau should be. Train yourself to stay still in your position (don't fiddle with your belt, even if you don't think the audience will notice). You might bring in small audiences to give suggestions before the real performance., Remember, the best evaluation of your tableau is if you had fun while making it.

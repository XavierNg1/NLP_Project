 Once AVG is installed, make sure that the latest virus updates are downloaded. Right-click on the AVG icon in the lower-right corner of the desktop. Select “Update now” from the menu.


The AVG installer does not always contain the latest virus updates, so be sure to check for updates as soon as possible.
 Click the Scan now button in the bottom-left corner of the AVG window. Depending on your computer’s speed and storage size, this could up to several hours. Any viruses found will be automatically quarantined or deleted by AVG.
 From the main AVG menu, click the menu button next to the Scan Now button. It looks like 3 horizontal bars. Click Manage Scheduled Scans, and then “Edit scan schedule.”


Make sure Scheduled Scan is enabled at the top.
Set up an automated scan. It is recommended that you scan your computer at least once per week. Pick a time that your computer is on but you probably won’t be using it, as scans take a lot of system resources.

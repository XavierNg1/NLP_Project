There are plenty of good makes at your local hardware store.
As it expands, the excess foam starts to come out.
Make sure it is completely full and then leave it overnight to set.



This will require a little force but it should break off fairly easily.
Then give the viola a good scrape to remove any excess foam that's stuck to the outside.

Make sure you give it a thorough coating.
Two coats will do it.
Leave it to set.

You should have a beautifully finished Viola Tennis Racket!
It should be hard and durable yet light and easy to use!
It will even pack away nicely in your racket bag!

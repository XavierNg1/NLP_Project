 This remedy has not been proven to stop hiccups, but there's no harm in giving it a try. Wet your finger or a pacifier and dip the tip into a sugar bowl. Let your baby suck on the sugar for a few minutes, and the hiccups may fade away.
 Place your baby on a flat surface on her belly, and allow her to move around a little bit. Gently massage her back for a several minutes. This may help to loosen the sort of gas buildup that may be causing the hiccups.


If your baby seems uncomfortable with the massage, stop immediately.
 The following folk "remedies" have not been demonstrated to stop hiccups, and they can actually hurt your baby. Never try any of these methods:


"Scaring" the hiccups away by making a loud noise or otherwise shocking your baby.
Slapping your baby's back.
Pressing your baby's eyeballs.
Pulling your baby's tongue.

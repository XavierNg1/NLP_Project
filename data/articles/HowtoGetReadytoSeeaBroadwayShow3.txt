 Pick them up at the appropriate box office as soon as possible to avoid any last minute running around or confusion that may make you late for your show. You're definitely not going to want to be rushed or showing up late to a Broadway performance.
 Look nice, as a Broadway show is a special event. Just make sure your dress clothes are comfortable, thoughâ€”you don't want to be miserable during a long show! It's a good idea to dress in layers so you can adjust for being too hot or too cold in the theater.


Casual business attire is considered appropriate for most plays. While it's possible that some attending the theater may wear jeans or casual shorts, this would not be considered the most appropriate of attire.
For women, proper attire could include a skirt and top, a comfortable dress, or nice dress pants and a top. Consider taking a cardigan sweater to have something to throw over your shoulders if they are exposed or if the theater is a bit chilly.
For men, proper attire could include comfortable dress pants or khakis and a polo shirt, or button down shirt. A blazer, nice jacket, or sweater could be brought in case of cooler temperatures.
 Will you be walking to the show from your hotel or nearby restaurant, hailing a cab, using the public transportation systems? Go over how you plan to get there and how much time you will need to do so well before show time. Consider if you will need to take multiple forms of transportation to reach your destination.

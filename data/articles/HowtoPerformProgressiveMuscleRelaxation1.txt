 Though progressive relaxation can be used as a sleep aide, the goal is typically to learn to relax while still awake. You don't want to nod off in the middle of your session., Loose-fitting clothes are best; don't wear anything too tight, as this will limit your movement. And don't forget to take off your shoes so you can properly tense and relax your feet., Often, when people are very relaxed they become chilly. Have a blanket or sheet nearby that you can drape over yourself if you get cold. The warmth will help you to relax., You will want to find a space where no interruptions or sudden noises will interrupt your relaxed state. A small, uncluttered space in your home is ideal. Dim the lights if possible to create a soothing atmosphere., A full session will take 10-15 minutes. Turn off your cell phone or pager. If you have a landline, turn off the ringer. Ask your family not to interrupt you during your session.
 You can perform progressive relaxation standing, sitting, or lying down. Sitting in a reclining armchair is ideal, as it allows you to relax more than if you were standing, but you are also less likely to fall asleep than if you were lying on your back.Once in position, close your eyes, uncross your legs, and let your hands rest comfortably at your sides or on your lap.
 Deep breathing has been shown to help trigger the body's natural relaxation response, typified by lower blood pressure and a feeling of relaxation and wellbeing.Take a deep breath, hold it for four seconds, and relax as you let it out. Pay attention to how your abdomen rises and falls with each breath. After 5 deep breaths, you are ready to begin.

 Contact a couple of friends and ask if you can borrow some of their stuff for a while. Make sure you have extra stuff around your room such as a music player or some books to read. Things like building that model you got for a birthday or Christmas you never thought of doing, like stuff that would pass the time. If you are aware of the punishment beforehand, make a stash of electronics, such as an old game boy or Mp3 player.;
, One of the most important things that you can do is to make sure that you talk to them at school or put notes in their locker if you can't do that.
 When you are grounded, it is hard to get new stuff. Your parents might keep you from going to the store. This is always a good opportunity to save some money too.
 Yelling at them every time you see them isn't going to help. Don't be overly nice so that it's obvious that you are trying to get out of it, but just follow their terms of your grounding and try not to upset them, or they might increase the length of your grounding. Tell them you understand why you are being punished. If you think it might make them reduce the grounding, do extra chores around the house. This just might get their respect back.
 It's the most important thing to remember. It will all come to an end eventually, and you will survive. Just try to find something that your parents will let you do. Work on your drawing or read a book, or if all else fails, do some homework or some schoolwork. Be positive and tell yourself it's not going to last forever, and Do Not Think It's Entirely Your Fault! You really are good inside.
 If you make a mistake trying to sneak out while grounded, or get caught with your iPod, or on the computer or TV, figure out why your parents caught you and be a little sneakier next go-round

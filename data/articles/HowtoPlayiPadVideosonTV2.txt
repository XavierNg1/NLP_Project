 These connectors are made by Apple and allow you to physically connect your iPad to your TV. There are two types of connectors: Lightning connectors and 30-pin connectors. The iPad 2 will require the 30-pin version, while any newer iPads use the Lightning connector.


You will notice slightly lower video quality with the 30-pin connector.
 Insert the adapter into the charging port of the iPad. Ensure that you are inserting it in the correct direction so that the pins in the connector aren't damaged (it inserts just like the charging cable).
 Depending on your adapter, you may have a couple different choices. The newer Lightning adapters connect via HDMI. Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the adapter, and the other into an HDMI port on the back or side of your TV. Older adapters may use component cables, which plug into the color-coded ports on the back or side of your TV.


If your TV doesn't have an HDMI port but you are using the Lightning adapter, you will need a second adapter to convert the HDMI port to component cables.
 Switch it to the input that you plugged your HDMI or component cables into. The ports are labeled on the TV itself so you'll be able to seer which input you need to select on the TV.
 Your iPad's screen will be mirrored on your TV, showing exactly what appears on the iPad. Use your iPad to open the video you want to show. Some apps will have slightly different interfaces when using this method (e.g. Netflix will display the Netflix logo on the TV until you select a video on the iPad).

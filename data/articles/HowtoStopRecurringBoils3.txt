 Boils are most commonly found on the inner thighs, near the groin, under your arms, and on your buttocks at the site of a hair follicle. These areas are commonly damp and the bacteria that causes boils can grow there.Keep these areas as dry as possible. This means drying them with a cotton towel as much as possible after a bath and when you are sweaty.
 Make sure you wear the right kind of clothing to stay as dry as possible. This includes breathable fabrics such as cotton, linen, silk, seersucker, and lyocell. You should also wear loose-fitting clothing, which allows your skin to breath and prevents irritation in at risk areas.
 Boils can occur at the sights of cuts where you may have an infection. Whenever you get a cut, treat it right away with over-the-counter antiseptics. Try a triple-strength antibiotic and cover the injury with a bandaid. You can also try witch hazel, which has antiseptic and antibacterial properties.To use witch hazel, pour some onto a clean gauze pad and apply it to the cut. Let the witch hazel soak into the boil for about a minute and then pat it dry.
 If you think a boil looks like it's coming up, take a warm compress and apply it to the area where the boil is beginning. Then, try a home remedy (turmeric paste, tea tree oil, etc.) to treat boils and apply it to the skin as directed. Apply this combination every 12 hours until you are certain there is no swelling or tenderness.
 If you have tried many different options and you still have recurring boils, see your doctor. You should also see your doctor if you have tried home treatments and they donâ€™t help within two weeks, or if you have diabetes or another condition that causes your immune system to be suppressed. At this point, you should make an appointment with a dermatologist. You may have some other condition which makes you more susceptible to boils.


If you don't have a dermatologist, ask you doctor for a referral.

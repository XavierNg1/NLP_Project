 To safely dispose of an old card you need to first disable the magnetic strip which contains all of your personal data, such as your account number, card limit, and name. You need to demagnetize this strip to help make the card unusable by anybody. You can do this by running a magnet all the way along the strip.


Do this slowly so that the magnet is against the strip for a good amount of time.
You can use any magnet. A fridge magnet will do the job.You can then cut along the strip with a pair of scissors.;
, You also need to destroy the chip in your card, if you have a chip and PIN card. This is a small silver or gold square usually on the left-hand side of your card. This chip contains all the same personal information that the magnetic strip does. It can be difficult to cut it up with scissors, so use a hammer to smash the chip into small pieces., Once you have disabled the magnetic strip and electronic chip you can begin to cut up the rest of the card. Take care when you do this to ensure that you cut it up effectively and make it as hard as possible to be pieced back together. Begin by cutting up the numbers on the card so that there is no more than two numbers on each piece of card.


Then cut up the security code and signature on the back of the card into very small pieces.
Cut it up with bent, curved, and straight cuts which will make it harder to piece back together.

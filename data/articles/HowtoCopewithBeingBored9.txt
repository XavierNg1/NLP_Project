Take a nap. You know, the second you get too old to take naps is about the same time where you start to really appreciate them.
Take a bubble bath. Reenact Master and Command with the bar of soap. Or sing as much of Rubber Ducky as you can remember.
Build a fort. Come on. Forts are awesome. Do you still have the best pillow construction skills in the West?

 It’s usually considered one of the most harmless supplements, but in combination with certain other supplements or drugs, it can be harmful.In combination with diuretics (water pills) used to treat hypertension and edema — common symptoms of heart disease — vitamin D can cause kidney stones, weak bones, and mental problems.
Common diuretics include chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide.
 One class of hypertension medications — ACE inhibitors — work by preventing one of the enzymes responsible for narrowing the blood vessels from doing its job. Potassium can also regulate blood pressure, but when combined with an ACE inhibitor medication, your body might end up retaining too much potassium, leading to muscle fatigue arrhythmia, and paralysis.Common ACE inhibitors include captopril, moexipril, benazepril, and fosinopril., Vitamin B3 — also known as niacin — can interact adversely with statins, a class of drugs used to regulate cholesterol, which in turn affects blood pressure. Taken together, niacin and statins can lead to fatigue or kidney failure.

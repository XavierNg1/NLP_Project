 With a little research, you’ll find a wealth of online retailers who sell what you’re looking for—from Amazon to retailers who specialize in high quality ocarinas.









If you’re just learning how to play this instrument, don’t break the bank on your first ocarina. $20 to $60 should get you the perfect starter instrument.
If you find you love your new hobby and want to invest in an instrument, high quality ocarinas can run as high as $500.;
, Ocarinas don’t cover a wide range of sounds, like a piano does, so it’s important to choose an ocarina that’s going to play the pitch you want. In descending order from highest to lowest pitch range, you can find soprano, alto, tenor, and bass ocarinas.









The higher the range, the smaller the instrument, so keep that in mind when choosing your instrument.










A four-hole ocarina can produce a basic scale of eight notes.
A six-hole ocarina can produce a basic scale plus semitones.
 Peruvian ocarinas are beautifully styled and detailed, so you may be tempted to buy one on aesthetics alone. However, they’re usually crafted with cheap materials, and don’t sound very good as a result. They’re more decorative than useful for playing purposes. Plastic ocarinas, although seductively affordable, are often “airy” and improperly tuned.

 Ensure that the fit is comfortable for the wearer before proceeding.


Choose a headband in the color you'd like to show through. If this isn't possible, select ribbon in that color and wrap it around the headband.;
, Do you want artificial flowers or real flowers? Artificial flowers are easier to add––they only require gluing. Fresh flowers will take a bit more work with wire, etc. This method focuses on the artificial variety.


Sourcing the flowers: Craft stores, remove from hair clips, thrift store finds, etc. You could even make your own.
 There is no hard and fast rule about how a fairy might like flowers to be arranged; that's up to you to be creative about! But some ideas that you might like to consider include:


A row of the same flower in the same color across the entire headband. For example, a row of sweet small pink satin roses.
A few large flowers placed in one spot of the headband, with the rest of the headband left free of embellishment (the method images here show such a result).
A mixture of flowers of differing sizes.
Flowers entwined with leaves, stems and artificial gems.
Any other ideas you have for fairy-like floral arrangements.
 Use glue suitable for attaching fabric to the headband material.


As you're gluing, wipe off any congealed glue to ensure that it doesn't create unsightly blobs when dried.
 Read the instructions on the glue package for details on drying times.
 Make any adjustments as needed.
 It's time to add the fairy costume and head off to the party!

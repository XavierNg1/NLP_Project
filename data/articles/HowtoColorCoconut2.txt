 You'll only need a small amount of water, about a tablespoon, although the precise amount can vary with the amount of coconut you use. Add 1 to 2 drops of a single color of food coloring. The more you add, the darker the color, so do this with care. Put the lid or cover on the jar.
 Check that you're happy with the color that results. If the color is too light, add more food coloring; if it's too dark, add water to thin it, then dispose of any excess water before adding the coconut.
 Place the lid back on the jar and shake to color all of the coconut. As the coconut soaks up the water, it will also soak up the color and absorb the dye.
 If there is any liquid left in the jar, strain the coconut out using a tea strainer or other wire mesh strainer, and dispose of the excess water. Then arrange the wet coconut on a paper towel or sheet of parchment or wax paper, to dry.


Once dry, it is ready to use.
 Be sure to wash the jar out thoroughly between color changes to avoid mixing colors accidentally, and dry each color of coconut separately.
 After all the coconut has dried, place each new color into its own bowl or resealable plastic bag. Storing each color separately will keep the different colors bright and fresh, whereas storing all the colors together in one container could allow them to blend and turn into an unappealing brownish color.
 When you're ready to use the rainbow coconut, add equal amounts of each of the colors to one bowl. Mix with your hands or a spoon to distribute the colors evenly. You will now have a rainbow-colored mixture of coconut.
 The bright, appealing colors make rainbow coconut a great topping for cakes, cookies, or other food. Add it to cake frosting or use in whatever way strikes your fancy.


If not using immediately, place inside a resealable bag and store in the refrigerator.

You can also open System Preferences by clicking the icon of an apple in the top left corner, and selecting “System Preferences.”, Click “Users and Groups,” and select the user you want to control from the menu on the left. Make sure the box that says, “Enable parental controls” is checked. Return to System Preferences.


If Users and Groups is locked, click the lock icon in the bottom left corner, and enter your administrator account’s name and password when prompted.
 From System Preferences, click “Parental Controls.” You will see a message about entering the name and password of an administrator in order to make changes to parental controls. Click the lock icon in the lower left corner of the screen to do so, and enter your information.

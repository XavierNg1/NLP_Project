 This will help you to gain perspective on your food intake, enabling you to make a plan to change it. Taking time to and think about when, how, and what you eat can be key to controlling how you consume. Mindless eating can be a huge part of snacking and unhealthy eating habits.


Get a notebook.
Record where, when, what, and, honestly, how much you eat.
Note how you feel.
There are free online food diaries available at many websites, including www.myfitnesspal.com.
 Research shows that what a consumer defines as a snack plays a marked role inhibiting conceptualization the behavior.If you don't understand it, it becomes a lot harder to fix. Draw your boundaries. Define what you feel makes a snack.
 Specific times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with at least three to four hours in between each time you eat. Creating this schedule for your dining experiences can help you to plan around when you get hungry. Use your food journal to figure the best times for you to eat.


This is crucial, especially when starting out, to ensure that you have your meals planned out and spaced apart so that you are not left with extra food to eat at the end of the day, or worse, no food at all.
 This way you can pinpoint your targets. Few things can beat a well-thought out strategy.


Watch for patterns.
Check for variety.
Be positive. This is how you support yourself.
 You don't have to stop snacking altogether. Even if that is your eventual goal, starting small can provide goals that are easier to achieve. Think of it as a series of little battles, not an overwhelming war.


Start slow to help ease into your new habit.
Try eating half your snack, at first.
Skip eating the snack entirely for one day, and then do the same the following day. After seven days, you might begin to realize you really didn't really need to eat it. The next week, pick another food to eliminate between meals.

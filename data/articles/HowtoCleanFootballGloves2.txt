 Keep in mind that a glove’s construction can vary by brand and model. Always check the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding washing. Expect some to be machine-washable, while others should be hand-washed only. If in doubt, always hand-wash., Keep in mind that the outside of a garment experiences a harsher ride through a wash cycle then its inside. Protect the grips to your glove by turning them inside out. Reduce the chance of damage that might come from snags, tears, or wear., Expect top-loading washers to have a rougher cycle than front-loading machines. If your machine loads from the top, protect your gloves further by placing them inside a pillowcase or something similar and then tying it shut. Front-loaders’ cycles should be softer on your gloves, but err on the side of caution if inclined and bag them anyway., Be aware that heat can damage your gloves’ components, depending on the material used. Set the temperature to “cold” for both your wash and rinse cycles. Then select “delicate wash cycle” for the gentlest wash. Add a mild laundry detergent to the washer as it fills., Run your cycle. Once it’s completed, lay the gloves flat on a surface or hang them on a drying rack or clothesline. Don’t use the dryer, since its heat will likely damage the grips and/or other components.

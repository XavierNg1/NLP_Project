 You will want to use ice or cold packs as soon as possible to help keep swelling at bay. There are many cold therapy packs available from your local drug store that you can apply to the sore area. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables or a towel filled with ice. Cold can be applied for up to 20 minutes several times a day.
 When 48-72 hours have passed after the injury, you can apply heat to the sore area. Don’t use heat if you still have swelling. You can also alternate between heat and cold to help make your arm feel better. Avoid heat on the area for the first 48 hours because it can increase swelling—this includes hot showers, tubs and packs.
 Over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen, naproxen and acetaminophen can be used to help with pain and swelling. Always follow the directions on the label and don’t take more than the recommended dose. Never give children aspirin.
 You can use gentle pressure to rub or massage the sore area. This can help with pain and get blood flowing better to repair the damaged tissue faster. If it hurts too much, don’t try to massage it until your pain level decreases.


One way to massage areas that are sore is to use a tennis ball. You roll the ball over the sore area, and when you feel a tender spot, roll it slowly over the area for a maximum of 15 times.You can also go get a massage regularly from a professional, which may prove helpful.
 Always consult with a doctor for any questions or concerns you may have regarding your sore arm. If you are unable to control the pain, it lasts more than 2 weeks or your pain gets worse, then you need to see a doctor. Also, if you can’t use your arm normally, you develop a fever or you start to get numbness and tingling, it’s time to call your medical provider.

 There are thousands in the English language that don't rhyme with any other word. Challenge yourself to find as many of them as possible. This can also be a good competition among friends - who can come up with the longest list?;
, There's nothing that rhymes with the word "purple" but "hurtful" comes pretty close! How many more "almost" rhymes can you think of?

, Using the words you've collected on your list of non-rhymers, compose a poem that doesn't rhyme at all! Make it as serious or as hilarious as you like - it's all a bit of fun.
 Ask for his or her opinion of words that don't rhyme. If you're an editor of a school or college paper, print up the article to honor the day and help spread knowledge about non-rhyming words.
 Try to order food with words in it that don't rhyme. Orange and sushi are excellent words to start with!

, Have everyone write non-rhyming poems (as above). Perhaps hold a competition to try to trick people into rhyming too - a little improvisation could work well here if you plan it properly.


Another idea is to hold a competition for the funniest made-up words that rhyme with non-rhyming words.

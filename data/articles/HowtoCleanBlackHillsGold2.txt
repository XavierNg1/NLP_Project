 This product may contain a brush that you can use to clean your jewelry. If not, you can use a clean cotton cloth or towel. Dip a corner of the cloth into the liquid jewelry cleaner, and then apply the damp cloth to your Black Hills Gold piece. If the jewelry has sticky or oily residue on it, you may need to dip a soft toothbrush into the jewelry cleaner, and gently brush to clean the surface of the jewelry.You should be able to find a suitable jewelry cleaner at any local grocery store or drug store. If you can’t find the product, you may need to check at a hobby store or a jewelry store, which will certainly have a cleaner solution for sale.
 If you’d rather not go to the trouble of scrubbing your jewelry with a toothbrush or cloth, you can simply immerse it in boiling water. Heat a saucepan full of water on your stove, and, once it’s boiling, gently immerse your jewelry into the water and let it boil for about 15 minutes.The boiling water will clean grease and oil from the jewelry.


When removing the jewelry, be careful not to burn your fingers. Either let the water cool before grabbing the jewelry, or use a spoon to fish out the jewelry.
Once the Black Hills Gold is cool enough to touch, use a clean, dry cloth to blot it clean.
 Rubbing alcohol is an effective substance to clean jewelry with, including Black Hills Gold. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cotton cloth, and use this to wipe clean any spots of dirt or grease on your jewelry. As always, when cleaning any jewelry, be careful not to scratch or damage the gold.However, if your Black Hills Gold jewelry contains gemstones that are attached with glue, you should avoid cleaning it with alcohol. The alcohol will corrode the glue, and may result in the gemstones falling out.

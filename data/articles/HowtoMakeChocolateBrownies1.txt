 Set the oven rack to the middle position, and heat the oven to 350ºF (180°C).


Grease the baking dish, making sure to get all the corners.;
, In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt

, In a medium-sized saucepan or double boiler, slowly melt the chopped chocolate and butter until thoroughly combined. Stir occasionally. When done, remove from heat.
 Whisk the sugar a few tablespoons at a time into the chocolate mixture until combined. Then whisk in dry ingredients.
 Whisk well, and then add the vanilla. Whisk until the batter is thoroughly combined, then pour into the greased baking dish.
 Test for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. If it comes out with batter, it's not done yet. If it comes out dry, take it out. Ideally, you want to have some crumb attached to the toothpick so your brownies will be just right! The outsides will be crisp with the insides remaining sticky.
 Top with confectioner's sugar and toasted nuts if desired.

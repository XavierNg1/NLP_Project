 Add the liquid to the bottom of the blender first when making smoothies. This helps everything mix faster. Add a quarter cup of your almond milk to start., You can then layer the remaining ingredients. It does not matter which order you add them, but your smoothie will mix easier if you layer powder-like ingredients on the bottom, followed by fresh fruit, and then frozen fruit. Therefore, try adding the rolled oats and Chia seeds, followed by the dates, and then top everything off with frozen blueberries., Pour the other quarter cup of almond milk on top of the smoothie. Blend your ingredients together until you have a smooth, even consistency. You can then pour your smoothie into a bowl and enjoy.

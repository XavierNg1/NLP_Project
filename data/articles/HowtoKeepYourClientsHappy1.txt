 Take a few extra days or weeks to get information, ask and answer questions and set up a meaningful plan. Creating a thorough plan will help you to avoid problems in execution of a service or contract.;
, Be honest about the products you can provide, without hyperbole. People often suggest that you under-promise in order to give the appearance of value if you provide more than what was expected.
 You probably don't have the time and money to over-deliver on projects by a large margin; however, it is all about creating value. Deliver a little bit more so that your client feels they get something free or extra with their dollar.
 Setting a deadline is effectively making a promise. If possible, set your personal delivery deadline to a day or 2 before the deadline, in case of unforeseen problems.


Assume that late work will cost your client money, when they have to delay plans. This extra cost brings down the value of your product. It is likely to come up when they reevaluate your business relationship.
 If you are in need of clients, you may feel as if you can adjust your services slightly to provide them a good product. Be honest and do not accept a contract if you will not fulfill their needs, because you may be creating an unsatisfied customer from the beginning.
 Ultimately, the customer will come back if your service was successful for them. Ask the client how their business initiative turned out and if there are any changes they would make next time.


Following up and getting facts about your service will help you to catch any frustrations or unhappiness that a client may feel uncomfortable about calling you and telling you. Customers often change who they work with because of seemingly small frustrations that were never addressed. Some businesses conduct surveys, but you may want to take a more personal approach with big accounts.

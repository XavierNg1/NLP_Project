 In the 1800s, naval officers would salute by raising their cap or by touching the brim of their cap with their index finger and thumb. This became the standard Navy salute, done with the right hand. The salute was done with the hand at a diagonal to prevent exposing the palm, as naval officers did not want to show their tar-stained hands to their superiors.In the Navy, officers can salute with their left hand if their right hand is engaged or occupied.
 Make sure your forearm and hand stay in a straight line. Tilt your hand so your palm does not show as you salute. Keep your hand to the side of your face, just below your cap., The word “salute” means to offer a salutation or a greeting. In the military, you must show respect by saluting your superiors, and your superiors must reciprocate by saluting you.If you are not sure who is your superior officer based on your rank, you can use this chart here to determine who you should be saluting in the Navy. For example, in the Navy, a Petty Officer will always salute a Lieutenant.

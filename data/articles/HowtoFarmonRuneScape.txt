 Using your tool belt is the most effective way to use the most common farming tools, such as a rake, seed dibber, and spade. Once you add something to your tool belt, it can not be removed.;
, There are several ways to do this, depending on the kind of seeds you want. Many mid to high leveled monsters drop higher seeds (for example herbs) while the lowest kinds (such as potatoes) can be gained from seed shops. Thieving master farmers or simply buying them at the Grand Exchange are always a great deal.
 Know that most of the allotment patches are located on the outside perimeter of flower and herb patches. Special patches, wood trees, and fruit trees have their own locations around the RuneScape world.
, Using compost ensures a lower chance of your patch getting a disease (or dying). Super compost also ensures a higher harvest probability. When you apply the compost on a patch, the bucket will become empty in your inventory.
 It may take 1 seed (herb) to 4 seeds (hops) to successful plant an item.
 While all herbs takes an average of 80 minutes to harvest and fruit trees takes an average of 16 hours to grow, many other kinds of items has different times.


If you are worried of missing to harvest something, look for items that you can pay farmers to look after them. You do need to pay them a specific item in return, but it can be worth the time.

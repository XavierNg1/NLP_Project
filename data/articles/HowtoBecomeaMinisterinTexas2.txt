 There are many options to choose from when deciding where to obtain online ordination. Decide whether you want to associate with and fulfill rules and regulations of a religiously affiliated organization or to have no affiliation. Some organizations offer free online ordination, while others charge one-time or recurring fees. Some provide certificates of ordination, materials to assist in ceremonies, or manuals to help get you started. Choose what will suit you best.
 Most applications are short and quick to complete. You will need to provide some basic information, such as your name, address, and email address. Some applications may ask about your reasons for becoming a minister.
 Be sure to receive confirmation, as this will enable you to perform duties of a minister. Some organizations will send a certificate to you, either by mail or through email to confirm your ordination as a minister. While the state of Texas will not require any documentation, some county clerks may ask for proof of ordination. A certificate should be sufficient.

Stir in the chocolate, butter, orange zest, and liqueur, and then set the mixture aside for three minutes.There are a few orange liqueurs you can use for this recipe, including orange curacao, Grand Marnier, and Cointreau.
 After three minutes, whisk the mixture until the chocolate is fully melted and all the ingredients are incorporated. Transfer the ganache to the fridge and let it chill.


Let the ganache cool in the fridge for at least 40 minutes. Stir it a few times during the chilling process., When you're ready to use the ganache, transfer it to a mixing bowl and beat it with electric beaters. Only beat for one to two minutes, until the ganache becomes light and fluffy.Ganache is a great frosting for cookies, cakes, and muffins, but it can also be used as a filling for doughnuts, truffles, and other desserts.

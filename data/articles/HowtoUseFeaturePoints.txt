Once the two minutes are up, you can close the app and return to Feature Points to download another app.

Make sure that you are connected to WiFi, if possible. Downloading a lot of apps with your data plan can max out your data very quickly.
Feel free to delete apps from your device after you've earned your points. At a certain point, you will fill up your device memory if you keep downloading new apps without deleting the old apps.
 Once you've earned a few hundred points, navigate to the Rewards section of the app to browse your options. Bear in mind that you will need a few thousand points, at least, to reach even a $5 PayPal deposit.

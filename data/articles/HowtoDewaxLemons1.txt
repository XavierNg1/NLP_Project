 Fill a kettle halfway with water and bring the water to a boil on the stove.


You could use a small saucepan instead of a kettle. Fill the saucepan halfway with water and boil it on the stove over high heat.
If necessary, you could use hot tap water instead of boiled water. Make sure that the tap water is as hot as possible before pouring it over the lemons.;
, As the water is heating up, arrange the lemons in a colander, keeping them in a single layer. Place the colander in your kitchen sink.


It's best to work with only a few lemons at a time so that they can move around freely in the bottom of the colander. If you pile the lemons together, less of the peel will be visible, making it more difficult for the hot water to come into contact with the wax.
 Once the water in your kettle reaches a boil, pour it over the lemons in your colander.The heat of the water will partially melt the wax, loosening it from the peel and making it easier to strip away.
 Use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the outer peel of each lemon. Hold the lemon under cool, running water as you scrub.


Scrub the lemons one at a time.
It is important to use cold water. The boiling water heated the lemon peel, and the cold water quickly drops it back down to a more suitable temperature.
Avoid using a brush or scrubbing sponge used for dishes. Soap residue inside the brush could get onto the fruit and contaminate the peel.
 Give each lemon a final rinse to remove any additional wax residue.


Lightly scrub the peel with your fingers during this step.
 Gently wipe the outside of each lemon with a clean paper towel to dry the peel.


You could also allow the lemons to air dry on your kitchen counter instead of using paper towels.
Only store dewaxed lemons after they have been thoroughly dry.

 Set the antivirus application you’re using to block websites that shows pornographic contents. If you’re connected to a smaller network, contact your network administrator so they can restrict access to such sites.
 Speak with the members of your household who could or potentially be viewing pornographic websites. Explain to them the negative effects of opening such kinds of contents on the internet.


Remember that sometimes, the toughest problems can be solved or prevented with a proper discussion.
 If you’re aware of any online pornographic activities, such as cyber prostitution, in your area, alert your local authorities so they can take the proper actions and respond promptly to the issue at hand.

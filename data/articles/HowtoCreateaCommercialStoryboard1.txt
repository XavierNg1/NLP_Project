 The title area of your storyboard should contain your intended topic or general idea of the commercial.;
, Each of your frames should be given its own unique name or number. Most storyboards follow a format similar to "t6m2s5," which stands for topic 6, module 2, section 5.
 Provide explicit details and your vision behind what should happen in each frame, such as "John throws ball at Cindy."

, Explain what the camera should be doing for each particular frame, such as "Camera follows John as he walks 4 steps to the left."

, For each frame in the commercial storyboard, write out the intended dialogue, such as "John: Our company is innovative and will get the job done."

, For each frame, add details surrounding any extra audio you want to include, such as sound effects and background music.
 If there are to be any visual effects you need to add after filming your commercial, include them in that frame. For example, if your character is talking about the world, mention in your storyboard that a picture of a globe should be turning around in the corner of the screen.

 Intestinal parasites can make puppies sick and make it harder for them to gain weight and grow into healthy adults. To prevent these parasites from causing disease, have your vet deworm your puppies at two, four, six, and eight weeks of age. Then, give your puppies a monthly preventive that protects against heartworm disease and intestinal parasites.A deworming medication kills the intestinal parasites.
Give the monthly preventative year-round to give your puppies full protection from diseases caused by worms.
 By being orphaned, your newborn puppies may not receive enough passive immunity to be fully protected from disease. Your vet may recommend starting your puppies’ vaccinations earlier than usual to make up for the lack of immunity.Healthy puppies that have nursed well usually start their series of vaccinations between 6 and 8 weeks of age.Your vet will recommend how early your orphaned puppies should start receiving their vaccinations.
 Orphaned newborn puppies are at higher risk for sickness because of their lack of passive immunity. For this reason, you should keep your orphaned newborn puppies inside and away from other dogs that could make them sick.If you have other dogs in your home, keep them away from the orphaned puppies until the puppies are vaccinated.
Keeping the puppies inside will prevent them from being exposed to feces of other dogs. These feces could contain parasites that would sicken the puppies.
 The color of a newborn puppy’s feces can indicate whether the puppy is healthy or not. After you stimulate each puppy to defecate after a meal, look at the color of the feces. The feces should be brown and partially formed. If the feces are green, the puppy likely has an infection.Contact your vet if you see green feces. Your puppy will need to be treated for the infection.

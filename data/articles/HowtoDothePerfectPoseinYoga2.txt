 There are three basic options for how to hold your hands:


Rest your hands on your thighs. Palms can be facing up or down.
Put your palms together over your heart center in the prayer position.
Rest your hands palms up on your knees. Make a circle with each index finger and thumb.
 Imagine that your spine is connected to a thread that is being pulled up from the crown of your head.
 Hold the pose for one minute.
 Slowly lie down and close your eyes. Rest there for up to five minutes.

 The only consideration here will be temperature. Many seeds, especially smaller ones, will need higher temperatures. So if you can't provide the heat necessary for that seed, you might not be successful in the germination.;
, Make sure to get the seeds to stick to the sponge so they get moist. Paper towels work best because you can see through them to monitor growth.
 It's best to make it possible to see the seeds inside without opening it so you don't have to spend extra time each day opening this up.
 A smaller bag/container is better really, so the moisture stays on the seeds and seed retrieval will be less difficult.
 Consider labeling with the exact type of the plant and not just "tomato". If you end up with a fruit you don't like the taste of, you will want to know which type it was.
 Direct sun can be used, but only if the seeds are covered. Sun will cause the seed to act like it's not in the ground and stop it from growing. Left too long like this and the seeds could die. You can wrap them inside the towel to simulate being in the ground. You can use indirect sunlight or some other heat source. Best to place them indoors as this will keep them at a moderate temperature (not too hot or cold) at all times. Note: seeds don't need sun, just heat and water. Their plants need sun. So, placing them on a heater or some warm source is okay too, but creating a fire hazard should be avoided at all cost.
 The best thing to do is put them somewhere you will see them regularly. You must take them out of the bag/container soon after they sprout or they may die off.
 Since these seeds are just babies they will adapt to just about anything as long as it's not too harsh. Don't forget to do research if you plan to do hydroponics. Wicking gardens are about the same as regular dirt gardening, but there is some caution as these may contain too much water for the plant.

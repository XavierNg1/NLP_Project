 Range hoods can be made from a variety of materials. When choosing what to clean with, pick a cleaner that's safe to use on that material in order to avoid damaging it. For instance:


For plastic or vinyl hoods, use an all-purpose cleaner or warm soapy water.For stainless steel, go with warm soapy water.For copper, use copper cleaner.;
, Expect the hood’s exterior to be a pretty easy job since it’s aimed away from your stovetop. Simply spray it with your cleaner. Follow the cleaner's directions if it advises letting it sit for any length of time before wiping it off., Wipe it down with a dry, clean cloth or paper towels. Remove all traces of the cleaner. If the hood's material has an obvious grain, wipe with the grain for a more effective clean and polish.

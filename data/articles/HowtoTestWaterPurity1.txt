Water purity test kits typically cost less than $40.
Test kits are not difficult to read. For the test itself, you'll dip test strips into your water. Your kit will come with a chart that will help you read the test strips and determine what is in your water. Not only will you be able to see what kinds of contaminates may be in your water, you will also be able to see if they are present in safe or dangerous levels. Based on the results of your test kit, you may want to purchase a water filtering system for your home or call your water utility for other options on purifying your water.

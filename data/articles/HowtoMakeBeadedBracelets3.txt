 Memory wire is a coiled metal wire the maintains, or remembers, its circular shape. This material, which is similar in appearance to a slinky, is the perfect material for creating beaded cuff bracelets. Use a pair of wire cutters to cut 10 circles of memory wire. Cut one of the ten wire circles in half., To prevent the beads from falling off the memory wire, you must twist one end of each metal circle inward. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend one end of a wire circle inwards. The bent end will form a 1 cm loop. Repeat this process on the remaining eight circles and each half circle., For this project, you will need three different colors of Hama, or Perler, beads. String three metal circles with the first color (color A) of beads, three metal circles with the second color (color B) of beads, and three metal circles with the third color (color C) of beads. Leave one centimeter of the wire uncovered. Close the other end of the circle by creating a small inward loop with your needle nose pliers., Stack the metal circles on top of each other in the following order: Color A, Color A, Color A, Color B, Color B, Color B, Color C, Color C, Color C. Pass one of the two wire semi-circles through the enclosure loops found on the left ends of the wire circles. Trim the semi circle approximately 1 centimeter away from the beaded circles. Use the needle nose pliers to create a small inward enclosure loop., Each set of three like-colored beaded loops forms one strand. Plait the strands in a traditional 3-strand braid:


Pass Color C over Color B.
Pass Color A over Color C.
Pass Color B over Color A.
Pass Color C over Color B.

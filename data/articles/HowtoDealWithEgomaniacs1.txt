 You do not need to constantly engage with this person. The situation can be tricky when the egomaniac is your colleague, but by remaining calm and diplomatic, you can stay reasonable and active.


When you feel an avalanche of self-praise coming on, subtly stop the conversation by avoiding eye contact, withdrawing verbal affirmation, and acting disinterested or bored.;
, Remember, just because the egomaniac claims (s)he can walk on water, that doesn’t mean it’s true. You will have an easier time dealing with their self-apprasal if you remind yourself that you are capable and successful.


If your boss is the egotist, (s)he will probably have a hard time giving you the support and encouragement you need, so look elsewhere for a mentor., The egomaniac is actually very insecure and craves affirmation and attention. Don’t be the person (s)he relies on for proof of their worth. Instead make a slight pitiful pat on the shoulder, let them know its okay, this should take them a step back and confirm your confidence.
 When confronted with another person’s constant assertion of self-worth, your own insecurities or pride can get the best of you. Is this person really worth your time and energy?


Don’t let them lure you into an argument or long-winded conversation about their latest deeds., If you are the boss, and one of your employees is the egomaniac, offering your subordinate options might mitigate their need to assert herself or challenge you. Focus on the positive, and keep them focused on solutions.


You might try killing them with kindness, so to speak. Strategic use of praise and compliments can be a great motivator for a narcissistic employee.

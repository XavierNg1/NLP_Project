 Canned vegetables are generally high in sodium. To cut the salt from these, buy canned vegetables that say “no salt added” on the label. That ensures you are getting the vegetable without added salt.If you want a little bit of salt to taste, you can add a small amount of salt when you put the food on the plate.
Consider cooking your vegetables with spices and herbs to eliminate the need for added salt. For example, try adding rosemary and thyme to green beans or ginger and sage to carrots.;
, Many sauces, such as pasta sauces, have a lot of added sodium. Most brands offer a sodium free option. If you can’t find sodium free, you may find a reduced sodium option.Make sure to check the serving size. Reduced sodium varieties may not be low in sodium if the serving size is smaller than what you would eat.
 Canned beans are full of unnecessary salt. However, beans are a really healthy food. To get away from this, try dried beans. This will give you the benefits without added sodium.Dried beans take longer to cook, so cook enough for multiple servings for the week.
 Many grain items may be full of sodium and other unhealthy additives, especially if you buy flavored varieties. Replace these sodium-heavy versions with plain, whole grains that are relatively salt free.For example, instant oatmeal not only contains added sodium, but sugar as well. Plain, steel cut oats are a healthier option.
When buying cereal, look for brands that have whole grains as the first ingredient. Make sure to buy a brand with a low sodium content.
Try whole grain pasta, brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, and bulgur.
 Condiments are pantry staples, but they can be loaded with salt. Read the labels carefully and compare brands and types before buying. If available, get a reduced sodium, low-sodium, or no-sodium added variety.Condiments may include ketchup, mustard, dressing, olives, pickles, relish, dips, and soy sauce.
Consider leaving the condiments off your food completely.

 If you do not have an existing fence to attach the gate to, you will need to build one, as fence posts are necessary for installing a fence.;
, If you do not already have fence posts in place, you will need posts in order to install a gate. Make small indentations in the ground with your trowel.
 Before any digging takes place, call a utility location service to locate pipes, cables, and other underground hazards. You can call the toll-free number "811" for this service from anywhere in the US and Canada.
 If the fence is not yet built, you can build it in an "H-brace" style, with single crossbeams and horizontal tensioned wires connecting the posts. For the gate posts, use posts 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the other fence posts, and attach them to the nearest fence post using a tensioned wire strung diagonally from the bottom of the gate post to the top of the other post., If you are not building an H-brace fence, you can reinforce the gate posts with a concrete base instead. Begin by digging a trench 12" (30 cm) wide across the gate opening, and at least 18" (46 cm) deep.
 Place the two gate posts in opposite ends of the trench. Plumb them with a bubble level to make sure they are as vertical as possible. Brace them in place by nailing two angled 2 x 4s onto adjacent sides of each post, stabilizing them against the ground., For additional stability, you can lay pressure treated 2" x 4" boards across the entire length of the trench base. Nail them to the sides of the two posts.
 A fast-setting concrete mix or any basic Portland cement mix will do. You'll need roughly one bag per post.
 Cover the entire base of the trench with a layer of concrete 4–6" (10–15 cm) deep.
 Wait at least 24 hours for the concrete to cure, or as directed on the bag.
 Pour gravel to ground level to further reinforce the posts.

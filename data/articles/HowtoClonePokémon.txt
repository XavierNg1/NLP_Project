 You will need two separate 3DS's and they will need to both be in front of you.


Of course, if you're trying this with an earlier game, you'll need a regular DS instead.;
, You'll need the Pokémon that you want to clone but you'll also want to have a Pokémon that you're okay with losing forever. One Pokémon will be deleted in this process.


From now on, we'll call the DS containing the desired Pokémon DS1 and the DS with the throwaway Pokémon DS2.
 Start the trade on the DS that has the Pokémon you don't want to clone. Set the trade up as normal.
 Once the trade is started, you can leave DS2 alone. All you're worried about now is DS1.
 You'll want to carefully count or use a stopwatch to measure 4 seconds after the blue screen starts (with the message "Communicating. Please stand by." on the lower screen). Once that time has passed, turn off DS1 to interrupt the trade You do not have to turn it fully off. Just get to the gray, "In Sleep Mode the system can..." screen.


Look for a black screen and error on DS2. If you see a black screen and error message on DS2, then that means the clone likely worked.
 Press the home button and restart the game on DS1. You will also want to restart DS2.
 You should now have a clone of the DS1 Pokémon on your DS2.
 This is a very tricky glitch and it takes time to get it right. Don't be discouraged! Just keep trying until you get it to work!

, The alternate method is to hack the GTS, but this is complicated, can ruin your 3/DS, and makes Pokémon that are easily recognizable as fakes at competitions. However, you can use this method if you really want to.

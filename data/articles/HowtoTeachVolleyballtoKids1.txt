 Have them place one hand flat, place their other hand underneath that hand, and curl in their thumbs to the middle of their hands. Their forearms should form a flat surface, which is where the ball will be hit.Alternately, they can make a fist with their left hand and then cover the fist with their right hand so that their thumbs line up on top.
They should never interlock their fingers because it is dangerous and they could end up with a broken finger.;
, They should stand with their feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart and their knees bent. Have them practice squatting as if they were sitting in a chair.They should be light on their feet so that they can move and get to any ball. To help develop this agility, you can have them shuffle laterally from one side of the court to the other.
 The kids can stand in pairs and practice throwing the ball to one another. The ball should be thrown underhand to the other kidâ€™s arms. The ball will be hit with their forearms back to the other kid. This is known as bumping the ball. Have them do this until they get used to the feel of hitting the ball on the proper surface.


One kid can hit the ball 10 times and then the other can hit the ball 10 times.
 You can then start moving around and making fun games out of it. For example, the ball can be thrown towards alternating sides of the child instead of directly at their arms. You could give them a point each time the child who threw the ball is able to catch the ball that was hit back towards them. The team with the most points at the end of a minute wins!

 When you're with your soul mate, you are intensely attracted to each other. Do you look forward to your time together and miss each other when you’re apart? Do you catch him looking at you even when you’re not trying? Do you find yourself staring at him? And chemistry is not just physical attraction:


It’s the way he moves—the way he carries himself, his mannerisms, the goofy way he dances when he thinks no one’s watching.
It’s the way he interacts with other people—the way he jokes with his friends, the way he plays with your dog, the way he takes his niece out for ice cream.
It’s the sound of his voice—the way he laughs and the little catch-phrases he uses all the time. ;
, When you're with your soul mate, you just click. You don’t have to tell him that you’re tired and want to stay in for the night—he can see it on your face. And you can tell when he’s tired too. How in tune are you with with each other’s body language and moods? This natural harmony makes being together feel “right.” Remember that understanding each other's moods and needs doesn’t mean that you always feel the same way about everything. It just means that you have a deep empathy for each other and place a high value on each other's feelings.
 How complementary are your desires? Do you have similar libidos? If you're with your soul mate, he should know what you like and you should know what he likes, and you should enjoy doing those things together. Don’t assume that you will naturally come together sexually—many people are nervous trying new things in the bedroom. Communicate your desires to each other. If you're not satisfied, let him know what you want him to do. You’ll never know if you’re really compatible if you’re not open with each other. Don't worry if sex isn’t a priority in your relationship, as long as it’s not a priority for either of you, and as long as when it does happen, you both feel fulfilled.

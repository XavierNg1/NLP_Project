 Your Channel page is where your viewers will be spending their time, viewing your videos and posting comments. Your Channel should reflect your content, and a professional-looking Channel will help entice viewers to stay.


Open your Channel page by clicking the menu button in the upper-left corner of the YouTube page and select "My Channel".
 This will be seen every time you post and next to each of your uploaded videos. You will be taken to Google+ to add the photo there. Changes will then be reflected on your YouTube Channel page.
 Your channel has a banner that appears at the top of the page, and can be seen whether the viewer is on PC or a mobile device. This banner is essential for your Channel's branding, and can really help you to stand out.


You can add channel art from images uploaded to your Google+ page, or you can upload pictures directly from your computer.
 Your Channel's description appears in the YouTube search results, and allows viewers to quickly get a feel for what your Channel offers. A good description can help draw in viewers, but a misleading description will drive them away.
 You can add links to the About section of your Channel. These links allow viewers to easily access your other pages on the internet. Use these links to direct viewers to you other sites or online store.

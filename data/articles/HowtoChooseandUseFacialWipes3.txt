 Although facial wipes are convenient, they shouldn't replace your regular cleansing routine. Washing your face with water and a cleanser is the most effective way to clean your skin and remove makeup.

They can also cause your skin to dry out as a result of the chemicals contained within them.Continue your regular skincare routine and only supplement with face wipes on occasion.
Try to avoid using face wipes for more than three days in a row., Facial wipes can be a great substitute for a full face wash when you are unable to properly wash your face with water and cleanser. For example, if you are camping or hiking, face wipes allow you to remove some dirt and grime from your face when running water is not available. You may also find that using a facial wipe after the gym, when you donâ€™t have your regular facial cleanser on hand, is a great way to remove sweat.If you are unable to wash your face with water, then it is always best to use a wipe instead of neglecting your skin completely.
 You should always remove makeup from your skin before going to bed because it can clog your pores and cause acne. If you are too tired to perform your regular nightly cleansing routine, then you can use a face wipe to remove your makeup before falling asleep. This should not become a regular habit, but it is best to remove your makeup using a face wipe, rather than doing nothing at all.

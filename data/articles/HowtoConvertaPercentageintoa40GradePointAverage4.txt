 Weighted GPA is the idea that some harder classes, like honors or AP, should be weighted to reflect an extra degree of difficulty. So, instead of the traditional 4.0 grade scale, a weighted scale can go as high as 5.0, reflecting a harder course load. The idea is that getting a "C" in AP Algebra is just as hard as getting a "B" in regular Algebra.
 This time, use the same table as above, except add 1 point to each grade that you got in an honors or AP class. Here is what the scaling system usually looks like:


A = 5
A- = 4.7
B+ = 4.3
B = 4
B- = 3.7
C+ = 3.3
C = 3.0
C- = 2.7
D+ = 2.3
D = 2
D- = 1.7
F = 1

, Add up the numerical scores assigned to each of your grades. For the sake of example, say you took AP English (C), Honors History (B), Math (B), AP Chemistry (C+), Music Theory (B-), and Honors Art (A-). That would mean you'd have: 3 + 4 + 3 + 3.3 + 2.7 + 4.7 = 20.7.
 Again, you're just finding the average score. This will give you your final GPA score on a 5.0 scale. Note that you can only receive a 5.0 GPA if all of your classes are honors or AP and you receive an "A" in each class. Many students are required to take classes without extra degrees of difficulty, such as gym.


In our example, we added up our numbers to get 20.7. Since we took six classes, we have to divide 20.7 by six. 20.7 รท 6 = 3.45 (or 3.5).

 Try not to get metal or paper boxes. You need a box big enough to put your fish in, but light enough to carry out, because there will also be the added weight of the water.


If you have Betta fish, or multiple aggressive fish, it would be best to get a box with small dividers. Remember, at the point when you have to carry the fish out, it's best to have one you can carry. At that point, you want the smallest box possible.;
, Quickly take your jar and take the fish out, and put them in the box.
 When your house is breaking apart, the fish can handle the stress.

 Start with a letter-sized piece of paper and trim a strip a half inch wide. Lay it flat, vertically, on a table in front of you.


Avoid thinner paper like gift wrap or wax paper as this method will require a bit more handling of the star.
 At the top of the strip, make a knot by creating a loop and drawing the end through; only devote the last inch or two of the strip to this knot. Measure first with a ruler before knotting. Make the loop by curling the strip behind itself, pass over the front to the right and around the back and through the loop made.


Tighten (gently) and leave only about a ¼-inch tag out of the loop. Once the knot is made, flatten it gently with your hand.
Once done, tuck the tag end into the pocket formed by the knot. This should form a small pentagon at the end of the strip.
 First fold the strip over the edge of the pentagon which it meets. The result should be a smaller strip with the same pentagon atop it. After every fold, a different edge of the pentagon will meet the strip.


Continuing folding in this way until there’s only a short bit left, about ½ an inch. Tuck this short strip into one of the creases of the pentagon.
 Using your thumb and index finger, pinch each of the five corners of the pentagon. These will narrow the edges into points, creating your “lucky star.” Once all the corners are pinched, you should have your star.

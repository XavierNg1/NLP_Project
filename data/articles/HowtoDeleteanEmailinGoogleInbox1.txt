 While the traditional Gmail app has an obvious trash can button for deletions, Google Inbox doesn't. Google's aim here seems to be that you keep all your emails and reminders either pinned in your inbox, snoozed, or marked done.


Since most people find they don't run out of storage in Gmail, you may just want to abandon your deletion habits and mark any email you want to get rid of "done," instead.

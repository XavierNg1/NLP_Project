 Before you begin to work on your relationship, you’ll need to decide what your end goal is. Then you’ll need to determine if what you want is realistic. Attempting to have a relationship or need fulfilled that is essentially impossible will only cause heartache and frustration for you.


If your parents treat you badly, and have always treated you badly, expecting them to perform a full 180 is likely futile. Wanting them to simply not criticize you constantly or be respectful of your life choices is a more attainable goal., If you’re already at your breaking point and can’t see your relationship getting any worse than it already is, having low expectations for your parents’ change is where you should start. Preparing yourself for the worst can stop additional hurt from occurring. If your parents actually do more than you expect, you may be pleasantly surprised.


For example, if you just want to spend more time with your parents, set a goal of one extra visit per month. Starting off small won’t be such a disappointment if your parents don’t follow through with their promises., The truth is, you’re not going to change your parents. Attempting to try to change them, the past, and anything else will likely only make the situation worse. Instead, accept the small improvements that may occur, or simply accept that nothing is going to happen. At least you know you tried.

 To do this fun self freezing trick, you need a 20 ounce plastic bottle of room temperature soda. It is important that your soda is room temperature, not chilled.
 Shake the bottle of soda violently to create pressure. You want as much pressure as possible to build up in the bottle.
 Lay the bottle down on its side. Freeze the bottle for about 3 hours and 15 minutes. You want the temperature of the soda to be below the freezing point, but not actually frozen yet. The soda will still look like a regular soda., There are two ways to serve your magic icee. You can create the icee inside the soda bottle or by using a frozen bowl.


To create the icee in the bottle, open the cap a little to release some of the pressure and then quickly close it again. Quickly flip the bottle upside down and back up again. It will instantly become a frozen slushie. You can then squeeze the icee out into a cup or a bowl and serve. To make the icee a bit smoother, add a little refrigerated soda to the cup or bowl.
To use a frozen bowl to make your slushie, you need a bowl that has been in the freezer. A metal, or stainless steel bowl will work best. Pour your soda into the bowl and it will instantly turn from liquid soda to slushie! Your friends will be amazed! Serve with a spoon and straw.

Dig a hole around the base of the pole that is 8" to 12" in diameter. Dig until you reach the bottom of the pole.
Examine the hole to determine whether the fence post was set in dirt or concrete.
Pound the post further into the ground using a sledgehammer if the post was set in concrete. The distance between the old concrete foundation and the ground should be about 6".
Pour concrete into the hole. The concrete should come slightly above ground level.
Shape the surface of the concrete using a trowel so that the surface angles down from the fence post. This will allow rainwater to run away from the base of the post and will prevent rot.



Dig a hole next to the rotten post. Determine whether the post is salvageable or if the post needs to be replaced because of extensive rot.
Insert a shorter post into the ground next to the damaged post if the post does not have significant damage.
Bolt the posts together, making sure that the bolts are secured to solid wood.
Saturate the rotted area with a wood preservative to keep the rot from spreading.



Remove all of the nails that attach the stringers to the damaged post.
Swing the sections of the fence at least two feet away from the damaged post.
Prop the free sections of the fence on wood blocks to ensure that they do not pull away from other undamaged posts.
Remove the rotten post. Lift carefully, particularly if the post was set in concrete. Posts set in concrete can weigh 100 pounds (45 kg) or more. Discard the post.
Insert the new fence post into the hole.
Pour concrete around the base of the pole until the concrete is slightly above ground level.
Shape the surface of the concrete using a trowel so that the surface angles down from the fence post. This will allow rainwater to run away from the base of the post and will prevent rot.

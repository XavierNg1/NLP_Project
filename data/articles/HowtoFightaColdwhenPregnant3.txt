 Before taking any over-the-counter medications to relieve your symptoms, always consult your doctor. Your doctor will know which medications are safe to use and which ones are not. Your doctor will also be able to prescribe medications based on your individual case.Also, call your doctor if your symptoms including shortness of breath, chills or back, neck or abdominal pain persist or worsen, or if you develop a fever that is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius) or higher.
 NSAIDs like aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) should be avoided. These pain relievers and fever reducers may interfere with your babyâ€™s development in the early stages, as well as cause labor complications.Instead, opt for acetaminophen, like Tylenol, if you have a fever, headache, or body aches. Be sure to consult your doctor prior to taking any over the counter medication, though, to make sure the medication and the dose are safe and appropriate.
 These medications come in a variety of forms, for example, nasal sprays or drops and oral medications. Before using these, speak with your doctor. Nose sprays and drops are generally ok, but use caution, and do not over use them.If your congestion is severe, then use a nasal spray before you sleep.
 Cough suppressants like cough drops, Robitussin, and cough medications that contain dextromethorphan are generally ok to use. Again, speak with your doctor before using these medications.Sometimes doctors will prescribe a combination of cough suppressants, like cough drops and Robitussin, for very stubborn coughs.

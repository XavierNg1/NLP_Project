 If your jurisdiction allows this, the form will be located with the office that issues forms to create or register a domestic partnership or civil union, often a clerk of courts or the county recorder.
 This form will likely be a sworn statement. You will likely:


Swear you are terminating the partnership
Swear you have provided a copy of the form to your partner
Be required to attach documents that prove this notification
Be required to sign it in front of a notary.
 Your form will likely be filed at the same office in which you obtained the form. Most jurisdictions require you pay a filing fee at the time of terminating your domestic partnership or civil union.

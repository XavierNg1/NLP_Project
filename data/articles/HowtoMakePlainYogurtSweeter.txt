 This is a healthy way to sweeten the yogurt. You can mix it only slightly to give the yogurt a swirly touch, or you can mix thoroughly. Taste it, and, if you wish, add more. Remember: you can always add more honey, but you can never take away honey.
 This is actually not less healthy than adding honey. It is usually less natural, however, and you can't make swirls using them. Instead, sprinkle some on your yogurt, give it a mix, and taste. You can add more if you wish. The same goes for sugar, too. You can't take away the sugar you've put into it., Berries, cantaloupe, and mangos work well, as well as other soft fruit. Demolish the fruit into little bits, or just place them into the yogurt. Large fruits, such as cantaloupe and mangos, will need to be cut into bite-size pieces. Choose sweet, juicy fruit, although other types of fruit will still work. Dried fruit, like raisins or craisins, work well also., Jam surprisingly also works very well. Some people like taking out the little tidbits of fruit in them, but some people enjoy the contrast of texture. You may also mix it in swirls, or mix it thoroughly, just like honey., All types of chocolate can be added: dark chocolate or light chocolate or melted chocolate. Make sure they are all crushed into bite-size pieces or melted. Dark chocolate tends to be more healthy., Your additions to your plain yogurt are definitely not limited to these options. Experiment with what you add and how much you add. Apple butter, peanut butter, sun butter, granola, extracts, anything!

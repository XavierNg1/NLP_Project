 If your area has advanced warning against a hurricane, snow event, fire or other natural disaster, follow instructions.


Prepare your home and pack what you will need for at least a few days. For example, board your windows if a hurricane is expected.
 Have bottled water, batteries and non-perishable food stored in case you lose power and other resources.
, Do not go outside to explore if a weather event is occurring. Stay inside with your children and pets, and try to keep everyone calm and busy.

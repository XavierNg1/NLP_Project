 A frugal option for aging wine without a cellar is by finding a room in your home that approximates the ideal aging conditions as closely as possible. Look for an area that is dark, cool, humid, and is not subjected to swings in temperature and humidity. Basements and closets along cold exterior walls are possible choices.
 After selecting a location, assemble several wine racks so that you can age bottles on their side. Remember that your intended consumption rate will determine how much aging space you need. Make sure the wine racks are positioned such that they do not need to be moved once in place.
 In an improvised cellar space like this, you won't generally be able to get away with aging wines for 10 or 20 years. Instead, aim for a maximum aging period of only a few years, and try to select wines that will benefit well from this short period.


As a way to test your improvised cellar's aging abilities, begin by placing 5 - 10 bottles of the same vintage wine in the cellar. At the end of each year, remove 1 bottle and drink it. This will help you determine whether your wine will continue to improve over this period, or at what point the wine will peak and begin to deteriorate.

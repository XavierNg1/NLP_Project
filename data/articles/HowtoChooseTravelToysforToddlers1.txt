 If your child has a favorite stuffed animal that they like to cozy up with each night, bring that along on your travels. Your child may feel comfortable having their favorite bunny or teddy bear nearby, or it may help them feel like they have a friend to bring along.


Be sure that the stuffed animal is small enough to easily pack in a suitcase or backpack. If your child’s favorite plush toy is an over-sized bear, you may wish to consider packing a smaller stuffed animal that your child likes.
Consider packing a small doll or action figure as well.;
, Select two or three of your toddler’s books to take with you. Choose a book that you know your toddler loves and another new, colorful book that will capture their attention. Reading to your toddler is important for establishing the foundations of basic literacy skills.If you are on a train or a plane, read the books to your toddler and let them look through the pages on their own afterward.
 Stacking cups are simple, colorful, and versatile toys that your toddler can take along. Your toddler can use their imagination and find endless games to play. They can sort them by color, use them to hold snacks, or build towers in the safety of their car seat.Nest them neatly so that they don’t take up too much space in your tot’s travel bag.
 Your toddler may have endless fun traveling with their very own transportation toys. Check to see if your toy store or department store carries age-appropriate toys shaped like airplanes, trains, cars, or trucks. If you are flying to visit a family member, you can show your little one how they are flying through the air with their very own toy airplane. If you are taking a train to visit a new city, show your toddler how the trains zoom quickly between towns.

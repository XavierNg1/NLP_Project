 This classic summertime refreshment, known as “Half & Half” in the Southern United States, is attributed to 60’s era professional golfer Arnold Palmer. Having concocted the delicious combination of iced tea and lemonade at home, he began ordering it in bars and the drink quickly caught on. A Spiked Arnold Palmer has three simple ingredients: iced tea, lemonade, and bourbon. The best ratio is 4 parts tea and 4 parts lemonade to 1 part bourbon, but the drink is very forgiving, and can be scaled up based on the size of your crowd.
 Add 5 regular tea bags to 4 cups boiling water. Let steep for 5 minutes before discarding tea bags. If you don't want to make the tea, you can buy it pre-made.
 To prepare lemonade from scratch, squeeze the juice from 8 lemons. Combine with 1 ½ cups sugar and up to 6 cups water, adjusting to your desired sweetness. Chill until you plan to serve. If you don't want to make the lemonade, buy some pre-made.
 Combine 4 cups tea, 4 cups lemonade and 1 cup bourbon in a large container. Adjust the ratios to taste.









Chill in a carafe or large pitcher and serve. Spiked Arnold Palmers are best served with lots of ice, a slice of lemon and a sprig of mint for garnish.

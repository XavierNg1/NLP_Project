, Transfer the toasted teff to a saucepan with 1 cup of water., Heat the water and teff until it boils., Turn the heat down to a simmer. Cover the pan with a lid, then cook for 10 minutes., Take the pan off the heat and set it aside for five minutes to cool. Leave the lid on., Whole teff can be served alongside a meal instead of rice or can be added to dishes like soups or stew. This form of cooked teff works well mixed into soup, sprinkled on salad or vegetables, or in other recipes which call for the teff to be whole.

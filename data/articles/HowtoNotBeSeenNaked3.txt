 It sounds weird, but when you think about it, most people only spend a few minutes a day in the buff. You can't get better or more at ease with something if you don't practice. Lock your door and add five minutes of nudity to your morning ritual.


If you're a girl who wears makeup, delay getting dressed while you apply your makeup.
Do something that makes you feel good and pampered while you're having naked time. Rub a nice-smelling lotion all over your body, brush through your hair, even close your eyes and meditate.You want to start creating a positive connection with being naked.
 Do you like to dance? Swim? Practice yoga or hike? People who exercise for fun improve their self image while improving their bodies.If you hate running, don't hit the treadmill! Try a Zumba dance class or playing a sport instead.


Focus on making your body strong and capable, and not on how it looks.
 For some, you may have to go all the way back to childhood, but try to remember a time when you weren't self-conscious about your body.Try to find a picture of yourself from that time and refer to it when you need a reminder that you don't need to be so hard on yourself.


Even if you had a rough childhood, focus on the fact that you had enough strength to survive it and get where you are today., If you're terribly self-conscious about your partner seeing you naked because you think they'll lose interest, think again. Your partner isn't checking out your stretch marks or cellulite. You partner isn't thinking you're to big or skinny. They're just psyched to be getting naked with you!


Focus on being present with your partner. Instead of tearing yourself down, allow yourself to feel and enjoy the moment.
Your partner has his or her own insecurities and imperfections, but does that stop you from loving them or wanting to be intimate with them? Try to remember how good and generous feel toward them, and imagine that they feel the same way about you.

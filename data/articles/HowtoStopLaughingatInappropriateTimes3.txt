 If a grin or chuckle slips through, quickly cover it up by putting your hand over your mouth and coughing. Move away from the crowd, even if it means stepping out of the room or going to the restrooms. If they see you are coughing, they will understand.
 Some people sound like they are laughing before they cry.


If it gets really bad, hold your nose and cover your mouth with that hand. Then people can't see your grin, and you can laugh as hard as you wish inside yourself. You may start shaking, but that's okay, it can be covered as crying. Try not to let any sound out, but if you do ease up by accident, it sounds much like a sneeze or a strange snort.
 Open your mouth wide and pretend to pick away at something stuck. Not only does it totally hide your smile, you also clean your teeth at the same time! Be careful though because the face made is funny enough to make others start laughing when they see what you're up to.
 If your friend just got insulted and the insult is funny, then you know you will have to laugh. What is found most effective is to turn it into a pity laugh. You laugh but without fully smiling, then look to the ground and either mutter under your breath or tut noticeably, then start to shake your head. This works really well!

, Ask them to say things that may cause you to laugh. If you work at it, you can master not laughing and be serious at the right times, yet funny at the right times, as well!

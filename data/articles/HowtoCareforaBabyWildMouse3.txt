 You will need some kind of enclosure to house your baby mouse. That first night, you might begin with just a shoebox containing a kitchen towel. However, if you plan to make this mouse your pet, you will need something more permanent. As a general rule, you should provide one cubic foot (30.4 cubic cm) of space for your first mouse, and an additional 0.5 cubic feet (15.24 cubic cm) of space for each additional mouse in the same cage.You must also clean the cage once a week. You may purchase one of the following at your local pet store:


Glass aquarium.
Metal cage.
Plastic cage.
 If your mouse were in the wild, it would cuddle with its mother and siblings. In your home, you need to make sure that your baby mouse stays warm.Spread wood shavings on the bottom of its cage.
Keep the cage off the ground in your home.
Keep the temperature in your home around 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).
 Mice need to exercise quite a bit, they need things to chew on, and they crave mental stimulation.As your mouse begins exploring the cage, consider providing some of the following items:


Exercise toys, like a mouse wheel or little balls with bells inside (normally sold as cat toys).
Chew toys, like paper towel rolls or egg cartons.
Foraging toys or food-hiding toys (created for birds and/or rodents).

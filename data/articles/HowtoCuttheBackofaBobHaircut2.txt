 Your vertical part should be straight down the middle of your client's head, and your horizontal part should be about one inch above the hairline.


Each side of the bottom horizontal portion should be divided equally down the center and tucked off to each side.
 The hair should be cut in natural fall. This means that you should comb the hair flat against the neck, holding it with light tension. This will help create more blended graduations.
 Take a diagonal subsection of hair from the back, and hold your hand close to the base of the scalp at a 45-degree angle. Cut the hair along the 45-degree line created by your fingers.


Cut the hair above the parietal ridge (where the skull begins to curve upwards to the top of the head) at a lower elevation.
If you are right-handed, comb the left section aside, beginning with the right half of your first section.
Left handed individuals should follow these directions in reverse, starting first with the left section and then working from the outside in.
 You will want to cut a straight line from the outside inward. Use the straight edge of your hand to maintain your cutting angle. Cross check by pulling a small piece of hair from the same spot on either side and visually checking the length.
 Do this in the same fashion described for cutting the right side. Be sure you maintain the same angle of cut on each side.
 Your next section of hair is going to be anywhere from a half to a full inch above the first section line. Make sure you are cutting methodically. Consistency is key to making your cut uniform.
 This line can be identified by connecting an imaginary line from ear-to-ear across the top of the middle of the head. Separate the back portion by directing it behind the ear. This will connect the back and side sections properly.

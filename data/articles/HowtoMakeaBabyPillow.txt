 Society tells us that stuff for baby girls must be pink, and stuff for baby boys must be blue. You can choose to abide, or use a more multi-sex color like yellow, red, or greed. Buy a roll of cheap plain fabric and the softest material (perhaps felt, not muslin) you can find with the desired color. There is the option to dye it.;
, It should be springy, not something the baby could sink their head in to. Do not go overboard with expensive stuffing; a cheap, bouncy stuffing can be purchased at most warehouses.
 Sewing with a needle and thread is enjoyable to some, while for others, it's a pain. If you do not have your own sewing machine and you would rather not do it manually, borrow a friend's. Put the sewing machine aside and take out the cheap fabric.
 It should be roughly 28 centimeter (11.0 in) by 28 centimeter (11.0 in) or 25 by 25. Iron both pieces. Leave one side unsewn, and leave yourself a 1.5mm seam allowance. Use a color thread that is the same as your outside fabric. Start sewing!

, This is your inner. Put it aside where it will not be damaged. The outer squares should be approximately 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) higher and wider than the inner. Cut out the outer squares, being careful to cut evenly; the outer is the best looking part.
 Iron both pieces. Sew it like the inner, leaving one side open for stuffing. This time leave a 20mm seam allowance. After sewing, stuff the inner into the outer via the open side but do not sew shut.
 eg. original thread color- green; change to blue. Original thread color- red; change to pink. Sew the opening shut.
 Sew those on and there you have a not-quite-finished baby pillow. Make sure to wash before giving it to somebody.
 Newborns are highly prone to illness so make sure it is free of bacteria. There you go!

The smaller triangle at one end will be the helicopter’s nose.
The bigger triangle at one end would be the compartment gate.



for the rotor bases, add two rectangles at the top of the rectangle on each opposite side. The rear rectangle should be bigger than the one in front.



Add two small circles at the lower base of the rectangle. These will be your copter’s wheels. One should be at the bottom part of the compartment and the other near the middle of the copter’s body.
Add two downward curves at the top of the rotor bases you made earlier.



Add straight lines on top of the rotor bases. Depending on the angle of the view, you might need to add 2-3 lines per rotor base.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like light bulbs, small windows and doors.
You can also add screws and metal sheets for added rugged effect.



Helicopters could go from boring gray or white to camouflage or even in bright colors. You may also want to add symbols or insignia to make your helicopters look more real.

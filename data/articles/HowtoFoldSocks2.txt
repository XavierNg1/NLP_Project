 This way of folding works very well on most socks, and it creates a much tighter and tidier fold.








Again, find a pair of clean matching socks.
Lay the socks on a flat and firm surface.
Lay one sock on top of the other and align them evenly. If you turn them to the side, it should look like you have 1 sock.
However, this time the heels should be facing up and the toes should be pointing toward you. Smooth the socks out.
 Smooth the socks again with your hand. This might be a tad tricky because the heels might be naturally protruding.









Now take hold of the toes and fold the socks again about one third of the length toward the folded cuffs. There should be a little overlap between the toes and the cuffs.
Slightly open the elastic of the top folded cuff and tuck the toes in.
Straighten the socks again. You should have a flat, square-like looking pair of folded socks.
 This method requires more practice, but it is very much worth it! It will help keep your dress socks from getting stretched or misshaped.









Fold all types of socks you have using this method.
If your sock drawers are shallow, or you use drawer dividers, this method will help keep the drawer looking neat and organized.Socks folded this way are easy to organize by color and style.

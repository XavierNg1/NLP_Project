 Try to spread your legs as far as possible without straining them.
 Your left arm should be above your head parallel to your right leg, and your right should be by your hips and parallel to your left. Try to touch your right ear to your knee.
 Only this time, use the opposite arms.
 Lean directly toward your right leg. Try to touch your nose to your knee.
, Try to 'walk' your hands in. But do not go farther than your natural ability. It should hurt a little, but you shouldn't be in excruciating pain. If you can, try to lay yourself flat on the floor.
 Stay in the same position for at least 10-15 seconds.
 Sit as straight up as you can, and lift one leg at a time off of the ground. This is probably going to be pretty painful and your leg might get cramped, but try to lift it for at least 10 seconds. It helps your toe-touch get higher.
 Your straddle may not be as spread out as it was, but just try to focus lifting your leg.
 You'll see a drastic improvement.


Try to record yourself doing toe-touches. It lets you see your mistakes better.

 Use Google Maps and find two bicycle friendly routes to your school. One should be the one you take most of the time and the second one should be a backup. If you already know a route to your school and it is possible to travel it on a bike, use it. (You should still find an alternate route in case the first route becomes obstructed or impassable.) Carry a printout of both routes while riding the bike to school.;
, If you ever get lost, you will be able to contact your parents, the school, etc. Program the appropriate numbers into it.
 It is possible for a cyclist to be issued a ticket. It is illegal almost everywhere to operate your bike on a pavement unless it is marked for that purpose. You are generally also required by law to make to appropriate hand signals when turning and stopping.
 Make sure they know the route that you will be taking as your alternate route.
 Stay safe and have fun!

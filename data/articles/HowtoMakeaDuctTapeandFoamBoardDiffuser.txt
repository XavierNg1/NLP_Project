 For this Sunpak 4000AF, it is the following:


6 cm /2 3/8 inches
3 1/2 cm/1 3/8 inches
3 cm/1 1/4 inches;
,, You will see two 12 X 17cm rectangles. This divides your larger rectangle into two halves.



Draw a line an inch from the bottom centered around the center line.
Draw another line parallel to the center line 3cm away from it on each side.

Your shape should resemble the image above.
 To do this, use the measurements you have above.


24 cm (1x)
6 cm (2x)
3 1/2 cm (2y)

,


(1x X 2y)/2x
(24 X 3.5)/6 = 84/6 = 14

, Create a rectangle shape of 14 cm x 17 cm. However, instead of 7 cm, use 4 1/2 cm on the rectangular base of the diffuser. It shouldn't be snug, hence, 1 cm has been added to the actual measurement.
 Make any required adjustments.


If they fit together properly, use them as templates. If they don't, make any necessary adjustments.
,, Be sure that it doesn't go all the way through the foam board.
 Once you are sure they fit, take them back apart.
 Either white or something like shiny duct tape so that it will help with the light. If it isn't white or 'silver', you can make it that way.
 Here, the silver duct tape is used because it was used on the inside of the diffuser.
 While it is on, put duct tape around it so that it will hold its shape.
 That will make it difficult to fit on the flash. When putting tape on the corners, split the tape at the corner, and then tape it down to each side.
 The silver duct tape was used here to allow it to double as a reflector if needed. If you wanted it to look 'more professional', you could use black, or if you wanted it 'more hip', try tie dye duct tape.
 Cut it out with a little extra of about 1/2 to 1 inch.
 You can do this with transparent tape, duct tape (carefully), or Velcro.
 Use the foam board diffuser to make great shots.

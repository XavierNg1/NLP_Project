 Throw away the vacuum bag or clean the collection container afterward to prevent re-infestation of mildew.
 Use a damp, not soaked, rag to prevent over wetting the furniture, which can damage the wood.
 If the musty mildew smell persists, add a small amount of baking soda inside of drawers, allow it to sit for several minutes, and then vacuum it out.

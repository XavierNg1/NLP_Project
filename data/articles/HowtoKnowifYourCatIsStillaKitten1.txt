 There are obvious differences between an adult cat’s fur and a kitten’s fur. Kittens have more of a fluffy, downy coat, while adult cats have a more sleek and shiny look to them. Older cats can have less sleek and shiny coat due to age and inability to groom themselves. Older cats may sometimes have matted fur as well.


Pet your cat and pay attention to the feeling of the fur as well as its appearance.;
, Kittens are usually smaller-boned and may appear to have unusual proportions. For example, some kittens may have paws that seem too large for their bodies. Pay attention to your cat’s size and proportions for another clue about his or her age., Facial features provide a strong indication of how old a cat is as well. Kittens tend to have more of a round face with feathery cheeks and large, round eyes. As they grow older, their facial features become more pronounced. An adult cat’s face tends to look longer and the nose stands out more.
 All kittens have blue eyes when they are born. At around 6 weeks, a cat’s eyes will change from blue to their permanent eye color. Check your cat’s eyes. If they are still blue, then your cat may still be a kitten.

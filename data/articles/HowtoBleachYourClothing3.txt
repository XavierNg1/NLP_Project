 Bleach will not be effective on every stain type. For example, bleach will work well on stains like coffee, juice or grass but is not effective on oil-based stains like grease.
 Place the stained area on top.
 The ratio will be 1 part bleach to 30 parts water. For a small amount of solution, this could be 1 tablespoon bleach to 30 tablespoons of water, or just under 2 cups (15 ml bleach to 236 ml water).
 Pat the back side of the stain with the cloth in light strokes toward the center to keep the stain from spreading. The stain should begin to transfer to the cloth below.
 Blot excess solution from the fabric using a dry area of the cloth.
 Check to see if stain is fully removed before drying in a clothes dryer or adding heat, which could cause a stain to set.

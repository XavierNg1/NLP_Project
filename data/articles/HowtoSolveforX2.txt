 Let's say you're working with this problem where the x term includes an exponent:


2x2 + 12 = 44

, The first thing you should do is combine like terms so that all of the constant terms are on the right side of the equation while the term with the exponent is on the left side. Just subtract 12 from both sides. Here's how:


2x2+12-12 = 44-12
2x2 = 32

, In this case, 2 is the x coefficient, so divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of it. Here's how:


(2x2)/2 = 32/2
x2 = 16

, Taking the square root of x2 will cancel it out. So, take the square root of both sides. You'll get x left over on one side and the square root of 16, 4, on the other side. Therefore, x = 4.
 Just plug x = 4 back in to the original equation to make sure it checks out. Here's how:


2x2 + 12 = 44
2 x (4)2 + 12 = 44
2 x 16 + 12 = 44
32 + 12 = 44
44 = 44

Put one breast shield on your more productive breast and pump it until it's empty or for up to 20 minutes, then pump the less productive breast for at least the same amount of time. "Empty," means that you pump for a minute (some experts say two) without getting any drops.
Devices designed to hold breast shields onto your breasts may allow you to pump enough to relieve engorgement, but they won't empty most breasts because they can't create the snug fit you get from holding the shield to your breast with one hand.
, You may be surprised at how much extra milk you are able to work out of the breast. (This is why babies instinctively grab at the breast or bottle while they nurse.) Lactation consultants will warn you that single pumping reduces your supply, but what they are saying is that it reduces the effect of nipple stimulation on your supply.


Consider this: single pumping allows you to get more suction out of the machine, single pumping leaves a hand free to massage and squeeze your breast, and single pumping allows you to use a remote control, read a book, eat a sandwich, or rock your baby in a swing. Only single-pumping will keep you sane for the marathon ahead.

Hopefully, your baby will begin to latch easily and you will not need the rest of these instructions.
 You can find bottles that help protect your breast milk from deteriorating in the bottle. Standard nipples are important because wide-mouth bottles can leave up to an ounce in the nipple that your baby can't reach from a comfortable feeding position.

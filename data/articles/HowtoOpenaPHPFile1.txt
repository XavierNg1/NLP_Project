 Code editors are text editing programs that allow you to write code or scripting languages. A code editor is different than a standard word processing application like Microsoft Word.


Code editors include features for writing and reading in various coding languages, such as PHP.
Common code editors include Dreamweaver, Notepad++, TextEdit, and Komodo Edit.;
, Once you find a code editing software you like, download the application and install it. Locate the .exe file and open it. Follow the installation instructions.When clicking to download, you can also choose to run the installer upon downloading. Click “Run” on the security dialogue box. This will automatically run the installer.
Once you have installed a code editing software, you can open and view your PHP files.
 Depending on your computer's speed, the file may take a moment to open. Your editor will launch and load your PHP file.


If your code editor does not appear in the new drop-down menu, then click “Choose default program...” If your program does not appear in the new screen, then click “Browse...” and find the location you installed the program to on your computer. This may even include the desktop. Click on “OK” once you've located the program.
Once you locate the program and click “OK”, your PHP file will open in your text editor. You can now view the code and make edits to it if you wish.
 To make it easier to open PHP files in the future you can set your application as the default for this file type. Change the app for your PHP files in the default settings page. Go to Settings > Change PC settings > Search and apps > Defaults.
Click “Choose default apps by file type” or “Choose default apps by protocol”. Then click on the app, such as Notepad++, to set it as the default app.
The next time you need to open a PHP file you can just double click on the icon to open it.

 Draw a big C. Then draw another C in reverse, almost joined. The C's should be mirror images of each other.
 Draw a double "I" (small letters). Put this double "II" on top of the apple, as its stem.
 This "O" completes the top of the stem.
 Draw a misshapen "D" to form the leaf, alongside the "ll" stem, on one side.
 Again, make it misshapen. This time, place it opposite to the D that you drew before. Also join up the base of the apple. Draw three little lines under it to represent the part of the apple pulled from the tree (calyx and stamen).
 You are done with drawing an alphabet apple.

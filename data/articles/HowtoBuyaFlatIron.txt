Flat irons can range anywhere from $15 to $300, depending on heat settings, plate sizes and brand names.
The more often you plan to use your flat iron, the better quality product you should look for.



Research retailers and their reviews online, making sure to look through the customer reviews on product and service quality.
Consider shipping costs in the price of your flat iron if you will be buying online.

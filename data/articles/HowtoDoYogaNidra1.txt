 To induce Yoga Nidra, you must listen to a set of instructions, similar to guided meditation. You can listen to a friend reading the instructions, but listening to a recording by someone else or by you yourself is more practical. A good recording will have a soft, soothing feel, while being clear. Many people prefer female recordings, but you can also find many male recordings, if that works for you. Some well-recorded videos are:

, For Yoga Nidra to be successful, you must be comfortable. If you have a memory foam mattress or mat, this is the best thing to use. If not, any pillows or mats will work. Some people prefer to elevate their feet, or head.
 You don’t want to be breathing toxic fumes, artificial fragrances, or any bad smells when practicing yoga. Scents can be geared specifically towards encouraging emotional reactions. Some foster tranquility, calming our nervous system; others promote a sense of joy and energy.
 You'll want clothing that is comfortable and breaths easily. This can help deter any unsuccessful attempts because you are not comfortable. You don't necessarily need specific yoga clothes, just loose and breathable clothes.
 Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can effectively prepare your muscles and mind to practice yoga.If this does not relax you, try learning a few yoga asanas. There are a wide variety of yoga poses, or asanas, that one can practice and they range from difficult and strenuous to simple and relaxing.
 To fully concentrate the mind, it must be silent. However, in today's busy times, it may be impossible. Instead of focusing on making the room silent, focus on making the room quiet.

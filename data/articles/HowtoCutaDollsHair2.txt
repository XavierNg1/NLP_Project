 Get a pair of scissors. It is best to use hairdressing scissors or thinning shears, but virtually any sharp scissor will work. Right above where you placed the rubber band or hair tie, make a cut. Any hair that was below where you marked off will be removed and the doll's hair will be that much shorter. Double check your cut and how much hair you want removed. Once you make the cut, there's no going back!

, You might want your doll's hair to be short in the summer much like people's. You can simply measure out a short hair cut for your doll, depending on how long you want it to be. It is best to cut long first and then slowly cut shorter since you cannot put hair back on.
 Section off the part of the hair that you want cut into bangs using a rubber band or hair tie. Comb the bang area forward and then slide the rubber band over the head. Apply warm water to the hair, such as water warmed up in the microwave in a tea cup. Make sure it's not too hot. Let it dry and then cut the bangs along the upper eye level.


It will appear shorter once you remove the rubber band, so make sure to cut it a little long at first. You can always touch up the bangs once the rubber band or hair tie is removed.
 Place the doll on its back, upside down so that the hair is against a flat surface. Separate out the top layer of their hair using a rubber band or hair tie. Then access the layers below and cut to shorter, varied lengths to give the doll's hair the impression of volume.

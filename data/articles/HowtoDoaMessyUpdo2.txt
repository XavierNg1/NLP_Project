 This pretty low bun looks great with a side part. If you're doing your hair for a formal evening event, a deeper part (further to the side) looks elegant. Run the tip of a comb along your part to make it straight., This step is optional if you're not in the mood to go all out. However, if you tease or curl your hair, it will take your messy low bun up a few notches. Lift the top layer of your hair and backcomb it toward the roots to add volume and texture. Alternately, use a curling iron to curl the top layer of your hair so it won't be completely smooth.









Of course, if your hair is naturally curly and voluminous, this step is completely unnecessary; your bun will look beautifully messy on its own.
 Position it at the nape of your neck or slightly higher up, according to your preference. You could even position it on the side, just under one of your ears. For now, don't make a tight ponytail; just wrap the ponytail around your hair one time.
 Twist the hairband and pull it over your ponytail, but this time don't pull the hair all the way through. Stop pulling before your ends are all the way through the hairband. Leave several inches of the ends of your hair sticking out. You should now have a simple looped bun.









If the ponytail seems loose, use a second ponytail to ensure the looped bun stays securely in place. While the look should be messy, you don't want it to be so loose it falls out.
 You want to add some volume to the look by pulling up the top and sides of your hair so it doesn't lie flat against your head. this will help the look go from "sleek" to "messy." Check out your hair in the mirror, and pull out a few strands from around your temples, too.
 Take the ends that are still sticking out of your bun and wrap them around the hairband to hide it from view. Use bobby pins to secure the hair in place.
 This will let your hair move while also keeping it from falling out.

 The best way to get your children to value saving money is by showing them how to do it. Show your children your familyâ€™s budget and talk with them about how you are planning for your retirement, their future college expenses, and other savings goals. Modeling responsibility will likely lead to similar behavior from your children., In order to teach your children how to save money, you should practice money-saving lessons. Teach them how to use coupons or help them start a lemonade stand. These things will help them better understand the importance of a budget and how to save money.For example, you could encourage small children to place their money in three jars: one for savings, one for spending, and another for donating. This will help them gain an understanding of how adults budget their money.
 With older children, you should consider giving them an allowance for completing household chores. This will help them become more responsible around the house and learn how to budget their money. Encourage them to save their allowance money for larger items like video games or bicycles., Once they are old enough, ask your kids to get a part-time job or do odd jobs around the neighborhood. Your kids can earn a little extra money by babysitting, mowing lawns, walking dogs, or shoveling snow. Encourage your children to put the money they have earned towards your savings goal.Do not force your children to put the money they earned towards their savings. This will make them resentful and less likely to want to contribute. Instead, remind them of the benefits of saving but allow them to make the final decision about their money.

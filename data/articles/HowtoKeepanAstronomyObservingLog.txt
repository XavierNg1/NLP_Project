 You can keep an observing log either on paper or on computer. A paper log is easier to take into the field with you than is a laptop computer, although you may find it easier to keep records on a computer than in printed form. Computer-based astronomy record keeping programs offer the options of pre-printed log forms and the ability to generate reports, as well as an astronomical database that can help you identify objects and the ability to search your own records to track the positions of planets and comets over time.


You may want to use several methods, such as a small notebook you carry into the field on which you make notes, which you transcribe to either a larger notebook or binder or onto a computer.
Some amateur astronomers like to include sketches with their notes. If you're one of them, you'll need to have a hard surface under your note-taking paper, such as a small clipboard.
Several websites offer pre-printed astronomy log forms you can use to record your observations on. One such site is that run by the American Association of Amateur Astronomers (http://www.astromax.org/aa02801.htm);
;
, The sooner you can commit your observation to print or computer, the more accurate your records will be-�not to mention that you may forget to do so entirely if you wait too long. This is where taking a simple notepad into the field with you may help.
 This may include some or all of the following:


The day and date of your observation session. You can record the date in either American format (month, day, year) or European/military format (day, month, year), although you may want to write out or use the abbreviation for the month name to avoid confusion on the part of others who may read your observing log.
The times your observing session began and ended. If your observing log includes sketches, include the times those sketches were made. Time should be expressed in Universal (Greenwich Mean) Time, or your local time, with the mention of whether it was Standard or Daylight Time.
Your observation location, preferably including your latitude and longitude, but at least the specific area you were conducting your observations in (city, state, backyard, field, park, etc.).
What kind of telescope you were using (refractor/reflector � Newtonian, Dobsonian), its focal length, eyepiece, magnification, apparent field of view, and any notes on its performance. If you use a lens filter, note how images compare with and without the filter.
What you were observing, including a detailed physical description and/or a sketch. Include an estimate of the object's size based on the angular field of view of your telescope's eyepiece. If the object is a comet, name the constellation the comet appears in and the constellations you searched to find it. If the object is a star cluster, include a count of how many stars you can see. If the object is a nebula or galaxy, include a description of how concentrated the stars or glowing gases are.
The amount of moonlight, which can affect how well you can see dimmer stars. You can also include an estimate of the apparent magnitude of the dimmest stars you can see directly overhead (transparency) and the approximate arc-second diameter of star images (seeing).
The local weather conditions, including the percentage of cloud cover, and any mist, fog, or haze.
You can also include non-astronomical observations such as the presence of wildlife or sources of light or other pollution that hamper your ability to see the sky. If you're sharing your observing session with other amateur astronomers, you may want to include their names and notes on their equipment for posterity. You can also include personal thoughts.

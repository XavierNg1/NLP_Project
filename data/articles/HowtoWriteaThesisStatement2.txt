 A thesis statement conveys to the reader the points and/or arguments you wish to make in a paper.It serves as a road map by telling the reader the direction of your argument or analysis and how you will interpret the importance of the subject.In the most simple of terms, a thesis statement answers the question, "What is this paper about?" Additionally, a thesis statement


is an assertion, not a fact or observation.Facts are used within the paper to support your thesis.
takes a stand, meaning it announces your position towards a particular topic.is the main idea and explains what you intend to discuss.answers a specific question and explains how you plan to support your argument.
is debatable. Someone should be able to argue an alternate position, or conversely, support your claims.
 You want your thesis statement to be identifiable as a thesis statement. You do this by taking a very particular tone and using specific kinds of phrasing and words. Use words like "because" and language which is firm and definitive.


Example thesis statements with good statement language include:

"Because of William the Conqueror's campaign into England, that nation developed the strength and culture it would need to eventually build the British Empire."
"Hemingway significantly changed literature by normalizing simplistic writing and frank tone."



, Because of the role thesis statements play, they appear at the beginning of the paper, usually at the end of the first paragraphor somewhere in the introduction. Although most people look for the thesis at the end of the first paragraph, its location can depend on a number of factors such as how lengthy of an introduction you need before you can introduce your thesis or the length of your paper.,

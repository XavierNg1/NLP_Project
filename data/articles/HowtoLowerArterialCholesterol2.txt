Often times, changing your diet and increasing your daily exercise levels can help you lose weight and live a healthier life.
 Smoking is widely considered a factor in atherosclerosis and heart disease.Even occasional or light smoking habits can damage the heart and blood vessels, and increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis.If you're a current smoker, talk to your doctor about ways to give up tobacco and lead a healthier lifestyle., Regular consumption of alcohol in excess has been shown to raise blood pressure, and may contribute to atherosclerosis. Excess alcohol consumption can also cause weight gain, which is another factor that contributes toward atherosclerosis.To track alcohol consumption, adhere to the recommended consumption limits.The NHS calculates units of alcohol in a given serving by multiplying the strength (alcohol by volume) times the volume (in milliliters) and dividing that total by 1,000. The recommended daily maximum for alcohol consumption is approximately one to two glasses of wine or beer.

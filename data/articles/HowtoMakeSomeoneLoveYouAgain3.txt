 Honesty is the basis of trust and often, love. Being honest will show the person that you’re serious, which they may respect and like about you. However, honestly isn’t just telling the truth. Say things in a way that the person will understand them and benefit from them. Sometimes, brutal honesty can do more harm than good, so try some tender honesty. If the person asks you an uncomfortable question, answer it honestly, even if you know they won’t like the answer. However, you may also want to talk about what has changed.If you’ve made mistakes, admit them. Say how you’ve grown since making the mistake and how you will avoid future similar mistakes.
Don’t be afraid to ask hard questions, either.
 Even if the person has harmed or hurt you, be unconditional in your love toward them. Show them that though times may be difficult and the relationship may waver, you will be a constant source of love and support. If the person is hesitant in expressing their love, don’t be hesitant in giving your love. Even if the person upsets you or lets you down, be unwavering in your love toward them.However, if they ask you to leave them alone or to give them more space, respect their request. Do not stalk them or give them more attention than they’d like. You don’t want to turn them off or have them upset with you for going overboard on your attention and affection.
 Remember that above all, you must learn to love yourself before you love another. Think about what aspects of yourself you suppress or feel ashamed to show to the world. Feel free to show your true self to yourself, friends, family, and to the person you want love from. Allow them to see you in your entirety.If you feel scared being vulnerable or feel like you are unlovable, work with a therapist. They can help you uncover your insecurities, work through your wounds, and build your self-esteem.

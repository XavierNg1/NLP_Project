 If you can't find a notebook, get some 20 to 24 gauge metal wire from a bead shop or an art shop. It can be any color you like., If you want to make two earrings, snip another loop off. You will end up with one (or two) metal rings. Be sure to cut the "hook" off the end of end of your metal ring as well.


If you are using a metal wire, cut about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) off with a pair of wire cutters. Wrap it around a pen or marker to shape it.Do not use scissors, or you will dull them.
 For a fancier earring, add a smaller bead to either side of the larger one.


If you want a dangler use a pendant or charm from a necklace or bracelet instead.
 Pinch the cut end of the wire with the pliers, and fold it inward. This will make the earring "softer" and more comfortable to wear.If you added any decorations to your earring, these loops will also keep them from falling off.
 Use your fingers or a pen to curve the earring back into a ring shape. Keep a small gap between the two folded loops.
 Pull the earring apart until you can slide the gap part onto your earlobe. Carefully close the earring until it stays on.

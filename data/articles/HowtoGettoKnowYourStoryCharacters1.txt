 On each page, create a category for “name,” “date of birth,” “height,” “physical characteristics,” “favorite food,” “favorite time of day,” and so on.;
, Write the name of a character at the top of each page. Fill in the blanks for each character. Note whether each one is a minor or major character, and how they relate to one another in the story.


Draw a family tree if you need help keeping all of the characters straight.
 Don’t forget to include diversity in your characters. Your characters should reflect real life in age, race, sexuality, gender, size, etc.
 Maybe they never shut the kitchen cabinets. Maybe they always hang up before saying “I love you.” Maybe they sing in the car, but never in front of people. Maybe they eat a bit too much cheese, and spend an entire paycheck in the cheese section of Whole Foods.
 What does your character fear? Maybe he doesn’t like spiders, or he’s afraid of the water. What motivates her? What keeps her awake at night? Maybe she can’t sleep because she always dreams of black cats. What makes him cry? What makes his heart stop beating for a moment? What’s his favorite china pattern? What does he want most in life? Where is her favorite place in the world? What medications does she take?

, For instance, what do her scars or tattoos say about her past? Maybe she got a tattoo that reminds her of a favorite pet that died. Why are his eyes brown? Maybe they’re his grandmother’s eyes, and he shares a passion for painting with her. When or why did she decide she liked strawberry-rhubarb pie? Maybe it was her mom’s favorite, who died when she was a kid. Why does she like mornings? Maybe that was the only time she really got to spend with her mom.


Continue to dig. Ask “why” to every characteristic. Why is he afraid of spiders? Why does she dream about black cats? Write down the potential answers on your character’s biography page.

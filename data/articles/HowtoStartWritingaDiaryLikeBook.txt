 Will it be about the life of a boy or girl? Teen or child? Adult or Elder? Or will it be about yourself? Decide where they live and their characteristics, like name and hobbies. Come up with everything they like and dislike, and spend a lot of time dwelling on it.;
, The family and friends are the most important people in their lives, and they are the people who make things very interesting in the storyline. Decide the people around them, like the parents and friends, family and enemies.
 If you just want it to be about their basic life, that's fine, but you might run out of things to say, and the story might become dull. Begin to think of what your character's life revolves around, whether it's a pet, family member, grades, friendship, etc., and think of a story to tell about it. Begin to think more about your idea and then write down your ideas at the moment for their life (remember, you can change it along the way).
 Either draw it or take a photograph. Remember, it is a diary, so try to make it like a cartoon or something that relates to this person's life. Maybe make it look like the cover of a diary of something. Then, begin to make illustrations in the book, if needed.
 Don't forget to label the days and make each entry about a page long. Also decide how long you want the diary to last for, whether it's a year, a decade, or until you run out of paper.


Realize the format of the book. There shouldn't be any chapters or anything in the book because it is a diary. Try keeping a diary to see how a diary really works.

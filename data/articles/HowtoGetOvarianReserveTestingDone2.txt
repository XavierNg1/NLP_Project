 The “Day 3 FSH test” is a blood test that measures your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone on the third day of your cycle. It is done on the third day because this is when estrogen (estradiol) levels should be at their lowest.High estradiol levels can alter the appearance of FSH. As such, estradiol levels should always be tested in conjunction with FSH.
In women with irregular or infrequent menstruation, both FSH and estradiol levels can be taken at random. If estradiol levels are low, then the FSH levels can be counted.
FSH levels below 10 miu/ml are considered normal. Levels between 10-15 miu/ml are thought to be “borderline.”

, In this test, your FSH levels will also be checked on Day 3 of your cycle. Then, you’ll be given Clomid for days 5-9, and your FSH will be tested again on day 10. Clomid is a “selective estrogen receptor modulator.” The presence of this drug in your system should cause your FSH levels to rise. By day 10, your body should be able to bring this your FSH levels back down to normal. Higher FSH levels on day 10 can indicate a low ovarian reserve., The AMH test is a blood test that assesses your antimüllerian hormone levels. AMH is a substance produced only in small ovarian follicles. Levels of this hormone are thought to reflect a women’s remaining egg supply (or ovarian reserve). AMH levels can be tested on any day of a women’s cycle.Higher-than-usual levels of AMH may be present in women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
AMH levels are commonly used to determine how well women may respond to infertility drugs.
 Testing these levels (via blood test) on the third day of your cycle is thought to help determine both the quantity and quality of your remaining ovarian reserve.Unfortunately, this test may not be available at all fertility clinics.
This test may be especially helpful for women with unexplained fertility issues.

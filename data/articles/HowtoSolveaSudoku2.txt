 Use the same logic from an easy puzzle to fill in every empty box with all of the possible numbers for that box. If possible, put in definites. For example, picture three (above) shows that you can't solve for 3.


In a hard Sudoku, you won't be able to solve from the start, so just fill in what you know it could be. This will help later when you have two or three options per box and you can't remember what they are.
 For example, in a block, there are four open boxes. From your analysis, you have determined that:


box A can be 1, 2, 3, or 4;
box B can be 1, 2, 3, or 4;
box C can be 3 or 4; and
box D can be 3 or 4.
From this we know that box A and B cannot be 3 or 4, because they have to be either 1 or 2. Box C and D have to be either 3 or 4. This information might be useful in solving other boxes.
 A hard Sudoku can actually take days to complete, but they are still fun. The harder they are, the more fun it is when you finish. A hard Sudoku can be solved the same as an easy one, it just gives you less to start with. The logic of a hard puzzle is that if you know everything that can go in every box, it is very simple.


For example, say you have two possible 2's for a particular nine-square box, and they are in a row or column and you know that 2's cannot go anywhere else in the nine-square box. This means that you know that the row or column those 2's are in cannot have 2's in it except in this nine-square box. This sounds confusing, but when applied, it is actually very easy and it helps a lot.
 In this method, fill in each block with all the possible numbers that could go there. Write all the numbers small at the top of the block. You can recreate the puzzle on bigger paper to help with this. Write all the numbers that don't appear in that row, column or square. Once you have done this for a whole column or row, start filling in the obvious answers. You will have solved the puzzle by the time you do this for every row.

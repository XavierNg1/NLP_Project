 To switch between spaces on a Mac with a trackpad, swipe left or right on the pad with a four-fingered gesture. This will cycle you through the open spaces in your chosen direction.
 If you don't like using the trackpad, you can cycle left and right through your open spaces by pressing CTRL+LEFT CURSOR or CTRL+RIGHT CURSOR.


This shortcut also can be used to go to each space individually. To do so, press CTRL and the number of your desired space, e.g. CTRL+2 to go to the second space.

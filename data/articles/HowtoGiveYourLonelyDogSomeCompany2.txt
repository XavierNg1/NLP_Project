 All dogs need daily exercise. However, some dog breeds, like Huskies, Golden Retrievers, and Dalmatians, need an hour or more of daily exercise.If you have a high-energy dog, loneliness can lead to destructive behavior. Give your dog some company by taking it for a run.


Running can be hard on a dog’s joints. Have your vet examine your dog to make sure its joints are healthy enough for running.
 Walking can be good exercise, too. Rather than taking your dog along the usual route, take a different route. This will let your dog see new sights, sniff new smells, and maybe make some new friends along the way.
 If you live near a nature trail, consider taking your dog for a hike. Not only will this give your dog some company, it will allow your dog to get some exercise and experience something new. Bring some water, plastic bags to pick up poop, and a doggie first-aid kit.The first aid kit should contain some basic supplies, such as absorbent gauze pads, scissors, and tweezers.The website http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/pet_first_aid_kit.html has a helpful list of first-aid kit supplies for dogs.
Check the weather before you go hiking so you don’t get stuck in rain or other unpleasant weather.
 The beach is another great location to give your lonely dog some company. You can play fetch at the beach and even chase your dog in the sand. If your dog likes the water, you can play or swim in the surf.

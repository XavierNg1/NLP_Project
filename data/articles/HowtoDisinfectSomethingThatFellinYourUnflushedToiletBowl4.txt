 Run some water into a spacious pot or saucepan (depending on the size of the item you’re trying to sanitize). Place the pot over medium-high heat until the surface of the water just begins to bubble. The heat from the boiling water will instantly destroy microbial bugs on durable, hard-to-clean items.Boiling is a good way to thoroughly disinfect solid, one-piece objects that aren’t easily broken, such as toothbrushes, combs, drinking containers and just about anything made out of plastic or glass.
 Using a pair of tongs or a strainer, lower the tainted object into the boiling water. The item will need to stay immersed for 1-20 minutes, depending on the size and material—any longer and it may be in danger of being warped by the heat. Whisk the item through the water to flush away bacteria concentrated on the surface.Make sure you have a way of protecting your hands from the heat. Consider taking the precaution of wearing a pair of dish gloves or oven mitts, even if you’re using tongs.
Leaving plastic and fragile metal items submerged in boiling water for too long could cause them to melt.
 Pull the infected item out of the pot and give it a shake to remove excess water. Wrap the item in a clean, dry towel, then leave it out to air dry. Once the remaining moisture has evaporated, it should be as good as new.


If the item has a lid or cover, leave it off to allow airflow and prevent mildew from forming inside.

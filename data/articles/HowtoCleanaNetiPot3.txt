A simple rinse won’t be enough to effectively clear away harmful bacteria.
Disinfecting your neti pot is key to practicing safe, responsible hygiene.
 It can be dangerous to irrigate your sinuses using regular tap water. Instead, go with distilled water or purified bottled water. You can also boil about a quart of water and use it to clean your nasal passageways after letting it cool to room temperature.All sorts of foul things, from caustic chemicals to microscopic brain-eating amoebas, have been known to lurk in water straight from the faucet.
If you’re preparing sterile water for your neti pot at home, make sure to bring the water to a steady boil for no less than one minute., Since there’s often some bacteria remaining on the spout after it’s been inside your nasal passages, letting someone else use your neti pot increases the risk of transferring these bacteria. This is true even if the device has been cleaned between uses. Play it safe and make sure your sinuses are the only ones your neti pot sees.Neti pots are like toothbrushes, loofahs or retainers—everybody should have their own.

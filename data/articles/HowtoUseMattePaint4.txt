 Before applying matte paint to your car, you want to make sure you sand away any rough surfaces. This will help the paint adhere properly. Examine your car carefully for any rough spots like scratches. Use a #220 sandpaper to buff out any imperfections.Use circular motions when sanding for the best results., Never apply any type of paint to a dirty vehicle. Surface dirt, dust, and grime can easily get trapped under the paint if it's not washed off first. Either clean your car in your garage by hosing it down or take it to the car wash. Make sure there is no dirt, debris, road dust, or other grime on your car prior to cleaning.If you've never cleaned your car yourself before, test out your cleaner on a small portion of the car before applying it to the full car.
 Find a small, unnoticeable portion of your car. Apply the paint there and allow it to dry so you can see the kind of color your matte finish produces. If you like the effect, you can apply a layer of matte paint to your car., Use masking tape, duct tape, or painting tape to tape off the areas you don't want painted. This usually includes areas near the tires, doors, handles, and so on., Paint is usually applied to a car using a sprayer. Spray paint across your car by holding the sprayer's nozzle six inches from the car and moving the nozzle in side to side motions. Keep going over your car until the full surface is covered with matte paint. You should only hold down the trigger of the spray gun while you're actively moving the gun sideways. Do not hold down the trigger when changing direction as this can cause paint to run.Refer to your instruction's manual to see if more than one coat of matte paint is required. Usually, you need to apply at least two coats. If multiple coats are required, you usually have to wait anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour between coats.

 When investigating a new object, food, or environment, they will make these type of squeaks. They are very short in time frequency and have a neutral tone but may sound positive.
 Common movements range from shaking their noses up and down to smell, shaking their heads to see, and using their teeth and claws to touch and feel it. The squeaks will accompany these movements.
 Until they investigate everything, it will continue. When the curiosity stops, they just go back to their old routines and activities.

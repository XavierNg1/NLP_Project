 This is called the rockstep and is what gives you forward momentum to do the next steps. When the follow feels the lead initiate the rockstep, they do the same, only stepping backwards onto their right foot and forwards onto the left.


Keep your feet more or less underneath you. The further backwards you step, the harder it will be to move forward into the next step and you will lose your momentum.
The follow will know the lead has initiated the rockstep because the lead's arm will press backwards into their arm, and the lead's hand will move ever so slightly backwards.
Think of this step like an athlete building up to run.
 Ideally you will rise up on count three and come down on count four (it's important that you don't put your foot down until count four.) Leads will step onto their left foot and follows onto their right.


The upward motion in this step is important to differentiate it from other basics.
Leads need to make sure they bring their arms forward along with their body so the follow knows where to go.
 Don't step onto it, and don't rush it. By count 8, it should be slightly behind you, and just before count one of the next bar, step onto it.


Be careful not to lose your balance by trying to 'kick' your foot out forwards, or step back onto it too early. Let your body flow naturally.
That being said, this is a great time to add some extra style into your step!

, Now you can repeat it, go into another basic, or do something entirely different!

 If your cat suffers from impaired mobility, it probably won't be able to groom itself as efficiently as a healthy cat would and will require some help. Brushing your cat daily will help to keep its coat healthy and free of mats, dirt, and debris. Use a slicker brush, which is suitable for both short haired and long haired cats, or a rubber grooming glove, which is gentler., In addition to regular brushing, be sure to remove any mats you find in your cat's coat. Instead of cutting them out, which can injure your cat's skin, tease the mats out slowly with a fine tooth comb. If you have a long haired cat, trim the hair around its bottom and hind legs to prevent hair from getting soiled and matted., If your pet's reduced mobility makes it difficult to bathe itself effectively, purchase non-toxic pet wipes to keep it fresh. Most pet wipes contain ingredients to condition your cat's coat (e.g. aloe) and help reduce dust and dander buildup. These disposable cloths can also be used to regularly clean stray litter or dust from your cat's paws.

 Make them parallel with each other, and put the sides together.
 Make sure the boxes line up the right way before making the holes. The more holes that you make, the more secure the end result will be., Tie it, so that it creates a loop. Make sure it's very tight. Repeat for each hole pairing that you've made. The two boxes should now be connected., Spread glue on three sides, and slide this piece into the middle of both boxes. Make sure the unglued side is pointing towards you., Make sure it's like an isosceles triangle, with a long flat end. Glue the long end to one side of the box, and cover it up with paper/papier mâché. The short end should touch the ground.

While papier mâché will create a more realistic appearance, paper is easier and less time consuming.
 Put the triangle on the other side, and make the short flat end align with where the top of the box ends. The long flat end should touch the box, while the crooked end should be on the outside. Now cover it with paper/papier mâché again., For the leaves, you can use papier mâché, paper, or glue plastic leaves onto the top. For paper, cut it like a fluffy cloud with a flat bottom. You should make four of these pieces. Take a strip of paper, and glue it onto the pieces, with one on each side. cut off the excess.

Glue it just under the door, and arrange the leaves to make room for it, while some still goes underneath the balcony., But this time, make the balcony smaller and a bit higher. Be sure to add a telescope too, which can be made by rolling paper into a cone and gluing it together., You can print out shelves with books on them from the internet, which is very easy and fine.

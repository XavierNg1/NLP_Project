 While odor from urine is the biggest problem for pet owners, other causes of pet odor include feces, drool, and hair. To keep these odors from lingering, clean up after your pet daily as much as you can. The longer you wait to clean a mess, the harder it will be to get any residual odor or stain out of your floor or furniture.


Pay special attention to areas in which your dog spends the most time. Routinely cleaning these areas will help keep pet odor from building up and becoming difficult to get rid of., Your dogâ€™s bed or blankets are another area that can hold in odors. To keep these smelling fresh, wash them at least once a week if possible.To help neutralize odors between washing, try spraying these linens with an odor-neutralizing spray, not just an air freshener that will cover up the odor for a short period of time.
 Vacuum regularly to remove any lingering pet hair that can contribute to odor. It is best to vacuum at least twice a week, depending on how much your dog sheds.Be sure you vacuum any furniture your dog frequents as well as the floor.

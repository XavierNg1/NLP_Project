 There is a Hepatitis A vaccine available for children over one year old, and a combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine available for adults over 18. There is no serious risk associated with getting the vaccine, and the most common side effect is tenderness at the injection site.Discuss risk factors with your provider to determine if you should be vaccinated to prevent Hepatitis A.
 If you may have encountered Hepatitis A and have not been vaccinated, your doctor can accurately diagnose you with a simple blood test for Hepatitis antibodies and immunoglobulins.


Your healthcare provider can give you a dose of Hepatitis A vaccine or immunoglobulin to limit the length and severity of the infection, but this only helps if it is within two weeks from exposure., Almost everyone recovers fully from Hepatitis A.In rare cases, however, untreated Hepatitis A can lead to permanent liver damage including fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure. This is uncommon but more likely in adults over 50 years old and those with underlying liver disease.Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can cause similar symptoms to Hepatitis A, and you cannot tell the difference just from how you feel. Hepatitis B and C can be more serious and chronic illnesses that require different treatment, so a correct diagnosis is important., Children under six years old are most likely to have an asymptomatic infection.If an unvaccinated child under six has been exposed to the virus, it is best they get tested.


The severity of symptoms worsens with increasing age. Adults over age 50 are at higher risk of severe symptoms and complications.

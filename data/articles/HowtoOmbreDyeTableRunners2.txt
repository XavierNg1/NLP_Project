 Before you dye it, run the table runner under a faucet until the entire fabric is wet. Wring out excess water so that it is slightly damp. Fold the runner lengthwise. Roll the table runner widthwise until you have a compact roll. The hem of the runner should be on one side of the roll., Starting with the first bucket (the bucket with the lowest concentration of dye), dip the hem side of the runner into the dye. Make sure that it is submerged a little less than two-thirds of the way up the rolled runner. Hold it there for a minute. Remove and dip it in the second bucket, submerging it above halfway up the roll. Hold it there longer than the first, about two minutes. For the last bucket, dip the fabric about one-third of the way up, holding it there for three minutes.The longer you hold the runner in the dye, the darker the color will be. If you want a very light shade, submerge it for less than a minute. If you want a very dark shade, hold it down for longer than three minutes.
 Once you have finished dyeing it, run the fabric under a cool, running faucet. Rinse out excess dye until the water runs clear. If there are any sharp lines or splatters in your fabric, you can use a damp paper towel to smooth them out., Hang the table runner to dry completely. Once dry, you should wash the table runner with color-safe detergent before you use it. Do not wash with other linens or clothing in case the dye runs. If you used machine-safe fabric dye, you can put it in a washing machine. If not, wash it by hand.

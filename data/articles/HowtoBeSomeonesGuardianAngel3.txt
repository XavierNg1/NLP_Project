 When providing emotional support, it’s important to try to understand what the situation is like for the person you are helping. Set aside your own opinions, and sympathize with their perspective.


That said, you should not talk over them and relate one of your own “similar” experiences; this will come across as insensitive or even sound like you are boasting or placing your emotional needs above theirs., When this person wants to talk, listen without providing advice or input of your own. Sometimes the most helpful thing you can do for someone is just to listen to what they’re going through, without trying to interrupt or judge their situation.Don’t brush them off or say that you don’t have time to hear what they have to say.
Often acknowledging people’s pain and sadness is worth more than all the advice and guidance you might have in store.
 Although many of the ways in which you can support an individual are through emotional support, there are ways in which you can physically be a “guardian angel.” Perhaps you could even donate blood if they have an illness with medical repercussions.Ask the person you are helping:


“Can I help by driving you to the grocery store or other errands?”
“Would it be helpful if I went to doctor appointments with you?”

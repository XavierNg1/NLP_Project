 Before using new nipples or bottles for the first time, submerge them in a pot of boiling water for at least ten minutes.Remove them from the pot with a clean pair of tongs and let them air dry on a clean towel.This method is safe on all kinds of baby bottles and will sanitize them and make them germ-free for the initial use.;
, If you have well water, youâ€™ll want to sterilize your bottle nipples on a regular basis,but all other parents are fine moving onto everyday cleaning methods after the first sterilization.
 Another sterilization option is to buy a microwave sterilizer. To use this device, follow the instructions on the package. Microwave sterilizers generally involve placing a small amount of water in the base of the device, placing the bottle and nipples in the water, and then microwaving everything for a few minutes until the steam has sterilized the items.Microwave sterilizers are just as effective as the boiling method, and can be found at any baby store.

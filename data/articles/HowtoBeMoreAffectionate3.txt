 Answer cues by returning hugs, complimenting, saying “I Love You,” kissing someone on the cheek or high fiving. Ignore the urge to hesitate during these moments. If you aren’t used to doing this, it may take some practice but will become second nature in time.
 In decades past, it was not as culturally important for dads to be affectionate to kids. However, times have changed. Both parents should strive to show affection to their children, even if it is not natural for one of them.
 While you are cuddling, holding hands or giving a compliment, eye contact connects you further and shows you are serious. Studies have shown that staring into the eyes of someone you love (even a pet) can increase oxytocin hormone levels. This can make you both feel really good and is well worth the effort.
 Motivational strategists believe that good habits can be established by dreaming big about the way you would like things to be, such as being a more affectionate parent. Then, give yourself micro quotas, such as “I am going to spend 20 minutes conversing directly with my children every day.” Always break down larger goals into smaller goals so they are more obtainable and give you the opportunity to celebrate your successes more often., If you have no desire to show affection or feel affection but can’t express it, consider speaking to a counselor or therapist—either alone or with your partner. Relationships take work. Don’t associate couple’s counseling or seeking therapy on your own with weakness. If you love someone and want to make it work, then nothing should keep you from seeking help to make your relationship stronger.

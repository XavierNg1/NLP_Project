 There is a heightened risk of falling after a surgery. Move all the things that you need close to you so that you can reach them without getting up. Place a table or tray beside your bed to make it more convenient.You may want to put your phone, the remote, a beverage, medication, glasses, or a book on the table so you can get to it easily.
 You will have to move around after your surgery, like when you go to the bathroom. If you are able to walk, you should place things like handrails or secure things to hold on to along the path you will walk. You may ask a caregiver, family member, or friend to help set up a path for you to walk.If you donâ€™t have handrails, you can set up solid, secure tables or other furniture along the path to hold on to as you walk.
 Clothing may also contribute to your fall risk. To make sure you stay as safe as possible, avoid wearing overly large or long clothing that you could trip over or step on. You should also wear non-slip footwear that fits your feet., Trying to walk in the dark can also cause a fall. Make sure that there are night lights along hallways or in dark rooms, like bathrooms. You may also choose to keep lamps on in all rooms during the night so you can see to navigate your way around.

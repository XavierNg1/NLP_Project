 You shouldn’t be able to hear your fridge running all of the time. This indicates the motor is going at full blast trying to keep the fridge cold. If a fridge is running properly, the motor will only run periodically.Note that your fridge’s motor will run more often if the door is frequently opened. For instance, if you’re having a party and people are going in and out of the fridge, the motor will run more frequently.
 If you feel excessive heat coming from your fridge, have a appliance repair professional come take a look at it. There are coils on the back of the fridge that release heat regularly, but it shouldn’t be too noticeable unless you’re nearly touching the insulation that covers the coils.If the fridge is emanating heat, it likely needs new coils. Weigh the cost of repairing your fridge against buying a new one. It is often worth buying a newer, more efficient fridge in these cases.
 If you notice food going bad more quickly than expected, or that you have to keep turning the fridge’s thermometer down to keep items cool, your fridge has probably become less efficient.Whenever you notice a fridge is not working as well as it used to, have it looked it by a professional. For instance, a freezer that's running too cold is also an issue.
Even if it is still working, the fridge may be using more energy than it should, not to mention increasing your energy costs.

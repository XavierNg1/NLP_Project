 You will need ribbon, plastic beads, straws, wrapping paper, glue, and scissors. Choose the specifics of the beads, paper, and ribbon according to your style. Try to get colors which match well together and fit your child’s personality.
 You will make the beads by covering the straw in the wrapping paper. This will be something that the child can do largely unaided, if they are old enough. These straw beads will be more cost effective than glass beads and also safer for the child to wear.


Begin by cutting the paper into small triangles, perhaps an inch to an inch and a half across the long side. Brush glue onto the backside of the paper and then roll the paper onto the straw. Cut off the section that is now covered in the paper to form the bead.
 Alternate the straw beads with the plastic beads and then tie the ribbon in a bow to create the closer. You’re done! This is a great project to do with your child as it will allow them to express their creativity while practicing hand-eye coordination as well as other important skills.

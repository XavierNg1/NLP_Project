 Cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap this left lace around the right lace and pull tight to complete a basic starting knot.


Pull the two laces together firmly to secure this knot in place.
Note that this is the same “starting knot” used in the double slip knot method. This starting knot forms the basis for many different lace tying techniques.
 Pull about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of the right lace up and fold over into a loop.


Do not cross the ends over each other. Instead, simply pinch the loop closed toward the bottom with your fingers.
Note that if you are left-handed, you might find it easier to start with the left loop instead of the right.
 Pass the left lace over the right, wrapping it snugly around the back of the right loop. Use your index finger to push the left lace through the center hole created in between the two laces. As you push the lace through, you should notice a second loop forming from the left lace.


You should continue to hold the right lace loop in place as you work with the left lace.
 Grab both loops with your fingers and pull them outward to tighten the knot securely.


The left lace loop will be pulled to the right and the right lace loop will be pulled to the left.
This knot is the standard knot used to tie most shoelaces. You can use it to tie your moccasins, and if you practice enough to create an even, smooth looking loop, the appearance can be quite flattering. Since it is not as secure as the double slip knot or boat shoe knot, however, you might find yourself re-tying your moccasins more often if you stick with this method.

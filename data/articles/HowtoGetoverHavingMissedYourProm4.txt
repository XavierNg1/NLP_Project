 Don't worry what other people think, or if they stare at you. You're not doing anything wrong or breaking any laws. As a really cool alternative, travel to someplace spectacular like Las Vegas or Times Square to do this. You might just find you're not the only couple re-creating your prom night.
 You can probably get a crown, tiara, and two sashes on eBay for a under $50 if you're really good, and easily for less than $100 even if you're not the savviest shopper. Find some formal attire at the secondhand store. Get dressed up in some formal attire, and have a photographer take some pictures of you and your "sweetheart" in a professional picture.
 A lot of organizations, both for-profit companies and non-profit organizations, host pageants where women of all ages compete for a crown. Did you know that several Miss Americas never went to their proms?

 If you want a more authentic ginger flavor, you can rely on this recipe instead. Making it at home allows you to adjust the strength to suit your taste.
 Start with about 2 tbsp (30mL) for a 10-oz (300mL) glass. You can find this ingredient at health food stores, upper end grocery stores, or online. For a fresher taste, make your own:


Heat 1 cup (240mL) water and 1¼ cups (240g) sugar, stirring until dissolved.
Add ½ cup (120mL) grated or thinly sliced, raw ginger.
Simmer for 15 minutes.
Let cool, then add 2 tbsp (30mL) lemon juice.
 Plain seltzer (fizzy water) is best. You may use lemon-lime soda, cream soda, or other sodas. Sodas add a large amount of sugar and can overpower the ginger taste.
 This alcoholic ingredient will add complex herbal flavors. Try it if you happen to have it on hand, but don't bother buying it if you don't make cocktails at home.
 Give it a stir until all the ginger syrup has dissolved. Add ice or drink it straight.

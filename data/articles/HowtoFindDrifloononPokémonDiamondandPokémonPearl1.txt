 Not long after earning your first Gym Badge, you'll find a girl on Route 205 who's father has been taken hostage at Valley Windworks by Team Galactic. You'll need to clear Team Galactic out of Valley Windworks in order to get Drifloon.;
, The Galactic Grunt should be an easy fight, but he'll lock the door to Valley Windworks once he's defeated.
 You'll be able to get the Works Key from these guys. Head south to find them in Floaroma Meadow.
 You'll have to fight both Grunts back-to-back, so make sure your team is ready. The fight shouldn't be two difficult if you've been fighting regularly, and you'll only have to get through three Pok√©mon to win.
 Once you have the Works Key, you can clear out Valley Windworks. You'll have to fight two Grunts and Commander Mars, who has a difficult Level 16 Purugly. After defeating the Commander, the girl will be reunited with her father and will mention "the Balloon Pokemon." This is Drifloon.

, An uneven number is best and have some facing forward, depicted with circles and others pointing different directions, indicated with ovals.
 On the areas intended to be flowers, brush on very diluted, pastel reds, yellows and blues, or any other colors you wish. Don't stir, apply the colors and move rapidly to the leaf shapes. Paint very diluted blues and greens for leafs. Go to the edges and using the same colors as for the petals, paint abstract shapes around the flowers. All of these colors will merge and blend, but that is the idea. With the tip of a damp brush blend hard edges.
 The colors will dry lighter than when they are wet, but they should barely tint the paper.  Let it dry and do a detailed sketch of the flowers in pencil., Paint them yellow with touches of orange and red. To insure they remain bright, either mask them using masking fluid or plan to paint around them.
 Follow with a line of water on the inside edge to soften it. Do the center vein as a curved line with a fine brush and some of the tributary veins on some. It isn't necessary to put in every tiny vein., There will be many partial leafs between the flower heads and some will overlap., Keep this brown line irregular by holding your brush up onto the handle. Let the vine go through and around the flowers. Add little curvy lines coming off the branch for interest and to appear life-like. Do some pieces of pine if you wish. Start with a fine brush line and lightly make wispy pine needles coming off each side.
 Go back in and darken the areas under the berries to make the centers pop. If you used masking fluid, unmask with your finger.

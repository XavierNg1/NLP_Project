 If you want a faster swing, you have to teach your body what it feels like to swing a bat faster. Choose a bat that is ten to fifteen percent lighter than your normal bat. Swing it as fast as you can for five reps. Do five sets of this three times a week.








Remember to have proper mechanics.
Don’t practice swinging with a heavier bat or you could alter your swing.
 Your swing should be compact for maximum speed. Walk to a fence and then measure out the proper length of your swing from the fence. Swing your bat by the fence. If you hit the fence, then your swing is dragging too long.


Do three sets of twenty reps three times a week.
This drill works best with a chain link fence. It could damage a wood fence.
 Switch the position of your hands. Have someone toss a ball up and practice driving it into the net. This will help you learn how to snap your wrists at the end of your swing and get the most out of the torque energy your body generates.

 Assume a normal batting stance and have a friend toss up a ball. Practice swinging the club of your bat through the ball. Really focus your attention on the club of your bat. This drill will help you follow through with your swing. If you don’t swing through the ball, you can’t have a smooth swing.

, Carefully bend the triangular part of the wire hanger into the shape of a circle.
 Floral sprays are made up of individual sprigs or sections attached to a central stem. For this method of making a wreath, you need to separate the sprigs. Look for the point at which each sprig is attached to the stem. Using the wire cutters, clip each sprig from the stem.
 Starting at the top of the hanger, near the hook, attach the sprigs to the hanger with floral tape.









Hold a floral sprig with the flowers pointing to the left.
Lay it against the hanger at about a 140Â° angle.
Holding the stem and the wire together, wrap a piece of florist tape around both.
Lay a second sprig to the right of the first, close enough that the flowers are touching and the stems are overlapping. Wrap with florist tape.
Working clockwise, continue attaching sprigs and taping them to the hanger, until the hanger is completely covered

, If you like, wrap some florist tape around the hook so that it blends in with the rest of the wreath. You could also make a bow with some ribbon for a final touch. Your wreath is now ready to hang.

 In general, it is good advice to keep at least two pairs of clippers on hand at all times. You will need one shearing clipper to use for wide areas of clipping, and a smaller clipper for sensitive areas such as around the face.
 When cutting anything, the sharper the blade the easier the process. If you are using brand new clippers, you probably won’t have to sharpen the blades. If you are Using older clippers or blades, send to have the blades sharpened or do it yourself at home.
 Make sure there is nothing on the blades that might slow or impede their process; dirt and mud buildup will make clipping take much longer. When the blades are clean, coat them with oil and allow the clippers to run for 10-20 seconds. This will make them run smoother as you’re clipping.
 You want your clippers to be running at room temperature; if they get hot, the motor is overheating and they won’t work as well. If your clippers are ever hot, turn them off and let them cool down for several minutes before attempting to use them again.

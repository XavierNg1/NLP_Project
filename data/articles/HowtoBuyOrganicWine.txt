 For a wine to be labeled “Organic” and bear the USDA organic seal, it must be made from organically grown grapes and give information about who the certifying agency is. A wine in this category cannot have any added sulfites. It may have naturally occurring sulfites, but the total sulfite level must be less than 20 parts per million., The classifications below apply to wines produced in the United States.


”100 Percent Organic” printed on the label means that the wine was made from 100% organically grown grapes and does not contain added sulfites.
”Organic” printed on the label means the wine was made from at least 95% organically grown grapes. The other 5% of the ingredients in the wine were not produced organically, or another ingredient, such as yeast, was added.
”Made with organic ingredients,” “Made with organic grapes” or “Organically grown” printed on the label means the wine contains at least 70% organic ingredients. The other 30% of ingredients were not grown organically.
 Sulfite (sulfur dioxide) is used as a preservative in wines. Many wines are made from 100% organic grapes, but they may contain a small amount of sulfites. Wine exported to the United States, even though it is made from organic grapes, cannot be labeled “organic.”If the total sulfites in a bottle of wine are above 10 parts per million, the label must state that the wine contains sulfites. If that is the case, you may not want to purchase the wine, even if it is made from organic grapes. Look for a statement on the label that says, “No added sulfites.” That doesn’t mean it is sulfite-free, but it does mean there are probably some naturally occurring sulfites in the wine due to the fermentation process.
 There are many small family-owned vineyards that grow organic grapes and bottle organic wine, but they don’t get themselves certified. Why? The certification process is restrictive and the costs are prohibitive.

 For most cars, you can find the VIN in one or more locations:Look on the dashboard, in the far left corner just under the windshield. It is usually easiest to see this from the outside, looking in the windshield.
Look on the front of the engine block. Open the hood and look toward the front of the engine and you should find it on a metal plate.
Look in the rear wheel well on the driver's side. The VIN may be located by looking directly up inside the wheel well.
Look inside the driver's door, either under the side mirror or at the door handle. The VIN may be located either near where the door latches or directly under the side mirror.

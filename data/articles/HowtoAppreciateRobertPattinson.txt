 Robert Pattinson did not start his career as a vampire, so appreciate what he's done in the past, as well as future media.


Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: plays as Cedric Diggory, a student above Harry Potter.
The Bad Mother's Handbook: a BBC TV drama, Robert plays as Daniel Gale, a quiet schoolmate whom is befriended by a rebellious teenage girl with her own family problems.
How to Be: comedy/drama movie, he plays Art (Arthur), whom is trying to find his "self" during a life crisis, including a relationship breakup, jobs, and a relationship void between himself and his parents.
Remember Me: executive producer to this drama film, he plays a troubled adolescence and falls in love with a girl that has a similar life background.;
, Two of his songs, "Never Think" and "Let Me Sign" are featured in the movie "Twilight", as well as the soundtrack. In addition, he has contributed three songs to "How to Be" soundtrack. He has stated in many interviews that he does think about composing music in the future.
 It's reasonable to say that until it comes out of his mouth in a physical interview or professional source website, not to believe any dating rumors between him and his co-stars, such as Kristen Stewart. When he doesn't answer love life questions, please respect that.
 No one is literally perfect when it comes to hygiene or fashion. With busy and hectic schedules, he's also known for wearing the same clothes or not washing his hair. He prefers the fashion of Marc Jacobs.
 Appreciate him the most by watching segments or appearances that he makes, such as the "Today Show", "The Daily Show with John Stewart", and "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon".
 These only view an actor's or actress's looks and acting performance. Look outside the box and appreciate more than that.

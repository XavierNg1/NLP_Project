 Stretch marks during pregnancy are very common. As at other times in life, there is little that can be done to directly prevent them. However, they will often fade in time, and you can take many steps to reduce the chance of stretch marks. Watching your weight, eating right, exercising, and other standard advice to counter stretch marks all apply during pregnancy as well, with some slight modifications.
 Your weight gain in pregnancy should be slow and gradual. Gaining 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy is a rough expectation.The exact amount you may gain depends on your pre-pregnancy weight and other factors, so talk to your doctor about what kind of weight gain to expect.


During pregnancy, avoid the conventional wisdom that you are “eating for two.”Your eating habits should not change much, even while you are pregnant. Focus on eating a variety of healthy foods that are rich in vitamins adrenals.
Typically, doctors recommend eating approximately 300 calories more than normal during your second and third trimesters. You should continue to select foods that are healthy and rich in vitamins E, C, B2, and B3 as well as zinc and dietary silica to promote skin health (as described above). In addition, your doctor may prescribe a daily multivitamin to ensure you get enough of the right nutrients.
 Drink 8-12 glasses (approximately 2 liters) of water per day during pregnancy to stay hydrated and to promote good skin.Avoid products containing caffeine, as these can increase urine production and lead to dehydration.
 Creams containing vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin A, as well as ointments like cocoa butter and lanolin cannot prevent stretch marks entirely. However, they do help repair skin tissue damaged by stretch marks.Use these products as desired for dry, irritated, or damaged skin.


Retinoid creams are thought to lessen the appearance of existing stretch marks. However, these are not safe for use during pregnancy.

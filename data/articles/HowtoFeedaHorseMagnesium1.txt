 In order to provide your horse with the correct amount of magnesium, you will need to know how much your horse weighs. Depending on its age and breed, your horse could weigh anywhere from 840 to 1210 lb. (380 to 550 kilograms). Your veterinarian should have a scale to weigh your horse on.;
, To begin with, try giving your horse 10 grams (1/3 ounce) of magnesium supplement a day. This should be safe regardless of the type of supplement used. If you feel that more is needed, consult with a veterinarian before increasing the dosage.If you increase the dose, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions. This usually involves calculating a dosage based upon your horse’s weight and diet, which can be complicated. Consult with your veterinarian before increasing the dosage.If you decide to dose the horse yourself, understand that increasing the dosage may result in diarrhea and dehydration. This could make your horse very ill and possibly kill it.
 Once you have determined the correct amount of supplement to add, mix it into your horse’s feed. If it is grain, stir the supplement into the mix. You may also sprinkle it on their hay. However, they will ingest much less of the magnesium this way.These supplements all come in powder form and generally need to mixed with your horses feed or another food.
Avoid mixing magnesium supplements with oils. The oil may bond the magnesium and make it more difficult for the horse to absorb., If you are giving your horse a bitter magnesium supplement, like magnesium oxide, you may want to consider mixing it with molasses or applesauce to mask the bad flavor. If you do not mix it with something, your horse will not eat the supplement.
 If you do not want to mix the magnesium with your horse’s feed, you can also get a mineral block. These are typically designed for cattle, which require less trace minerals than a horse, but they can provide some help.

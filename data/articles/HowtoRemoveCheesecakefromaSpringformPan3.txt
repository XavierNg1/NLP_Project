 If you haven't yet baked your cake, this trick will make removing the pan much easier. Cut out a circle of parchment paper slightly larger than the base of the springform pan you're using. Press it into the bottom of the assembled springform pan. You'll bake the cake on top of the parchment, rather than directly on the pan. This way you can just slide the bottom of the cake off the pan with the parchment, which looks a lot less noticeable than a metal base.


Some chefs also like to use a cardboard cutout to lend the cake a little more support. Cut out a piece of cardboard the same size as the base of the springform pan. Press a piece of parchment paper over the cardboard.
If you want to line the sides of the pan with parchment as well, cutÂ  a strip long enough to wrap around the inside of the pan and slightly thicker than the depth of the pan. Now you can make your cheesecake as normal, and when it is completely chilled the cake can be removed with ease from the pan.
 The presence of parchment won't change anything about the baking process. Go ahead and bake the cheesecake as usual.
 Even parchment won't save a cheesecake that's still warm when you try to remove it from the pan. Be sure it's thoroughly chilled before you try to lift away the sides or bottom.
 If you didn't line the sides with parchment, run a knife dipped in hot water around the edges of the cake to loosen it, then unclick the pan's sides and lift them away. If you did line the sides with parchment, you can skip the knife trick and simply take off the sides of the pan. Then very gently pull away the strip of parchment to reveal the cake underneath.
 Grasp the edge of the parchment paper and gently slide the cake onto a serving plate. The parchment will lift easily from the bottom of the springform pan.

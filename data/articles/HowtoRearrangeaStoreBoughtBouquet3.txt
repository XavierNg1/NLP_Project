 What you place the flowers in is just as important as how you arrange them. Decide what you want to place your flowers in. You may choose a vase, a bucket, a mason jar, or anything else you believe would look pretty with flowers inside., The size of the container influences how you arrange the bouquet. The size of the bouquet also determines the type of container you need. If you have already bought a bouquet, look at the amount of flowers and the size of the stems. Decide if you need a larger container or a smaller one.


If you don’t have a large container, you can spread the flowers among multiple smaller containers.
If you only have large containers, make sure to buy enough flowers to fill the container so it doesn’t look sparse.
Tiny vases can’t hold a lot of flowers. Short and wide vases may need stems that are cut shorter.
 If you have trouble with your flower arrangement staying in place when you place it in the vase, use scotch tape. Place four pieces of tape over the mouth of your vase in a grid pattern. Two pieces should go horizontally, and two should go vertically.When you place the flowers into the vase, separate them into sections and place them in the holes in the tape. This will help keep the flowers from shifting or falling over.

 You must have access to that person's computer. Try this when they're out of the room or you know that you have a few minutes alone.


Open a link from an email or a Help menu to launch the default browser.
 The process for accessing the password manager is different depending on the browser you are using.


Internet Explorer - Click the Gear button or the Tools menu and select "Internet Options." Click the "Content" tab and then click the "Settings" button in the AutoComplete section. Select "Manage Passwords" from the new window.
Chrome - Click the Chrome Menu button (☰) and select "Settings." Click the "Show advanced settings" link and then scroll to the "Passwords and forms" section. Click "Manage passwords."
Firefox - Click the Firefox Menu button (☰) and select "Options." Click the "Security" tab and then click "Saved Passwords."
Safari - Click the Safari menu and select "Preferences." Click the "Passwords" tab.
 Use the search bar in the password manager to search for "google". This is the quickest way to narrow down the list of passwords. Look for the "accounts.google.com" entry for the target's Gmail address.
 Select the password and then click the "Show" or "Show Password" button. You may have to enter the administrator password for the computer before the passwords are displayed.
 Make note of the password as well as the exact Gmail address. Close the password manager when you are done to cover your tracks.
 If the target has not enabled two-factor authentication, then you should be able to access the account. The target will likely be notified that a login has occurred from an unknown browser.


If the target has two-factor authentication activated, then you will need the code that is sent to their mobile device. There is no way around this if it is activated.

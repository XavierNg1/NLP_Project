 Even where you are allowed hike with your dog without a leash, do not allow your dog to run around everywhere. This could crush precious wildflowers and fragile soil structures. Additionally, traveling off of the trail can get you both lost. Make sure that both you and your dog stick to the hiking trail., Before you head out on a hike, think about your dog's temperament. If you know that your dog likes to pick a fight, keep them restricted on a leash. It is very likely that you will encounter other people and dogs on the trail, so try to be prepared., Many wilderness areas contain predators—such as bears, snakes, or mountain lions. Research the predators that may exist in your area, and take necessary precautions.If you are hiking in an area with bears, always carry bear spray. Also, it is safest to hikes in groups of three people.
If you are hiking in an area with poisonous snakes, watch the trail and avoid stepping on one. You can also carry a snake bite kit.
If you are hiking in an area with mountain lions, avoid hiking at dawn and dusk, and avoid running on the trail.
 Both you and your dog should drink frequently. Drinking water at least once every half an hour is appropriate during an average hike. Bring your own water along, and avoid drinking (or allowing your dog to drink) from unfiltered water sources., Anytime you or your dog feel fatigued, it is important to rest. Don’t try to overexert yourself or your pet. Take a seat, catch your breath, and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

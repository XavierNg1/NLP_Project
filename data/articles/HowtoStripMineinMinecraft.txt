 You will want an entrance to your mine, which will be pretty far down; Y=12, to be exact. Also craft a stack or more torches, for obvious reasons.
 You WILL power through stone pickaxes, while actually digging an entrance to the mine, and digging the mines themselves. Bring along a crafting table too, so you can make more as you need them, Yes, yes, I know, the number one rule of Minecraft is to NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN. But if you stand on the edge of both blocks, you can dig on both, and unless both are gone, you won't potentially fall to your death in lava or something. Place ladders on every block so you can get back up. On the other side of your two block tunnel, place a torch every 3 blocks, Like this:Torch (place the next torch on the fourth block) Once you have reached level 12, dig a 1x1x1 hole on the same side as the torches, NOT THE SIDE WITH THE LADDERS. Fill this hole up with water, making for a quick trip down, and the ladders for back up., This will ensure that you will only dig the space you need. Keep digging in this manner, and place a torch every 11 blocks, so like this: (Legend: % = 1 block) Torch %%%%%%%%%%% Torch,

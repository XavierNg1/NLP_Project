 The most basic way to accept payment through PayPal is to create a personal account on the PayPal website. Creating a personal account allows you to link an e-mail to the PayPal service that can be used to accept money as well as pay money for items and services. The person paying you would need to go to the PayPal website and select Send Money. After entering their e-mail and account information, they would then send the money to the e-mail you provided. The person paying you can use either their credit card or their bank account to send payment. After the transaction completes, you could then transfer the money from your PayPal account and into your checking or savings accounts. This option is very useful when accepting payments for work provided or one time payments for selling items through classifieds or auction sites.;
, If you are trying to sell items through your own business or from your website, PayPal allows you to set up a business account. Go to the website, select sign up, and after entering your information make sure to select the premier or business account option. The differences between the two depends on whether you are an individual selling items or a company selling items, so choose according to your need. After your account is confirmed, PayPal will allow you to create buttons that tie in to your products. It will ask that you set the price for your product and then give you the code to place on your website. When the button is clicked, users of your website will be able to pay you for the product using cash or their credit card. Just like with a personal account, these payments can then be placed in your bank account like any other cash transaction.


Read the PayPal agreement closely. Depending on the amount of transactions and type of business you are running, PayPal will charge you different fees. Each transaction made through PayPal is subject to a flat fee as well as a percentage of the sale. For example, if you are selling many smaller items, choosing the micro payment pricing option will charge you .05 cents a transaction and 5% of the total transaction cost. If you are selling larger cost items, the default transaction fees will be .30 cents per transaction and between 1.9% and 2.9% of the total cost of the sale.
 A third option that PayPal offers is the ability to accept donations. Adding a donation button to your website is done the same way as adding a payment button. The difference is that the donation button allows users to enter their own transaction amount. While transactions through this method are still subject to PayPal fees, PayPal does offer discounts for legally registered non-profit organizations.

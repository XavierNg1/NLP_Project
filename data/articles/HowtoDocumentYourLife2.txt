 Whether it's with your cell phone, an SLR, dSLR, or that old point and shoot, don't forget to take photos. Keep your camera around or on yourself to be sure that you don't miss a good photo opportunity.
 Even if you get on other's nerves (or your own nerves), later you will be glad that you were that person.
 These should be images that you think represent a pivotal point in your life.
 Lightroom, GIMP, Zoner Photo Studio Pro, and many others are available. Some will do more than others.

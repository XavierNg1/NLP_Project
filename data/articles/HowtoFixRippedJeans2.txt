 Mending a torn seam should be approached differently than a regular tear; the fabric in seams is usually much more reinforced than the rest of the pant legs. While this can make it more challenging than stitching regular fabric together, mending a seam rip will look much better in the end; if done correctly, it'll be near-impossible to tell there was a problem to begin with!

, In the vast majority of cases, you'll find a torn seam is a few centimetres at most. Unless the tear is miniscule or much more significant, it is generally good form to cut a length of thread that's around the length of your arm. Seam stitches tend to be very tightly woven, and the thread will disappear faster than you might think. If you even up with excess at the end of mending, you ca always cut the extra thread off at the end.


Make sure to choose a thread that resembles the existing stitching as closely as possible. This doesn't always match up with the colour of the jeans themselves-- some denim brands tend to prefer golden thread. Choosing a close colour will make the repairs look harder to recognize.
 Hold the fabric and the broken seam together and slowly stitch them back together. It is highly recommended that you try to follow the pre-existing stitch pattern. The closer you're able to get to replicating that pattern, the harder it will be for anyone to detect there was a repair in the first place.


You'll need a stronger needle to penetrate the thicker seam fabric.
 Once you've sewn shut the extent of the tear, you should take some scissors and cut off any excess thread as close as you can.
 It's always good measure to iron out the seam once you're done with the sewing. This will smooth out any creases in the thread and help seal in your repairs.

 Unlike a set of towels, a cutlery collection, or a kitchen appliance, checks are small and lightweight, and consequently easy to misplace. If the wedding couple opens their gifts (or their cards) during the reception, your check could easily be lost or misplaced. To avoid this confusion, mail the check, either before or after the wedding.Concerning wedding etiquette, it’s appropriate to mail a check any time before the wedding, or shortly after the wedding. Do not wait more than three months post-wedding to mail the check.If you mail the check, address it to a permanent address where you know one or both members of the couple will receive the check.;
, If you’re flying or driving across the country—or even across the state line—to attend this wedding, it may be impractical and expensive to bring a large, bulky gift with you.In instances like this, a check is the more convenient and practical option.


If you’re traveling to a destination wedding, giving a check can solve much of the hassle associated with bringing a gift to a distant location.
 Consider giving the couple a gift card to a place that has personal meaning to one or both of them. The gift card could be to one of their favorite stores or restaurants. Gift cards do not need to be physically taken to the bank and cashed, which makes them much more convenient for the recipient.


If you know where the couple has registered—for example, Target or Bed Bath and Beyond—you can purchase a gift card to that location, so the couple can purchase items on their registry if they choose to.

 Instead, try dark oiled tack. Believe it or not judges don't judge the class on the color of your tack. In English everyone's tack matches right? Well, white bridles and tack can be purchased. These look nice, especially on dark horses.
 Only use them on short tailed horses, or horses with pieces of their tails missing. Most horses do fine without them.

 If you are sharing your bed prior to purchasing a water mattress, make sure to include your bed partner in the purchase process. You both need to be comfortable with the amount of support, movement, and temperature associated with the water bed. Try out mattresses together, and choose one that best meets both of your needs., If you already own a water bed and are now sharing with a partner, the adjustment process can be more difficult. If you have a full motion mattress, you may need to invest in a mattress with a higher waveless rating when sharing space with others. In some cases, you may also be able to purchase mattress covers or retainers that reduce motion. If temperature is your concern, you can use extra padding to reduce heat for one partner or the other., If you and your partner are similar in size and weight, the mattress selection process is less difficult. However, if you and your partner are significantly different heights or weights, the selection may be more complicated as a see-saw effect can occur where the weight of one partner lifts the other during sleep. In these cases, a dual mattress may be your best option. These can be fitted into a hard sided or soft sided frame, but they allow you and your bed partner to specify your own comfort levels. Additionally, your movements will not have a dramatic effect on your partner compared with a single water mattress., Rather than a single or double flat mattress, you can also have a series of connected tubules. This reduces movement overall, and because each tube is separated, your weight and movement have less effect on your partner. These mattresses are typically thinner than other water beds, and while they have higher waveless ratings, they do not offer the same level of support available from traditional water beds with fiber layers. Youâ€™re also more likely to touch the bottom of your bed frame.

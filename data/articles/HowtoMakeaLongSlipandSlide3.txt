 Use a shovel to clear an area that is 10 by 100 feet (3.05 by 30.48 meters). Add an extra 40 feet (12.92 meters) at the beginning for your "runway." Make sure that there are no rocks or shells in this 10 by 140-foot (3.05 by 42.67-meter) strip.For best results, choose something with a slight incline.
Walk over the area and pat it down with your hands. This is important. Any sharp shells or rocks can not only cut the plastic but also you.
 Buy a roll of plastic that is 10 to 12 feet (3.05 to 3.66 meters) wide and 100 feet long (30.48 meters). Make sure that you use thick, heavy-duty plastic, about 6-mil. Don't use the thin kind just because it is cheap; it will rip and tear., You can do this by burying them in sand, about 1 to 2 feet (30.48 to 60.96 centimeters) on each side. You can also drive landscaping anchor pins into the edges instead. Use a hammer to drive the pins into the sand so that they don't stick out. Keep them 5 to 10 feet (1.52 to 3.05 meters) apart., This will lubricate the plastic and make it even easier to glide along it. Use environmentally-friendly soap, if you can, such as unscented castile soap., If you have access to a hose with fresh water, use that if possible. If you don't, grab some buckets and start gathering water from the sea. Pour enough water onto the plastic to make it wet.

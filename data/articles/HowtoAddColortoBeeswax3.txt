 To make molds with beeswax, you will need resin which you can purchase online or at a craft store. Resin helps protect beeswax from heat damage during the melting process. Mix one part resin with eight parts beeswax in a can. Place the can in a pot filled with hot water until the mixture melts.So your colors come out as vibrant as possible, use white or bleached beeswax.
 Once your beeswax is melted, pour it into cans. You can divide the beeswax evenly or use more or less beeswax depending on how many molds you want in a particular color., You can buy pigments online or at a craft store. To get the color you want, simply mix pigments in with the beeswax until you get your desired color. Start with a small amount of beeswax and add the pigment gradually until it changes to the color you want., You can buy molds online in your desired shape. Pour the beeswax mixture into the molds. Allow the beeswax to sit until it hardens. Times will vary depending on the size and shape of your mold.

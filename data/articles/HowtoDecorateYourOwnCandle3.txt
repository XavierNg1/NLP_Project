 One will be your base candle, the one you'll decorate, and the others will be melted down so you can use the wax. Keeping this in mind, choose candles with colors that complement each other.
 You can use different-colored wax to dye half of the candle a different color, make a polka dot design, or create random, modern art-esque shapes. Have a plan in mind before you start melting wax, since it tends to harden quickly.
 Choose one color to work with first. Melt the wax in a wax warmer or place it in a microwave-safe bowl and zap it for a few minutes. When the wax has melted, handle it very carefully - melted wax can burn your hands if you aren't careful.


Place the container of wax on a paper towel or cloth so that it doesn't get on your furniture.
You may want to work in the kitchen or bathroom to minimize the mess.
 You can dip the candle in the colored wax or use a paintbrush to paint on a design. When you're finished using one color, heat a second candle and create a wax design using that color. You'll see that the wax hardens very quickly.


Colored wax tends to make translucent, watercolor-like patterns.
For best results, use only two or so extra wax colors. If you use too many, the candle could start to look messy.

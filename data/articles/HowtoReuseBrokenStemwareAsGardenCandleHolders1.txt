 The idea for this project is to use glasses which have broken stems or bases only and that still have intact bowls. Do not use glasses with jagged cut tops or broken shards. While you don’t need the glass to be in perfect condition, it does need to be free of cracks and other vulnerable areas that could make it prone to further damage. Also ensure that you choose the right stemware. For example : A champagne flute can't be used because it's too thin unless if you have a thin candle.


There muse be enough of a stem left to stick into the ground. If not, you'll need to glue a dowel or something similar onto the glass bowl to make up for the lack of a stem.;
, Sand down the broken glass stem edge to reduce the chance for any cuts. The stem should stay sharp enough to pierce through the dirt and hold its own in your garden but not so sharp it cuts you., Give them a quick trip through soapy water, followed by a good rinse and thorough drying.

 Add a pot to the stove filled with water. The pot should be big enough to hold the celery, but don't add it yet. Salt the water, and then let it heat to boiling. You'll need to turn it to high heat to get it to boil. Turn the oven on to 400 degrees Fahrenheit., Wash the celery thoroughly. Cut the celery hearts in half, lengthwise. Also trim off the brown ends. Peel the onion and garlic, then slice it. Wash and cut the lemon into slices. Parboil the celery by adding it to the water once it starts to boil. You'll only cook it for about 3 minutes. Drain off the water, and use paper towels to dry the celery. Place the celery in a baking dish., Add a tablespoon of oil to a medium skillet. Let it heat up a bit over medium heat, then throw in the onions. Add a dash of salt. Let it cook a bit before adding the garlic. Let it cook together for a minute or two.The garlic will burn if you add it at the same time as the onion.
 Pour in the cup of stock. Chicken or vegetable stock is best for this recipe. Also add in the 1/4 cup of white wine and the 2 tablespoons of lemon. Let it come to a boil, mixing with the onions and garlic.If you don't have white wine, you can use dry vermouth, white wine vinegar, or a bit more stock., Carefully spoon or pour the liquid over the celery in the baking dish, being sure to get the garlic and onions, too. Add a dash of salt and pepper. Layer the lemon over the top. Make sure the dish is covered, then set it in the oven., Take the celery out of the oven. Let it cool for a bit before taking the celery out. Place the liquid back into the skillet boil. Let it cook down about halfway. Once it's done, add it back to the celery. Add the parsley and the tablespoon of oil on top, along with a grind of fresh pepper.You can use dried parsley if you don't have fresh, but add it to the liquid as you're reducing it.
This dish is best served cold. You can also serve it at room temperature.

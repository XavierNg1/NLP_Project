 Make sure your table or figure is really needed. Does it add anything to the paper? Does it make the information clearer? If it is just taking up space, delete it.;
, The reader should not need to refer to the text to understand it.


Place any tables or figures as close to the relevant text as possible. Always introduce the graph or figure in the text.
 Graphs, tables, and figures do not need to be overly complicated to be effective. In fact, they are probably more effective with a simple design, as the date or information is the star of the show.
 Use appendices for related information that does not directly correspond to the text.


For instance, if a graph provides population information from the last ten years but you are focusing on the last year primarily, the graph doesn’t necessarily need to be in the text.
Place it at the end of the paper, and reference it as needed.
 Most of the time, you will place graphs and figures in the main body of the text only, not in the introduction or conclusion.


That’s because your introduction and conclusion provide an overview of what you are saying, not the nitty-gritty details that graphs and figures provide.

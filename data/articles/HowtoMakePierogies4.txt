 Divide into 4 pieces.


Use a large amount of flour while rolling. Roll to a thickness of approximately 1/16” (1mm).
Cut 3” (7.5cm) circles from the rolled dough. Coat well in flour.
 Divide the fillings equally centered in each circle. Don't try to overfill – if you do, simply remove some of the filling (use the first successfully filled pierogie to guide filling the rest). About a scant teaspoon is suitable for each pierogie.


Work through filling them methodically; if it's easier, sit down. Have a suitable surface to place the filled pierogie on, such as the clean tea towel shown in this image.
 (Keep flouring your hands.) Pinch really well and firmly, even if you have to do it several times; you don't want the filling to spill out when cooking!


If wished, use a fork to press down the edges neatly.
 Pat some more flour on every pierogie to prevent them from sticking together. If necessary, add some more warm water to the dough, as adding flour makes each pierogie drier.
 Once the water is boiling, drop some of the pierogi in the water. Don't overcrowd the pierogi - allow moving room. When they float to the surface, let them boil for approximately 1-2 minutes more.


Fish them out with a strainer or slotted spoon. Place them on trays lined with wax paper; do not let them touch or they'll stick together.
If not eating immediately, place the pierogi in the fridge if you're eating them shortly; or freeze with wax layers between them, then remove frozen pierogi from wax and place into sealed freezer bags.
 Either add the topping direct, or provide a range of toppings for diners to select from. Some suggestions include: melted butter, fried bacon pieces, fried onions (chopped finely) or sour cream. Some people prefer no topping at all, as they're delicious enough on their own!


Serve with a salad.

 If you're Tweeting about going somewhere, or how much you enjoyed your lunch, people may not be interested. Despite having a boring Twitter page, think about if your Tweet is really worth Tweeting.;
, If your Tweets are interesting, people will follow you. Don't ask for lots of Follow backs. That doesn't make your account interesting and it wastes your limited Tweets.
 Tweet fun facts, pictures and more, don't just mention people!

, You may give 5 people on average a day a shoutout. This is great, but you may want to limit yourself. Too many shoutouts will get boring and only one person will enjoy that Tweet -- the person who got the shoutout.
 Maybe you should try counting your Tweets. Know that after 500 Tweets, your already halfway to Tweet limit. Pace yourself.
 Don't Tweet celebrities to follow you. People will get tired of your account and chances are, the celebrity won't see that Tweet.
 Direct Messaging is private, and nobody else can see except you, and the person who you are chatting with. These are limited to 140 characters each message, just like each Tweet, but they won't show up as Tweets on your account and there is a more likely chance of them reading it than if you Tweet them. You may DM up to 1,000 people a day. The times you leave a message are not limited.
 Maybe you want to say how great you like pastel nail polish and ask everyone how they were. Instead of Tweeting once about the nail polish and another time asking how everyone is, you can Tweet "I love pastel nail polish! Anyone else? How is everyone by the way? Tweet me!"

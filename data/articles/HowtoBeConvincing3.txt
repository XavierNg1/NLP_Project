 Overblown language can pop up even when speaking, but it has a tendency to pop up in writing even more frequently. Don’t be afraid to write simply. Remember that your goal is to seem clear and convincing. If your audience doesn’t understand your writing, it might seem that you are hiding something or don’t really have anything to say.Don’t use lofty language when it’s not appropriate. For instance, if you can say “improve” instead of “ameliorate,” then consider doing so.
If you use technical terms like “synergy,” make sure they are ones that your audience knows and uses.
Likewise, if you use slang or informal language, make sure your audience will understand what you mean.
 Writing something that is sloppy, filled with errors and typos, or not formatted correctly will cause you to seem the opposite of convincing. Show your readers that you are credible and mean what you say by polishing your writing.Always proofread before submitting something.
Back up claims with specific evidence whenever possible.
Cite any sources of information you have used.
 Showing your personality and coming across as natural in writing is more challenging than doing so while speaking. This is because readers will not have the ability to see you and read your body language. Try to do everything you can to have your writing show who you are, and what you are trying to convey.For instance, if you are writing a college admissions essay, don’t just say that you want to become a doctor because you think that sounds good to admissions committees. Instead, paint a picture of what your interests and goals really are, no matter what you think someone else wants to read.
Have someone you trust read your writing, and tell you if it “sounds like you.”

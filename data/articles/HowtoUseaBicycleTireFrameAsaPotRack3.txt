,, Fasten your chain onto a set of two spokes, over both spokes, where they cross, so the chain won't go sliding down the length of a spoke.
 Aim to form a cross (see the image for guidance).
 The chain should slide easily through the hook and be suspended from the ceiling.


If the chain is too long after hanging it, use steel cutters and snip the chain, allowing for a full link to be available for hanging.

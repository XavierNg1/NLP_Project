 Set it on top of the newspaper.


Only remove one fish at a time. Keep the remaining fish cold in the cooler while you work.
 Hold it firmly by the head and scrape the scales from the tail toward the gills with a butter knife or scaling tool. Test for the right pressure; the scales should come loose easily and fly off.


Keep the strokes of your scaler short and quick. Avoid pressing too hard and gashing the fish.
Work carefully around the fins, since they can prick or puncture your skin.
Be sure to remove all of the scales from both sides of the fish. Don't forget the scales around the pectoral and dorsal fins, and up to the throat, which is the edge of the fish's gills.
 Use your hose, or the faucet provided by the marina. The pressure should be just strong enough to remove loose scales; avoid blasting the fish with water, as the meat inside is delicate.

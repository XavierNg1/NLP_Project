 Take the measurements for your sofa's length and width, as well as the length and width of the arms. You'll need to know these in order to know what size cover to buy. You'll also want to take note of what style of couch you have and who the manufacturer is. There might be an official slipcover made especially for your couch, such as if it is from Ikea. If not, the general shape of your couch should inform what style of cover you buy.


For example, if your couch has scroll-style arms, you'll want to find a slipcover with ties at the front so that you can gather the material and maintain the round shape of the arm.
 Sofa covers are readily available at home supply, furniture, and upholstery stores. Consult the cover's packaging or a sales associate to make sure the cover is the right size. You'll want to err on the side of caution: if you're unsure on the sizing, try to get something that's slightly too large, instead of something that might be slightly too small.
 Drape the cover over your sofa so that its edges fall evenly to the ground. Tuck any excess fabric into the cushions. There may be special instructions included with your sofa cover, in which case you should be sure to read and follow them.

 Looking at message information is not as reliable of an indicator as using test calls. However, some information displayed underneath iMessages can be helpful in determining if someone has blocked you.;
, Check underneath the last message you sent.
 Many users have read receipts turned on, so if you no longer see "Read at..." underneath your sent messages you might have been blocked, or the person may have turned off read receipts.
 If you used to see "Delivered" when messages were sent and no longer do, you might have been blocked.


The "Delivered" receipt is known to show inconsistently, so this method may not always be reliable., Using a test phone call is one of the more reliable indicators as to whether or not someone has blocked you.
 If you hear exactly one ring and are then sent to voicemail, you may have been blocked.


Just because your call goes straight to voicemail doesn't mean you have been blocked. Your contact's phone may be dead.
 If you receive the same result after calling a couple times, it's a good indicator that the person you're trying to reach has blocked you or has a dead phone.


Users are not notified if they are receiving a phone call from a blocked number.
 You can use a masked number to double check the status of another person's phone.
 Doing so will start a call without your contact information appearing to the recipient.
 Many people avoid answering calls from blocked numbers, but if you hear the call going through like a normal call should, you may have been blocked.


If the call goes directly to voicemail after one ring, your contact's phone may be dead.

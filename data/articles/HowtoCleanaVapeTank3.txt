 Weekly cleanings are important to prevent damage or unnecessary wear of your device. Consistent cleaning will also prevent older e-juice from collecting in your vape tank, which can negatively affect the quality of your vaping experience., Cleaning is important between different types and flavors of e-juice. If you don’t clean the tank fully when you switch to a new flavor, you may experience “flavor ghosting,” or the taste of a previous flavor mixed into a new flavor.Even if your tank appears empty, e-juice from the previous load has formed a layer on the walls of the tank and is still contained in the wick and coil of your device. In order to remove the flavor, the tank must be cleaned.
 Many vaping setups house the wick and heating coil that are used to produce vapor near or within the vape tank. Accordingly, you’ll usually be cleaning these parts when you’re cleaning your tank. When you do so, make sure to check them for wear. The coil in particular should be changed regularly.If your tank includes o-rings, check them for damage or wear each time you clean the tank. Change the o-rings whenever you're uncertain about their condition.
If your vapor tastes burnt, even after a fresh cleaning, it’s likely time to replace the coil.
Other signs that the coil or another piece may need to be replaced include less vapor coming through your device, any leaks, or an unsatisfactory vape.

 Above, we've explained how to use a spoon to eat pasta. Though there's nothing "wrong" with doing this, it's not something Italians usually do.This can be considered a little "clumsy" or "childish," like using chopsticks to spear food and put it into your mouth.


However, it is common to use a fork with a spoon to serve pasta and toss it with sauce., Traditionally, spaghetti isn't cut or broken at any time while it's cooked or eaten.This means that you shouldn't break the spaghetti in half before you cook it in boiling water and that you shouldn't use your fork to cut spaghetti strands on your plate.If you find your spaghetti bundles too large, don't cut your spaghetti — just use fewer strands.
 This doesn't just look silly — it makes spaghetti awfully hard to eat. Digging right into the center of your spaghetti before you start winding your fork will leave you with an enormous, unwieldy bundle that will be very hard to get to your mouth without spills.


Avoiding this is simple. Just use your fork to gather a few strands at a time and separate them from the rest of the spaghetti before winding.
 To Italians, pasta isn't something you shovel into your mouth to satisfy your hunger. It's a dignified dish meant to be cooked properly, cherished, and savored. Use the following tips to eat your spaghetti respectfully:


Don't slurp strands of spaghetti into your mouth "Lady and the Tramp"-style. Instead, put small, tiny bundles in your mouth.
Don't pile food onto your plate next to your pasta. Pasta is best enjoyed by itself as a primo piatto (first course).
Eat slowly to avoid spills and drips, but don't lose your head if you make a mistake. It happens to everyone.

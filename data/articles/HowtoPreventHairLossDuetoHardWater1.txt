 Although it is unlikely that hard water will lead directly to hair loss, softening the water you use to wash your hair can help you have a healthy and strong head of hair. The most comprehensive way to do this is by lowering the mineral content of the water. Water softener machines are specifically designed to solve this problem.Water softeners are typically kept in basements or garages, and they work to reduce calcium and magnesium (limescale) in the water.If your home or apartment does not already have a water softener, you might consider buying one.
In some cases, you may also be able to rent a water softener in order to try it out before making the investment of buying one.;
, A much more practical and affordable option is just to get a filter for your shower head. These work in much the same way as a regular water filter, by neutralizing pH levels.You will need to replace your existing shower head, but this is a lot cheaper and easier than buying a full water softening system.


You may have to replace the actual filter inside the shower head every six months or so, but these are relatively inexpensive.
You can expect to pay between $10 and $45 for a filter in the US., One way to get softer water is set aside a bucket of water from the shower or tap which you will use to rinse your hair. Before you rinse, add a spoonful of alum to the bucket of water. The alum will help the minerals in the water to settle at the bottom.You can then scoop up water from the surface to rinse your hair.
This water will be less rich in minerals, and less hard.
You can find alum powder at the spice section of your grocery store.

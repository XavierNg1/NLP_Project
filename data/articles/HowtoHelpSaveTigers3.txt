 One of the major reasons tigers are endangered is because their home is being destroyed. Illegal logging and forest clearing are destroying the habitat that tigers live in, causing them to become displaced without enough food or land to sustain themselves.One way that you can help is by purchasing your goods from companies that only implement sustainable practices. You can also purchase 100% post-consumer recycled paper.
Look for paper and wood products that are approved by the international Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The goal of the FSC is to improve forest practices, and therefore end deforestation, around the world., Palm oil is a popular vegetable oil used in food and cosmetics. The palm oil industry has led to deforestation and the destruction of the tiger habitats. Only buy products that use palm oil from a sustainable source.Look for products with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) trademark.
 One major source of deforestation comes from the coffee industry. The next time you are purchasing some java, look for a brand that is sustainable. This means that they do not condone the practice of deforestation.Sustainable brands will have a certification on the box from an independent certifier, like Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, or UTZ Certified.
 Poaching is the number one threat to tigers. Never buy tiger products, either in your own country or while traveling abroad. This includes products made with tiger parts or tiger derivatives.Do not buy any traditional medicine that is made from tiger parts, such as tiger bone. Today some chemists still use tiger bone, even though it is illegal and a main part of the reason tigers are endangered.Poachers hunt these beautiful creatures illegally, so much so that there are now only an estimated 3,200 tigers left in the wild.

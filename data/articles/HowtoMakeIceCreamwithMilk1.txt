 Measure out each ingredient and add it to a medium-sized bowl. Use a large spoon to stir the ingredients together. Continue stirring until all of the sugar has dissolved.


For the milk, any level of fat will do, whether itâ€™s fat-free, 2% or full fat.
You can also experiment with chocolate milk to create chocolate ice cream.;
, If you have an ice cream making machine, pour the mixture into it. Turn it on and process the mixture for about 20 minutes until the mixture has significantly thickened. Pour the mixture in an airtight Tupperware container and put it in your freezer.
 Ice cream makers are nice, but using one is not necessary for this recipe. Pour the milk, sugar and vanilla mixture into a shallow dish that is freezer-safe. Place this dish into your freezer.
 The consistency of the ice cream can be improved by taking it out every 2 to 4 hours and stirring it around. Then place it back into your freezer.


If you used an ice cream maker, stir every 4 hours.
If you did not use an ice cream maker, stir every 2 to 4 hours after the initial ice crystals have formed.
 After about 8 hours (and periodic stirring) the ice cream should be fully frozen. It should have an ice cream-like consistency and is ready to serve immediately.
 Use an ice cream scoop to transfer the ice cream into serving bowls. Top with chocolate syrup, whipped cream, nuts, dried or canned fruit, and anything else you enjoy on your ice cream.


Return any leftovers to the freezer. They will keep for several days.

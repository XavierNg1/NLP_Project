 Have a look around, and see all the attractions. Visit Federation Square, tour the Melbourne Museum, look around and have fun!;
, Personally, not being a football fanatic, I don't know a lot about Australian Rules Football (AFL) but if in the right season (March to September), AFL at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG or "The G") is a must see for tourists and locals alike!

, Try to sample as much of the Melbourne food cuisine as you can, and enjoy yourself! Visit Victoria Market for a beautiful fresh taste.
 There is also an Australian animal zoo at Healesville and an African plains open range zoo at Werribee.
 St Kilda Beach is one of Melbourne's most popular beaches but Brighton Beach just south of St Kilda is also a great beach.
 To just chill out and people watch over coffee really is refreshing.
 Melbourne is unique for having many great cafes bars and restaurants located hidden in laneways. Some great ones are Hardware Ln, AC DC lane and Hosier lane; where you will find heaps of fantastic cafes, colorful graffiti art and hidden restaurants and bars.

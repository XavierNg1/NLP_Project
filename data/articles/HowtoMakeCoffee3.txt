 You will need a Chemex brewer, filter, medium-coarse ground coffee, and cups.
 Using a burr grinder, set it for a medium-coarse grind. You will want about 6 tablespoons of ground coffee when finished., Place a folded Chemex filter into the cone of the carafe, with the folds toward the spout.

Pour hot water through the filter to remove any paper flavor, and preheat the carafe. Let the water drain completely, then pour it out. Keep the filter sealed against the walls of the cone.
 Pour 6 tablespoons of the medium-ground coffee into the filter., Bring the water just to a boil, and pour only just enough into the filter to saturate the grounds. Move the stream of water around to saturate all the grounds evenly, but avoid pouring too much—you want very little water actually dripping through on the first pour. Let bloom for about 30 seconds., Pour water around the cone, breaking down the bloom and saturating all the grounds evenly. Fill the cone till the water's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the top, and let the water filter through the coffee, into the carafe., When you see about an inch of grounds clinging to the sides of the filter, fill the cone again, pouring around the sides to wash off the dry grounds back into the mix, and fill to the top of the cone., When the water has filtered through, remove the filter and put it where it can finish draining without making a mess., Serve your coffee, creamed and sweetened and flavored to your tastes. Good morning!

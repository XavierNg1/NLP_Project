 A .bin file is a binary file that can contain a wide variety of data. The most common form of a .bin file is a CD or DVD image. The file is created by copying the content of a CD into a single file that can be either burned onto a disc or mounted into a virtual drive.


.bin and .cue files need to have the same file name, and should be located in the same folder.;
, In order to mount or burn a .bin image, you must have a .cue file. The .cue file tells the mounting or burning software where the .bin file is located. Luckily, you can make or adjust a .cue file very easily.

 This might already be done. If not, use the rules of algebra to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side.

For example, for the equation y+1=x−1{\displaystyle y+1=x-1}, to isolate the y{\displaystyle y} variable, you would subtract 1 from both sides:y+1=x−1{\displaystyle y+1=x-1}y+1−1=x−1−1{\displaystyle y+1-1=x-1-1}y=x−2{\displaystyle y=x-2}


, Make sure you substitute the entire expression for the variable. This will give you an equation with only one variable, allowing you to solve for the variable.For example, if your first equation is 2x=20−2y{\displaystyle 2x=20-2y}, and you determined y=x−2{\displaystyle y=x-2} in the second equation, you would substitute x−2{\displaystyle x-2} for y{\displaystyle y} in the first equation:2x=20−2y{\displaystyle 2x=20-2y}2x=20−2(x−2){\displaystyle 2x=20-2(x-2)}


, To do this, move the variable to one side of the equation. Then, move the constants to one side of the equation. Then, isolate the variable using multiplication or division.

For example:2x=20−2(x−2){\displaystyle 2x=20-2(x-2)}2x=20−2x+4{\displaystyle 2x=20-2x+4}2x=24−2x{\displaystyle 2x=24-2x}2x+2x=24−2x+2x{\displaystyle 2x+2x=24-2x+2x}4x=24{\displaystyle 4x=24}4x4=244{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{4}}={\frac {24}{4}}}x=6{\displaystyle x=6}


, To do this, plug the value of the variable you already solved into one of the equations. This will give you an equation with only one variable. Solve for the variable using the rules of algebra. You can use either equation to solve for the remaining variable.

For example, if you found that x=6{\displaystyle x=6}, you can substitute 6 for x{\displaystyle x} in the second equation:y=x−2{\displaystyle y=x-2}y=(6)−2{\displaystyle y=(6)-2}y=4{\displaystyle y=4}


, Plug the values for both variables into one of the equations. If the equation is true, your solutions are correct.

For example, if you found that x=6{\displaystyle x=6} and y=4{\displaystyle y=4}, plug these back into the original equation and solve:2x=20−2y{\displaystyle 2x=20-2y}2(6)=20−2(4){\displaystyle 2(6)=20-2(4)}12=20−8{\displaystyle 12=20-8}12=12{\displaystyle 12=12}

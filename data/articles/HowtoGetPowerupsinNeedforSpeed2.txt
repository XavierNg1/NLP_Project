 On the game’s Main screen, click the “Play” button and press Enter on your keyboard to display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFSW world in Free Roam mode.
 You can do this by pressing “H” on your keyboard or by clicking the SafeHouse button on the top right-hand corner of the NFSW screen.
 Do this by clicking “Powerup Console” on the SafeHouse menu. In the Powerup Console, you will find two panes: the right-hand pane is the Event Mode pane and the left-hand pane is the Powerups pane.
 This will display the icons of different Powerups that can be used for such an event on the Powerups pane.


You can tell what Powerup each icon represents by hovering your mouse on it and reading the tooltip that appears.
 To recharge a Powerup using this method, you must be able to pay its SpeedBoost price. Your SpeedBoost balance is displayed on the top right-hand corner of the NFSW screen, and you can find out how much a Powerup costs by dragging its icon and hovering it on top of the Powerup Recharger box (located on the bottom right part of the Powerup Console screen) without releasing it. This will display the price next to the Recharger box.
 To recharge (purchase) a Powerup, drag its icon from the Powerups pane onto the Powerup Recharger box. If you have the required SpeedBoost balance, you will have instantly recharged/purchased that Powerup.

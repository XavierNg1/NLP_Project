 Most operating systems will automatically detect your new DVD drive. Drivers for the drive are typically installed automatically. Your operating system will inform you when the installation is complete.
 If your drive did not install itself, you may need to install the drivers that came with it or that you downloaded from the manufacturer. Follow the prompts to install the drivers. You may be asked to restart your computer after installation.
 Many drives come with packaged software that allows you to burn media to blank DVDs, or watch HD video. None of these are necessary, as there are free equivalents available online, but you can install these if you wish.

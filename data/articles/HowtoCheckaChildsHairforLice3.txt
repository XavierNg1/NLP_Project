 Find out from your child's school whether anyone in his or her grade has reported a lice inspection. You may want to ask other parents as well.
 Take note if your child or one of your child's friends engages in frequent head scratching or appears to have an itchy scalp or crawling sensations., You may also want to advise your child to avoid touching couches, chairs, or pillows that a person with lice has used., If your child has lice, there's a good chance you or someone else in your home may have been exposed to lice. If you are manually removing lice from your child's head, wear rubber gloves or thoroughly wash your hands afterward, as lice have been known in some cases to live underneath a host's fingernails before spreading to the head.
 Bedding, towels, hats, and recently worn clothes should be washed with hot, soapy water and put through a clothes dryer at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). You may also want to vacuum pillows and car seats, and store anything that can't be washed (like stuffed animals) in a sealed plastic bag for at least two weeks to ensure that any lice and unhatched eggs are dead.

 In order to be able to load older versions of a file or folder, you will need to enable File History, which requires having an external hard drive or access to a network folder. Windows will use that to store older versions of your files, allowing you to recover from bad saves and overwritten documents. It also acts as a backup for all of your personal documents in the event of data loss.


You can access File History by searching for it by typing “file history” while on the Start screen. Select File History from the results.
 If your external hard drive is plugged in, the Turn On button will become available to click. If you’d like to change the location to a network drive, click the Select Drive button in the left menu and then click “Add network location”. You can then browse for the network drive.Choose whether or not you want your HomeGroup to be able to connect to the drive. If you have multiple computers on your HomeGroup and you want them to all save their backups to a central location, click Yes, otherwise it’s OK to click No.
 Once you have File History enabled, you can configure its advanced settings by clicking the “Advanced settings” link in the left menu.


Change how long files are kept by using the “Keep saved versions” menu. The default is “Forever”.






Change how often copies are saved by using the “Save copies of files” menu. The default is “Every hour”.
 Windows 8 File History will not allow you to choose what is backed up. Instead, it will automatically back up everything in your user libraries (Documents, Pictures, etc.). If you have files in other locations that you need to back up, move them to a folder in one of your libraries.

 These tomatoes are less likely to have been treated with chemicals or pesticides and often cost less than mass-produced varieties.


Locally-grown tomatoes can be found at a farmer's market, at seasonal vegetable stands or in the section of your supermarket designated for produce from local farms.;
, Avoid refrigerated tomatoes.


Tomatoes kept in a grocer's refrigeration unit will break down faster in their cell walls, making them soften faster and lose some texture and flavor.



Buy tomatoes no more than a day or 2 before you plan to use them. This will ensure they are fresh and will prevent them from spoiling before you have a chance to eat them.

 Boarding a flight can be uncomfortable for many people with disabilities. Regaining access to a wheelchair can also take considerable time, so ensure you have long layovers, if you book them.
 Although these guidelines may differ in countries outside of North America, there are some concessions made for disabled passengers. The following are preparations you can make before or at the gate:


Keep a card or letter with you if you have any metal implements or prosthesis. You can request these cards from your surgeon after you have surgery. It is a good idea to keep it with you when traveling, in case you go through metal detectors during sightseeing as well as in the airport.
Keep all prescription and over-the-counter medication with you in your carry-on baggage. Keep all medications in their original packaging.
Declare all medically necessary liquid medications to the TSA officer. If they are over 3.4 oz., they should not be carried in a quart-sized plastic bag with other small liquids. If they are required to take essential medication, water and juice may be declared and carried through security after going through an additional screening process.
Make sure all frozen medications are frozen solid as you go through the security line. Slushy or liquid medications are subject to additional screening and limitations.
 Choose an aisle seat or a seat near the bathroom, if you need one. Always avoid sitting in an emergency exit row, since this seat requires that you be prepared to assist other passengers.
 You will need to order a taxi or mini-bus with disability access.
 Make sure you arrive at least 2 hours ahead of time for all international travel.
 Press the call button should you need them during flight. Ask that the attendant helps you to get access to your devices after the other passengers have disembarked.

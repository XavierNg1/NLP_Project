, You will see three events; a boss battle, a torch battle, and a mystery battle. Tap the boss battle.
 The boss has more than a million HP. However, even if someone from your guild has battled the boss alone, if he loses, the boss will have his remaining HP, so it will be easier. However, you will need a lot of high level heroes, mostly 100-180 is recommended.
 You cannot take any attack troops since the boss could kill them easily in one hit.
 Consider dropping your least level heroes that are strong, to attack the boss. Once your heroes don't survive (if it happens), drop your other strong heroes.
 The boss battle is activated by the leader of the guild. It lasts 30 minutes, so you can always retry after a 5 second cool down.
 This can include warehouse items or regular every day rewards.

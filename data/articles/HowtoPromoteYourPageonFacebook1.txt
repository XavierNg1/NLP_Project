 At the top left corner of your Facebook Page’s Timeline is an “Upload cover” button. This button is represented by a camera icon. Click on it to browse for the appropriate photo from your computer.


Try to select a photo that’s interesting and in connection with your Page, like a picture from your latest event. Make sure that it’s a clear shot, not blurry. The cover photo you upload should be 351 pixels by 815 pixels and should not exceed 2MB.

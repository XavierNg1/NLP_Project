 Many health experts in the US and Australia recommend avoiding this method, since harmful bacteria on the shell could get in contact with the egg.The risk of contamination is much lower in the EU, which has a very effective anti-salmonella program.If you're concerned about the risk, use one of the other methods instead.


Cooking yolks or whites until firm makes them much safer.If you plan to serve the eggs runny or raw, consider another separation method.
 Room temperature eggs have runnier whites, which can make this method messy and difficult. Work with eggs straight from the fridge instead.
 This is where you want to make the cleanest crack you can manage. The key with this method is to crack the egg evenly, so you can easily transfer the yolk between the two halves.
 Tap the center of the egg gently against a hard object, so a crack forms across about half of the egg. The edge of a bowl is a good surface for getting two equal halves. The edge can also break off shell fragments into your white, though, so a flat counter might be better if your eggs have thin shells., Hold the egg over a bowl in both hands with the crack facing upward and the wide end tilted down. Slowly pull apart the two halves with your thumbs, until the egg breaks into two halves. Because the egg is tilted, the yolk should fall into the lower half., "Pour" the intact yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell. Repeat this about three times, while the white drips over the side of the shell and into the bowl below.
 Drop the yolk in another bowl once there are only tiny bits of white stuck to it. If you have more eggs to separate, consider using a third bowl, so a messy crack doesn't drop shell shards or broken yolk into your whites. Separate each egg over this third bowl, then empty the bowl into the other whites bowl before you move on to the next.

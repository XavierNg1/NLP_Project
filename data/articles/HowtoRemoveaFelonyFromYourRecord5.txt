 To get a pardon, you must request one from the governor of the state in which you were convicted. If you were convicted of a federal crime, the pardon would have to come from the President of the United States.


If you are pardoned, the conviction will remain on your record. However, a notice will be added, stating that you’ve been pardoned (forgiven) for committing the crime. Your civil rights, including the chance to own a firearm and serve on a jury, will be restored. Rules and procedures for applying for a governor’s pardon are different from one state to the next. Some require that you complete your sentence, including any probation, and establish that you’ve engaged in no criminal activity for a prescribed period of time since. , State parole boards, prisoner review boards, and governor’s offices will normally provide fill-in-the-blank applications for you to complete. You can ask your local public defender’s office for assistance, although you do not need an attorney to apply for a pardon.
 Your parole board or local court clerk will have information on where to send the application and what documents should be included with it.


There typically is no application fee, although you might have to pay for certified copies of orders or transcripts to accompany the application. In many states applications are first reviewed by the state’s parole or prisoner review board. The board then submits its recommendations to the governor’s office. Once you apply for a governor’s pardon, you typically cannot follow up on or check the status of your application. You simply wait until you hear back, and that can take six months or more. There is no appeal if your application is denied, although you may be able to reapply after a few years.

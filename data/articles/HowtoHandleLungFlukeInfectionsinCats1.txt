 It can be really scary to see your cat have breathing troubles. Stay calm, and make an appointment to see the vet as soon as possible. A persistent cough or wheezing can be a symptom of a variety of health issues, but the cause should be assessed by a veterinarian.When you call to make an appointment for your cat to be seen, ask the staff member whether you should bring in a stool sample when you bring your cat in. A stool sample can be very helpful for diagnosing a lung fluke infection.
When you take your cat to be seen by a veterinarian, be ready to describe your cat's symptoms and when they started.;
, Once your cat is being seen by a veterinarian, you should let them run the tests that they think are necessary. There are several tests that may be run on your cat to get a definitive diagnosis, including a special fecal float test, called the Baermann technique. The vet may also want to x-ray the cat's lungs to look for the development of parasites and do a trans tracheal wash to identify ova in the lungs.A transtracheal wash is a procedure in which a sample of respiratory secretions is taken from the cat's trachea and bronchi.
Additionally, your veterinarian may want to run tests for secondary infections that have been caused by the lung fluke infection, such as pneumonia.
 In most cases, your veterinarian will need to send samples to a veterinary lab for analysis. A sample that is being tested for lung flukes needs special processing that is usually done in professional labs, not veterinary offices.While waiting for test results, your veterinarian should be working on treating your cat's acute symptoms. This may mean giving your cat oxygen if it is having a hard time breathing or beginning treatment for any underlying infection, such as pneumonia.

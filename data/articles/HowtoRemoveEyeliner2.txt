 The makeup wipes designed to remove an entire face of makeup may be too harsh on the delicate skin around your eyes. Look for a wipe made specifically for use around your eyes


Sensitive baby wipes can sometimes be used to cleanse your face, but they're not designed to lift off makeup. Try to stick to wipes that are specifically for makeup removal for the best results., Wipe along the upper lid with an outward motion (from the inner corner of your eye to the outer). Then repeat underneath your lower eyelid.








Change to a new tip of the wipe for each eye, to prevent transferring anything from eye to eye.
Don't pull or tug the skin too much. This can cause wrinkles., Even if you can use the wipe to remove makeup from your entire face, removing makeup is not the same as cleaning your skin. It should be a two-step process: remove your makeup first, then follow by washing your face.

 Let's say you're solving for x in the following problem:√(2x+9) - 5 = 0

, You have to move the part of the equation with the square root sign to one side of the equation before you can proceed. So, you'll have to add 5 to both sides of the equation. Here's how:


√(2x+9) - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5
√(2x+9) = 5

, Just as you would divide both sides of an equation by a coefficient that is being multiplied by x, you would square both sides of an equation if x appears under the square root, or the radical sign. This will remove the radical sign from the equation. Here's how you do it:


(√(2x+9))2 = 52

2x + 9 = 25

, Combine like terms by subtracting both sides by 9 so that all of the constant terms are on the right side of the equation while x remains on the left side. Here's what you do:


2x + 9 - 9 = 25 - 9
2x = 16

, The last thing you have to do to solve for x is to isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, the coefficient of the x term. 2x/2 = x and 16/2 = 8, so you're left with x = 8.
 Plug 8 back in to the equation for x to see if you get the right answer:


√(2x+9) - 5 = 0
√(2(8)+9) - 5 = 0
√(16+9) - 5 = 0
√(25) - 5 = 0
5 - 5 = 0

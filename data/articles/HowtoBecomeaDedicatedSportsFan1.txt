 Every sport has its rules and regulations, and its own hand signals. Here are some tips for learning to understand the sport:


Read books on your sport. Go to a book store and look around, or look around on the internet. It's important to find quality books that offer as much information as possible on the sport, this way you can make fewer purchases, and learn much, much more.
Watch games. Tune in to see all the action. Turn up the volume to hear what the announcers, referees, and coaches are saying about the game. They can offer some very helpful information on the sport. You will also get to see which teams, and players, are the best.
Ask around. Ask some of your friends and family members who are interested in the sport what it's all about. They'll be happy to help you! Watch some games with them, and if you don't understand something, ask them!
Look around on the internet. There are many websites where you can ask questions about certain topics, ask a couple of questions, and while you are waiting for answers, search around for your sports website, to see if it has any information on the sport.;
, Every sport begins with a little dirt! Try not to miss any meetings, games, or practices so you can learn as much as possible. Listen to your coach or instructor and hear what they have to say.
 Or maybe even create a blog to keep track of everything you learn. It's important not to forget anything about the sport, or else you won't be able to really choose the team, because you might end up picking the worst team, when the best team would be obvious if you remember everything your coach said.

 There are many wiki's out there, Wikipedia, wikiHow, and Wikimedia Commons are just a few out there.;
, Most wiki's have these buttons, "edit" "save" and "discuss"., The edit button "transforms" the page into an editor, like a word document. This page allows you to change the way text looks, change the content, and add or remove content. This button also goes along with the save button.
 You managed to edit the article. But now how do you "save" or keep your changes on the page? Click save! Â Save transforms the editor back into the web-page, but this time with the changes you made!

, You can "discuss" or comment on a page. Discuss is usually used to help give ideas for other editors, or give opinions on the page you viewed, without editing the actual page. You can also collaborate with other editors on things such as changing the title, or what needs to be added to the page.
 Wiki's can be slightly different, find out what you can do with the wiki you edit!, Editing wiki's can be an enjoyable pastime. Now that you know how to use one, start editing!

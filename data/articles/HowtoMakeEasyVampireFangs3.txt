 With the straw method, you'll just need a pair of scissors and a white plastic straw.
 Measure how long the piece should be by fitting the straw over your canine or incisor. Then look in the mirror and see how much straw you'll need for a fang. Then cut off double that amount so you have enough for two fangs., The folding helps ensure that you get a symmetrical pair of fangs.
 This will separate the straw into two symmetrical fangs.
 If your canines are too big for the fangs to fit, you can also place them on your incisors.

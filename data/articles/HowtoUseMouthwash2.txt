 Read the instructions on the label of your mouthwash to learn the proper dosage. Your bottle of mouthwash may have come with a small cup (often the bottle's cap) you can use to measure the correct amount. If your bottle didn't come with a cup, pour the mouthwash into a small cup you've set aside for this specific purpose.


Most mouthwashes will recommend a dose of about 20 ml.This amount is enough to clean your teeth in one dose. Some fluoride mouthwashes, however, only require 10 ml.
Unless you're using a prescription mouthwash, don't worry too much about using the exact amount. Use enough mouthwash to fill your mouth without making you feel uncomfortable. Always follow your dentist's instructions when using a prescription mouthwash.
 Tip the cup into your mouth and pour in all of the mouthwash at once. Close your mouth to create a seal so that the mouthwash won't squirt out when you start swishing it. Do not swallow the mouthwash. It may contain strong chemicals that are not meant to be ingested.
 Follow the directions on the bottle to learn exactly how long you should swish the mouthwash. Make sure it swishes in front of and behind your teeth. Swish it through your molars as well as your front teeth. Swish it under your tongue and across the roof of your mouth, too.
 When you're done swishing, spit it out into the sink. Rinse out the sink to get rid of the used mouthwash.


Depending on what type of mouthwash you used, you might need to wait 1/2 hour or more before drinking water or eating in order to increase the effectiveness of the mouthwash. Read the directions on the bottle to find out if you should wait.

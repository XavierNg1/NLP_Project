 If the fish is being served whole, you'll want to cut the head off first, just behind the gills. Next, hold the body with your fork, and use your knife to the belly open, starting at the head and ending at the tail. Pull open the body, and remove the backbone. You can do this by placing the tip of your knife under the spine, then lifting it out with your fork.If you can't remove the bones, simply eat around them. Don't flip the fish over to eat the flesh from the other side of the bones. This is bad etiquette. Instead, use your fork to lift the bone up and pull the flesh away.;
, Most fish fillets will be de-boned, but you will still want to be careful. If you bite into a bone, simply pull it out of your mouth with your fingers, and set it down onto the side of your plate.

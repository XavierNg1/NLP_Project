Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 In Free Roam mode, if you do not like the behavior of any fellow driver, you can block them by right-clicking their user name and selecting “Block Driver.” The usernames of the drivers are shown on top of their vehicles throughout NFS World.


A dialog box will appear asking you to confirm whether you wish to block the driver. Click “Block Driver” to confirm. The user will be blocked, meaning they can not race with you or see you in NFS World. They will not be notified that you blocked them.

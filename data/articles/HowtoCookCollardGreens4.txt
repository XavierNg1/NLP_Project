 Place the stockpot on your stove and heat 1 tbsp. of olive oil and 1 tbsp. of butter over medium heat until the butter is melted, and the melted butter and oil glide smoothly to coat the bottom of the pot., Add 1/2 of a chopped large white onion to the oil and butter. Move them around rapidly with a spatula. Continue cooking over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until they feel slightly softened., Stir 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes and 1 minced garlic clove into the other ingredients and continue cooking over medium heat for another minute., Toss the greens into the seasoned oil, making sure that all the greens are thoroughly and visibly coated with the oil. Cook for at least another minute., Pour the stock into the pot, give the greens another quick stir, and cover the pot. Bring the stock to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium-low, making sure the stock is still simmering afterward., This should take about 40 minutes, but may take as quick as 20 minutes depending on how small your strips of greens are.

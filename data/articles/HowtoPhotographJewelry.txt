 A white sheet of heavyweight paper works as an ideal background to photograph jewelry, especially for novice photographers. As you become more skilled at taking jewelry pictures, consider using a colorful background of printed paper that has minimal text, graphics and compliments the jewelry's color scheme. Your background should add visual interest to the photograph without distracting from the jewelry's best qualities.;
, Early in the morning and late in the afternoon are the 2 best times to take jewelry pictures. If you pick a different time of day, create soft lighting that will compliment the jewelry piece from all angles. Ideally you will have slight shadows behind the jewelry to help make the piece stand out.
 A piece of letter-sized cardboard wrapped in foil serves as an impromptu light deflector that can bounce light away from the jewelry piece when you aim it at reflective spots. If you need to use your camera's flash, place a piece of facial tissue over the flash to diffuse the strobe. Wearing a white t-shirt while you photograph jewelry also helps diffuse harsh lighting from your camera's flash when it fills the room with brightness as you snap photos.
 Use your camera's macro setting, which allows you to obtain crisp, up-close photos of the jewelry. Select different angles that show what the jewelry looks like up front, from the side and even from behind.
 A close-up, focused shot of a pendant hanging from a neck or a gemstone dangling from an ear lobe is more interesting to viewers and helps give them a better idea of the size of the piece.
 Jewelry is alluring because pieces tend to reflect everything in their environment. Jewelry can also reflect unwanted elements in the room where you are taking pictures, such as window blinds or light bulbs. To avoid unattractive reflections on your jewelry, stand as far away from the subject as possible while using your camera's zoom feature to bring the jewelry into focus.

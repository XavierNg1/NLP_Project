 These are the kind made famous by the great Eddie Van Halen.
 This performs the same duty as picking, but your picking hand is currently grasping the whammy bar behind the bridge (not over the strings) in swung around position.
 Place your finger directly over the fifth fret (the actual fret), just above the loosely flapping string.
 As the string tightens, it should snap into your finger, producing a very clear harmonic squeal as it rapidly rises in pitch. When you've got this down it only takes a moment to get squealing, and then you can hold the note, pushing the whammy bar to the limit. This can be done on any string, at any fret, but it's easiest at fifth fret G. Attempting this with a non-locking tremolo bar can result in your guitar going out of tune or may cause broken strings. Avoid using poorly made, though licensed copies of reputable name gear (e.g. Floyd Rose copies).

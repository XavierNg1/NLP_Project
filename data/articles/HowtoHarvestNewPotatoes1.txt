 Generally this will tell you when it's time to harvest the potatoes by looking at the plant on top. When it is time to harvest, the plant withers and dies off - this is an obvious sign.;
, After the plant has died off the potatoes can continue to grow in the ground for a limit of 7 weeks. This strengthens the potato which is a good thing.
 Once the plant has died off and it's forecast to rain you'll want to harvest your potatoes before it rains. Otherwise the potatoes will rot in the ground from the rain.

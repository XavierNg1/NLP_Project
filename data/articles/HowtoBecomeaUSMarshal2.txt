 The USMS requires candidates to have a bachelor's degree with superior academic achievement, graduate work in law enforcement or a related field, or three years of applicable work experience.


A combination of education and experience equivalent to the GL-07 level, which is the entry level for the USMS, is also acceptable.
 There is no requirement regarding majors, but courses in law, criminal justice, sociology and psychology will be helpful when you become a US Marshal.


If your work as an undergraduate is considered to be Superior Academic Achievement, you may end your education there. Superior Academic Achievement means having at least a 3.0 grade point average in every undergraduate course, having a 3.5 grade point average in courses within your major, ranking in the upper one-third of your class or having membership in a national scholastic honor society recognized by the Association of College Honor Societies.
 If you did not attain Superior Academic Achievement as an undergraduate, or if you would like a more specialized education in the field of law enforcement, enter a graduate program in law enforcement, criminal justice, sociology or a related field.
 If you decide not to pursue a Bachelor's or graduate degree, you must have three years' experience to apply to be a Deputy Marshal. Applicants for a position as DEO or AEO must have at least one year of experience regardless of their education level. Experience requirements are different for prospective Deputy Marshals, DEOs and AEOs.


Applicable experience for prospective Deputy Marshals includes experience with firearms, criminal investigation, making arrests, issuing warrants, and writing reports.
Applicable experience for prospective DEOs and AEOs includes conducting searches for prisoners, applying and removing restraints from prisoners, and transporting prisoners.

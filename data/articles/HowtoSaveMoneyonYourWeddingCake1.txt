 Don't just settle with the first cake or bakery you see. Have a look at different places locally or online. After all, there could be an equally good or even better bakery just around the corner for a cheaper price. Remember, more expensive doesn't necessarily mean better.


Don't be afraid to try somewhere new that you don't know. Newer bakeries usually have good offers as they are trying to attract more customers.
Look online to find local or close enough places with good deals. You may be surprised at what you might find.;
, Instead of going to a bakery, purchase your wedding cake from someone who bakes cake as a hobby. They are equally talented and will charge less than a fancier bakery.You can also use a baker who does not necessarily specialize in wedding cakes. Visit your local bakery and ask if the baker makes wedding cakes.Keep in mind that you may have fewer design options when using an amateur baker or a baker that does not typically make wedding cakes.
You can also ask your caterer if a cake can be included in your package. The cost may be lower than ordering your cake through a separate bakery.
 If you, your family, or your friends are good at baking, consider baking the cake on your own. If you are baking the cake yourself, look for recipes that freeze well so you can bake the cake ahead of time.If a friend or family member is baking the cake, ask them to make your cake at a discount or even better, it could be their wedding gift to you.


It is a risk using an inexperienced baker. You should do a trial run before the wedding. The test cake should be the exactly like your real wedding cake.If you go the do-it-yourself route, have a backup plan just in case.

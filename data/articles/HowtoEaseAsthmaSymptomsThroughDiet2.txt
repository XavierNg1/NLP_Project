 The best way to figure out what your food triggers are is by trial and error. In order to find a pattern and discern your reactions to foods, keep a food diary of everything you eat during the day. Write down any reactions you have, even if they seem minor.


Keep this diary over the course of two to four weeks. This should be plenty of time to decide what foods you react adversely to.
Try to eat a wide range of foods so you can ensure that you get the largest sample for possible triggers.
Share your food log with your doctor or nutritionist so that they can help you make informative decisions about your health and asthma.

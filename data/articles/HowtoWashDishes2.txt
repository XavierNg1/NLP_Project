 Although washing dishes in the sink by hand may be faster for some, you may want to keep your hands clean and soft.
 All dishwashers are different, and every person has a different method of loading theirs. Establish a routine, and stick with it for most loads. Here are some things to consider:


How does your dishwasher operate? Some have one set of arms blasting water up from the bottom, while others have an arm for the lower shelf blasting up, and an arm on the upper shelf blasting down.
Many dishwashers have a variety of spacing to accommodate large bowls, small bowls, utensils, dishes, and plates of varying sizes on the bottom shelf. The top shelf is given to shorter items such as glasses, mugs, jars, and long utensils such as spatulas and stirring spoons.
 Fill your dishwasher till it's full but not crammed. You'll maximize the cleaning capacity of your dishwasher and minimize excessive water usage.
 Fill the detergent dispenser with your preferred cleanser—liquid, powder, or capsule—and close it up.









You can add extra cleanser in a secondary cup should your dishes be excessively filthy.
Add a rinsing agent to prevent spotting, if necessary.
 Set the timer as necessary—a shorter time for lightly-soiled dishes, or a longer time for heavily-soiled pots, pans, and dishes.
 You can use a heated dry (but be careful of plastic dishes or containers), or use air drying. Dishes will still dry relatively quickly, as dishwasher water is usually heated to 140 °F (60 °C).

, This will open a new window to create a link.
 This will allow you to link to any cell in your spreadsheet.
 There are a few ways to do this:


To type a cell location, select the sheet it's on from the "Cell Reference" list. You can then type the specific cell, such as "C23" into the "Type the cell reference" field.
You can select from cells or ranges that have been defined in the "Defined Names" list. If you select one of these, you won't be able to type a location.
 By default, the link's text will simply be the cell that you are linking to. You can change this by typing anything you'd like into the "Text to display" field.You can click the "ScreenTip" button to change the text that appears when a user hovers their mouse cursor over the link.

Remind students that images used for their wikiHow must be properly licensed.
 Advise students not to begin annotating., As a class, brainstorm reasons and goals for annotating images for instruction sets. Scaffold and support the conversation by emphasizing that images included in instruction sets should: a.) help readers visualize a process that is difficult to describe and b.) make important information easy to find., Explain to students how using Skitch enhances each image.
 Monitor student work while providing guidance and reiterating key points brought up during the classroom discussion.

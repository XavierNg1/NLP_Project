 Immediately after, play the correct D note using a pitch pipe, guitar, or piano. Use the bass knob to adjust the string until plucking it produces the same note.


If using a guitar, pluck the open fourth string to hear the correct note.
When you do not have a pitch pipe or other instrument to tune this bass string to, you can informally tune the dulcimer by humming a note that feels natural and comfortable. Match the string to the note you hum.
The Mixolydian Mode can also be called the "slightly minor" mode. Typically, this mode is heard most often in Neo-Celtic music and songs written for the Irish fiddle.
 Press down on the bass string, positioning your finger a little to the left of the fourth fret. Pluck on the string. The note you produce should be an A note. Use the appropriate tuning knob to adjust the middle string until an open pluck on the middle string matches that A note.


Note that this step and the one before it are identical in each tuning method, so if you master these two steps, you can use just about any tuning method.
 Press the middle string down at the third fret and pluck it to produce a high D. Adjust the melody string using its tuning knob until plucking the open melody string produces the same high D sound.


This high D is one octave above the open bass string.
Note that tuning to D-A-D or Mixolydian Mode puts more tension on the melody string.
The Mixolydian Mode scale begins on open melody string (also called the "zero fret") and runs through the seventh fret. There are no notes below the octave on your dulcimer, but there are notes above it.

 Never use a microwave to defrost shrimp, because it may make the shrimp rubbery. The best way to defrost shrimp is to place it in cold water or let it sit in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.
 Deveining a shrimp is removing the back vein. When you are preparing shrimp, it is not necessary to remove the back vein, but some cooks devein the shrimp to make it look better.


Devein your shrimp by running the point of a sharp knife or a de-veiner along the back vein.
Hold the shrimp under cold water and take the vein out.
 When saut√©ing shrimp, you must remove the tail and the shell.


Use your fingers to pull the shell from the meat of the shrimp. When you are preparing shrimp, you may want to wear gloves. Shrimp may cause a rash on some people's hands.
Discard the tails and shells.

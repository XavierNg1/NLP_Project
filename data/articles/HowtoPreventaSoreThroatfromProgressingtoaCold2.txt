 The main goal in treating a sore throat is to reduce the signs and symptoms of it. Antibiotics are not the first line of treatment for a sore throat caused by a cold, because they are ineffective against most viral infections.


Only when you have a prolonged infection, such as strep, should you seek out antibiotic treatment.
A sore throat is an indication of the body’s natural defenses working against infection.
The tonsils at the back of the throat trap foreign bodies and swell when large amounts are trapped in them.
 Over the counter medications can be used in order to reduce the signs and symptoms of the sore throat and let the body’s immune system take care of the infection. Reducing the symptoms of the sore throat can allow you to get better rest and fight off the infection more effectively.


Take simple painkillers to aid in the relief of pain related to the sore throat. Painkillers work by blocking and interfering with the pain signals going to the brain.

Common painkillers are ibuprofen, aspirin, and acetaminophen.
 If you have determined, through testing and a doctor's visit, that you have a bacterial infection, get antibiotics prescribed. Antibiotics can help the body fight off a bacterial infection that would otherwise be very hard to beat.


Do not use antibiotics that you have leftover from other illness, because they will be ineffective if your sore throat is not the result of a bacterial infection.
Most sore throats are viral, and cannot be treated with antibiotics.

 One of the best ways to advocate for the elderly is to volunteer with or work for an organization that promotes intergenerational communication and engages in legislative advocacy. The National Council on Aging is a good place to start looking for groups and resources to join.Work on a local level to promote or draft protective legislation that creates access to necessary services in your community.
Host public awareness events that encourage the community to work to protect elderly citizens, and that connect older members of your community with resources that can help them medically, legally, and financially.
 Financial abuse of the elderly, inadequate healthcare,neglect and senior abuse, and lack of transportation services are important issues to bring to the attention of legislatures. Call or write your local and state representatives to let them know that the voting population wants to see more attention to care for the elderly.


You may want to start a whole letter writing campaign to get more support behind the message. With proper permission and permits, set up a table at your local community center to help others draft and send in letters.Provide pre-written letters that individuals can read and sign, along with addressed and stamped envelopes and a collections box so that you can take the letters in all at once.
 Advocate through peaceful protest and demonstrations at local political events. Work with national advocacy groups to get resources and develop a plan of action. Then, gather individuals to participate in your demonstration.Prepare materials in advance to distribute to the public advocating for senior issues. Include information in how people can get involved, such as writing to their congressional representative or voting on certain measures.
Keep your protest structured and peaceful. The focus should be on the message, not on causing a public scene.

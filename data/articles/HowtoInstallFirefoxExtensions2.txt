 Some Firefox add-ons can be acquired outside of the built-in add-on interface. Navigate to the website that hosts your desired extension file and download it. Firefox extension files use the .xpi filetype (cross-platform installer).


XPI files can be acquired from external installation links by right-clicking and selecting “Save Link As…” if you prefer to install manually or want installers for archiving purposes.
Firefox uses the desktop as the default download destination.
 A notification will appears to the left of the address bar that an external source wants to install an add-on.
 Press “Install” in the notification and restart Firefox if necessary.

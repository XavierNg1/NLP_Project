 Pink hot chocolate mix makes a great gift for Valentine’s Day. If you want to give someone pink hot chocolate mix as a gift, put the mix into a mason jar and seal it up. Then, decorate the mason jar with ribbon and a label that says, “pink hot chocolate.” Write a personal message on the label or attach a card to the mason jar.Make sure you use powdered ingredients only in the mix, such as instant milk and strawberry flavored Nesquik. This will make it easier for the person to prepare the mix at home.
Include toppings in the mix like marshmallows and sprinkles.
 You can also package the pink hot chocolate mix in decorative coffee mugs. Use Valentine’s Day themed coffee mugs. Wrap the coffee mugs with the mix in them using tissue paper or clear plastic.


Add ribbon and a personalized card to complete the gift.
 Use small decorative plastic bags that can be resealed to keep the mix fresh. Look for decorative plastic bags that are Valentine’s Day themed to make the wrapping extra special.

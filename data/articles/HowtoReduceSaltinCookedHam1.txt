 Place the ham in a large bowl or pot and pour cold water over it until it is covered. Let it soak overnight to give time for the salt to soak out into the water. Remove the ham from the water and pat it dry with a paper towel before heating it in the oven., Prepare your ham with your choice of glaze or seasonings and place it in the oven to cook. After 20 minutes of baking, remove the ham from the oven and carefully pour off the pan drippings, which will be very salty. If desired, add more glaze or seasonings and place the ham back in the oven., Offset the saltiness of your ham by serving it with neutralizing side dishes. Potatoes, rice, and pasta are bland enough to round out the overall flavor of your meal. Avoid using pre-packaged side dishes, which are likely to be high in sodium on their own., To reduce the intensity of the ham's saltiness, cut it into very thin slices before serving it. Thick slices of ham can overpower a meal with their salt-heavy taste. Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the ham as evenly as possible.

This purpose is your thesis statement.A narrative thesis statement may offer the lesson you learned or talk about the impact of the moment on your life, such as "The most memorable moment in which I showed courage happened in seventh grade."

Use words such as "then," "next," and "finally" to show your progress., This is where you come back to the thesis you gave in the beginning. What did you learn?

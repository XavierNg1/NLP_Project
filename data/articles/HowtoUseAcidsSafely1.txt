 Your hands are the most likely place to be exposed to acid. Your eyes are even more vulnerable to corrosive materials than your skin. Thereâ€™s no reason to risk it. Wear gloves and goggles at all times.;
, Diluting acid releases a lot of heat. Plastic containers are subject to melting during dilution. Even glass containers may crack, unless you use borosilicate glassware. Pyrex is an example of borosilicate.
 In this instance, water is also considered a base. Pouring acid into water, or other base, allows the heat generated during dilution to be more effectively dispersed. Appropriate dispersion of heat prevents cracking or melting containers and flash boiling, both of which could result in acid ending up on your skin and clothes.


When diluting sulfuric acid, you should do it in an ice bath.
 When taking acid from a large container, remove just enough to do the experiment or task. Any excess acid will have to be diluted, neutralized, and disposed of. Less left over acid will save on costs and make cleanup easier.


Never add chemicals back into the original container. This will introduce contaminants.
 If you are doing a specific experiment or task, follow the directions carefully. Find the Materials Safety Data Sheet for all chemicals used in the experiment and be sure that none of them react unpleasantly with acid (e.g. forming toxic gases, exploding, etc.). Never mix acids and bleaching agents.

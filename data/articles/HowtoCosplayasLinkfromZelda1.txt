 There are different types of a Link costume that you can take. Consider how much time and money you’re willing to spend. Play Zelda and understand the different generations of the video game.


Throughout the generations, the central costume of Link has remained the same.
The basics are his green tunic and cap, blonde mid length hair, white or tan pants, and brown gloves/boots.
He also carries an array of weapons and a shield.You can decide which of the weapons you’re willing to carry, or omit the weapons entirely if you plan to wear the costume to a location, such as a school, that prohibits toy weapons.;
, To get the basic look of Link, you’ll need a green shirt that is long. You could also use a green tank top that extends past your rear. Don’t worry if it fits you too loose, you’ll be wearing a belt over it anyway. Use a lighter green or white long sleeved undershirt.


Check out some thrift stores before spending too much.
Put on the long sleeve shirt and then the green tunic. Finish the torso with a wide brown belt over your waist., For the pants you can use a variety of options based on what generation Link you want to go for. The key to the pants is that they are tight or slim fitting. Go for either white or tan pants.


Tights are also a great alternative and fits the time period Link exists in., The head is critical for achieving a believable Link. Fashion the hair by either using a wig or by dying your hair blonde. Find a green hat that slouches off the back of your head.


If you feel serious you could buy elf extenders for your ears. These are optional, but will add a nice touch to the look.
If you have a wig, you should spend some time with a pair of scissors and try styling the hair like Link's.You can also create your own hat by cutting and sewing a green cloth.
 Any serious Link has to have gloves and boots. The boots are always hi-top brown boots. The gloves are either dark grey or brown. Leather is preferred for an authentic look.

 Network drives are great for storing and sharing files with other users on a network. They are also useful if you want to store the drive out of the way, since they can be accessed remotely from anywhere on the network.
 Network drives can be connected to your network and can be accessed like any other disk as long as you remain on the network.


Plug in the network drive to an outlet if it requires external power.
Connect the drive to the network. This can be done via the router or modem - usually with an ethernet or USB cable.
 This allows you to easily access the drive like any other hard drive whenever you are on the network. The following steps are written for Windows 10 and may vary slightly depending on the version of Windows you are running.


Navigate to This PC > Map Network Drive.
Select a drive letter and press Browse.
Select the network drive from the list and press OK.
 Open the file explorer and you should see your drive appear listed with the rest of your storage devices.

 To get Zedge ringtones on older or simpler phones you will still need a computer with internet access. Find the ringtone you want and click "Get Ringtone."

, This will send your email account a downloadable version of the ringtone that you will forward to your phone.


Make sure you keep this email from Zedge and know how to find it again.
 Every phone has an email address that you can access using text messages, and you'll need this to get your ringtone. Your email address changes based on your cell phone carrier, but it always begins with your phone number. For example -- if my phone number is 234-567-8910 and I use Verizon, my email address would be 2345678910@vtext.com.For a complete list of carriers and their address, check out this page. You can also use this trick with any phone carrier if you cannot find your address:


Open up a new text message.
Send a message to your home email address (ie. WikiHowRules@gmail.com)
Open the message in your email browser, and check the "Sender." This will be your phone's email address.
 Take the email from Zedge with your ringtone and send it to your phone's email address. Be sure to "Keep all Attachments," as the attachment is your ringtone.
 Your phone should get a new "message," after you send the email. Click or tap the attachment and choose "Save the Sound." You may now set your new ringtone!


Name it appropriately to avoid confusion.
 In your phone's settings, choose "Tones," "Sounds," or another similar menu. From here you can see your new ringtone and set it to your phone.

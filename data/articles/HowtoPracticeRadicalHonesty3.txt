 When you are radically honest, some people will respond in like manner. Welcome it. This is a good opportunity to open new dialogue, and discover things about yourself that you might have otherwise never known. If someone gives you some harsh feedback, respond with gratitude. Say things like:


"Thanks for telling me."
"That's fine."
"That's true!""

, How honest is too honest? In the honesty business, thereâ€™s a fine line between radical and reckless honesty. Think about how to phrase what you're saying in a way that is not hurtful. Having tact is not the same thing as lying, and some feelings are subjective. You do not, for example, need to tell someone, "That band is bad." You only need to say, "I don't care for their music."If someone asks for your opinion, find a way to give that to them in a way that's not overtly mean or comes off as a put-down. For example, a friend asks you what you think of a dress they're trying to purchase. Do not say, "That looks awful on you." Instead, say something like, "That isn't the best style for you."

, Remember, your honesty comes from your own perspective. If you need someone to change their behavior, request they do so. Do not try to make demands, as this will not be met well.For example, do not say to your spouse, "You need to have your phone off when we're together." Instead say, "I would appreciate it if you could be on your phone less often when we're out."

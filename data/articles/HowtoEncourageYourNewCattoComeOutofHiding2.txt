 You’ll likely need a minimum of 20 or 30 minutes to get your cat out of hiding and comfortable enough to get into a carrier. If possible, work this into your schedule so you can avoid having to fight with it and force it into a carrier.Try keeping the carrier in its space at all times, and place its food inside the carrier so the cat will associate it with good things.
 If you need to make a vet appointment or otherwise get your cat out of hiding in a hurry, try coaxing it with pet treats or a piece of canned tuna. You can also use a chase toy, like a feather on a string, to help it forget about its fear or shyness.Continue to play with it for 10 to 15 minutes. If you need to get it in a carrier, try placing treats in the carrier, and avoid forcing it in the carrier unless absolutely necessary.
 Feliway contains synthetic pheromones that can help soothe your cat. Spray it around your cat’s hiding spot to encourage it to come out of hiding. It’ll relax your cat and make it want to investigate the scent.It’ll probably want to rub against you and be stroked. You should give it some loving attention after spraying Feliway instead of trying to rush it into the carrier.

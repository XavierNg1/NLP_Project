 Daily blood sugar testing with a glucometer is advised to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. This will also help assess your ideal insulin requirement. Learning to use a glucometer is important. Select a brand that has easily obtainable glucose strips. In the beginning you may have to check your blood sugar levels three to four times a day or even at nighttime.
 Managing your insulin levels improves carbohydrate metabolism and reduces blood sugar levels. Insulin therapy is individualized according to weight, lifestyle, age, family support, and occupation. Follow your healthcare providerâ€™s instructions when administering insulin injections.
 If medications are required, some physicians recommend starting with oral blood sugar control medications such as metformin or glyburide.If oral agents fail, the traditional treatment involves an intermediate insulin such as NPH in the morning and bedtime, and a short acting insulin with some or all meals. The dosing depends on weight, trimester of pregnancy, and how elevated the blood sugars are.

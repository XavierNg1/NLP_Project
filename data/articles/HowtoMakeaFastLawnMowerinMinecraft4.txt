 A stone hoe is the best because it doesn't last too long or short, however, if your lawn is extremely big, an iron hoe will be needed. Avoid using wooden hoes because they do not last very long.
 By doing this, the grass will be temporarily removed. If you wish for it to be permanent, replace the dirt with wood or stone. Consider using carpet for a nicer look.

 It's one of the only weapons that can beat the sword in close quarters.;
, When they start to move towards you really quickly, pull the trigger and kill them with the shotgun. Then take the sword because it has a higher kill range and it also lowers morale if they know you have it.
 You don't need to do noob combo, you just need the plasma pistol and a quick thumb.
 Then, when the sword-holder lunges, release the trigger and press down on the B button quickly. There's a certain amount of luck involved, but if you get the timing right, it will kill them, earn you a Beat Down medal, and you'll LOVE the surprised expression on their face.
, if his shields are down you might get him or at least take out both of you.

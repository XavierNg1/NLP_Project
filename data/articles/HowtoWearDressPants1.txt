 The waist of your jeans should come high up on your hipbones, or possibly even higher if you find it comfortable. The waist should be snug enough to fit without the help of a belt. Basically, find a waist that is not too tight or loose and does not sag., The seat, or the butt area, of your pants should be snug. That area should not sag or be so tight that you can’t comfortably sit down. Sometimes, the rest of the pants will fit comfortably, but the seat will be too loose. If this is the case, take your pants to the tailor for an alteration., You should be able to pinch 1/2” to 1” (1.3 to 2.5 cm)of fabric around your thighs. The pants are too tight if you can’t pinch any loose fabric at all. If there is a lot of extra fabric, the pants are too big. It’s okay, however, if there is slightly more fabric than an inch., The pants should get narrower towards the calf if you have a thin or regular build. The calves should be fitted, but still have about ½” (1.3 cm) of excess fabric that could be pinched. The ankles should be the narrowest part of the pants., A tapered look is not the ideal style for a person with a wider or heavier build. Instead, opt for a straight cut. A straight cut will balance out your proportions.

 Skipping meals can actually make stress-related symptoms worse. Common stress symptoms that can increase when you skip meals include headaches and stomach aches. Instead of skipping meals, try to fit in at least three meals each day, or space out your meals and eat four to five smaller meals throughout the day.


Skipping meals may also force you to opt for quick-energy sources like candies and other sweets instead of healthy meals. These quick-energy sources may spike your energy levels for awhile, but will ultimately cause you to crash and feel hungry and fatigued.
 Stressed people tend to absently munch, so it is sensible to always carry a healthy snack with you to avoid buying whatever is available (which is generally junk food). Ideas for healthy snacks include:


Fruits that can easily be eaten and handled like bananas, oranges and apples.
Whole grain cookies, sunflower and other seeds.
Carrot and celery sticks.
 One of the most effective ways to avoid unhealthy foods is to simply stop buying them. If you donâ€™t have cookies in the house, you will be less inclined to absently munch on them.


Instead, fill your house with healthy snacks. However, be careful not to excessively snack on these foods. Just because they are healthy does not mean you should overeat.

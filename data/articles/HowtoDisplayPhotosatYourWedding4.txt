 Mixing old with new photos is a great way to display pictures of you and your fiancee while honoring those who got married before you. Hang up the photos around the reception area in designated areas using metallic tape.To make all the photos look vintage, scan all of the photos at a high resolution, and then take them to a copy center. Print all the photos in black and white to give an antique feel to even the most recent photos.
For an added vintage looking grainy effect, try to print them on ultra thin plotter paper. This is the paper used for architectural drawings. The paper will give it an added vintage effect.
 Photos that span decades may not look visually appealing together. To help give your photos a more cohesive look, scan them into your computer and edit them with the same colored filter.Some websites and photo editors will allow you to turn all the photos a color, like blue, green, or red, make them sepia-toned, or turn them black and white.
 Another way to make a uniform, tasteful display of photos from different eras is to place them all in the same frame. If you like the evolving look of photography through the decades, gain some continuity by placing each photo in the same frame.You can buy frames that are silver for a classic wedding look. You can buy frames in one of your wedding colors, or you can buy wooden frames and paint them for a unique DIY look.
If you want to go for a rustic, natural look, place the photos in the unpainted wooden frames.

 If you have the Spotify or SoundCloud URL for a particular song, click on the "Use a URL" link underneath the search bar. Then type in the URL.



The song will be pulled by Tumblr to be featured on your blog, but it will not be hosted on Tumblr's servers. Therefore, if Spotify or SoundCloud's servers are down, your song will not play.
You should also check that the artists have licensed their work under a Creative Commons license to at least allow non-commercial sharing with attribution, no modification.

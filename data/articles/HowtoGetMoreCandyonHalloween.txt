 You can wear the mask later to go back to houses with the best candy.;
, In the beginning, a lot of people give out more candy because they don't realize that they don't have a lot of candy.
 Try to trick or treat with only a few people so you can move to each house quickly.
 This usually means that they do not celebrate Halloween or aren't at home. (Or worse, don't give out candy!)

, Wear the second mask so they don't recognize you. Be careful not to be too recognizable though - if you're recognized, treat givers may ask you to leave with no candy from their house.
, That doesn't mean it's always better than their last round, however.
 Don't bother with those small jack-o-lantern buckets, since they won't hold much candy.

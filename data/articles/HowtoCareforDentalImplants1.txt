 You should also floss your teeth, paying maximum attention to all sides of the implant. Both brushing and flossing should be done softly and gently.
 This step is one of the most basic things that you can do to extend the lifespan of your dental implants. Choose a toothpaste that has a low abrasive property but still keeps tartar away.

Stay away from toothpaste brands that market themselves as "whitening" or "brightening" because they ones are very abrasive.
 Cleaning your teeth doesn't just stop at picking the right toothpaste. You should choose the right toothbrush, too. Pick a toothbrush that has soft bristles, enough to reach those hard to reach areas while not irritating your gums.

Be subtle when cleaning your implants to avoid scratching the outer coating. There are interdental toothbrushes in the market that can help you remove the plaque. These toothbrushed have tiny bristles that can help you get to those hard to reach areas with precision.
 Generally, there are hundreds of dental floss brands in the market. If you are given a choice between the waxed and unwaxed ones, always pick the latter. Insert the floss between your tooth and perform the flossing with a shoeshine motion. This reduces the chances of food particles getting stuck between your dental implants, thus extending its lifespan.

There are also water flossers and dental irrigators that do the same thing, although it's a little harder to acquire than a dental floss.
 After flossing, use an antibacterial mouthwash or mouth rinse. Choose a mild mouthwash to go hand in hand with your mild toothpaste.

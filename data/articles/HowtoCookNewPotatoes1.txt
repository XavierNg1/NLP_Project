 You'll need the following ingredients to make delicious pan-roasted new potatoes:


1 pound new potatoes
2 Tablespoons butter
1 Tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
Salt and pepper;
, Wash the potatoes with cold water, taking care to scrub off dirt and other debris. Cut each potato into bite sized pieces; for small potatoes, cutting each one in half should be sufficient.


Because the skin of new potatoes is so thin, there's no need to peel it.






Use a paring knife to cut off any bruised or pitted parts from the potatoes.
 Allow the butter and oil to melt together.


Cast iron cookware is ideal for pan-roasting potatoes; since it retains heat so well without getting too hot, it creates a crispy outer crust on the potatoes.
 Cook until the potatoes are brown and crispy, about five minutes. Turn the potatoes so that each side gets brown.
 Use tongs or a wooden spoon to toss the potatoes a bit, making sure they are covered on all sides with seasoning.


Add dried herbs such as rosemary, thyme, or oregano if you'd like to flavor the potatoes.






Add chopped onion or garlic if you wish.
 Reduce the heat to medium low and allow the potatoes to cook until tender, about 15 minutes.


Check the potatoes frequently to make sure they aren't overcooking.






If the potatoes absorb the butter and oil and seem to be drying out, add 1/4 cup water.
 Serve as a side dish to accompany chicken, fish, or steak, or toss with arugula to make a salad.

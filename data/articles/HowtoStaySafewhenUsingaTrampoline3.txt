 The bolts that secure the springs of your trampoline may loosen up as the trampoline gets repeated use. If all the springs aren't held at the correct tension, your trampoline may malfunction.For example, a loose spring could lead to a "dead spot" on the mat. If you're jumping on the trampoline and then hit that dead spot, you won't get the same degree of bounce that you did elsewhere. The hard landing can lead to leg or ankle injuries.
 A wet trampoline surface can be very dangerous. As you jump, it will become impossible to keep your footing. A trampoline mat may take a few days to dry completely after rain.You may be able to find a cover you can use to protect your mat and keep it dry. If you're using a cover, remove it completely before using the trampoline. You still need to check to make sure the mat is dry, even if you're using a cover.
 Check your trampoline for damage before anyone uses it. You also want to check it periodically if it hasn't been used in several weeks. If you notice any damage, fix the problem as soon as possible before it gets worse.Your trampoline came with an instruction manual, which should include information on how to repair common problems. Keep a kit nearby that has the basic tools and materials you'll need to complete a repair.
You also may want to keep around trampoline mat patches, some extra bolts, and extra springs. Especially if these metal parts are exposed to the elements, you'll want to replace them if they start to show signs of rust.
 Allow there to be a buffer zone extending all the way around your trampoline. Pick up items around the yard on a regular basis, even if no one is using the trampoline at the moment.Getting in the habit of keeping the area clear will make it easier for everyone to stay safe while using the trampoline. If the buffer zone is normally kept clear, you won't forget to remove objects before jumping.

 First, unplug the power cord from the console so no electricity is running through it while you clean it. Then unhook the controllers from the console. Do the same with anything else that may be plugged into it so you have access to all of the console’s ports., If you need to clean your console, then chances are that wherever you keep it also needs cleaning. Remove the console from there and place it somewhere clean and free of dust. Make the job easier by working on a surface that isn’t going to get your console dirty all over again even while you clean it.
 Before you start blasting your expensive electronic device with compressed air, keep in mind that there’s moisture inside that can. Always hold the can upright, since this lowers the risk of releasing that moisture.Also, hold the nozzle at least five or six inches (13 or 15 cm) away from what you’re aiming at, since holding it closer will be less effective.








Read the directions to your particular brand of compressed air for any additional advice or warnings.
 Start by firing short blasts along the indentation that runs around the middle of your console. Then move on to the ports located on its front and back. Finally, blast away as much dust as you can from the remaining surfaces, plus all of the vents.
 Be sure to use a clean, dry cloth to remove any lingering dust, since a wet one can end up harming your console.Wipe down all sides of the exterior to finish up. As you work on each side, always wipe in one continuous direction away the light sensor so none of it ends up in there. Also avoid wiping dust into any of the ports and ruining your work.
 Set the console aside and dust the area where you keep it. Depending on how much has accumulated and how much ends up in the air as you clean, give any airborne dust time to settle back down and repeat. Then set your console back in place.

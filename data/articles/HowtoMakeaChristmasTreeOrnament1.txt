 Draw a Christmas tree shape on the cardboard using a pencil.;
, Carefully cut around the edges of where you drew the line.
 Get some green paint and a paintbrush and paint one side of the tree.
 Repeat steps 1 and 2, only with the shape of a star. Then, paint one side yellow.
 Put a dab of glue at the top of the tree and lightly press the star onto it.
 Get paint of different colors and make small dots on the tree to make it look like it has ornaments on it.
 Get something small and sharp, like a sewing needle, and poke it through the center of the star.
 You need a string to hang it on your tree, so just get a piece of dental floss and stick it through the hole you made in the star. Tie the end of the string into a strong knot.
 You could just put it on the Christmas tree, or you could wrap it up and give it to someone. If giving, find a small box and put the ornament into it. Then, just wrap up the box and put it under the tree.

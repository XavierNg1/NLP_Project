 If your baby is stirring, stretching, or making sucking motions, your baby is showing early signs of hunger. Crying and fussing are later signs that the newborn is hungry. Try to start feeding as soon as you recognize that the baby is hungry. This will keep you from having to spend so much time soothing the baby.


The baby will let you know when it's time to eat. Listen to your baby and feed when he or she wants to eat.If your baby sleeps for more than three or four hours, wake them to eat during the first few weeks. After this, it is okay to let your baby sleep longer.If your baby stops sucking, turns away from the food, or closes his or her mouth, the baby may be full. Burp the baby and wait a few minutes to be sure.
 Newborns eat eight to 12 times a day. This is about one feeding every two or three hours. Only feed the newborn breast milk or formula. If you are using formula, your baby may only eat every three to four hours. A newborn does not need water or juice.The amount of food your newborn needs varies with each baby; however, most newborn babies take about 1â€“3 oz per feeding. Trust your gut and look for signs that your infant is eating enough such as:Weight gain
Appearing satisfied in between feedings
At least six wet diapers and three bowel movements each day (after the first five days)
Feeding is also another time for you to bond with your baby. Don't forget to talk to, make eye contact with, and rub your baby during this time., After a few ounces, or while switching breasts, hold the baby over your shoulder and gently pat or rub the back until you hear the baby burp. You can also place the baby in your lap, use your hand to support the chest, support the cheek bones with your thumb and finger. Lean the baby slightly forward and wait for the baby to burp.


Your baby may not burp every time, but burping keeps your baby from eating too fast and helps reduce gas.Burp her after feeding as well.

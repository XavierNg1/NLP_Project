 You can look up your J7's unique IMEI code, which you can then verify with Samsung.
 This will immediately pull up a window that displays your IMEI code.


If this dial code doesn't do anything, you likely have a fake device.
 The number should be 14-15 digits long.
 You can start a live chat at samsung.com/support/ or call 1-800-SAMSUNG.
 Explain that you're concerned your device is fake.
 The support rep should be able to check to see if your device is genuine. You may have to wait for a reply.

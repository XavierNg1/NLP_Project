 Catching the ball in a shot-ready (or athletic) position is a good way to improve your form. By being ready to shoot the ball when you catch it, rather than getting ready to shoot the ball after you catch it, you can improve the speed and accuracy of your shots.








To get into a shot ready position, bend your knees slightly and hinge your body forward at the hips. You should look as if you are getting ready to jump in the air. This will provide you with some extra power when you make your shot.;
, Your shot pocket is the position where you shoot the ball from and this is different for everyone. Try to identify the most comfortable shot pocket position for you and stick with that position.








For example, you might feel most comfortable shooting from the center of your forehead, to the right of your head, or slightly above your head.
Keep in mind that you don’t need to have the same shot pocket that other players do. Focus on what seems to work best for you.
 The position of your arm, hand, and head can also influence the accuracy of your shots. Your shooting arm and hand should form a “C” shape when you are getting ready to shoot the ball. You can check yourself in a mirror or have a friend check you from the side.








Make sure that you are looking straight ahead as well.
 When you shoot the ball, make sure that you follow through with your shot by snapping your elbow.Then, hold the position until the ball makes contact with the hoop and








Follow through with your body as well. You should begin your shot in an athletic position and then spring out of it as you make your shot. Keep your body in this extended position after you make the shot.

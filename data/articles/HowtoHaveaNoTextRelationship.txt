 Explain to them that you'd rather be together in person more often. Make sure that they know that it's not that you don't want to text them; it's that you want to have your relationship based offline.;
, Don't all of a sudden stop texting; take it slowly. Start by limiting yourself to only thirty minutes a day, or send only a hundred texts a day. Switch to phone calls instead of texting; have an hour chat every other night to make up for the loss of texting. If you usually text often, this may be a bit hard for you. To keep you from giving up, think about how nice it would be to spend time with the one you love, and not just sitting around staring at a small screen, wasting time and phone battery.
 Keep at a pace that is comfortable for you.
 Go to parks with your boyfriend/girlfriend, record stores, the mall, events in your town; anywhere! You'll find that your time is better spent, you feel happier, and you can also see the face of the one you love and feel their presence.
 If you want to, go all the way and do this with everyone; stop texting altogether, or only use it for emergencies. By doing this, you will reduce your phone bill, save energy, and have more time to do important things.

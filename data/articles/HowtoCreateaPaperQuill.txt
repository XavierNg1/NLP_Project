 A piece of printer paper is usually a fine choice.;
, Outline a feather shape next to the fold. Draw the outline so that one side of the feather is straight and is formed on the fold, as shown in the image.
 There should be one piece consisting of two feathers, still joined on the fold.
 This step can be as simple or as elaborate as wished; the image shown has recreated feather-like strokes using markers. Other ideas include calligraphy, watercolor paints or pencils, stencilling, stamping or even decoupage.
 The exact positioning will be dependent on the size and length of the ballpoint pen you've chosen; adjust it as needed.
 Spray or adhere glue to both insides of the feather in the area where the pen will be attached.
 Carefully fold the feathers to meet, capturing the pen in the middle. Gently mold the section of the feathers that sit over the pen so that it wraps around the pen as shown.


You can curl or bend the feather a little so that it won't seem so stiff.
 Once dry, the paper quill is ready for use or for wrapping as a gift.

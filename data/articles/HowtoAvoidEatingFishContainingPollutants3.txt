 One of the main sources of mercury contamination is through fish.The highest risk for mercury poisoning is for the developing fetus, so pregnant mothers must be particularly careful when choosing fish.


Fish that the highest concentrations of mercury include saltwater fish like shark, swordfish, and tuna. Freshwater fish, such as pike, walleye, and bass, are also known to be potentially high in mercury.
 PCBs, used in electrical equipment, building materials, and to keep dust down on roads, were banned in the US in 1979. However, these cancer-causing chemicals are still found in foods, oceans, rivers, and soils. PCBs can be degraded by sunlight and by various microorganisms, but the process can be slow., Pesticides can be very difficult to track and are often not even tested for, likely because there are so many. Pesticide contamination is most common in freshwater fish with nearby agricultural runoff.
 Have your mercury blood levels checked every year, especially if you eat a lot of fish. If you intend to become pregnant and are concerned about mercury levels, avoid any of the fish listed for six to 12 months and get re-tested before trying to get pregnant.

 Move furniture out of the way, make sure that there is plenty of free space for guests to mill around, dance, play games, etc. Put the food in an easily accessible place but not somewhere that impedes movement.


It's best to party proof your house beforehand, too. The food table should be away from anything that shouldn't get spilled on or ruined. If guests are drinking, have a place for coats, keys, and get the bathroom ready.
 It is always nice to decorate the table Halloween style, with an orange tablecloth, a witch's hat, a pumpkin, etc., whatever takes your fancy and is available. Provide plates, utensils, serviettes/napkins, drinking glasses. Serve the drinks nearby.


Wait to add ice to any drinks or to bring out any food that needs to be warm until numbers have accumulated.

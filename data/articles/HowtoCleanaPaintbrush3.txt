 After an hour, check to see if you can bend the bristles back. If you can't, put it back in and keep soaking it for another hour.
 If there's still hardened paint in your bristles after 2 hours of soaking, try boiling. You want the vinegar to completely cover the brush's bristles.
 Let it simmer for a few minutes with the paintbrush in it., It will be very hot to the touch at first, so be careful. You may want to use a pot holder or tongs to remove it.
 You can use your finger or an old comb. Place it at the base of the bristles and pull through to comb out the loosened paint. Keep doing this until the hard globs of paint have all come loose.
 When the paint is loose, rinse the brush in running water to wash it all away.
 You may need to do another vinegar boiling session and comb the brush again to get it back into shape.
 Place it upright in a jar and reshape the bristles. After it's completely dry, store it away.

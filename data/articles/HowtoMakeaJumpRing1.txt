 This depends almost entirely on what you want your jump ring to be like. If you are making a large jump ring, you should use thick, fairly stiff wire. If your jump ring is to be smaller, you may get away with a slightly thinner wire.;
, The loop should end with the long part of the wire just below the short part (when looking at it from the side with the pliers pointing upwards).
 Make sure you don't hold it so tightly it can't move up the pliers. The loops should be the same size rather than stacked in a cone shaped like the pliers.
 This allows for mistakes and the removal of sharp ends.
 This will leave you with just a coil of wire.
 Find the point where the wire ends and cut through the loop above at this point. When you take your cutters away, you should have a jump ring attached to it. Continue this step until all of the coil has been cut into jump rings.

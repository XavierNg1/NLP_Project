 You can find the Setting app on your Home screen. The icon is a gray gear.
 If you don't have this option in the first group of Settings, your cellular plan does not support sharing your iPhone's internet connection. You'll need to contact your carrier to switch to a plan that supports tethering.
 It will turn green when enabled. If you are notified at this point that your plan does not support tethering, you'll need to contact your carrier.
 Perform the following on a Windows computer to connect to the Bluetooth network:

Click Join a Personal Area Network.
Click Add a device.
Click your iPhone and tap Pair on the box that appears on your iPhone's screen.
Right-click on your iPhone after it installs and select Connect using → Access point. Your computer is now using your iPhone's internet.



Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences.
Click the ⋮⋮⋮⋮ button to view the main menu.
Click the Bluetooth menu option.
Click Pair next to your iPhone and then Pair on your iPhone's screen.
Click the Bluetooth button in your menu bar, highlight your iPhone, and click Connect.
 Now that you're connected to the network, you should be able to access the internet using your iPhone's internet connection.


Note that Bluetooth is slower than Wi-Fi or USB tethering, but it is more secure.

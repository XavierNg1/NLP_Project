 When you call the office or arrive for an appointment, ask for your attorney by either "Ms. Smith, please," or "May I speak to Mary Smith?"

, You may be very comfortable with your attorney or know her socially outside of the office. However, in public meetings, you are in a business environment and should observe formalities. In private meetings, some attorneys are comfortable with first names, others aren't. Even with an attorney you know well, you shouldn't use nicknames without permission. Don't be afraid to ask if you are unsure how to address your attorney when in private meetings.
 Some courts are more formal than others, but you should always refer to your attorney by honorific/surname (Ms. Smith) while in the courtroom, regardless of your social relationship. A typical courtroom etiquette rule requires all persons present to use titles and surnames. Ignoring these rules can result in sanctions ranging from a stern warning to cancellation of your hearing to being held in contempt for disrespect to the court.


Always refer to a judge, whether male or female, as "Your Honor."
The term "counselor" is very formal and usually only used in court between the judge and the other attorneys. It is not wrong to refer to your attorney as "counselor," but the honorific/surname is preferred.

 Insert a second AA, LR6 1.5 volt battery into the digital clock.Ensure that you insert the battery according to the right polarity on the battery. This is indicated by the plus and minus signals on the case and on the battery.
 Mount the clock to stand in an upright position near a window so that it can search and receive a signal. The clock will either receive a WWVB signal to set itself to the exact time within five minutes of exposure or it will determine that a signal cannot be received due to the location or time of day., Select the time zone that you are in. The SkyScan atomic clock can only collect the correct signal from 2,000 miles (3,200Â km) away, so it must be set to the correct zone to get an accurate reading.


Press and hold one of the four time zone buttons MT-Mountain Time, CT-Central Time, ET-Eastern Time, and PT-Pacific Time.
Clocks tend to automatically default to a Pacific area time zone. If you are in the Pacific area time zone, hang up your clock. If not, use one of the buttons to make the setting correct.
 If you choose to manually set the hands, be aware that it will still gather a signal and adjust the time periodically, overriding manual set ups.Once the SkyScan clock picks up the signal from the NIST station, it will advance by eight seconds until it gets the right signal.

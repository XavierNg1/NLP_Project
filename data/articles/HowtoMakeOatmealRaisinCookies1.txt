 Line baking sheet with a parchment paper, or spray it with a non-stick cooking spray to ensure that the cookies can be removed cleanly when finished.;
, Add the room-temperature butter, white sugar, and brown sugar into a large mixing bowl and slowly increase the speed on your mixer. You want everything to be blended and the mixture to be light and fluffy., Work the eggs in slowly at first to avoid splattering. Add in the vanilla and keep mixing until everything is well-blended and the same color.
 You just want all of the dry ingredients to be even distributed before adding. Use a fork or small whisk to break up any clumps as well, making the dough much more even and easy to work with.
 Add the flour slowly, in 3-4 parts, and mix each part in individually. Don't simply dump all the flour in and turn the mixer on -- far more of it will end up on the countertop than in the cookies. Keep mixing until all of the flour is incorporated into the mixture and there is none along the sides of the bowl.
 Once all the flour is in, stop using the hand mixer. Flour gets tougher the more you beat it, leading to denser, less chewy cookies. Dump in the oats and raisins and mix them in with a spatula, stopping once they evenly distributed.
 For perfect looking cookies, you could roll them into balls, but this is rarely necessary. Just scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of batter and drop it on the cookie sheet. Keep the cookies roughly 2 inches apart.


No matter what size you choose for you cookies, keep it consistent for all of them so that they take the same amount of time to cook., There should be little moist cracks in the tops of the cookies, which will slightly harden over as they cool. If you take them out once they've completely hardened, you'll be left with crunchy cookies., Wire racks will ensure the entire cookie cools at the same pace, leading to far greater texture and chewiness.

 Schedule an appointment with a qualified investment advisor before you make important decisions about your retirement and investment accounts. An advisor will be able to help you look at all relevant variables, help you run the numbers, and arrive at the best annuity payment solution for your situation and specific needs.
 You will have the option to select a beneficiary, or the person who will inherit the annuityâ€™s funds. The beneficiaries will be responsible for paying taxes on amount of money that was initially placed into the annuity and the amount it is worth when the investor dies. You can name more than one beneficiary, and you can change the beneficiary at any time as long as your contract allows., If the insurance company you have invested in declares bankruptcy, you could lose your money. Be sure that the company you are investing in is sound, trustworthy, and has a good credit rating.

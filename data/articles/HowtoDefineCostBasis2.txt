 For this calculation, you would assume that any profit or loss you earned this year came from the sale of securities purchased first. It is the default method for calculating cost basis. Unless you specify otherwise, the IRS assumes that you used this method to calculate the cost basis., For example, suppose you own 100 shares of ABC common stock that you purchased 2 years ago for $5,000 (at a cost of $50 per share) and 100 shares that you purchased 3 years ago for $3,000 (at a cost of $30 per share) and 100 shares that your purchased 5 years ago for $1,000 (at a cost of $10 per share). Your total holding at this point was 300 shares of ABC for a total cost of $9,000.This year you sold 50 shares of stock for $3,000.


Using the FIFO method, you would assume that you sold the oldest shares first. This means you sold the 50 shares of the securities purchased initially for a cost of $10.00 per share or $500 total ($10 x 50 shares).
 To calculate your capital gain or loss, you subtract the cost basis from the selling price of the assets. The difference is your gain or loss. This is the amount used to figure your taxes on the sale.In the above example, the cost basis of the 50 shares sold is $500. The selling price was $3,000. Calculate the capital gain with the equation $3,000 - $500 = $2,500.
Your capital gain in this example is $2,500. This is the amount used to calculate the taxes you owe.
 This method is easy to understand. The assumption is simple, that the shares are sold in the same order in which they were bought. It is also uncomplicated for record-keeping. You don’t have to worry about identifying specific shares you’ve sold and figuring out the cost basis for each.However, you do need to keep good records of the different purchase dates, as the transaction date also affects whether the gain or loss is long term or short term.
 The FIFO method is less tax-efficient. Your gains or losses are not being calculated in the most accurate way. If you want to minimize your gains or maximize your losses to offset your gains, this is not the best method to use. You have no control over which assets are used to calculate your capital gain or loss.

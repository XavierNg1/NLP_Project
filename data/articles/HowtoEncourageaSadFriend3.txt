 Ask if there is anything you can do for her. Offer to watch her kids while she spends time alone working through her sadness. Offer to go to the grocery store and/or cook a meal or meals for her. Offer to clean her house. If her parent is very ill, offer to go with her when she takes him to the doctor., She may need some alone time right now. Comply with her wishes, but tell her to call you when she needs you, regardless of the time. If she takes you up on your offer and calls you at two in the morning, make sure you answer your phone and listen to her. If she needs to see you at three in the morning, climb out of bed and go to her.Don't forget to call her to say hi and to ask how she's doing and how she's feeling.
 Friends who you both share can provide extra support and duplicate the cheering-up efforts. You don't want to tell them anything she's told you in confidence. Ask her beforehand if you can tell them about her sadness, and clarify what you can say., If your friend's sadness continues, if her sadness is interfering with her life, if you find that you can't cheer her up, her problem may be more serious than being upset over a difficult situation. She may be clinically depressed.Be honest with your concerns. Suggest she talk to someone about her problems. Offer to help her find a counselor or therapist and drive her to the appointment if needed.

 If your kettle manufacturer states that you should not use vinegar to clean your kettle, you can use lemon instead. Make a solution with lemon and water. Squeeze a lemon into water and then cut up the lemon and place the slices in the water. Fill the kettle with this solution.Boil the water and let it soak in the kettle for around an hour.
Dump the water and rinse the kettle.
Alternately, you can use a lime instead of a lemon.
 Another cleaning option is to make a solution of baking soda and water. Mix around a teaspoon of baking soda into water. Pour this into the electric kettle and bring to a boil.Let the solution soak for around 20 minutes. Then, pour out the solution and rinse with cold water.
This should remove the scaling inside the kettle.
 If you want to use a commercial cleaner, find a kettle cleaning product online or in your local home improvement store or supermarket. You should dilute the cleaning product with water according to the directions and boil the solution in the kettle.Leave the solution in the kettle to let it soak.
Rinse the kettle with cold water.

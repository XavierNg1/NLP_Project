 Corticosteroid creams block certain inflammatory and itch-inducing chemicals in the immune system, and can be applied directly to itchy skin.
 Antihistamines are primarily used when itchiness is a result of an allergic reaction. They work by blocking the body’s production of histamines, which are involved in the inflammatory response system.
 Applied directly to itchy skin, topical anesthetics contain ingredients that numb nerve endings, thereby decreasing the sensation of itchiness.
 If you and your doctor determine that your itch is caused by an underlying psychological, emotional, or stress condition, you may be given Prozac or Zoloft, both of which have proven anti-itch properties.
 Your doctor may suggest using a topical calcineurin inhibitor, which reduces itchiness by blocking your body’s inflammatory response system.
 In some cases, your doctor may recommend light therapy, also known as phototherapy. This type of treatment exposes skin to various wavelengths of light in order to block the immune system functions that contribute to inflammation and itching.
 If your itchiness is the result of a fungal infection such as ringworm or athlete’s foot, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal agent. These can be applied topically or taken orally.

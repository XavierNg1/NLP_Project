, In most cases, you will want to cut them right at the first knuckle. Use a tailor's chalk (for dark gloves) or pen (light colors) to draw a line across your fingers.
 You will be hemming your gloves so that they don't fray. Once you hem them, they will be the right length.


Measure your other glove against the one you just cut, and cut that one too. This way, they will be even.
 You can cut the entire thumb off, or you can cut it off at the middle. If you want to be more precise, pull the glove on, and draw a cutting line as you did with the fingers., Working one finger at a time, fold the raw edge inward by Â¼-inch (0.64-centimeter). Sew around the finger using a loose, running stitch or a hem stitch. Knot the thread, then snip the excess off.


Pull the glove on before knotting the thread. This way, your finger will stretch and loosen the hem so that it fits.
You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.
 Make any adjustments, if necessary. Once you are happy with the fit, repeat the process for the other glove.

,, Place one sliced banana on the right side of the ice cream and the second slice on the left side. Place the third slice on the top of the ice cream sticking up.

 Place a tablespoon of chocolate fudge on each banana and stick each cherry on one banana.,, Stick the blue and green candy melts on the ice cream to resemble the 'eyes'. Place the pink candy melt in the middle to resemble the 'nose'., Curve the string of red licorice into the shape of a 'C' and place it upwards to form the 'smile'., Garnish the bottom of the sundae with plenty of whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!

 If you experience tattoo scarring, avoid placing the scar in direct sunlight. The sun can cause scarred tissue to darken or become red, making it look more noticeable. As a result, you should always apply sunscreen to the scarred area before sun exposure. Use a sunscreen that is SPF 30 and reapply frequently throughout the day., Aloe vera gel can help to reduce the appearance of scars by moisturizing the skin. The gel from the aloe plant contains microbial and anti-inflammatory properties which can help heal the skin and reduce scars. Apply the gel directly to the scarred skin two to three times a day., Moisturizing a scar will not remove the scar, but it can help to blend the scar tissue with the surrounding skin. Moisturizers will provide nutrition to the area and can reduce the appearance of scars.

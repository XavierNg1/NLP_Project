 Garage door openers are found in three different sizes: 1/3 horsepower, 1/2 horsepower and 3/4 horsepower.


You will need to examine if you need an opener to lift one or two doors. You will also need to take into consideration the material and size of the door.
If you plan to purchase an opener to lift double doors, you will need to look for an opener that is at least 1/2 horsepower.
A single door can be lifted with a 1/3 hp opener. However, an opener with more power will last longer.
Oversize, large and heavy doors will need the most horsepower.;
, The three main types are belt drive, chain drive and screw drive.


Belt drive openers raise and lower the door on rubber belts. This is a very quiet opening and closing. In most cases, this type of garage door opener is on the higher end of pricing.
Metal chains raise and lower the garage door on chain driven openers. Naturally, the clanging of the chains causes a more noisy opening and closing. This type of opener is usually lower priced.
Screw driven garage door openers raise and lower the door on a threaded rod. This type of opener has fewer parts and is often lower maintenance.
 The average opener opens at 7 inches (17.8Â cm) per second. Some models may double in speed. Others may be slower.
 Do you need a retailer that offers installation? Will you install it? Do you have an outside party that will complete the installation?

, Now that you know what you need, visit stores such as Lowe's, Sears and Home Depot. Private businesses that sell and install garage doors will most likely also sell garage door openers.

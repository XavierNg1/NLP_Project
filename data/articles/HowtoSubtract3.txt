 Let's say you're working with the following problem: 10.5 - 8.3. Write 10.5 above 8.3 so that the decimal points of both numbers are lined up. The .5 in 10.5 should be over the .3 in 8.3, and the 0 in 10.5 should be over the 8 in 8.3.


If you have a problem where both numbers don't have the same amount of numbers after the decimal point, write a 0 in the empty spaces until they even out. For example, if you have the problem 5.32 - 4.2, you can rewrite it as 5.32 = 4.20. This won't change the value of the second number while making it possible to subtract both numbers more easily.
 You should follow the same process you'd follow when subtracting regular whole numbers, except that you need to remember to line up the decimals of both numbers and to keep the decimal in your answer. In this case, you need to subtract 3 from 5. 5 - 3 = 2, so you should write a 2 below the 3 in 8.3.


Make sure to carry that decimal point down to the answer. It should read .2 so far.
 Now, you'll need to subtract 8 from 0. Borrow from the 1 next to the 0 to make it a 10, and subtract 8 from 10 (10 - 8) to get 2. You can also just think of it as subtracting 8 from 10 without borrowing since there's no number in the tens column of the second number. Write the answer down below the 8, to the left of the decimal point.
 Your final answer is 2.2.
 If you want to make sure you subtracted decimals correctly, then all you have to do is to add your answer and the smaller number to make sure that you get the larger number. 2.2 + 8.3 = 10.5 so you're all done.

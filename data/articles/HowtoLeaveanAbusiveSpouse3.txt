 Your spouse is an adult, and they have agency over what they say and do. You cannot make them abuse you any more than you can make them treat you kindly. Realize that it isn’t your fault when your spouse treats you badly, no matter what they might tell you.An abuser will often try to make their victim feel like the abuse is the victim’s fault, but this is just a manipulation tactic.
 If you have children, living with an abuser may be dangerous for them. Take this into account as you decide whether to leave your spouse.If your spouse is the parent of your kids, leaving can be especially difficult. Even if you’re not ready to get out yet, talk to your kids about abuse, and make sure they know how to stay safe in the face of violence.
For instance, show your kids a safe place in the house where they can go if your spouse starts abusing you, and make sure they know not to intervene.
 Once you’ve made the decision to leave your spouse, stick with it. Don’t waver, or you may not end up following through. Remind yourself why you are leaving, and don’t let your spouse or anyone else dissuade you.If you’re married to an abuser, you probably already know how manipulative they can be. Maintain your inner resolve to leave, even if your spouse acts apologetic or turns on their charm.
Make a list of reasons why you want to leave your marriage. Refer to it when you feel like changing your mind. Be sure to keep this list somewhere secure where your spouse can’t find it, such as a password-protected document on your computer.

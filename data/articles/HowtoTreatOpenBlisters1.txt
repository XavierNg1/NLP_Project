 As soon as the blister pops, tears, or opens, wash it well. Use warm water and soap.Any dirt in the blister should wash away with the soap. If something is lodged in your skin, visit your doctor to have it thoroughly cleaned and treated.;
, If the skin over the blister tears off partially or completely, that’s okay. However, don’t try to pull off the overlying skin.Leave as much skin intact as possible.Don’t pick at the edges of the exposed skin., You can use a plain ointment like petroleum jelly to keep the blister hydrated and comfortable, but using an antibiotic ointment can also help prevent infection. Apply a large enough dab of ointment to cover the whole raw area of the open blister.If you prefer a natural alternative, use calendula cream., Apply an adhesive bandage over the blister or, if the blister covers a large area, a sterile gauze pad held in place with medical tape. Change the bandage every day, or if it gets dirty. Apply more ointment every time you change the bandage.You can also use a hydrocolloid dressing, which may provide more relief than a sterile bandage. You can get these from most pharmacies., Continue to change your dressing daily until the blister stops being tender. Then trim the dried, dead skin.Use small nail scissors or nail clippers that have been sterilized by rubbing them with alcohol, boiling them for several minutes, or holding them over an open flame for about one minute.

Do not pull the dead skin, as this can cause further injury to the tender area. Clip the skin carefully.

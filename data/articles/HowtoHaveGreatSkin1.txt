 Don't over-wash your face, however. You will dry out your skin, which will cause it to produce extra oils to compensate. Instead, wash your face in the morning when you wake up, and in the evening before you go to bed. Use a gentle face wash designed for your skin type. Don't use ordinary hand or body soaps; they are too harsh for the sensitive skin on your face and could lead to dryness or breakouts.

If you have dry skin, pass on the powder foundation and go for a cream or liquid foundation instead.
If you have normal skin, you can wear any type of foundation.

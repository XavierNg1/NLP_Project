 Symptoms of leptospirosis can vary and can look like symptoms associated with other infections or illnesses. If you develop flu-like symptoms suddenly, donâ€™t assume it is flu if there is the possibility of exposure.Leptospirosis generally presents with flu-like symptoms including fever, myalgia, rigor, and headache.;
, A high fever and chills can indicate infection because your body is trying to fight off the infection. If you feel excessively warm suddenly, or have chills, take your temperature and call your doctor., Some people experience symptoms of light sensitivity and headache with this kind of infection. If you develop a painful reaction to light or intense headaches along with other symptoms, get medical attention., Muscle aches are a common symptom of infection too. Because muscle aches are symptoms of fever or flu as well as leptospirosis, review your recent activities before deciding these are merely flu symptoms., You may feel nausea with or without vomiting or diarrhea. Let your doctor know about any sudden stomach problems., Jaundice may appear later as the infection progresses, and can indicate serious liver problems. Jaundice will typically appear 4-5 days after exposure, so review activities during that time period to assess exposure risks., Pain in the right upper abdominal area is a symptom of second phase infection. Often leptospirosis can develop into chronic renal disease. If you develop pain in this area, see a doctor right away., Sudden rash that is dark red to purple in color is symptomatic of infection. A rash that is concentrated on the lower body or palette of the mouth is specifically associated with this kind of infection.

 You'll need a solid rubber eraser and a few dozen sticky notes. Keep in mind that your final kneaded eraser will be about the same color as whichever one you choose to start with. A multicolored eraser won't produce a smooth, uniform putty eraser.The color of your sticky notes won't have any impact on the final eraser. However, since the sticky notes won't be usable after you're finished, consider using up a color you dislike.
 Rub your eraser along the sticky part of each note. Use enough force to remove the glue from the paper but not so much that you tear the paper. When one sticky note runs out of glue, move on to a new one., After you've finished each sticky note, sweep the eraser shavings into one large pile. Keep rubbing your eraser against the sticky notes until you have enough shavings to make a new eraser. A pile containing about a tablespoon's worth of shavings is a good size to shoot for., The thin shape of the rubber makes it more malleable, while being coated with glue from the sticky notes will make the small pieces much easier to stick together. Carefully scoop the pile of eraser shavings into your hand. Squeeze the shavings into a smaller clump. Roll the clump around in your hand. Continue working it until the clump becomes nice and smooth. When that happens, your eraser putty is finished.

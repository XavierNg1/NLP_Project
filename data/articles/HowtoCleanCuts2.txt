 When you examine the cut, it is important to assess whether the edges of the cut fit nicely together. In a small cut or scratch you have nothing to worry about. However, if you have an open wound and it is hard to pull the edges of the wound together, you will want to see a doctor to consider stitches. The advantage of stitches is that they hold the edges of the wound in place in exactly the position that is ideal for healing. Also, the sooner you receive stitches the better, as having them put in sooner rather than later (if they are needed) diminishes scarring and improves healing.
 See your doctor immediately if you suspect your cut may be infected.
 If the cut is severe enough to show tendons or ligaments, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, or bone, you should definitely see a doctor as this is considered a deep wound that merits medical attention.Also, if the bleeding does not stop, and/or if you have numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation, go to the Emergency Room immediately. All of these are signs of a more severe injury that warrant professional attention and evaluation.


Always see a doctor if you have been bitten by an animal.
Also see your physician if you have a puncture wound from stepping on a nail or other foreign object.
Both of these situations will require infectious disease precautions.

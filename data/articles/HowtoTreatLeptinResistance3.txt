 Leptin resistance can be related to a number of obesity-related medical issues, from heart disease to diabetes. If you haven’t already, schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss your overall health.If you’re concerned about losing weight and improving your health, ask them about medications, dietary changes, and workout routines you should adopt.
 Leptin resistance research is still a relatively young discipline, and new treatments are being studied and developed. In time, gene therapies could become available that help your brain respond to leptin in your system.Hormone treatments have already proved modestly successful at improving leptin sensitivity and aiding weight loss.You could ask your doctor if they’re familiar with or recommend any emerging treatments. Ask them if they could refer you to a medical study on the subject.
 The endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, is a part of a cell that, among other functions, helps with protein transport. ER stress, which can result from neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and obesity, could be related to leptin resistance. Ask your doctor if you might have ER, and if medications that treat ER stress might also improve your leptin sensitivity.Increased exercise can also improve ER stress.

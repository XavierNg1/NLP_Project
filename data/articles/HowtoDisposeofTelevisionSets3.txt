 The hardest part of getting rid of your old TV is getting it in a truck and lugging it around town. Since most recycling centers and manufacturers make you drop off your own item, you’ll need a big vehicle.

If you have your own pick-up truck, the TV will likely fit in the bed. If you only have a tiny sedan, ask around to see if a friend has a larger vehicle you can borrow for a day. As a last resort, you may need to rent a truck.
 Offer a friend or two some pizza in return for helping you move your old TV. You’ll need the extra hands. Once the job is done, you can relax in front of your new TV!, Don’t stand more than 1 foot (0.30 m) from the old TV. Your legs should be shoulder-width apart. This is a nice strong stance that’ll help you stay balanced as you lift the heavy item., You should never bend over from the waist to lift heavy items. Squat down, keeping your back straight. This will allow you to lift with your legs and avoid straining your back muscles., Lift up one side of the TV at a time. Slip your fingers safely under the lifted sides. If you’re working in a team, be sure to communicate with one another.Make one person the spotter by positioning them in front of the TV to steady it as you lift each side.
 All the weight should be in your legs. If you feel a strain in your back, put the TV back down and reposition yourself. Once you’ve got it lifted, either walk the TV to the truck or move it to a wheeled dolly.Wheeled dollies will make moving the TV from spot to spot much easier. If you’re working without a dolly, you can also use an old blanket to slide the TV across surfaces.
The spotter should continue to steady the TV once you transfer to it a dolly or start walking by keeping a hand on the center of the item.

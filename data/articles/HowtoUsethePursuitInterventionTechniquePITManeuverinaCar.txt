It is usually performed while the two cars are almost touching each other. A starting distance which is too great can cause danger to Car A.;
, At speeds closer to 40 mph (64 km/h), Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B.



Car A will need to straighten out, so as to not follow through too much and lose control. Car A then needs to slow down immediately to avoid broadsiding Car B.
For two comparable cars, Car A should always be able to slow down faster than Car B, due to efficiencies of braking in a straight line.



An experienced driver in a FWD vehicle could recover and drive off in the original direction at surprisingly fast speeds.
An experienced driver in a RWD vehicle will, once the vehicle is slowed most of the way, likely try to accelerate in the opposite direction of the initial pursuit.
AWD vehicles may be able to go either direction.
 For example, before the tap into Car B's rear quarter, easing off the throttle (or even using the brake a bit) at the same time as the turn-in, will increase front tire down-force and increase traction for a very short period of time, which can add lateral velocity into Car B.

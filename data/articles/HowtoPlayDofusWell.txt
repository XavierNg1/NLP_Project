, Dofus is an MMORPG (massively multiplayer online roleplaying game). There's no point to playing an MMORPG if you're not looking to make friends. Eventually you will come to need their assistance in some way so start making friends right away.
 Some people don't do them but they are good for the first 3-5 levels, then you may move onto other things. Killing gobballs, and doing the dungeon are good ways to gain experience after that.
 Be careful for the various creatures that will attack you. They will only attack as a p2p character attacks, but for f2p members, it's harder to level up.
 At this point it is hard to level up if you do not switch. Once you get p2p, head for the Rocky Intel for amazing XP, or The Dragon Pig area it's a long walk, but so worth it.
 Here you can learn some good ways to level even higher.
 You can make money out of items, resources, and crafts.
 Try to get mobs near to your level for better xp.

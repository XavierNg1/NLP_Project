 Explore different styles of martial arts, each of which includes multiple kata. Once you’ve mastered one, learn another. Widen your skill-set with more techniques and combinations.
 Practice both sides of your body an even number of times. Perform the kata with your favored side and then your weaker side (the left side for right-handed people; the right side for left-handed people)., Picture your own movements within each kata as well as your imaginary opponent’s. Imagine yourself from your own first-person point-of-view, as opposed to an external, third-person POV. Project a mental image for your body to fulfill in action. Practice this while physically practicing katas or while doing something else entirely.It may also be helpful to practice in front of a full length mirror.
 Once you’ve mastered a kata while alone in a controlled environment, seek out or create a less controlled environment. Sharpen your ability to focus on your kata while other elements try to call attention to themselves. Perform your kata in front of other people, in noisy areas, and/or in less than ideal weather, such as heavy rain, snow, heat, etc., Practice rebounding from internal distractions. Stub your toe, spin around until you’re dizzy, or work yourself up into a rage over something that’s been bothering you lately. Then perform your kata in this less than ideal mindset, which will resemble your mental state in an actual fight much more closely than always practicing with a calm mind will.

 The skate boot must also prevent most lateral movement. Keep in mind that it should still allow flexing and pointing of the foot as well as bend in the ankle. The front of the boot should be roomy enough so that you can wiggle your toes but should still be snug around the instep and the heel.
 Blades come in many varieties:


Dance blades are shorter on the heel end.
Advanced freestyle blades have large, intricate, intense picks.
 Blades are screwed on, so make sure that you check the screws are securely intact. The blades must sit securely under the physical center of the boot. This is very important because it ensures that the blades will run true across the ice without pulling. Check out the consequences of different fitting:


Blades set too far in - the feet will fall outward
Blades set too far out - the feet will fall inward
Blades correctly centered - feet stand upright naturally


, It is very important that the blades are sharpened. Have them sharpened by someone who specialized in figure skating, not hockey. You will know when to have them sharpened when they start feeling 'slippery' on the ice or you fall out of turns.
 When you first purchase your skates, the shop will either apply a waterproof coat for you or they will tell you to do it yourself. This will keep the sole waterproofed so that it doesn't absorb the water and break down and rot.
 While walking around the rink, it is essential to always wear guards. They come in many different colors and combinations to suit your personality and they protect the blades from undue pressure. They are usually made from plastic.
 As soon as you step off the ice to take off your skates, use an old towel to wipe the water from the boots and blades. Put a "soaker" over the blade to protect it. This will ensure that your skates last.

 Have you ever bought a temporary tattoo from a quarter machine or the toy store? These temporary tattoos are printed onto water slide paper, a special paper lined with adhesive on one side. The tattoo design is printed with ink on the adhesive.


Water slide paper is available online or in craft stores.
 The sky is the limit when you're using water slide paper; any shape, color or pattern will print beautifully onto the paper and show up clearly on your skin. Use Photoshop or a similar computer program meant for creating images to come up with a tattoo design.


Decide whether you want the tattoo to be in black and white or color. If you have a color printer, your design can include as many colors as you want.
Choose colors that will show up well against your skin.
Keep in mind that when you apply the tattoo, the image will be reversed on your skin. That means that if your tattoo includes a word, it needs to be reversed in the design, or it will read backwards once you put it on.
 Feed the water slide paper into the paper handler in your printer. Make sure the paper is placed correctly so that the image will be printed onto the adhesive, not the matte paper. Cut out the tattoo with a pair of scissors when you're finished.
 Place the tattoo ink-side down on your skin. Cover it with a damp cloth or paper towel. Press down on the cloth or paper towel and hold it in place for 30 seconds. Remove the cloth or paper towel and peel back the paper. The dampening process causes the adhesive to "slide" from the paper to your skin.

, This type of tattoo may last a week or more before it starts to peel off. If you want to remove it before it comes off on its own, scrub it off with soapy water and a scrub brush.

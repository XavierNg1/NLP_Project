 Measure out the extra virgin olive oil and pour it into a small saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the burner up to medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat up.
 Finely chop the shallots and put them into the warmed oil in the saucepan. Sauté them for four to five minutes, stirring occasionally. You’ll know they’re ready when they’ve softened. Add sea salt to taste, if desired.
 Remove the sautéed shallots from heat and carefully transfer them into a high speed blender. Measure out and add the water, cashews, lemon juice, white pepper, non-fortified nutritional yeast, nutmeg and garlic to the blender. Secure the lid.
 Process the ingredients using a high speed setting for about 60 seconds until they are fully incorporated. The sauce should appear creamy in consistency, with a smooth texture.
 Transfer the sauce from the blender to a saucepan. Turn the burner on low. Stir the mixture constantly and allow it to cook for two minutes. Once the sauce is warmed through completely, check the texture. If it’s too thick, add small amount of water and stir well.
 Remove the sauce from heat and stir one last time. Spoon the sauce over portioned bowls of al dente noodles. Serve immediately. Pairs well with white wine and salad.

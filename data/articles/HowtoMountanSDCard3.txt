 Under "Storage" you will scroll down until you find the icon "Unmount SD Card." Wait until your phone says it is safe to eject the SD card. Slowly pull it out so you do not bend or damage the card., Look for missing gold prongs, and for chips or dents in the card. If the SD card appears to be physically damaged, you may be required to replace the SD card. These can be bought fairly cheaply at most technology stores., Before you put it back in, blow on it gently, or wipe it off with a soft cloth. This will get rid of any dust particles potentially interfering with your card. Do not continuously reinsert the card otherwise you could cause damage to both the card and the port., Plug your device into the wall charger for at least 15 minutes. You can then turn on the device using the button at the bottom. If for some reason your device isn't turning on, let it charge for a little while longer before you try again., Your device should read "Mount SD Card" when you go under the "Storage" setting. If your device still reads "Unmount SD Card" there may be a problem of communication between the SD port and the phone itself. This is most likely an internal problem which can only be fixed by taking your phone to your nearest technology professional., If the SD card works properly in another device, then your SD card slot may be faulty on the original device in which the card was tested. If the SD card fails to mount to another device, you may be required to replace the SD card. Make sure before you put your Sd card into another device, that that device is also fully charged.

 If you've already started your journey as a Pokémon trainer, you'll need to start a new campaign for this trick to work.;
, When you begin gameplay on your new account, you'll see a Squirtle, a Bulbasaur, and a Charmander appear on your screen available for the catching. If you catch one of these, the others disappear and so will your chance to start with Pikachu. So, walk away from these Pokémon until they are out of sight.
 When you walk far enough away, the Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander will reappear on your map. Stick to your guns, and walk away from them again.
 After rejecting the three normal starter Pokémon three times, Pikachu will appear alongside them the fourth time.
 Instead of walking towards one of the other three Pokémon, walk towards Pikachu and tap on it.
 When you do this, the other three Pokémon will disappear, leaving Pikachu as the first Pokémon to join your pack. What a headstart!

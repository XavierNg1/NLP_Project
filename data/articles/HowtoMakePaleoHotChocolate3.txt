 Coconut whipped cream is a delicious and paleo-friendly topping that is quite easy to make. To prepare coconut whipped cream, pour a 14 ounce (414 ml) can of chilled coconut cream into a large mixing bowl.Whisk with an electric mixer until creamy, about 30 seconds, then add in 3 tablespoons (44.37 ml) of coconut sugar.
Whisk until firm peaks form, about another 30 seconds, then scoop the coconut whipped cream on top of your hot chocolate.
 Paleo hot fudge is another topping that will make your paleo hot chocolate even more decadent! To make paleo hot fudge, melt 3 ½ tablespoons (51.7 ml) of chopped unsweetened dark chocolate in a double broiler over medium heat.To use a double broiler, place an inch (2.54 ml) of water in the lower pan of the broiler, and place the chocolate in the upper pan. The heat of the simmering water will evenly melt the chocolate.
Stir the chocolate until melted, then add 1 tablespoon of cacao powder, 2 ½ tablespoons of honey, 2 ½ tablespoons (36.97 ml) of full fat coconut milk, ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.
Once you have mixed the hot fudge ingredients together, take the fudge of the stove, let it cool for 5 minutes, then drizzle the hot fudge over your hot chocolate.
 A subtle and calorie- free way to garnish your hot chocolate is to add a pinch of your favorite sweet spice. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and ground anise are all great ways to add an extra touch to your paleo hot chocolate.

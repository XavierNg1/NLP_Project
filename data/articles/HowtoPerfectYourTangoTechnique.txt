Starting from your feet, make sure you maintain your weight on your toes, as this is what gives you control when you are dancing.






Always, think of pulling up from the lower abdomen and keeping your chest open.






The chest is very important in tango because this is where the connection is made between the leader and the follower.

, Tango is an intense and passionate dance. Much of that emotion comes from the energy which flows between the dancers and creates that all important connection.


The energy should flow from the centre of the dancers, up through their arms and chest and from there permeate through to their partner, creating a strong link and route for communication. Newcomers to Tango may at first find this hard to achieve, but with more practice and appreciation for the dance the energy will begin to flow naturally.
 The movement of your feet in Tango is extremely important.


There should be as much contact with the floor as possible, so that the feet skim over it rather than being plodded or being placed.






However, skimming should not be confused with dragging which would make the steps heavy and very tiring.
 Close contact is very important in Tango and some people need a little time to get used to it.


The man should embrace the woman using the whole of his right forearm across the middle of her back, bringing her closer to him.






The lady holds his hand with her right hand and her left is placed on his shoulder.






It's a cliché, but it's true—Practice does make perfect. The more you do it, the more you will understand your movements and technique. You'll also become more confident with your actions too.

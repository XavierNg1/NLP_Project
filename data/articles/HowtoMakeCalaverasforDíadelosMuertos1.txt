 Combine the egg white, corn syrup, and vanilla in a very clean, totally greaseless bowl.


If you want colored sugar skulls, add in the food coloring now. Use one or two drops for a light color, three or four for a rich, more vibrant color.;
, Once all the lumps have been sussed out, add it to the liquid mixture with a wooden spoon, spoonful by spoonful. Mix everything together until not quite one uniform consistency.
 When the sugar is nearly incorporated into the liquid, start kneading with your fingertips to form the dough into a ball. Dust the countertop with cornstarch, and continue kneading until you have a smooth paste.


Mix well with your hands until every bit of sugar is moistened. If your fingerprints remain when you squeeze the sugar in your hand, it is ready to mold. It should feel like cool, beach sand. If it doesn't hold together, mixture is too dry.
Remember, water sinks, so keep the sugar mixture mixed up frequently as you make your sugar skulls.When the dough is ready, put it in a plastic bag to chill in the refrigerator. You can store the chilled dough for several months.
 When you're ready, divide the dough into as many parts as the number of skulls you want to make. Take a section and roll it into a ball.


Squeeze and pinch the ball into a skull shape. Using your fingers, add depressions for the eye sockets and mouth. Use a toothpick to carve out teeth and to smooth out any rough edges.

Skull molds work too and are available just for this purpose.

 Use a ponytail holder to secure it tightly in place. This type of bun works very well with even very short styles, as long as you can gather it all into a ponytail holder.


If you want a side bun, gather your hair to the right or the left instead of right in the center. A side bun is a pretty look for a dance, party or elegant dinner.
 Hold out your ponytail and tease it with a comb by backcombing it section by section. This will add volume to your bun and create a classic "messy" appearance.If you'd prefer not to go with a messy look, you can skip this step.
 Take a small section of hair and curl it under, then use a bobby pin to secure the ends right next to your ponytail holder. Continue taking sections of hair and pinning them under until all of your hair has been pinned under and the ends are tightly secured.


Leave a few strands loose if you want the look to be messier.
For a neater appearance, divide the ponytail into two equal sections, twist each section, and pin the ends under. This will create a low ballerina-style bun.
 Spray it over the bun and the rest of your hair so your low bun doesn't come undone.

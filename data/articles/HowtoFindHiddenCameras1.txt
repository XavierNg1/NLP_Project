 While the camera may be hidden, the lens can only be camouflaged.

Locate possible places that hidden cameras can be found in a personal residence or business. Start looking in logical places such as in the bedroom, in the living room, or especially near valuable items.



 


Common items to have video cameras hidden in them include books, smoke detectors, desk plants, house plants, tissue boxes, stuffed teddy bears and electrical outlets.






Check for cameras in less conspicuous items as well. These can include a gym bag, a purse, DVD cases, air filter equipment, eyeglasses, lava lamps, buttons or a Phillips screwdriver.






Look for a little hole, no bigger than this "O," somewhere on the side facing the room.






Look for mirrors that seem to have no reason to be where they are. It may be next to impossible to spot the camera, but you can be alert to the possibility.

Search for areas that would offer the best field of vision. This is generally higher up on buildings or in open areas without obstructions.






Look for glass or plastic domes, particularly tinted ones. Public cameras are generally found behind protective shields. Chances are if it's facing the room, and is either mirrored or translucent, there's a camera behind it.

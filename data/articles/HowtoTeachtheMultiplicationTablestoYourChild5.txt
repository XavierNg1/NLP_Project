 Once the paper and pens are put back and the initial hurdles are over, go online for quizzes and games to see how much your child has retained.


Of course, it's possible to write out quizzes yourself and you're more than welcome to do this--but simply being on a computer may make your child feel like it's less of a test and more of a fun challenge.
 You've done all this work at home--now how has it gone at school? If your child isn't volunteering this information, just ask! They should be proud of good grades; if they're grades aren't so stellar, you can review with them more to have better results next time.


It's always an option to call the teacher and inquire about the curriculum. An involved parent is always appreciated.

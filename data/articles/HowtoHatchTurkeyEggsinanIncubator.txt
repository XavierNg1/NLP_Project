,, Make sure they are elevated to half the height of the eggs (usually about 1 inch). You can get disposable plastic cups and cut them to the desired height to act as platforms for the thermometers.
 This thermometer, called a wet-bulb thermometer, will give you a rough idea of the humidity in the incubator, but only if the fabric is wet.
, Put an "X" on one side and an "O" on the other (when the eggs are laying flat on their sides). This is so that when you turn them, you'll be able to turn them exactly 180 degrees. Do not use a colored pencil, a pen, or a marker - these contain chemicals that will harm the turkey through the shell.
 Have them all with the same letter facing up. For 25 Days: Turn all the eggs three to five times every 24 hours. This prevents the turkey inside from sticking to the shell.
 This is so the turkey can get into hatching position. In approx three days, on the 28th day, they will hatch. When turkeys hatch out, they may roll over the others' eggs, use the turning marks to keep the same side up.

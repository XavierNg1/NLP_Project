 Turtles will burrow into mud during cold seasons and go into a state called torpor (similar to hibernation).During this time, the turtlesâ€™ activity is minimal. They will remain in this state until warmer weather returns.


Limited evidence shows that terrapins may also spend some time hibernating in mud, or in periods of reduced activity.
 Eating habits of turtles will vary greatly by species and environment, but can include plants, insects, and other small animals. Since they are land dwellers, tortoises tend to eat low-lying plants such as grasses, shrubs, and even cacti.The diet of terrapins has not been thoroughly studied.
 Land-dwelling tortoises will build nesting burrows and lay eggs. Species of turtles and terrapins that spend time both on land and in water, as well as sea-dwelling turtles, will all leave the water to lay their eggs.

 Consider the colors of your home decorations when choosing the ribbon for this project. The length could be as short as 2 feet (60cm) or as long as you would like.
, Hang anywhere in your home that you would like for your Christmas cards to be on display.


A good way to attach the cards to the ribbon is with small miniature clothespins. You can also use binder clips that can be purchased in decorative colors.






For a little more decoration, you can make a loop in the ribbon every few inches (cm). The cards would be attached under this loop. If you choose this looping method, it will take more ribbon.

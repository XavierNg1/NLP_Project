 “Divorced, beheaded, died; Divorced, beheaded, survived.” This ditty has been memorized by generations of British schoolchildren.It is not strictly accurate. The marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves legally ended in annulment, not divorce. And both Anne of Cleves and Katherine Parr survived the king, in the sense of outliving him.;
, One died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded.” This version is inaccurate in the use of the term divorced, which should really be annulled. It also doesn’t tell you the order of the queens. However, it has a catchy meter and is easy to remember.
 “Kate and Anne and Jane, and Anne and Kate (again, again!)”For this poem, it helps to adopt an English accent, so that Jane rhymes with again. Note that “again, again” is a reminder that there are two “Kates” at the end of the list: Catherine Howard followed by Katherine Parr.

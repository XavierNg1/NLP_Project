 Add the orange food coloring in small amounts to gradually change the sugar to orange. Once it's orange, put it to one side.
 Center the skewer each time, then push the marshmallows on to one end and keep them close together.


If the skewers are not already cut to size, do so now.
 Add two tablespoons of water and warm over medium heat. Stir constantly to prevent them from sticking as they melt. Keep on a low heat so that the mixture remains melted.
 It helps to arrange everything close together, to make the assembly process easy and quick.


Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Dip a marshmallow skewer into the caramel to coat. Spoon extra caramel over the top to ensure it's evenly covered. Hold the skewer over the pan to let excess caramel drip off.
Dip in the colored sugar to coat. Spoon extra on to ensure it is evenly covered.
Place on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Repeat. Every now and then break up the sugar with a fork if it clumps together.
 Melt the chocolate as instructed by the packaging. Transfer to a piping bag or a small resealable bag with one corner snipped off. Squeeze the melted chocolate down the length of each marshmallow skewer in a zigzag line.
 Put aside for an hour or two.
 Hold with the remaining end of the skewer and bite away!

 You will need a video game to play through. You should probably pick one you have beaten at least 1 time but that is up to you;
, If your game is a game played on a TV the best method would be a capture card but a good camera is a substitute. Older video game consoles can be emulated on your computer if a capture card is too big of an investment as well as some handheld consoles. There are fancy pieces of hardware that allow you to record from handheld consoles, such as the Game Boy Player (used with a capture card) or the 4DS Capture Board. And finally if your game is played on a PC the best method is a recording software. There are free ones(eg camstudio) and much better but costly ones(eg Fraps)

, Not all LPs have voice (some don't even have video and are text-and-picture!) but the best ones have voice commentary as it adds to the entertainment value. A lot of bigger LPers use the Blue Snowball or Blue Yeti, but most high-quality mics will work. The recommended program to use to record your voice is Audacity because of the extensive noise removal options. If you want a high-quality video, learn how to use audacity to make your voice sound good.
 Most LPs are on YouTube so it would make sense to upload your videos there. If you already have one you can skip this step. If not go to https://youtube.com and follow the instructions.
, Movie Maker or iMovie will work fine, but more professional editing programs are recommended.
, Be sure to make it look as professional as possible.

 Good strangers are people you don't know but they are there to help you, such as a police officer or a doctor. However, bad strangers are people whom you don't know, who want to hurt you, do something that will make you feel uncomfortable or might take you away from your mom and dad. Bad strangers are the ones you need to stay away from.
 If they start following you, then something isn't right and you must tell a trusted adult about this. Walk as fast as you can to your parents, a neighbor, a friend's parent, a parent with children, or any adult in the area whom you can trust. If you cannot tell an adult, or if there isn't an adult in the area, walk to your house.

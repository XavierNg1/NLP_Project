 These are on the back of guitar or is the pickguard assembly such as on a Stratocaster. You will need to detach any wires leading from the pickguard assembly so you can easily replace any pickup or or other hardware.;
, There is a small amount of solder from the hot and ground wires from the pickup that you will be replacing. To remove them you need to touch the solder with the soldering gun and pull the wires apart. Don’t forget where they were because you need to know that when you place in the replacement pickup. If you need to, draw a basic schematic if you cannot get a wiring diagram., Take out the two screws on either side of any old pickup. Now gently remove it, making sure you leave enough lead wire for both positive and ground. Be certain you keep the springs, screws, and any pickup cover.
 Unless you want to try “fishing” wires through precisely drilled holes, taping a guide string or small gauge wire to the ends of the hot and ground will save you much frustration and time.
 When you buy new pickups they come with a wiring diagram. Use this diagram to distinguish which color represents the hot and ground. Then tape those wires to the guide string if needed. Be sure to pull gently or you may rip the wires out of the guitar.
 Once you have placed in the new wires and have enough lead wire, solder them to their necessary places.
 Secure the new pickup by doing the opposite of taking it out and replace all electrical covers; make sure you have firmly placed them in level so there is no room for distortion in sound.
 If you can hear a signal, congratulations! You have just installed your first replacement pickup. If you cannot get any signal, go back and find a problem by referencing your diagram.

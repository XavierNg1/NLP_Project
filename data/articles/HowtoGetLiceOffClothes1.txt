 If you have lice, you will need to wash your clothes to help you make sure you and your house are rid of them. Before you do this you need to determine which clothes you need to wash. Gather together all the clothes that you wore or used over the past two days before you noticed and treated the lice.You should include everything, including things such as scarves and hats.
When you do this you should also gather all the towels, bedding and cloth toys that you have used in the two days.;
, Once you have gathered together all the clothes, you need to wash them at a high temperature in your machine. You should set the temperature to at least 130째F (54째C). Machine washing clothes at this temperature will kill the lice.If for some reason you cannot use a washing machine, you can try submerging the clothes in hot water, at least 140째F (60째C).After washing your clothes, dry them in a dryer set to a high heat., If you have clothes that cannot be machine washed you will need to try some alternative methods for killing the lice. You can take these items to the dry cleaners and have them washed there. This is a way to clean the clothes without damaging them, while still killing the lice.This method could be used for woollen clothes that you don't want to shrink in a hot wash, or silk clothes that are too delicate for the washing machine.
You should inform the person working at the dry cleaners about the lice so they can take extra care.
You may be able to use a home dry cleaning kit if this involves you putting the clothes in the dryer on a high heat for at least fifteen minutes.
As long as the clothes are exposed to a temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 5 to 6 minutes, the lice should be killed.

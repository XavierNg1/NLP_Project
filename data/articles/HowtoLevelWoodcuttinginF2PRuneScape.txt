 You can get a free one from Bob's Axes in Lumbridge, or you can get a free one from the Woodcutting trainer in Burthrope. The highest axe you can use is a Rune Axe since it is F2P, so as soon as you hit 51 woodcutting it is a highly recommended buy.;
, It is highly recommended to cut the ones around the Grand Exchange.
 The best place to cut these would be West of Varrock East bank. However, this place can get crowded, so if there are too many people you can go to the Draynor manor.
 There are a few good locations to cut these, primarily north of Draynor bank or south of the Grand Exchange, however both locations are often crowded, so take your pick.
 The most popular spot by far to cut these would be directly south of Draynor bank, as it is within a few steps of a deposit box and very easy to bank your logs. This will get crowded, but it's the only real place to cut down willow tress in F2P

, This is a long stretch, however there are no other alternatives in F2P. The best places to do this would be just south of Edgeville, North of Varrock Castle but still within the walls of Varrock, or West of Lumbridge. YOu are going to want to save these logs, as they sell for quite a bit which you could make money with, or they could help you level up your firemaking

 Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to eight ounces of warm or lukewarm water and gargle after lifting your head back. To help cut the mucus even more, add the juice of 1/2 lemon to the salt water and gargle.
 If allergens are haunting your sinuses, the only home treatment you may need is a treatment of your home. Try the following suggestions to remove dust, pollen, and dander from your residence before they come back to bite you â€” in the nose.


Wash your clothes, sheets, pillowcases, and mattresses in hot water regularly. Hot water will kill any bacteria that may be causing your symptoms.
Use HEPA air filters in your home. HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate air, and is an industry standard tested by the government.
Vacuum regularly with true or absolute HEPA filters. Vacuuming with HEPA filters ensures that any allergens are picked up during the vacuuming process.
 All three may make mucus production worse.
 Try out a DIY steam treatment by covering your head with a towel and placing it a safe distance from a pot of warm water. Make the steam treatment aromatic by adding tea (ginger, mint, or chamomile, for example) or essential oils (lavender, rosemary, etc.).


Take a warm shower. Let the steam of the warm water work its way into your lungs and sinuses while you bathe.
 For this you'll need 3 cups of tea (1 huge cup) and hot water. Add sugar to taste and a little honey. Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 dark green lime. Drink this concoction first thing every morning without food. The lime will clean your liver and your stomach (full of last night's mucus due to the postnasal dripping) and you'll feel lots of energy throughout the day.

 If you don't want a white sheep, find a black, brown, or gray sheep. If you want colors like blue, red, green or yellow, you can make dye and dye it. To dye it, make dye and pretend it's a block and you're breaking it, but don't dye it until after the next step.;
, you need one fence gate, and a lot of fences. Once your sheep is caged, you can dye it.
 Make sure your house is near your sheep's pen, but if you want your sheep to come in, connect the fence to your house.
 Sheep are grazing animals, and the grass on a block goes away and grows back slowly when sheep graze.

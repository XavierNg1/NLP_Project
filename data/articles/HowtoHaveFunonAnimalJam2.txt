 To go to your den, click on the button that looks like a house at the bottom of the screen. Then, explore the buttons on the screen until you find a button that opens up a store. This store will let you buy items for your den. Buy some to customize your den a little! Try decorating your den a little different than you normally do. When you start out, animal jam offers you a couch, a table, a lamp, a window, and a plant. Go in the shops to see what's new.

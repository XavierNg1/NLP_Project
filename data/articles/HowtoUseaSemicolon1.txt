 A complete sentence must contain a subject and a verb and be a complete thought. The subject is the person, place, or thing that the sentence is about, and the verb is the action that is being performed in the sentence.



Ex: "Wanda couldn't fall asleep last night.";
, This sentence must be strongly related to the first sentence for the semicolon to work.



Ex: "She had too much on her mind."

, Remember to make the first letter of the second sentence lowercase.



Ex: "Wanda couldn't fall asleep last night; she had too much on her mind."

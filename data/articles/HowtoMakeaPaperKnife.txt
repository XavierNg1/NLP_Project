 Ordinary printer paper will do. Notebook paper is too thin for this object.;
, Do it so the top edge of the paper lines up with the left edge of the paper. The folded portion will form a triangle, with a rectangular piece remaining along the bottom. Make sure the edges line up and that you run your fingers along the crease you've created.
 Use a pair of scissors to cut the rectangular shape that is left over on the bottom of the paper. Then unfold the triangle to reveal a square-shaped piece of paper. You will use this paper to make a blade for your knife.
 This will create a blade that is at least 1- 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) thick. The paper should now look like a stick.
 Cut a slanting edge on one end of the paper that makes the paper resemble a sharp kitchen knife.
 Just staple the blade in the center and at the top edge to hold it together. You can even color the staples with white-out if you'd like to hide them more.
 The handle should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the slanted part of the blade. Measure and cut the excess paper from Step 3 to the appropriate length, and then fold it to the width you prefer for your handle.
 Just cross the handle over the blade, about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the flat end of the blade. Then, staple the two together at the point where they intersect.
 You can paint your knife silver, decorate it, or make more paper knives to keep it company.

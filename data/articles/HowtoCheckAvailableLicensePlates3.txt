 Most full-service DMV offices will allow you to review each style and theme of license plate at the time of your vehicle registration.Locate the nearest DMV office by consulting with your local telephone directory or by visiting your region's DMV website. Your region's DMV website may be listed on the "DMV List" website, but you can do a quick internet search to find the office nearest you.
 In most cases, each theme and style of license plate will be displayed publicly in the DMV office.Wait in line and ask a DMV representative about available license plates if samples of license plates are not displayed for you to review at the DMV office.
You can also view the available options ahead of time online so that you already have an idea of what you want by the time you make it to the DMV.
 At the time of registration, the DMV representative may advise you of any applicable annual fees or requirements for each type of license plate.For example, if you want license plates that state you are the alumni for a particular college or university, you may need to provide proof that you are an alumni of that particular school before you can be issued the license plates.

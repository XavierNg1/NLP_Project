This can be an established wiki site such as:


Wikimedia administers several different types of wikis.
wikiHow


You can also create your own wiki for whatever you choose: work, pleasure, whatever.

Note that there are a lot more sites where you can start your own wiki. Success will be determined, in large part, by the subject matter and by the design decisions of you and the others who become involved in the start up.
 One site's wiki-markupis not (necessarily) another site's markup., Your chosen wiki will have an established markup that they use. While pages could be created and rendered differently than wiki-markup, such a choice, more than likely, will confuse potential editors and the browsers displaying the coding.
 An excellent example of markup that is used by most wikis is Wikipedia markup.
 Follow the guide to learn how to reference things and layout (format) the wiki pages for the free Mediawiki.org wiki software which was originally written to use on Wikipedia.org and is used on many hundreds of other sites. Most places want some type of internal uniformity and also a degree of interchange with and portability to other wikis, which Mediawiki provides.

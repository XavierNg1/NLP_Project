 Remember to take your room key with you, unless your "MyMagic+" wristbands have been linked to your room access.
 Take the elevator from your room down to the fourth floor.
 If you'd like to go in the reverse direction, you may, but realize that the monorail makes one complete loop between the resorts (Grand Floridian, Contemporary and Polynesian) and the parks, and you shouldn't have to go across to the other side to board.

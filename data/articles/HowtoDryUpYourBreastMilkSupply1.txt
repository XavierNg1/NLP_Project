 Start replacing one or two feedings a day, and work your way to completely stopping. This is the safest, and most painless way as your body will slowly stop producing milk.


Breasts that are not weaned gradually, but suddenly, can become painful, engorged, and even put mothers at significant risk for developing mastitis.If you have been pumping and wish to stop, here is a typical schedulethat will wean you off your pump slowly but surely:
Day 1: pump for 5 minutes every 2-3 hours
Day 2: pump for 5 minutes every 4-5 hours
Day 3-7: pump just long enough to relieve discomfort

;
, This should reduce your discomfort and some swelling.
 Wear a supportive, but not-too-tight bra. Opt for clothing that is loose and less likely to show milk spots; consider wearing nursing pads to absorb leaking milk.


Taking a warm shower, although it inevitably involves some stimulation, may help to relieve pressure in the breast and soothe discomfort. Avoid direct stimulation from the water whenever possible.
 If you start to become engorged, hand pump just enough to reduce your discomfort.
 If you become dehydrated, you will actually start producing more milk, and your discomfort will increase.
 Estrogen injections have fallen out of favor, although they were once used to promote estrogen suppression. Some forms of estrogen injections contain known carcinogens.If you have consistent trouble with lactation suppression, ask your doctor about taking medications like bromocriptine (Parlodel). Doctors usually don't recommend taking Parlodel because of increased likelihood of hypertension, stroke, and heart attack., Hormone levels will change drastically as your milk production slows, which will trigger mood swings. Many women feel guilty, inadequate and sad. Getting through these emotions may be the hardest part of the whole process, but having a good support system will help.

 Use a plastic cutting surface to avoid contaminating a wooden cutting board.
 Put a teaspoon or two of cooking oil in the pan and allow it to get smoking hot.
 Let them cook on one side for 15 seconds, then turn them to the other side using a pair of tongs. They should form a thick, crunchy crust on both sides.


Don't turn the steaks until they've seared; moving them too soon will prevent the crust from forming.
Don't crowd the steaks in the pan. If necessary, cook the steaks in more than one batch.



For rare steaks, cook for a total of 1 1/2 minutes on each side.
For medium rare steaks, cook for a total of 2 minutes on each side.
For medium well steaks, cook for a total of 2 1/2 minutes on each side.
For well done steaks, cook for 3 or more minutes on each side.
 This allows the juices to distribute through the steak.

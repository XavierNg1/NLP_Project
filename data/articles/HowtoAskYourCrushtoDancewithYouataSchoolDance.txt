 He might think you're a little annoying and so will the person he's dancing with. Don't be the jealous type. Let him have his fun first, no matter how hard it may be.;
, Try some slow country songs, like, "Big Green Tractor".
 Don't run to him right away and ask him, just do it slowly, but before anyone else does.
 Try to sound sweet and casual. Don't make it awkward for him. The worst he can do is say no. If he does, smile and say, "No problem!" or even, "Okay." You don't need to act to sad or desperate in front of them. If he says yes, make your way out to the dance floor and wrap your arms around his neck. If your crush knows how to slow dance, he will most likely wrap his hands around your waist.
 A lot of people do this when they're slow dancing, and it's not hard at all! Remember to stay calm though, and don't step on his feet! Strike up a conversation with him, otherwise it will be a bit awkward.
 Now he's in your arms. Don't make it obvious, however, that you like him by asking him to dance when every slow song plays; ask a few different guys, too. Yes, even the shy, nerdy ones. Good Luck!

 Occasionally luggage is misdirected as it is unloaded and transported.;
, If you still can't find your luggage after some time, head to your airline's baggage service office inside the airport as soon as possible. Don't leave before speaking with a representative and filing a claim.
 Keep this along with your boarding pass to help supply the airline with information to track your luggage.
 Make a detailed list of all of the items inside your bags and give it to the airline in case your bag was misplaced, stolen, torn open, or destroyed.
 If things don't get resolved in a timely matter or the financial loss of your luggage was significant, an airline attorney can help as a last resort to collect restitution in excess of $2,500 USD.

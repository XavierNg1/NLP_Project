 If you are the partner or principle guest of the mother, make sure you are ready to assist her during delivery with helpful tips, reminders, and encouragement.


A childbirth preparation class will teach you the stages of delivery, options for pain management, breathing techniques, assistance tips you can use as a guest during birth, and even what to bring with you to the delivery.
 If you have been invited to attend the delivery of a child, it may help to learn how labor and delivery function.


Knowing the basics of what the mother is experiencing and how labor is expected to progress can help you calm the mother, prepare yourself for the sight of blood, and inform you of how long you can expect to be on your toes as a guest.
 Many times, labor can begin hours before delivery occurs; as a guest, you may wish to think of strategies for keeping the mother pleasantly occupied during dilation.


Write down a list of things to discuss or safe activities to do while she is waiting to begin delivery. Suggestions include talking about future vacations, taking a walk, giving her a massage, listening to music, taking a bath (you may wish to pack a swimsuit), sitting on an exercise ball to relieve discomfort, watching the mother’s favorite movie on your laptop, and other low-stress activities to kill time and calm everyone’s nerves.

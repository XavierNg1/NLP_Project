 If you don't have any spare pieces at home, hunt for a cute set at a thrift or antique store. They don't need to be matching; they can be as eclectic as you like. The main thing is that you like how they look together.


Choose strong items. Check for cracks, hairline cracks and anything else that might signal weakness in the cup or saucer. They need to be strong, as they'll be hanging up and holding birdseed, along with birds.
You may wish to use a plate larger than a saucer, especially if you plan on feeding large birds or you're using a large jug. Use your eye to gauge good proportions.
 Allow to dry thoroughly.
 It must rest on one edge, with the wide mouth leaning towards the center of the saucer.
 Lay the cup over on its side (handle side facing upward) and press the edge of the base firmly into the glue on the saucer. Apply pressure for a few seconds, then let it dry of its own accord. Leave it for at least 24 hours, or longer if the glue product so advises.
 Carefully pick the cup up by its handle only. Both the cup and the saucer should lift up together. If they do, they're ready for the birds.


Test this over a very soft surface, such as your bed or a pillow; also, only do a very small lift at first. That way, if poorly attached, you can rescue the items and add more glue next time.
 Hang from a pre-arranged hook; you can either use a standalone hook, such as a shepherd's crook style hook or you can use a hanging hook, such as one hung from the porch roof beams.
 The birds will land on the free space on the plate and will peck at the seed inside of the cup. It will spill outward, creating a pleasant effect.

 If you are feeding the dog a different brand or type of food than they were eating at the shelter, you should try to slowly transition them to the new food. Find out what the shelter was feeding them. Mix a little bit of new food in with the old food. Over ten days, gradually increase the amount of new food that you give them while decreasing the amount of old food. In general, you can follow this schedule to transition the food:Day one to three: mix 75% old food mixed in with 25% new food

Day four to six: mix 50% old food mixed in with 50% new food

Day seven to nine: mix 25% old food mixed in with 75% new food

Day ten: feed them only the new food

, To make sure that your new dog does not get ahold of anything that could upset their stomach, you should make sure that all potentially dangerous substances, plants, and objects are out of the way. To dog-proof your home, you can:Put cleaning supplies, medicines, chemicals, and lotions on higher shelves or locked cabinets.
Cover trashcans or place them inside a cabinet or closet.
Place the toilet lid down.
Make sure food is out of reach.
Clean up antifreeze, motor oil, and gasoline from the garage floor or driveway.
Pick up small objects, such as buttons, spools of thread, or plastic toys, from the ground.
 Make sure that the dog is only eating food that is safe for them. Limit how much “people food” you give them, and make sure you never give them food that contains chocolate, garlic, or onions. Keep the dog away from trash.If the vet has diagnosed an allergy, make sure never to feed the dog food that contains the offensive ingredient. You should read the ingredients of all treats and dog food that you purchase in the future.

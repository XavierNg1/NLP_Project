 Liven up a dark or neutral outfit with something eye-catching, like a scarf in a bold color or pattern. If you are going for a sophisticated look, this can create a fun edge without making your overall look less formal or polished. Choose a chunky knit scarf to create some interesting texture for an otherwise sleek silhouette.A pair of simple ballet flats in a bright color, like cherry red, can create a similar effect.


Feel free to match a bright scarf with ballet flats of the same color – as long as the rest of the outfit is neutral, matching these bright accessories can look really stylish.
 It may sound odd to wear heels with jeans, but they can definitely work with a pair of dark gray skinny jeans. The fit must be snug and the leg needs to be tapered. A cropped pair of jeans looks great, but you could also roll up the bottom hems to create tiny cuffs.Make sure the cuffs graze the top of your ankle – this look doesn’t work if the bottom hems go past your ankles.
 If you’re going for a dressy, office-ready look in your gray jeans, the accessories you choose need to be dark, sleek and classic. A patent leather clutch or high quality briefcase will perfectly compliment the more formal attire and actually add to the overall sophistication of your outfit. Stick to items that have clean lines and basic structures.


To complete this look, make sure your shoes are also sleek and black.

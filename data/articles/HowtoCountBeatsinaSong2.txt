 Before you can begin to count in music, you need to understand how long an individual note or rest lasts. Notes are the periods of sound in a song, and rests represent the lengths of the silences in a piece of music. A whole note lasts for four beats. A half note lasts for two beats. A quarter note lasts for one beat. An eighth note lasts for a half of a beat. A sixteenth note lasts for a quarter of a beat.
Rests follow the patterns of the notes. For example, a half rest is a silence that lasts for two beats.
A dot next to a rest or a note means that the note or rest is increased by half its value. For example, a dotted half note lasts for three beats. , Make sure you understand that every piece of music is divided into parts called measures or bars. This will help you count beats. Every measure in a piece of music has an equal number of beats.
 The time signature appears at the beginning of every piece of music as a fraction. It may change throughout a song, and if it changes, the new time signature will appear at the beginning of a bar. Look to part three below for more information on understanding time signature and determining a time signature by listening to a song.
 As you read sheet music, articulating the beats in a song make them easier to understand and keep track of. For eighth notes, use “and.” Say, “one-and-two-and-three-and-four.” For sixteenth notes, use “e” and “a.” Say, “one-e-and-a-two-e-and-a-three-e-and-a.”In a song, the downbeat is the first articulated beat in a bar. For example, the “one.” Make sure you find and articulate this first.
The upbeat is the “and.” For example, if you are tapping your foot to a beat, the upbeat is the time when your toes are in the air.
 If you know the time signature of a piece, a simple way to help keep a steady tempo while counting beats is to use a metronome. A metronome gives a regular ticking sound with a set rate of beats per minutes. Many free metronomes can be found online.

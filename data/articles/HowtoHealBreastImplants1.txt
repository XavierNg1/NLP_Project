 Immediately following your surgery, your doctor will take you to recovery room where you are placed in a semi-upright reclining position to help keep the swelling down.In the recovery room, your breasts are wrapped in gauze dressings to keep the surgical site sterile.
You may also be asked to wear a supportive bra to aid in the recovery and the bandages may be changed just before you go home.You will also be given a pain medication, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, to manage pain and discomfort.;
, It is helpful to bring someone with you to go over any discharge instructions with the nurse. The anesthetic and pain medications that are used during and after the surgery can make it hard to remember any instructions that are discussed. Before you leave the surgical center, be sure to ask for written aftercare directions so that you know exactly what you and any caretakers should be doing during your recovery period.


For example, you should know how long you need to wear the gauze dressings after the surgery, if you need to change them and whether you need to remove the dressing before a shower or keep them covered while showering.Sometimes, your doctor may advise you not to remove the surgical dressing at all, as this is done during your postoperative appointment.Your doctor will also go over the activities you should avoid that can put your recovery and the implants at risk., Breast augmentation is a major surgical procedure and you should not drive yourself home afterwards. If you have not arranged a ride to home, take a taxi to the surgical center and back home.


You will most be given pain medications that can impact your ability to drive.
Also, make sure you and your driver have plenty of time to get back home. The last thing you need is a bumpy ride and a seatbelt digging into your sore chest area.

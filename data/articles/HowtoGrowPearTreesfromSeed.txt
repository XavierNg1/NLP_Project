 Preferably, choose an all-purpose potting mix for the soil.;
, Set it on the counter.
 There should be around eight of these.
 Then transfer them to a resealable plastic bag. Store them somewhere cool and dark (in the fridge is a good choice).
 Put them in the cup of water. Put the cup of water with the seeds in it in the fridge for four to five days.
 Drain the water. Any seeds that floated are not viable, so toss them in the trash.
 Place one in each "corner" of the cup .
, Wait for two to three weeks. In this time, the seedlings will shoot up.
, Ensure that you will live in the same place for a long enough time to make the tree old enough and beautiful enough that no new buyers of the house will chop down the tree or think it's a weed and pull it out. If you must move, make sure the tree is at least healthy before the buyer sees it, as an inherited diseased tree is often not worth the trouble for whoever gets it and will be cut.


By the way, when the seedlings are in large pots, place them outside in the pots as the seedlings grow to strengthen the plants and acclimate them to the outdoor weather. This allows you to bring inside the young trees and care for them extra/overwinter them whenever you think they need it, and then move them outside again.
 If you want, graft a known variety onto the tree. However, you may prefer getting an unknown variety––who knows, maybe it'll be very tasty!

, Tend to the pears over the coming years and you'll get many good harvests of fruit.

 An estimate should never be used when you need to know the precise number of ounces, so you are strongly advised to use a scale when following a recipe or some similar set of instructions. If precision is not required, however, you can use your hand to estimate the number of ounces for most foods.


A good time to use this is if you are dieting and quickly need to estimate an amount of food for the sake of portion control.






Note that this only works if you have an average sized adult hand. Moreover, since all hands are different sizes, you may or may not have success using this method of measurement.
 Place the meat or cheese on the meaty, thick part of your thumb, right along the base. For dense foods like these, this usually measures out to about 1 ounce.More specifically, the portion of your thumb you need to use is the part extending from the lowest joint to the base of your hand.
 Place the food directly into the palm of your hand without cupping it. For dense foods like these, this will usually come out to roughly 3 ounces.


Keep your hand as flat as possible during this estimate. Only curve the hand slightly, and only if needed to prevent the food from slipping off your palm.
 Cup your hand and pour the food into it. For less dense ingredients, like pretzels, this will usually measure out to about 1 ounce. For heavier nuts, this measurement is usually closer to 2 ounces.


Keep your fingers closed and contain the food completely within the cupped portion of your hand.

 If it's a boring sock, or slight worse for wear, consider tie-dyeing it for a bit of added fun. At the very least, ensure it's washed and clean.
, Since this sock is so long, you could even stuff it with all those other mate-less socks that have been amassing in the laundry basket. Or, use standard toy stuffing, scrap fabric or felt offcuts, etc.
 Every few inches or centimeters, sprinkle in some additional dried catnip. This sock is long, so it is a good idea to encourage your cat to find several spots of catnip scent throughout the sock.
 Then tie the end of the sock off with yarn. Make sure to use a tight knot. Cut off any long loose ends of the yarn; this one isn't so ideal for "dangling", as it's big.
 Encourage kitty to sniff it. Enjoy the pouncing, the hugging, the back leg raking and the general enjoyment the cat will now produce.

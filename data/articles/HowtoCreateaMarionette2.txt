 You'll need FIMO clay, aluminum (also called tin) foil, sturdy but flexible wire, string, and something to make a handle (chopsticks will do in a pinch).
 Bend, cut, and straighten the wire until you have 1 piece for every section of the body. You'll want to make a small loop at each end of every section. These loops will become the joints.


For the head, you will want a loop coming out at the top of the head as well. For this particular set of instructions, the head is not a moving piece, so you can make the head and torso a single section, if you want to.
 Crumple and ball the tin foil and add it to each section of the wire bones. This acts like muscle, giving the marionette some substance. Don't add too much and don't worry about it being smooth: the clay will cover this part.
 Shape the clay onto each part of the marionette and carve it until you have the look you want. Leave the loops exposed.
 Bake the body parts according to the manufacturer's instructions.
 Connect the loops to create the joints for the puppet.
 Purchase a premade handle or create a basic one by joining two chopsticks together into a cross.
 Attach strings at the knees and wrists, tying them to one of the joint loops. Attach the other end to the ends of your four handles. Then, attach a string from the head loop to the center of the handle.
 You may want to paint some details onto your marionette and make it some clothing as well. This will give it a great final look!

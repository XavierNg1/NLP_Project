 Anyone can make this hackysack, even if you've never sewed before. The result is pretty sturdy if you use strong thread. One disadvantage is that sand – a great stuffing for beginners or people practicing tricks – will leak out the hole. Most players will still have plenty of fun with rice or lentil stuffing instead.;
, Find a pair of old socks without holes or worn areas. Cut off the tip of each one, about 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) from the toes., Thread a needle with a long piece of strong thread. Pull it through both sides of the sock, near the hole. Continue sewing by moving the needle back through the sock again in the other direction. Repeat this back-and-forth movement until the sock is sewn mostly shut. Leave a gap for stuffing the sock.


Polyester thread is cheap and strong, making it a good choice for this project.The closer together your thread lines, the less your hacky sack will leak stuffing.
 Stick a funnel in the hole, or a rolled-up paper cone. Fill the sock with stuffing material. Uncooked rice or lentils are cheap and large enough that they won't fall out much. Plastic pellets or steel pellets from a hobby store will give more control, and feel more like commercial hacky sacks.Sand and birdseed tends to leak out of this style hacky sack.
 Finish sewing the hole shut once the sock is filled. Tie the thread into a knot and snip off the excess.
 For extra protection, pull the second piece of sock over the first. Sew it shut just as you did the first one. Align this sock so the two holes are on opposite ends, reducing the chance of material leaking out.

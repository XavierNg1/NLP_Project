 Needles come in many different sizes, and its important to choose one with an eye, or an opening, big enough for the thread you are using.


Consider buying a pack of needles in many different sizes, so you can try a few until you find one that's the right size.
If you need help figuring out what needle to use, ask a salesperson at the fabric or sewing store where you bought your supplies.
 A piece of thread longer than 36 inches (91 cm) could get tangled as you sew, but a short piece of thread could run out quickly, and you'll be required to thread the needle again before you know it. Determine the length that's right for your project.









If you're not sure how long to cut the thread, err on the side of a shorter length; you can always rethread the needle with more thread later, but a tangled piece of thread can be a pain to straighten out.
Cutting the thread at a 45-degree angle using a sharp pair of scissors will create a point that's easier to thread through the needle.

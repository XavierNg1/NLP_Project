 If you are not sure about your animal's heritage and you don't have papers, consider getting a DNA test. All animals have specific DNA, which provides codes for their parentage. The DNA is equivalent to a fingerprint that points to the genetic origins of the breed. These tests, which are the same technology that criminal and law enforcement agencies use, is now available for pets.


The tests look for genetic marker material that indicate the breed of the parents. Reputable sites compare this with data held by the International Society of Animal Genetics, for the best possible accuracy., A good indicator that the site is reputable is if it is run by veterinarians. The sites will typically offer genetic testing for health conditions and hereditary illnesses. Often these sites often have parentage tests that are to the same high standard.


You can also purchase tests on Amazon or online, but check out the seller carefully before purchasing. You want to make sure you are not wasting your money and that you will get correct results., The procedure to collect the sample from you cat is simple. The genetic test kit contains two brushes. Place one brush in the cat's cheek and swirl it around for five seconds. Remove the brush from the mouth and hold it in the air to dry for 15 seconds. Next, replace it in the packaging. Repeat with the second brush on the opposite cheek.


This should be done away from eating or drinking, so make sure the cat hasn't eaten for at least 15 minutes before taking the test.Send the test off to the lab. Once the lab has received the sample, which is usually via the mail, an average time to get the results is four to five days, either by email or letter.

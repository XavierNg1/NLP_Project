 Search shallow, shaded water for active shiners.Avoid dense vegetation that may foul lines. In deeper water, scan the surface for bubbles, boils, and other disturbances that indicate activity below the surface. If necessary, hum the surface with a small amount of bread to lure shiners out into the open or up from the deep, Use a small treble hook to avoid injuring the fish. Bait the hook with balls of bread. Lower your bait into the water, keeping it on the surface., Once you feel a bite, wait a moment or two to give the shiner a chance to continue feeding in case it hasn’t actually hooked itself yet. Then reel your line back in gently until the line grows tight. Keep your motions smooth and gentle; avoid jerking the rod too violently and losing the shiner before it’s fully hooked., Hoist it out of the water. Keep a firm grip on your shiner as you unhook it so it doesn’t wriggle free. Be careful to not squeeze it so hard that you injure it.

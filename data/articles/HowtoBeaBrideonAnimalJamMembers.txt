, Use the swirl pattern for the best effect.

A ring (maybe put it on when they tell you to)
A jamaaliday bow- white preferably.
Maybe even a white mysterious cloak.
 When it's time to say your vows, say some romantic lines about how much you love your guy. For example: "When I saw you, I knew you were my prince. Now that I'm marrying you, I know I'm going to be happy. I love you so much." If AJ doesn't let you say this, try something else.
 This shows your love.
 Or, if you have free chat, say, 'o3o' or 'u3u'.
 Dance and talk to people. It's simple! Maybe even pretend to take photos or kiss the groom a couple of times. Don't be rude or anything, though. And don't get too kissy or else it will annoy other players.
 It's just kind! Give a special thank you to the bridesmaids and the flower girl and stuff, because they took a big part in the wedding.
 Get heart flowers or chocolate roses, and place them somewhere in the crowd. If it's not your den, ask the person who owns the den to do it in a JAG.

 Organic and inorganic fertilizers are by far the largest human source of nitrous oxide production, and this gas is now the prime culprit in depleting the ozone layer. Fertilizers are of course important, but to limit their impact on our atmosphere, suggest these practices that both save money and reduce emissions:Better matching fertilizer rates to crop requirements.
Using fertilizer formulations and additives that reduce emissions.
Improving fertilizer timing to assure maximum nitrogen absorption.
Using precision fertilizer placement to minimize nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.
 The majority of man-made ozone depleting chemicals now come from agriculture. Encourage your representative to put forth laws governing fertilizer use. Be sure to point out that by using fertilizer more effectively, these laws can save farmers money while also protecting the environment.
 Shrinking the hole in the ozone layer will take all of us working together. Encourage your friends to drive less, eat less meat, buy local, and to properly dispose of old fire extinguishers or cooling appliances containing ozone depleting substances.

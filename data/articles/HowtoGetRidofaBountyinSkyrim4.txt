 Press the Start button (PS3 and Xbox 360) or ESC key (PC), scroll to the left under ****, and check your bounty amount in each Hold so you’ll know which Hold you have to enter.
 You will be confronted by any guard you pass when you enter a Hold. He will talk to you and give you some options.
 If you are the thane, you’ll have the dialogue option, “I’m the Jarl’s Thane. I demand you let me go at once.” Select this option to have your bounty cleared without any negative consequences.


Be careful, as declaring Thaneship is a one-time deal, and only works with bounties less than 3,000 Gold.

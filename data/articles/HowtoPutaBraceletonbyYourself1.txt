 It usually helps to rest your hand, palm facing down, against a table or counter to steady it, so you don’t have to worry about the bracelet falling. When you place the bracelet on your wrist, leave the end without the clasp on top and pull the other end underneath to wrap it around your wrist.When you’re placing the bracelet on your hand, avoid setting it down so the end is right in the middle of your wrist because it’s more likely to fall off in that position. Set it down so the end of the bracelet is near the end of your wrist, closest to the other hand.;
, Make sure to use a large enough piece of tape to firmly secure the jewelry to your wrist. It’s best to place the tape just behind the end of the bracelet, so that part is especially secure.You can use any type of tape that you have at home, but try to find an option that won’t leave any residue behind on your bracelet or tear at your skin when you peel it off. Basic invisible tape, such as Scotch Tape, actually works best for this purpose.
 With the tape holding the bracelet in place against your wrist, you can easily wrap the bracelet around your wrist and close the clasp with your opposite hand. Once the bracelet is secure, simply pull off the tape and discard.If you’re having any trouble closing the clasp, make sure to keep the hand that you’re putting the jewelry on braced against the table or counter so it remains steady.

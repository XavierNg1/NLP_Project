Before the shot- In the waiting room, read a book, listen to calm and happy music, go online if you have a laptop, or do anything else that will get your mind off the shot. By entertaining yourself, you will feel much less tense. When you finally see the doctor, you can request to do the shot first to get it out of the way. After all, it could throw off your blood pressure if your heart is beating rapidly.

During the shot- Hold a parent's hand if you're a child. If you're an adult, you can still hold someone's hand if you wish, such as a nurse's. Don't look at the needle. Also, let your arm go floppy! If you tense up, it will be really painful. Clench the fist of the arm that is not getting the shot, and it will all be over in a matter of seconds.

After the shot- Give yourself a pat on the back! You have gotten your shots, and possibly even a lollipop. Treat yourself by going to get some ice cream or doing another activity you enjoy.

 Be sure to ask if the vendor will ensure that it will work every time you need to access it.;
, For example, a vendor could roll the services of handling email, fax and live chat into a separate package that they add (for a discounted fee) to their core services of answering phones and relaying messages. Or a vendor could offer handling all geographical areas instead of you having to break them up into separate contracts.
 The right information can assist your business in identifying trends that can help you with product development and/or marketing campaigns.
 Check to see if the vendor has a policy of hiring only those who work in an office and do not allow workers to answer your business calls at home. For some industries this may be fine, but for most professional businesses, you do not want to worry that a home-based CSR will be distracted by a crying baby, a knock on the door from a neighbor or delivery person, etc. The vendor will also be able to have more control over confidential records and social security and credit card numbers if their CSRs are supervised in a call center office.
 These days some vendors offer a variety of languages they can translate including Spanish, French, Japanese, German and Chinese.

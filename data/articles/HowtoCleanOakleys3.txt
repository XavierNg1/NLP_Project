 If you've recently gone skiing or snowboarding, you'll want to remove any built up snow on or in your goggles. Shake them off outside and use your fingers to clear the ventilation ports and lens vents on the sides of your goggles.Be careful not to scrape over the lenses of your goggles with rough gloves as you clear the snow from your goggles.
 The carrying bag that came with your goggles can also be used to clean them. Use the bag to lightly blot up any remaining moisture on your goggles.Do not rub the inner lens of the goggles when they are wet because it has an anti-fog coating that can be damaged when you wipe it., After you've blotted up the moisture from the goggles, allow them to air dry. When you put them back on, make sure to stay mobile as the airflow through the vents will help dry off the goggles.

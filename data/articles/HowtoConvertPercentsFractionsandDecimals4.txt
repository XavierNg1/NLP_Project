 Interpret the fraction bar to mean "divided by". This means for any fraction x/y, it is the same as saying x divided by y.For example: The fraction 4/8 yields the decimal 0.5.
 Many numbers don’t divide evenly into each other. When you divide them, you have to decide how many decimal places you want to give in your answer. Oftentimes, the standard is two places. Remember the rules of rounding when truncating a fraction: if the next number is a 5, round the previous number up. For example, 0.145 rounds to 0.15.


For example: The fraction 5/17 yields the decimal 0.2941176470588…
The final decimal can be written simply as 0.29.
 Just as you did to convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. Multiply the resulting decimal by 100 and add a percent sign to finish the conversion.If you had 4/8, dividing 4 by 8 would give you .50, then multiplying that number by 100 would give you 50. Adding a percent sign gives you your final answer by 50%.
Additional Examples:

3/10 = 0.30 * 100 = 30%
5/8= 0.625 * 100 = 62.5%

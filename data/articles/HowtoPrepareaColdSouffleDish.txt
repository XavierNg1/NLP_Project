, To do this, wrap a layer of foil or baking paper around the outside of the souffle dish that rises about 3 centimeter (1.2Â in) taller than the edge of the dish.
 The idea is to ensure double thickness so that the collar stands up stiffly.
 Use a large rubber band, tape, or string to keep the wrapper layers in place.
 Pour it into the prepared cold souffle dish as high as needed and follow the chilling directions outlined in the recipe.
 Remove the layers prior to serving. Everyone will wonder how you managed this amazing feat!

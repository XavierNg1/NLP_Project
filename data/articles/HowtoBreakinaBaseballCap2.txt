 If you want to break in the entire hat, then soak the entire hat in a bowl of hot water. If you want to keep the bill of the hat firm, only soak the crown of the hat in the bowl. Soak the cap for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and then remove it from the water. Lay it out on a towel to dry until it goes from soaking wet to damp. When the hat is damp, place it on your head, and allow it to finish drying while conforming to your head.There is a possibility that soaking your hat in hot water can cause its color to slightly fade. This will help your hat to look more worn. If you don't want the color to fade, soak your hat in cold water instead. If you soak your hat in cold water, soak it for 2-3 hours.
 This may seem like the most unconventional method yet, but showering in your new cap is a great way to break it in. Water alone is a great way to break in a hat, but keeping the hat shaped to your head while you wet it takes this one step further. Once you've finished showering, keep the hat on your head and allow it to air-dry.Be sure to take off your hat at some point during the shower to wash your hair, then put the hat back on for the remainder of your shower.
 Use warm water and liquid laundry detergent to wash your hat. It's easiest to wash your hat on laundry day and simply throw it in the washer with your load of clothes. You can wash the hat over and over again, with multiple loads, but do not put the hat in the dryer. Putting your hat in the dryer could cause it to shrink. Instead, let the hat air-dry or wear it on your head until it is finished drying.


If you have a wool or cotton cap, you can shrink it in the dryer to fit your head. You'll need to get a hat that is slightly too big or you, and then put in in the dryer to shrink it after washing it. If the hat shrinks too much, wash it again, and let it air dry on your head to stretch it out to the perfect size.

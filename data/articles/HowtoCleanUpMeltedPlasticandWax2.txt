 This can be done by lightly heating the mess until it is soft enough to scrape off. By getting as much of the mess off as you can manually, you’ll allow the cleaners to work best. After you’ve chipped away at the mess as best you can, allow it to cool.
 Plastic is soluble in acetone, so this can be effective in removing the nasty stain.Acetone is found in most nail polish removers, which can be found at your local pharmacy.Be careful, acetone can stain certain surfaces. If you think acetone is your best option for removing the melted plastic or wax, try testing it out a small- and preferably hidden- spot first. This could be the underside of the table you're working with, or a part of the floor that is usually covered with furniture. See how the acetone reacts before dousing your stain with it.Make sure that there is absolutely no acetone left on the surface. Acetone is highly flammable, and if there is acetone left over on your surface, especially if that surface is a stovetop or oven, you could have a larger problem on your hands than a little melted plastic., Once the acetone has soaked into the melted remains, it should be pretty pliable. With a little bit of force from your knife, it should come right off., This is only necessary if there is still remaining plastic or wax. WD-40 is a lubricating & penetrating spray product that can be used to remove the leftover gunk by dissolving its bond with the hard surface.Like you did with the acetone, test the WD-40 on a smaller, out-of-the-way spot before applying it to the stain.

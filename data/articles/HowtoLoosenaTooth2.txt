Instead, bite and chew the apple or pear to loosen the tooth.
 Another good crunchy food for loosening a tooth is corn on the cob. Bite into corn on the cob to help loosen your tooth from the socket.
 Soft but crunchy foods like bread or a bagel are also a good option for loosening a tooth. Bagels in particular are just soft enough to loosen your tooth without damaging it. Toast the bread or the bagel so it is crunchy and can help to loosen the tooth.

 The latches can be useful when you know how to use them. The majority go onto the top of the latch which is the best spot, but is quite vulnerable. That is why you'll want to go to a latch that has smoke coming out of it, this away you are covered, and the other players are blinded. Another good spot is to get into the "prone" position and lay in between the bottom of the latch, the concrete, and the hinge. This provides maximum coverage (except behind of course), and is even more covered whence the smoke is rising.;
, There is a small corner in the far North-East side of the map, or South-West, or North-West side, or South-East side, depending on your respawn location. This can be a nifty place even if you aren't covered by Anything, because it is dark so most players won't see you.
 There is also a corner that is blocked by big metal crates, but if you wish to use this area be careful because it is a continuous run-in spot.
 There is also a truck trailer that you can get underneath on both sides of the map, but be careful cause whenever a player spots you, your most likely to die cause it takes a few seconds (about 2-3) to get out from underneath.
 There are also stacks of wooden crates in every single building on the map that is a covered hiding spot.
 There is a small electronic grid that is used for cover for snipers as well, and is easy to escape from if you are being shot at.

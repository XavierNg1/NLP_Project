 Organizations like UNHCR always need money to continue the important work that they do. Donate money yourself, or start a fundraising campaign to raise additional monetary support for the refugee cause. You can collect the money yourself and then donate it to the organization in one large chunk.You could create an online fundraising campaign and share it with your friends and on social media. Try a fundraising site like GoFundMe or YouCaring.
You could host a donation drive to collect goods and other items needed by the organization. Just make sure you contact UNHCR ahead of time to find out what kinds of things they are in need of at the moment.
You can encourage others to register as volunteers as well.
 An important way that you can volunteer to help UNHCR is by hosting an event in your community. You could hold the event in a public space, or even in your home. This could be a film viewing about refugee hardships, a discussion or debate about an important issue related to refugees, or even a World Refugee Day party to raise awareness.If you contact your local UNHCR office, they may be able to provide a speaker for your event. They will also be able to provide ideas to help facilitate and manage your event.
 There are plenty of ways to donate your time to help out important causes like the refugee crisis. Make yourself available for any number of volunteer services that refugees need once they arrive in your country. Contact UNHCR directly to see what kind of help they need.This includes things like child care, transportation, translation assistance, or anything else that might be difficult for refugees to manage on their own.

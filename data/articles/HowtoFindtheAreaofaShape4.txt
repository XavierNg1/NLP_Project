 Sectors are portions of a circle, that come out looking a bit like fans. You'll need to know the radius of the original circle, or one side of your "fan", as well as the angle of the point. For us, let's say we have a radius of 14 inches and an angle of 60.


In the real world, you'll have to measure for yourself but for your homework your teacher should have these measurements listed with the shape.
 Multiply the radius times itself. This gives us a value of 196 (14x14).
 Pi (Ï€) is a really big number that is used in lots of calculations. If you're using a calculator, use the pi function for a really accurate result. If not, you can round pi (ignore some of the numbers) and just multiply by 3.14159. That gives us a value of 615.75164.
 Now, you'll need to take the angle of the point and divide that number by 360 (which is the number of degrees in a circle). For us, we get a value of roughly .166. It's technically a repeating number, but we're going to round to make the math easier.
 Multiply the number you get when you divide by 360 by the number you got earlier after you multiply by pi. For us, this gives a result of about 102.214.
 This resulting number is the area of your sector, making our sector 102.214 square inches.

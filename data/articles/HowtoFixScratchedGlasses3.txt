 Normally, glass etching involves the use a fairly powerful acid to cut or burn an image into glass.In this particular context, it will be used to burn off the exterior layer of the glasses. You will need:


A glass etching substance. A brand known as Armor Etch produces one popular variety of the material, but there are others as well.
High quality rubber gloves to protect your hands.
Cotton swabs or some other material to use for applying the substance to the glasses.
 Do not rub the substance in, but merely apply it to the surface. Because of the strength of the acid in glass etching substances, you must work quickly. Only apply enough of the substance to cover the lens.
 Again, etching solution contains powerful acids. Over-exposure to these acids will likely damage the lenses.
 Use water to wash off the etching substance, unless the instructions call for alternatives. Wash thoroughly to guarantee that no residue from the substance remains.
 Use this to wipe and dry the lens, again using only side-to-side motions.

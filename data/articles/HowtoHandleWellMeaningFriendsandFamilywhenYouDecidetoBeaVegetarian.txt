 Be sure as to why being vegetarian counts for you. When you decide to become a vegetarian, some of your family and friends may not understand or agree with why you're choosing this lifestyle. If you're not sure yourself then it may be possible to be persuaded out of it.
 By doing this they will either soften up to you or at least learn to accept and adjust to your new lifestyle., You may not see it this way, and many do not see it this way openly, but it's a subconscious kick to be made aware of the choices we make about the food we eat. This can be confronting for many people, who would rather not think about the actions that lead to meat upon their plate. This is not about denigrating them; it's about reminding yourself that you represent a way of living that is conscious about these aspects and it can unsettle some people., A lot of people still assume that being a vegetarian is not healthy and causes malnutrition or a loss of energy. This is usually due to ignorance of being vegan, so to ease your family's fears explain to them that the lifestyle is completely healthy. Moreover, realize that many people are sorely lacking in knowing whether or not their own diet, meat included, is healthy. Gently enlighten them on healthy eating in general.

This can be a great opportunity to encourage everyone to focus on their diet, relying on reliable sources of information rather than snippets of generalized wisdom garnered from women's magazines or breakfast TV shows.
Be wary of exhortations to eat such and such from well-meaning but ill-informed relatives. Stay polite but don't let it get to you; realize that you've done your research and it's probable that they haven't.
 Be sure to reassure them that this isn't the case and that you're not judging them.

Always make sure if your hosting a dinner make sure you cook or order in some meats for your family and friends to enjoy. On top of preparing a good meal for your family, it shows them that you care.

 Choose the desired size of your container depending on how much BB cream you'll be making. Smaller is best though, as the formula should be used up quickly and fresh amounts made regularly.


DIY BB cream should not be kept in the container too long or it will become of a poor consistency. The longest to keep it is 1 and a half weeks.
 It's best if it's not too expensive.
 Make sure the foundation is the same color of your skin tone, so that the BB cream seems more natural.
 Do this by adding a bit of foundation and mixing it with the daily moisturizer.


Make sure there is more moisturizer than foundation, so as to create the perfect consistency.
 You can now apply your DIY BB cream. Make new batches often.

 Every country has its own unique exit code. This is the number that you must dial first, in order to place a call outside of the country you are calling from. If you are making a call from the United States, your exit code would be 011, while if dialing from Argentina, you would use 00 to place a call out of the country.


To find your country’s exit code, you can run a simple search through your favorite online search engine. Simply type in a search phrase along the lines of “exit code.”;
, In this case, the country is Mexico. Mexico’s country code is 52.
 In Mexico, these area codes can be 2 or 3 digits long. The following list the area code for all of the major areas of Mexico. Their area codes are listed in parentheses after the name of the area or city.Acapulco (744), Cancun (998), Celaya (461), Chihuahua (614), Ciudad Juarez (656), Cozumel (987), Culiacan (671), Guadalajara (33), Hermosillo (622), La Paz (682), Mazatlan (669), Merida (999), Mexicali (686), Mexico City (55), Miquelon (508), Monterrey (81), Puebla (222), Puerto Vallarta (322), San Luis Potosi (444), Tampico (833), Tecate (665), Tijuana (664), Torreon (871), Veracruz (229).
 Phone numbers are either seven or eight digits long. So if you were calling from the U.S. you would dial 011-52-461-3456764 (this is a made up number.)If you are calling a cell phone, you will add (1) in between the country code and the area code. So to place a call from the U.S. to a cell phone in Mexico, you would dial: 011-52-1-(area code)-(cell number.)

, It would be terrible to wake someone up at 3 a.m. simply because you did not think to check the local time. Mexico has three time zones. Most of the country is on Central Standard time, while the areas of Chihuahua, Nayarit, Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California Sur are on Mountain Standard time. Baja California Norte is on Pacific Standard time.You may also be charged for your call to Mexico even if no-one answers at the other end. It's not a bad idea to check time zones and ensure the person you are calling in Mexico is likely to be home - and not asleep!

, So, let's say we want to call our friend up who lives in Lagunas, Mexico - and you live in the United States. You would dial:


Your exit code - 011
Then the calling country code for Mexico - 52
Then the area code for Lagunas - 972
Then the phone number you've been given (either a seven or eight digit number.)

, congratulations. You've successfully called Mexico.

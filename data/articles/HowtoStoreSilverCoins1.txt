 Moisture and extreme temperatures can damage your coins. Keep them in a temperature controlled environment, which means not in the basement or attic.Also avoid bathrooms and other sources of humidity., Certain substances interact poorly with silver over extended periods of time. This includes paper, aluminum foil, and plastics with PVC. Plastics can be a great storage medium for silver, but you should verify that they arenâ€™t PVC plastics, which are generally softer plastics., There are many products marketed for coin storage, but some like coin folders, are designed more to make coins easy to view than for storing extremely valuable mints. Good storage devices include hard plastic storage cases and glass or plastic coin tubes.Coin folders can be problematic because they expose your coins to air. However, if you have the original, airtight packaging, you can keep the coin in the packaging and place it in the folder. Make sure that the flaps are made of mylar, rather than soft plastic with PVC.
Many varieties of coin containers may be purchased online.

 The overhead is an important shot, though it’s used less often than the forehand and backhand strokes. If a ball is hit or bounces over your head, it’s the right time to use this stroke.
 As soon as you see the shot headed over your head, use your non-racket hand to point at the ball. This might sound funny or unnecessary, but doing this will help you keep track of the ball, especially while you're a beginner.









Move with the ball and position yourself under it.
Bring your racquet back early so you have more time to hit the ball.
 Try to hit the ball a foot or so out in front of your body, just like the serve. You don’t have to swing super hard; in fact, a slow swing will help you place the ball better.

 Get a skinny rectangular box such as a box that a watch comes in. Glue a piece of paper on top to cover it neatly. Use beads for handles.
 Use the box that your doll comes in. Cover the inside with construction paper and use a bottle top attached to a pipe cleaner for the shower. Taps can be made from bits of plastic or buttons.
 Use the lid off a spray can. Attach a paper toilet seat lid to the top of it.

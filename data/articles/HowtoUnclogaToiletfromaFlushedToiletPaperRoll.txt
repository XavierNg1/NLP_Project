 Sometimes it is not the roll that is clogging the toilet. If your toilet is clogged though, it's probably the roll.


Make sure water can get through when flushed. The properties of the roll will not allow much water flow but it will allow some. What should happen is your toilet should fill up abnormally high and then slowly drain. If the toilet water is not getting through you have a bigger problem.;
, Sometimes the roll is just right there in front of you and is not as big of a problem as you thought.
 This helps the roll soak and get softer in the water.


After this, remove the tablet. This step helps because more water gets through. Put on gloves to prevent infection.
 Sometimes a simple flush will dislodge the roll immediately because it has become soft and will now glide.
 Slowly press down with a plunger and then pull up. You should be pushing water into the toilet. Sometimes if you flush once, let the toilet fill up to that high level and then flush again it will add more water to the bowl and push the roll out more effectively. Be careful with this because you may overflow your toilet.


Eventually the clog should work its way out. If not move on to step 9.
 Simply try to push the snake or unbent wire hanger down the toilet to dislodge the roll. If you feel something slip try flushing.
 This will allow the roll to slide easier and then the cleaner should dislodge the roll and allow it to slide through.
 The more time you take the roll will get softer and softer and will dislodge more the more you flush.
 Do not get boiling hot water because too hot of water will crack porcelain. If you can get as little water in the tank as possible it will work better because you will be able to pour out more water. After/during pouring flush the toilet. This should help push it out the roll.
 Unfortunately sometimes this becomes necessary.

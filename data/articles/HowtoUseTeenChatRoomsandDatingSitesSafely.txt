 It is extremely easy to lie about who you are on an online profile. You can post any picture of yourself and claim it is of you. Internet predators do this without remorse. These predators pose as teenage girls when they are really grown men and pictures posted alongside the false profile sometimes fool other users. Predators also pose as ideal boyfriends, making them seem to be every girls dream guy, and again, they add pictures to bolster the deception. The internet predators then befriend teens and work to earn their trust. On occasions, they try to make the teens fall in “love” with them. Once trust is earned it seems only natural to make a date to meet face-to-face. Since many teens that meet people online do so in secret, without telling parents or even real life friends about their activities, face-to-face meetings are often set up without anybody else knowing. It is ironic that the same teens that post many pictures of themselves leave detailed profiles at public sites, are unlikely to tell people in real time what they are up to.;

With an anonymous phone service you never have to give out your number and can use a username or tag id. A typical anonymous phone chat service would be a company such as paginglist.com.
 your home or mobile phone number or your address! To be safe, always tell your parents or a friend where you are going. If you have to meet in secret for a particular reason (not recommended), always meet in a public place like a shopping centre or a coffee shop.

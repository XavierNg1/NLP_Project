 Suede isn't an ideal material for winter boots if you live in a very wet climate. While the boots can be protected by commercial products, chemicals in these can weaken the fabric after a time. Moreover, dampness and salt stains gradually destroy the suede.


One solution can be to only wear suede boots when it's not going to rain and when the sidewalks are obviously cleared of snow.Or, accept that suede boots won't look as good at the end of the season as they did at the beginning!
Synthetic boots may be more durable for some purposes. This will depend on your wearing preferences and the comfort of the boot. Ask a retailer for specific advice when purchasing your winter boots.;
, There are some commercial products available that you can apply to your boots before you wear them out in the weather. Some products include:


Waterproofing to stop material from becoming spotted in water or salt. These usually come in aerosol sprays and are sold at shoe stores or by the manufacturer.Oils, waxes, or rubs that create a protective layer on the boot material. You can find these at leather-repair stores, shoe stores, or hardware stores.Protective agents that keep the boots from fading or falling apart. These are often recommended by the boot manufacturer.
 Always read the instructions accompanying any waterproofing or cleaning product. Some are flammable, some require good ventilation and some require careful application. For your own safety, be aware of all the requirements for using the product before using it.


When you do use a product, always test it on a small, inconspicuous part of the boot. That way, it will not ruin the whole boot.

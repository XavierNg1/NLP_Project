 Damaged or wobbly teeth should be treated professionally because proper dental extractions with minimal trauma to the gum and jawbone need to be done under general anesthetic.
 The exception is a tooth that is so wobbly that it can be rocked backwards and forwards, to an angle of at least 90 degrees when tapped with a fingertip. For such a tooth use a finger and thumb to act as a pincer, grasp the wobbly tooth, and give it a twist and pull to remove it. If the tooth does not pluck out easily, leave it alone and seek professional help.
 Damaged teeth include those that are cracked, fractured, part of the crown is missing, or the enamel is eroded. All of these things are painful and the tooth needs extraction.


However, even though the tooth is damaged it is likely to be firmly attached and professional extraction is essential to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering.
 Tooth root infections can be identified as pus oozing between the gum and the tooth, a swelling on the face over the site of the tooth root, or through dental x-rays. Antibiotics are essential (see remarks for gingivitis).


Unfortunately, most infections recur once antibiosis finishes and so extraction of the affected tooth is advisable to prevent relapse.

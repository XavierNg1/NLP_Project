 Remember it could always be worse.;
, Garbage in equals garbage out . Deep down you know what is good for you and what is not. When in doubt, go with less processed and more fresh foods.
 No matter what your fitness level, keep moving. Be aware of the mind-body connection and try to do something healthy for your body each day. Your brain will thank you by making you feel better.
, Take a few moments each day to quiet your mind and focus on your breath. When the mind is quiet we can experience inner peace and let the troubles of the world go. Even if just for a minute.
 Treat the people in your life like you wish to be treated. Show them respect and kindness. And don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Ever.
 It makes the world a better place for yourself and your fellow man. If need be, fake it.
 Take a pottery class. Read an inspirational book. Anything that makes you better than you were yesterday.
 Do a little extra at work without looking for acknowledgement. Clean the kitchen. Volunteer. Help a stranger. Pick up some litter. Give someone a gift. Anything that makes your world a little better.
 Even if you can't see it right now, it is there somewhere. A bird singing, a blue sky, someone laughing, a snowflake. There is beauty and hope everywhere!

 Fill your sink with a few drops of dish soap and run some warm water. Then, remove the grates and burner caps from the stove and place them in the water to soak. This will help soften any stuck on food particles.Use mild dish soap such as Dawn or Palmolive. Any soap you would typically use to hand wash dishes will work.;
, Use a paper towel or dry dishtowel to wipe up any loose bits of dried food on the stovetop itself. There is no need to scrub at this stage, the goal is simply to clear any food debris from the area you want to clean.
 Examine the fuel ports of all the burners. Sometimes, burnt bits of food can clog the fuel ports, preventing your stove from lighting properly or creating a burning hazard. To clear any food material, use a small object such as a paperclip to pick any burnt food out of the port. If there are lots of food bits blocking the port, you can use a dry toothbrush to gently brush debris away from the port., Use the scrubbing side of a wet sponge and a few drops of dish soap to scrub the stovetop. Work in circular motions to remove stubborn spills, wringing and rewetting sponge as it gets dirty. Be careful not to use too much water when cleaning the stovetop, as it can make the fuel ports saturated. Wring your sponge regularly while cleaning. If the fuel ports get too wet, they will temporarily have trouble igniting. When they dry out, this problem will resolve.
 When you’re finished cleaning the stove with the soap, rinse the sponge completely. Then wipe the stovetop once more with just water to rinse. Dry with a clean dishtowel.
 Use your scrubbing sponge to clean the grates and burner caps that have been soaking in the soapy solution in the sink. The food bits on them should have softened and will come off easily. Rinse them with plain water once you’ve scrubbed off all food bits, drying with a clean dishtowel.

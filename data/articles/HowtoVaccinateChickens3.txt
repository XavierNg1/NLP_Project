 Intramuscular (IM) means that the needle you will use gets injected into the chicken’s muscle. The breast muscle is the best site for injecting this sort of vaccination. Follow the instructions that come with the vaccine to make sure that you prepare it correctly.
 It is easiest to give this injection when the chicken it placed on a table. Have your assistant grab the hocks and legs of the chicken with one hand, while the other hand grasps both wings at the base while the chicken is lying on her side.
 The keel bone is the bone that divides the chicken’s breast. You will want to inject the vaccine in a spot that is 1 to 1 ½ inches to the side of the keel bone. This is the largest part of the breast muscle, which makes it easy to inject the vaccine into., Holding the needle at a 45 degree angle and inserting it into the chicken will help to make sure that the needle reaches the muscle below the skin. Check to make sure that there isn’t any bleeding.If you notice that the spot is bleeding, you have hit a vein or artery. Remove the needle and try a different spot.
 Make sure that none of the vaccine spills out while you are injecting it. Once all of the vaccine has been injected, remove the needle from the chicken.

 The cost of the item is evenly distributed on financial statements over its useful life. Straight-line depreciation is the default method used my most companies. It is used when no particular pattern governs the use of the equipment. It is easy to calculate, reducing the occurrence of errors.
 To calculate straight-line depreciation you need to know the cost of the fixed asset. You also need to know the estimated salvage value and the estimated useful life of the asset.Include the sales tax, shipping and installation costs in the total cost of the asset.The salvage value is the amount for which you could sell the item at the end of its useful life. It is subtracted from the expense of the item when calculating the cost that is to be depreciated.Use Publication 946 from the IRS to determine the useful life for the asset.
 Calculate the net cost of the asset by subtracting the salvage value from the cost. Calculate a depreciation rate using the useful life in years. Multiply the cost of the item the depreciation rate to calculate the annual depreciation amount.For example, suppose a company purchased a vehicle for $60,000 and the vehicle has a $10,000 salvage value and a five-year useful life.
Calculate the depreciable asset cost with the equation $60,000 - $10,000 = $50,000.
Divide the useful life (in years) into 1 to calculate the depreciation rate. Use the equation 1 / 5 = .2. The depreciation rate is 20 percent.
Multiply the depreciation rate by the depreciable asset cost to calculate the annual depreciation amount. Use the equation $50,000 x .2 = $10,000. The company will record $10,000 of depreciation on the vehicle every year.

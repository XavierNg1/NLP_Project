 Make a dough, using cold water. Knead the dough well.;
, Keep them covered with moist cloth for 20 – 25 minutes.
 Drain the water and allow it to dry.
 Add crushed cumin seeds and asafoetida. Wait until it turns brown. Now add the ginger and green chilli paste, gram flour and spice powders of your choice. Sauté them for a minute or two.
 Place the fillings on a plate.
 Roll the balls using a rolling pin and roll into a thick poori. Add the kachori fillings in the center. Enclose the kachori fillings with the outer part of the poori to make a pocket. Make the same with the other balls.
 Add the kachoris to the oil and fry them until they're properly cooked and their colour turns to golden–brown.
 They're now ready to serve!

 Add two perpendicular guidelines to help position the eyes and nose overlapping the head.
, These are a bit flatter on the bottom than on the other sides, sort of like a very rounded, very tall semicircles.









Inside each eye draw two ovals, one inside the other, near the inside edge of his eyes.
Add the eyebrows, two crescent-shapes, directly below the hat.
 Depending on the angle, this is usually just a large circle meets the bottom of his eyes.









Sketch out his mustache directly below his nose. It's made up of two lines parallel to the flattish bottom of his eyes, both ending a little past the end of his eyebrows, and a curve connecting the ends of them. For now, this should look like a crude D that's tipped over.
 Depending on the angle, this may need to be more of a pear shape.









Draw the arm and leg shapes. These are all about the same length as his head, hat included, and get just a little wider at the end farthest from his body.
Sketch the hands and feet. The hands are just circles, while the feet are a cross between ovals and beans-they are perfectly round on the inside and bean-shaped on the outside.
 Give Mario some fingers and his shoes some soles (if you can see them). Draw the bumps on the bottom of his mustache and clarify his hat some. Finish this step by adding details to his clothes. Don't forget the M on Mario's hat!









Review your drawing. Now is the time to fix up any mistakes. When you're satisfied, clean up the lines you don't want.
 This helps ensure that they aren't visible afterwards.Mario is now ready for action!

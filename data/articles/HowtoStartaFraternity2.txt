 Because fraternities are a part of the Greek system you should pick between two or three letters of the Greek Alphabet. These letters should represent the Greek words for values you want your fraternity to embody. Make sure you choose a name that isn't already taken. A quick internet search should let you know if the name is taken or not.


You also could design and select your regalia, symbols, and mascots.
 Most fraternities have a good Latin phrase that fits their belief system. Your slogan doesnâ€™t need to be in Latin, but that is the standard.
 All fraternities have a hierarchy. For example there will be a President, a Vice President, a treasurer, and so on. Decide on how you would like for the fraternity to be organized. Some schools may have specific requirements for student organizations, so it would be a good idea to check with your Greek life coordinator or the director of Student Life., These should cover topics like academic performance, personal conduct, and public relations. Make sure you make a section that allows your brothers to sign the document. This way people are bound by the policies and you can remove someone from the fraternity if they are causing issues.


Make sure that you include all of your members on the editing and fine-tuning of your Constitution. This is vital to creating a good organization.
 Many fraternities are known for their houses. These houses act as gathering places for the fraternity brothers as well as a great location for parties and other social events. A house or other central location is vital to the long-term well being of a fraternity. Without a fraternity house it is hard to tell the difference between your fraternity and a club.

 If youâ€™ve got foggy windows in the summer, turn down your air conditioner. This will warm up your car and get the inside air temperature to match the outside a bit better. You can also open your windows a bit to allow more outside air in (and it prevents your car from becoming too stifling)., If the fog is on the outside of your windshield (as it will be during the summer), you can remove it with your windshield wipers. Simply turn them on to their lowest setting and let them run until the fog is gone., This is a quick way to get the temperature inside your car to match the temperature outside. Roll down your windows as far as you can so that the warm air outside gets into the cool interior of your car.

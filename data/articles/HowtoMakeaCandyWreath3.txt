Wrap the loose ends of the wire around the wreath once, then wrap them around the base of the wire loop. Wrap the loose ends once more time around the wreath, then poke the ends into the Styrofoam., This will not only protect it, but also make attaching the candy to the greening pins easier., Lay the candy flat on the cardboard or foamcore, and poke one of the greening pin's legs through the wrapperâ€”just between the twist and the candy itself. Do this for the other piece of candy and the other leg.Repeat this step with about 40 to 50 candies.

You can do this with any type of wrapped candy, from taffy, to Jolly Ranchers, to peppermints, to butterscotch candies.
Avoid poking the pins through the wrappers outside of the twisted part. The candy will be more likely to fall off.

You don't have to worry about covering the back of the wreath, because it will be resting against a door or wall., Use T-pins (for quilting) to secure single candy pieces to any holes or gaps in the wreath., You can make your own bow, or buy a pre-made one from the craft store. Secure the bow to the wreath using a greening pin. If the pre-made bow has wires attached to it, you can simply wrap the wires around the wreath and twist them shut in the back., Hang the wreath wherever you want. To eat the candies, simply untwist the wrapper, and pull the candy out. leave the wrapper on the wreath.

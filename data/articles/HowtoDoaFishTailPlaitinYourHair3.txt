 Comb it down and to the side, under either your right or left ear. Secure it in place with an elastic hair tie you don't mind breaking, since you'll be cutting it off later. The hair tie will make it much easier to plait your hair on the side.
 Create two equal sections and hold one in each hand.
 You're using the same method you used to make the basic Fishtail braid.
 Hold it in place with your right hand.
 It should be the same size as the strand you took from the left side.
 Hold it in place with your left hand.
 Plait your fishtail all the way to the end, going back and forth between the left and right sides.
 Use an elastic, a ribbon or a hair bobble.
 Now the top of your plait will look loose and natural.

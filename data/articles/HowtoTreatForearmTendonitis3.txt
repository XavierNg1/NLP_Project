 If you experience significant joint problems, severe pain, redness, swelling, or loss of joint function, you may have advanced Tendinitis and likely require medical care.Provide a detailed list of your symptoms and the duration of your symptoms. For example: “constant pain in the right forearm for two hours” or “swelling of the left forearm at the end of the day”.
Tell your physician about any treatments you have tried or used at home.
Describe your daily activities to your physician, as Tendinitis can be caused or exacerbated by excessive activity.
 Steroid injections around the tendon may help to reduce swelling and ease pain. These treatments are not recommended for chronic tendinitis lasting three months or longer. Repeated injections can weaken your tendons and increase your risk of rupturing the tendon. Therefore, it is recommended that corticosteroids be avoided., Your doctor may recommend physical therapy for your forearm tendinitis. The physiotherapist will then develop a program with specific exercises designed to stretch and strengthen your forearm muscles.Physical therapy sessions may be several times a week for several months.
Rest, stretching, and strengthening are the mainstays for this treatment.
 Depending on how severe and chronic your tendon injury is, surgery may be an option, especially if a tendon has torn away from the bone.


Focused aspiration of scar tissue (FAST) may be necessary to treat chronic tendinitis. This procedure is a minimally invasive surgery that uses ultrasound guidance and small instruments, and is performed under local anesthesia.
The goal of this surgery is to remove tendon scar tissue without damaging the surrounding tissues.
Most people return to normal activity within one to two months following FAST treatment.

 Brush some extra-virgin olive oil onto each side of the filets and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
 Squeeze the juice of 1 lime over each filet as it finishes cooking and then remove it from the grill.
 Mix until a smooth sauce has formed, and then transfer the sauce to a small bowl. Add in the diced tomatoes and chopped scallions.









Finely chop the cabbage and place it in a separate bowl.
 Serve the tortillas with fish, shredded lettuce, and guacamole sauce.









Break the fish apart into large chunks before serving.

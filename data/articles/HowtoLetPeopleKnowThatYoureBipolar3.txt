 It’s easy to become defensive when you’re discussing something personal like a mental illness. However, shutting down doesn’t help the dialogue or inspire your loved ones to offer support. Show them that you want them to understand and be there for you by encouraging them to ask you questions.You might ask, “I know this is a lot to take in. Does anyone have any questions or concerns?”
Provide any pamphlets or videos that might be helpful to their best understanding your condition.
 While it’s important to maintain an open and honest dialogue with those closest to you, you do have the liberty to withhold any personal information you don’t feel needs sharing. You might do this because you worry about stigma or because you are not as close to a particular person.If this happens, simply say, “I’d rather not talk about that” and change the subject.
 Education is one of the best ways to reduce stigma about mental illness and ensure that your loved one provide adequate support. After your initial conversation, point your friends and family to credible sources where they can learn more.

These may include the National Institute of Mental Health, the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness., Your loved ones can also support your treatment and recovery by joining you therapy or support group meetings. Here they can ask more questions to gain a better understanding about bipolar disorder and learn how they can be there for you in recovery.Support groups can give your loved one direct accounts about what its like to live with your condition, which can aid their understanding.

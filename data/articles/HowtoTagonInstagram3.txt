 A quick way to bring a friend’s attention to an interesting post is to tag (also called “mention”) their username in the comments. This sends a notification to your friend so they can see the post.Username tags begin with an “@” symbol and follow the format “@username.”
Your friend will not see your tag if the post is private (unless they follow that account).
 It’s the chat bubble beneath the photo or video you want to share.
 Instagram once let users type “@yourfriendsname” into the comments to tag folks, but now this just sends a direct message. You’ll need to start the comment with something other than the “@username” tag, such as a space or another word.
 If you don’t know their exact username, just start typing it until you see it in the search results. You can tap it once it appears to add it automatically.
 The icon looks like a paper airplane and is at the bottom right corner of the screen. This will post your comment, and your tagged friend will be notified that they’ve been tagged.

 The formula is Average=(x1+xn)2{\displaystyle {\text{Average}}={\frac {(x_{1}+x_{n})}{2}}}, where x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} is the first number in the series and xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} is the last number in the series., Remember, for this formula, you are only working with the first number in the sequence (x1{\displaystyle x_{1}}) and the last number in the sequence xn{\displaystyle x_{n}}.

For example, if you were finding the average of sequential numbers beginning with 15 and ending with 45, your formula will look like this: Average=(15+45)2{\displaystyle {\text{Average}}={\frac {(15+45)}{2}}}.
 First you need to add the two values in parentheses. Then divide by 2. The result will be the average of the series of numbers.

For example:(15+45)2=602=30{\displaystyle {\frac {(15+45)}{2}}={\frac {60}{2}}=30}So, the average of the series of consecutive numbers beginning with 15 and ending with 45 is 30.

 A disoriented older dog can easily get confused about where it is. This could be dangerous if your dog is outside and can’t remember how to get back inside. Even if your dog gets disoriented when inside, the indoor environment is likely safer than the outdoor environment.;
, When your dog is indoors, watch where it goes. Pay attention to if your dog walks into a corner and can’t get out, or gets stuck behind a door. These actions could be distressing to your dog.


Protect your dog from this distress by gently guiding it out of corners or behind doors. Talk in a soothing voice while you’re doing this so your dog can feel safer and more relaxed.
 If you have a backyard, keep a close eye on your dog when you let it outside to go to the bathroom. When in the yard, your dog get easily disoriented, forget how to come back to the house, and possibly wander off (if there’s no fence). It may help to go out in the yard with your dog so you can guide it back to the house.


If your dog wanders off and heads toward the street, it could get hit by a car, which could cause serious injury or be fatal.

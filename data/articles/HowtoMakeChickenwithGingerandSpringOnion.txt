 First take 3 spring onions (or green onions) and coarsely chop them. Next, cut off 5 slices of a ginger root. It is ok to leave the skin on the ginger as it will add to the flavor in the marinade. Add these ingredients along with 1 tablespoon of salt an 2 tablespoons of rice wine into a food processor. Finely chop and mix the onions, garlic, ginger, rice wine and salt. You can use a food processor or a mortar and pestle. Take the finished marinade and spread it evenly over both sides of the 1 1/2 pounds of chicken. Bone in chicken is recommended as it has more flavor and cook with the skin on. Now set the chicken aside for 1 hour at room temperature and let it marinate.;
, While the chicken is marinating, prepare the garnish. Start by peeling the skin off a ginger root with a spoon. Then thinly slice and finely chop the ginger to make a 1/3 of a cup. Remove the both the tops and ends of the green onions. Slice the green onion in half lengthwise and then line up all the green onion halves. Thinly slice them at a diagonal. Mix the chopped green onions and the prepared ginger in a small bowl.
 Put about 1 1/2 cups of water in the bottom of a large wok or skillet and heat to a low boil. Place a large steam basket in the wok and put the chicken into it. Cover the wok and steam for about 15 to 20 minutes to cook.
 Remove the chicken from the steam basket to a serving dish. Take a large skillet and pour in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat. While the oil heats, take the green onion and ginger mix and spread it evenly on top of the green onions. Once the oil starts to crackle, remove from the heat and pour on top of the chicken. This dish will serve four people.

 Only Pay-to-players can train the Thieving skill past level 5.;
, It is in a trapdoor right next to an abandoned house.
, It is fairly straightforward, but if you don't know how to do it, check the RuneScape game guide or the RuneScape Wiki. The completion of this quest should get you to about 8 Thieving.
 If you have high levels in Thieving or Agility, you can steal double, triple, or even quadruple loot from them. Do this until you reach 10 Thieving.
 If you like pickpocketing, you may want to try pickpocketing farmers. If you like stealing from stalls, you may want to try stealing from the bakers' stalls in East Ardougne.


If you have at least 20 Thieving, a visit the the HAM cave is also a good idea. If you pickpocket the HAM followers here, you can get all kinds of neat items, including HAM costume pieces to make them easier to pickpocket, or even an easy clue scroll.
You should have a fairly decent Thieving level by now!

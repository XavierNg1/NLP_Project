 Keratitis related to a feline herpesvirus (FHV) infection can’t be treated with standard antibacterial eye drops. If your cat hasn’t been vaccinated, the vet will test it for FHV.Other than eye infections, signs of FHV infection include respiratory infection, fever, lethargy or depression, and anorexia., To treat herpetic keratitis, the vet will most likely suggest an antiviral treatment. Most antiviral drops need to be applied five times per day.Ask the vet if they recommend a corticosteroid in addition to the antiviral drops. As in bacterial infections, the corticosteroid will help prevent the immune system’s scarring response.
 If your cat tests positive for FHV, reducing stressful situations will help manage the disease. The virus will go into a dormant state, and stress can result in recurrences.Try to keep your cat away from confrontations with other animals.
Avoid leaving it unsupervised with small children, who might play rough or tease the cat.
Give your cat loving attention, but be sure to give it space and don’t force it to endure situations that make it uncomfortable.

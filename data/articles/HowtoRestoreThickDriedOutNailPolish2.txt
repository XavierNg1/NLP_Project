 Nail polish thinner is sold at many beauty stores and department stores. Add one drop of nail polish thinner at a time. This will ensure that you don't end up making your polish too thin.








Add one drop, close the bottle tightly, and roll it between your hands. See if the nail polish is as thin as you want.
If it's not, add another drop of nail polish thinner and repeat. Keep repeating this process until the nail polish is thin and wet like new.
 For only slightly thickened nail polish, you may be able to get it flowing again by just rolling it between your hands. Turn the bottle upside down once, allowing color to redistribute. Then, place the bottle between your palms.








Roll the bottle back and forth between the palms of your hands. This may work to loosen up the polish.
If this method does not work, you may have to try another means of loosening your nail polish.
 Nail polish remover contains acetone. If you can't find acetone, a few small drops of nail polish remover. If you have a bottle of nail polish remover that's almost empty, this can be a particularly good method.








Use an eyedropper to add one drop of polish in at the time, swishing the bottle in between. Add as many drops as you need to adequately loosen up your nail polish.

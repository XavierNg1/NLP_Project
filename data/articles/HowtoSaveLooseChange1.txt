 Not only will your purse be lighter without the change weighing it down, but you will also ensure that you actually make note of and save that change.;
, When cleaning your car or vacuuming your sofa, check for loose change in the seats, between the cushions, or on the floor. You’ll be surprised by how much you can gather by just looking for it., Loose change can often be found on the ground in parking lots, in change slots in vending machines, and near drive-through windows. Make it a habit to check these areas for loose change, and you can add to your growing collection., If you’re looking for a hobby that can potentially help your bottom line, using a metal detector to find loose change could be for you. When you go out with your detector, practice the “low and slow” method by keeping the detector coil close to the ground and giving the machine enough time to process what’s below. Then, when you hear a beep, carefully dig and look for buried coins or other treasure.Parks, sports fields, and beaches are popular places for metal detecting.
If you want to use your detector on private property, be sure to ask permission first.
 Make it a habit to pay for small items in cash, and pay a whole dollar amount instead of providing change. For example, if your coffee is $4.35, pay with a $5 instead of four singles, a quarter, and a dime. The more change you create, the more change you can save.
 When gathering and picking up change, keep an eye out for coins that may be worth more than face value. Silver coins (like dimes and quarters) minted prior to 1965 may have enough silver in them to be worth more than the $0.10 or $0.25 you may think they’re worth.

 This is a great way to clear your head and feel refreshed. Getting some fresh air will leave you energized and help you take your mind off your studies and tests. Remember that you’re not necessarily looking to break speed records or build major muscle, but do a light or medium exertion.


Go for a jog.
Do some laps in the pool.
Walk outside. Hardly exercise, but sometimes you just need a break from tedious work.
Dance around your room. It sounds silly, but it’s a great way to use that pent up physical energy while listening to your favorite tunes.
 Yoga is the Indian practice of stretches and poses, as well as controlled breathing and meditation. Traditionally, yoga used for spiritual enlightenment and exercise. Yoga can come off as somewhat intimidating at first, but don’t be afraid to try it. Basic yoga positions are easy to learn and are more or less variations of different types of stretches you might do anyway.


Find a comfortable space to practice. The space should have enough room for you to move around and will ideally be quiet and free of distractions.
Begin by doing some basic arm and leg stretches, followed by a sun salutation.
Follow it up with some basic yoga poses like the down dog, cobra, forward bend, and star pose.
Hold each position for 3-5 deep, mindful breaths.
 Get a handful of friends together and play a game like frisbee, soccer, or pick-up basketball. Besides getting exercise, this is a great way to socialize and meet new friends. The games don't have to be competitive, just an opportunity to get the heart rate up and de-stress.

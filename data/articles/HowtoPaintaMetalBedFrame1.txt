This needs to be a well-ventilated place, dry, with temperatures between 45°F and 85°F (7°C and 29°C).
It should be fairly dust and insect free and where children and pets won’t disturb the bed frame as the paint dries.
There should be something in the area where parts can be propped against as you paint them and as they to dry. You could use a sawhorse, ladder or an old chair for this. You could also tape a drop cloth to a wall and lean the bed frame against that.;
, As you work, pay attention to how the frame was assembled so you can re-assemble it correctly. Store the nuts and bolts and other small hardware in a secure container.
 Pay attention to corners, and crevices in designs. Make sure all the dirt is scrubbed off.



Any old paint needs to be roughed up and all rust needs to be removed.






You may need coarser sandpaper or a wire brush for heavily rusted areas to start but finish with the medium fine sandpaper.






All loose peeling paint needs to be removed but it’s not necessary to remove all of the paint.
 Cover the painting area with drop cloths or old newspapers.

When one surface is dry, flip the pieces and spray the other side.
Use slow, sweeping motions with the spray can and avoid heavy coats that make drips.






Allow the primer to dry completely before moving on to the next step.



This paint should be rust resistant, and made for use on metal.
Use those smooth, steady sweeping motions to get even coverage.






Let the first surface dry completely, and then turn the pieces and spray the other side.
 Pay attention to corners and design areas to make sure they don’t collect excess paint or remain unpainted.

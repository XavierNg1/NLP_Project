 Keeping this in mind, make sure that you choose a gift that is unique to her and fits her hobbies and interests. Also, decide on a gift that she will use often. You could get her toys, games, make-up, a football, or anything that she will enjoy using and playing with.


If you have no idea what she likes, because you haven't really spent that much time with her, or if you are just having trouble figuring out a gift, ask your parents. Most likely, they'll give you some good ideas.;
, You need to accept that she has most likely been wanting this and as you are older, you could always buy it yourself or ask her nicely to borrow it. Don't be mean to her about it, otherwise she will be less likely to share anything else with you in the future.
 If this bothers you, then you could have a quiet word with your parents and ask them to see if a really good friend of yours could come. Don't ask for too many though, as your parents will probably say no. Stick to one really close friend, or maybe two if you really want to.
 Help her decide what she wants to wear, making sure it's age appropriate, do her hair if she wishes to have it done, and if your parents allow it, apply very minimal makeup if she would like some. Your parents will definitely appreciate you helping your sister so they can set up, and it can be some time for you to bond and have fun with her.
 Make sure that you are talking to her occasionally, but also giving her some privacy. When she gets up hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Even if she says she doesn't, or she looks mad when you talk to her, she most likely wants you to spend time with and talk to her.
 She will most likely be happy, and even if she is not, you can simply wish her a happy birthday, blow her a kiss, and walk out. If she allows you in, spend more time with her, talking about her birthday and tucking her in.

 Wash and dry a large potato, making sure to scrub the skin thoroughly. Place it in a microwaveable dish. Do not peel or pierce the potato.Russet potatoes work best, but other kinds of potatoes with thick skin are also good option (e.g. Yukon Gold, sweet potatoes).
 Cover the dish with plastic wrap, leaving a corner open. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Remove, uncover, and check the potato to see if it's cooked. If not, continue microwaving for another minute and check again., Remove the potato from the microwave-safe dish with an oven mitt or kitchen tongs. Run it under cold water for 15 seconds to cool. Make a cut on the side of the potato and slowly remove the skin entirely., Place potato in a bowl and add a half cup (4 oz.) of milk, half cup (4 oz.) or sour cream or plain yogurt, and one tbsp. (0.5 oz.) of butter. Mash the potato using a masher or large fork, continuing until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.,

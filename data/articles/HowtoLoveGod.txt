 If we feel compassion for others in the same way we feel compassion for our own dear ones and ourselves, we can know that we love God. God's most important command for us is to love him and to love his children. We need to especially love Jesus Christ, because anyone who does not love God's son cannot love him, the father.
 Know that the goal of life is to love God.
, Accept what God likes and hates and what he does.
, Know that others around the world are going through similar sufferings as you are, if not worse.
,, Know that with only knowing God and proper food and clothing, one can be content. The Bible says, "Godliness with contentment is great gain."

, Ask him to help you with selfish motives for one's own pleasures. Don't serve riches. The Bible says, "You cannot serve both God and money."

,, Speak words of blessing over others only.
 Think of it this way, if you are apart from a friend or spouse you'll still love them, right? Even if you're miles apart and you can't see them, if you can only talk to them., The trees, bees, flowers, nature, the people you love. He created these things for yours and his pleasure.

See him in the miracles and phenomenons around you.
 It doesn't matter where, it doesn't matter if it's in your headÂ or out loud, work or play. He promises to listen to your prayers., God first loved us by sending his son Jesus Christ as the greatest example of his love. Jesus died for all to come live in God's love from which we cannot escape. Jesus will save us from our sins and build in us a perfect eternal life by the strength of God and not our own efforts. When we believe and call on the name of Jesus and are willing to let go of our evil ways, God helps us with this so that we don't fail. When we commit to surrendering to his Lordship, He does this and the rest!;

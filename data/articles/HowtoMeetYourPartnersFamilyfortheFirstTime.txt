 Imagine that you are trying to find the perfect lawyer. You walk in and find a man who yells at you, is rude and mean. Then later, he tried to apologize. Would you want him to be your lawyer even though he did all those mean things? Probably not. Same for your partners family. If you go in there, throw your coat on the floor, scream and insult them do you think they are going to want their son or daughter to be with you? Most likely, no. That's why you have to set a good impression. It's not just about looks, it's about personality, too.;
, (For example: "Hello, I'm Jessica, how are you?") Of course, don't be too fake. Being fake is annoying and won't get you anywhere. You have to be sincere, and don't kiss up just because you want to leave a great impression. Be yourself, but a respectful version of it.
 Smile a lot. A smile is a good way of showing that you are nice and open.
 Saying thank you shows that you appreciate what they did for you. They are inviting you into their home or in their lives.
 (Example: His/her mom says that you have ugly shoes.) Tell her that you like your shoes but you appreciate her opinion. Being rude about the situation is just going to be bad and awkward for both you, your partner, and his family.
 Put your napkin on your lap, eat slowly and chew your food. If you spill something, say you are sorry and help clean up. Make sure you chew with your mouth closed and you don't talk while eating something.
 Answer honestly. If they question you on something personal, tell them that you wish to not speak about that.
 Also let them know that you had a great time (if you did, if not don't say anything. DON'T BE FAKE!)

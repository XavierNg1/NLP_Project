 This will help visually impaired children become more aware of their surroundings and other nearby physical movements. For example, announce your presence as you enter and leave the room.


Announce when you are moving to a different section of the room or coming near a particular child. This will prevent them from becoming confused or startled if their impairment does not allow them to follow your movements.
 In most cases, vague words and expressions can result in misunderstanding or failure to grasp specific meanings. For example, instead of saying, "Pick up that pencil over there," say "Pick up that red pencil on the desk next to the clock."

, Visually impaired children will often have difficulty seeing your face and expressions as you speak. For example, when you are praising a child on their good work, smile as you speak so they can hear the approval and happiness in your voice.
 This will allow visually impaired children to identify who is speaking to or addressing them, especially if their impairment does not allow them to clearly see the speaker.
 Visually impaired children must rely more on these other senses for the most effective learning experience. For example, instead of instructing children to read from a standard textbook, read the text out loud to them, or provide them with braille textbooks.


Use learning aids and tools that are specifically developed for the blind and visually impaired. Examples of tools you can use are text-to-audio systems, recordings, and other audio devices.
 Visual aids that are considered "busy" in appearance and contain multiple graphics and colors can be more difficult for visually impaired children to interpret.


Use materials with pictures and graphics that contain circles, squares, and triangles, and other basic designs.
Use colors that are bold and bright in appearance, such as red, bright yellow, and blue. Light, pastel colors are often difficult for visually impaired to see clearly.

 Take a deep pan or stockpot and fill it with water. Set the pan on the cooktop and turn the heat on high to begin warming it up. The water will be ready when it begins to bubble up from the center.The pot you use should be roomy enough to hold all the sunchokes you’re preparing along with enough water to keep them fully submerged.
Throwing a dash of salt in the bottom of the pot will help the water reach a boil faster.
 Rinse the sunchokes under running water, then use a veggie peeler to scrape off the outer layer of skin. Once they’ve been peeled, carefully cut them with a fine dice. To mash the fleshy sunchokes, it will be necessary to use a food processor rather than a traditional hand masher, so you’ll want to make sure they’re in small enough pieces to easily puree.Ordinarily it’s okay to leave the skin on if you’re roasting or frying, but for mashed sunchokes it’s better to remove it in order to achieve a smooth, creamy consistency.
Place your hand on the back edge of the knife and use a “lever” motion to chop tough sunchokes more easily.
 Drop the diced sunchokes into your pot of water. Allow them to cook at a boil for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat and let them simmer for 15 more minutes. The sunchokes should have some give to them when they’re done.You can tell when the sunchokes have cooked long enough by pressing them with a spoon or ladle.
 Drain the pot and move the sunchokes to the food processor. Combine them with garlic, shallots, heavy cream, butter, salt, pepper and any other desired spices. Pulse the mixture together until it forms a thick, batter-like puree. Serve the mashed sunchokes while they’re still hot.Unlike vegetables like potatoes or cauliflower, which can be mashed using a hand masher or egg beater, sunchokes need heavy-duty treatment in order to soften and smooth them.
Try not to leave any lumps or chunks in your mashed sunchokes. These bits may be mushy and slightly chewy, which will throw off the texture of the completed dish.

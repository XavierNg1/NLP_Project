 When going uphill on a dirt bike, position your stance so that your body weight is being pushed forward. This will add to your momentum. The rest of your stance should remain the same as when riding on flat ground.


Squat with your knees bent a few inches off the seat with your feet on the foot pegs. Keep your legs locked and knees grabbing onto the tank. Elbows should be bent with arms locked. Keep your head and shoulders straight, leaning forward almost over the handlebars.






While gripping your handlebars, cover the brake and clutch with your middle or index finger. Keep your grip loose by using only your index finger and thumb. Keep your wrist as straight as possible. Be alert and ready to grab the brake with your fingers from the handlebars.

, Before climbing the hill, gather as much speed as possible on your drive towards the hill. Maintain this momentum as you climb the hill.
 As you go up the hill, shift gears to prevent the bike from bogging or dying out. Once the bike bogs out you will not be able to recover.
 Giving too much throttle will cause the back end of the bike to slip, however not enough throttle will cause the front wheel to rise. Practice climbing hills so you get the right feel for throttle control.

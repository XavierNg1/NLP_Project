 This is a word that "self respecting" artists hate to hear, but the reality is, many artists never find true success during their lifetimes, and many historical artists were penniless at the time of their passing.
 This too, may be insulting on the surface, but unless you have sales receipts or support of a generous foundation, you may find yourself working a day job, and creating your art as a hobby in your basement studio for years, before success finds you.

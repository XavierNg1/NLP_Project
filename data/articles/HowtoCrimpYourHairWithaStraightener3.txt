 This will help reduce frizz. Do not work on damp hair.
 This will help your hair hold its crimp better later on.
 If you want, you can gather half of your hair up into a loose bun at the top of your head. Work with the bottom layer first. When you are done, you can undo the bun and work with that layer.
 The smaller section you grab, the tighter the crimp will be.
, This will keep your hair from drying out or getting scorched by the hair straightener.
 Do not let go of the rope just yet.
 If you let go of your hair too soon, it may not hold the crimp.
 When you get to the other side of your face, remember to twist the hair rope away from your face as well. If you are working in layers, undo the top layer, and repeat the twisting and straightening process on it as well.
 If the crimp is too tight for you, you can loosen it by gently running your fingers through your hair. If you try brushing your hair, your hair may turn frizzy.
 This will set the crimp and make it last longer.

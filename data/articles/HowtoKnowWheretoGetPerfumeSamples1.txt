 Sephora and Nordstrom are two of the best department stores for getting completely free perfume samples. If the store doesn’t carry samples of a particular perfume you’re interested in, many of them will decant a bottle and make you a sample of your choice.


Bring a few zip-lock baggies, some small sticky labels and a handful of cotton balls with you. If there is no other way to bring home a sample, simply spritz the perfume on the cotton ball and put it in the baggie.
Be sure to label each baggie with the perfume brand and name. Take it home with you and spend some time with the scent to see if you're interested in it.;
, If the store doesn't have the perfume you want to sample and they don’t have any empty sample vials to create one for you, ask if they would be willing to fill up an empty vial you have with you.Some department stores are happy to fill empty vials that you brought with you. Others don't like it doing it, so it really just depends on where you are.
However, it never hurts to be prepared by having the vials on you and asking a sales associate once you arrive.
 If you are at a department store making an unrelated purchase, always request a few free perfume samples at the register when you’re checking out. Even if your purchase is a relatively low cost item, you should still ask for a few perfume samples.


Most department stores are happy to comply with your request.
Giving free samples with a purchase is pretty standard practice at these establishments, since they want your repeat business.

 It will feel good to finally sort some stuff out.
 Think about the plot and characters and what it is about the story that moves you.
 National Geographic Kids or Nickelodeon might be a little childish, but reading them will make you feel better because they will give you something to do without having to think too hard.
 It may sound weird but it's really interesting to hear what you have to say to yourself.
 Drink something warm like a honey and lemon drink, and have a stack of old magazines available.
 If you don't want to do anything just watch your pets!

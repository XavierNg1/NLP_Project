 A cattail torch is another type of minimalistic torch that requires only a few simple items. With this type of torch, the spike on the end of the plant will be soaked in flammable fluid. Along with the cattail, you'll also need:


Hollow reed, stick, cane, or bamboo piece
Fuel
Matches or lighter

, The best place to look for cattails is around the perimeter of lakes, ponds, marshes, and other wetland areas. You may also know this plant by the names reedmace, cumbungi, or bulrush.Because cattails are rather flimsy, you'll also need to find a hollow stick or cane that you can insert the cattail into. The stick will act as a holder. Make sure it’s at least 2 feet (61 cm) long.
 Place the cattail into your flammable liquid or oil. Let the cattail soak for at least an hour. This will give the spike time to absorb lots of oil, which means a longer burning torch.Good fuels for this purpose include kerosene, naphtha-based camp fuel, lighter fluid, or rendered animal or vegetable fat

, When the cattail is done soaking, insert the bottom of the cattail into your hollow stick so the oil-soaked spike is protruding from the top of the stick. With a lighter or matches, hold a flame to the bottom of the spike until it ignites.


A cattail torch could give you up to six hours of flame.Don’t burn these torches inside or near other flammable objects.
Hold the torch away from your body to avoid burns.

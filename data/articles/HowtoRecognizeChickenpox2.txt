 The chickenpox virus is spread through the air or through direct contact, normally the product of unsanitary sneezing or coughing practices. The virus is transported in the fluid (i.e. saliva or mucus).


Touching an open sore caused by the virus or breathing it in (such as kissing a person with chickenpox) will also infect you.If you've encountered someone else who has a confirmed case of chickenpox, this will help you identify your own symptoms.
 The chickenpox virus does not produce symptoms immediately. In general, it can take 10 to 21 days after being exposed to develop any noticeable symptoms. The macular-papular rash will continue to appear over several days and the blisters will take several days to resolve. This means that you can have papular rash, vesicles and open blisters which are crusting over all at the same time.


Approximately 90% of susceptible close contacts not vaccinated will develop the illness after exposure., Although the chickenpox illness is not severe, it will cause more hospitalizations, deaths and complications in people who are adolescents and adults. The rash and vesicles can appear in the mouth, anus and vagina., Children older than 12 years, pregnant women or anyone with a compromised immune system (including the use of steroids which compromise the immune system) or who has asthma or eczema, are at greater risk for experiencing more severe symptoms.,

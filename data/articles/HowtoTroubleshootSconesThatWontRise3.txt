 Scones need to be baked as soon as the dough is made. If you let the dough sit while you wait for the oven to heat up, the gas bubbles caused by the baking powder will go away. Pre-heat your oven before you put the scones in; this way, everything will be ready and at the right temperature.
 In general, scones should be baked at a higher temperature than most other pastries. Using too low of a temperature will prevent the scones from rising.


If the recipe called for a lower temperature, try baking the scones at 400°F (205°C) next time, and see if that helps.
 Most recipes are made for those living up to 2,000 to 3,000 feet (609.6 to 914.4 meters) above sea-level. If you live higher than that, you will need to adjust your recipe in order to get the scones to bake properly. Here are some tips for you to try:Use less baking soda or baking powder. Use no less than 1/8 teaspoon.
Use less sugar.
Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of your liquid.
Add more flour. Start with 1 tablespoon.
If you are between 4,000 and 6,000 feet (1219.2 and 1828.8 meters), increase the temperature by 15-25°F.
If you are higher than 6,000 feet (1828.8 meters), use the original temperature, but bake the scones one to three minutes longer.
 Did you open your oven while the scones were baking to peak at them? If so, this might be why your scones didn't rise. Ovens are very sensitive, and opening the door causes the temperatures to drop for a little bit. Scones need to be baked at a high, consistent temperature in order to rise; if the temperature is too low, even for a moment, the scones may not rise.

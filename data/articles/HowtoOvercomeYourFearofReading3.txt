 Feeling rushed or uncomfortable while reading is likely to increase anxiety and reduce comprehension. Don’t leave reading a textbook chapter to the last minute, or expect to power through your book club selection the night before.If you’re working on developing your reading skills and/or a reading habit, carry along several reading options to suit your interest in the moment and the time you have available (for instance, riding the bus or sitting in the dentist’s waiting room).
When possible, set up in a comfy (but not sleep-inducing) space with lots of light.
 Many people confuse reading speed with reading skill; however, not being able to remember or make sense of what you just read (because you went too fast) may contribute to a fear of reading. Let your reading speed increase naturally — or, if you desire, with targeted instruction — after you’ve built up your reading comprehension skills.Holding a notecard or running your finger beneath the line you’re reading may slow you down a bit, but if it helps you understand what you’re reading, it’s worth the extra time.
Try to focus on one part of the page at a time. You can make this easier by covering up part of the page with your hand or a piece of paper.
 You’re never too old to learn to read, or to improve your reading skills. If reading presents a special challenge for you, seek out reading instruction resources available at your school, in your community, or online. Look for specialized instruction if you have a diagnosed condition like dyslexia.Don’t let a diagnosis of dyslexia or another condition turn you off from reading, or make you feel like you aren’t smart enough to succeed. Many people with reading issues have gone on to achieve great things.

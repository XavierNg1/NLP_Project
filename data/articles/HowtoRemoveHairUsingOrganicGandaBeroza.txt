 Exfoliate your skin properly before removing the hair. Application of ganda beroza may cause skin irritation if you do not properly clean and remove dead surface skin beforehand.;
, Only apply ganda beroza with clean hands.
, This hair removal agent comes in a solid form. It's a sticky substance that will immediately stick on your fingers. (You may wish to wear disposable gloves before touching it if you don't like the feeling but it won't harm your skin.)

, Take about the same amount as you would when taking a pinch of salt.
 You can use this hair removal agent to remove unwanted hair from the armpits, arms, legs, and even your bikini area.
 Once the hair sticks to it, start pulling with force. It won't hurt if you pull it with force––do it too timidly and it will.
, Apply moisturizing lotion to the area of skin where the hair has been removed once the surface is clean.
 To remove any leftover ganda beroza from your fingers, rub your fingers against a pumice stone. This will take off any of the remaining substance.
 All done, you should now be hairless in the places you applied the ganda beroza too, all without much fuss.

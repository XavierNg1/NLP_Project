 If you are using glue to add trim or other detailing on the inside of your car, you may accidentally get glue on the seats. You can use a plastic card or other tool to remove the glue. This makes it easier to remove the part adhering to the carâ€™s upholstery.


This step may only be effective if the glue hasn't fully set into the upholstery. Removing it as soon as possible is most effective, if possible.
 Use one tablespoon of liquid dish soap and two cups of cold water.Epoxy and super glue may not come out of fabric upholstery with soap and water. Acetone, such as nail polish remover, can be used to loosen the glue. Be sure to wash the spot with soap and water afterward to prevent damage to the upholstery., Use the cloth to absorb the liquid and repeat until the glue stain disappears.
 This ensures all the soap is out of the upholstery.
 Use a clean, dry cloth to soak up any remaining moisture.

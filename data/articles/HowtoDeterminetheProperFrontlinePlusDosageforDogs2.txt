 Frontline Plus is a topical medication that is used to prevent and kill fleas and ticks. You will need to re-apply it once a month. Only use Frontline Plus on dogs that are eight weeks of age or older., Frontline Plus comes in four different boxes that are differentiated by weight. If your dog weighs 22 pounds or less, then buy the 5 to 22 lb. box. The basic 5 to 22 pound box comes with three .67ml applicators. Only use one applicator per application. There are also 6 and 12 pack boxes available. These come with 6 or 12 .67ml applicators.If your dog weighs 23 to 44 pounds, then buy the 23-44 lb. box. The 23-44 lb. box comes with three 1.34ml applicators.
If your dog weighs 45 to 88 pounds, then buy the 45-88 lb. box. The 45-88 lb. box comes with three 2.68 applicators.
If your dog weighs 89 to 132 pounds, then buy the 89-132 lb. box. The 89-132 lb. box comes with three 4.02ml applicators.
 If your dogâ€™s weight is in between two different weight ranges, then use the box with the lower amount. In other words, round down instead of rounding up. It is always better to use less rather than more in order to prevent an overdose.For example, if your dog weighs 22.5 pounds, then use the 5 to 22 lb. box.
 If your dog weighs more than 132 pounds, you will need to combine products in order to get the correct dosage. This means you will need to buy more than one box. You will need to buy the 89-132 lb. pound box plus an additional box. The additional box you use depends on how many pounds of your dog's weight exceed the 132 limit.For example, if your dog weighs 152 pounds, then apply a 4.02ml applicator and a .67ml applicator since your dog is only 20 pounds over. However, if your dog is 30 pounds over, i.e., 162 pounds, then use a 1.34ml applicator in addition to the 4.02ml applicator.

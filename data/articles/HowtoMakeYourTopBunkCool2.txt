 You and your parents can make your own shelves, or you could buy one from a store. By adding a shelf to your bunk space, you'll have a place to stash important items, like books, your tablet, your cell phone, and so on.Be careful when hanging your shelf. Placing it too close to your bunk might result in you hitting your head on it, knocking items off, and so on, which could be dangerous., Adhesive hooks won't do damage to your walls, but screw-in hooks will be sturdier. Adhesive hooks can even be used on your bed frame, which is a great spot to hang sweatshirts and jackets.


To add color and character to your bunk, you might want to hang streamers, long strips of fabric, scarves, and so on from hooks.
Hooks are also a great way of keeping jewelry and accessories from disappearing. You'll be able to clearly see belts, necklaces, and bracelets that are hanging from hooks.
 A bag with a strap can be hung from one of the corners of your bed. This is the perfect place to store less frequently used items, like books, a box of tissues, extra blankets, spare batteries, a flashlight, and more.


You might want to use a specially designed hanging storage container. These oftentimes have special compartments to keep your things organized., This will also ensure your power cords are always accessible. Take a large binder clip and clamp it onto your bed frame. Then, flip the metal parts so they're facing opposite the mouth of the clip. Feed cords through the open space of the metal part to hold power cords in place.You can buy binder clips at office supply stores or even at the grocery store. You can even get colored binder clips to suit your room's color scheme or make a neat design.

 Once you decide on the date and location of your kids’ craft party, you will want to send out invitations. You can send traditional paper invitations in the mail. You can also invite guests via social media, email, or telephone. Make sure you ask guests to RSVP by a certain date so that you will know how many crafters to plan on.Send out the invitations 2-4 weeks before the party.
 Make a list of all the tools and supplies you will need for the craft party. Buy what you need, but also plan on purchasing extra. Having extra supplies and tools on hand can be helpful if you end up with an unexpected guests or accidents that ruin supplies., A children’s craft party will go more smoothly if you test the crafts ahead of time. Before the party, make each craft and resolve any issues before the guests arrive. For example, if the paint takes too long to dry between steps of the craft, children might not be able to take their completed craft home with them at the end of the party., Before your guests arrive, set up individual craft stations for each of the children. The stations should each have their own set of supplies and the tools necessary for completing the crafts. For example, you can set up individual stations along your dining room table., Most crafters will be hard at work on their creations, so an elaborate meal is probably not the best choice. Instead, stick to finger foods and easy-to-eat snacks. For example, try a fruit and veggie tray, cookies, or crackers and cheese. Keep it simple so your guests can focus on the crafts.

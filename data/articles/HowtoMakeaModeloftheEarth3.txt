 Make one of the two models described above. Once you're finished, glue it to a large piece of foam board or cardboard.
 Color the foam board black to show outer space.
 You can use stick-on stars, or cover the background with glitter glue or glitter paint.
 Find a golf ball or a crumpled up piece of paper, about ¼ the size of your Earth model. Glue it on the board, close to the Earth.
 Crumple up another piece of paper for each of the planets. Glue them onto the board in this order:


Mercury — small, grey
Venus — yellow, about Earth sized
Earth (your model)
Mars — red, about Earth sized
Jupiter — orange and white, the biggest planet
Saturn — yellow, almost as big as Jupiter, with rings around it
Uranus — light blue, bigger than Earth but smaller than Saturn
Neptune — light blue, about the size of Uranus
Pluto — a tiny grey dot

, Closest to Mercury, the sun is an enormous yellow-orange ball. The sun is much too big for you to show its size accurately. You can either make the biggest ball you can fit, or just color a corner of the board yellow to indicate that the sun expands far beyond the edges.

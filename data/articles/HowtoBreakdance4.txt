 Twist your upper body with your arms tightly wound around yourself. Bend your upper body over until your arms hit the ground. Once your arms hit the ground, you can swing your feet up into the air and transition into other groundwork moves.
 Bend your left leg deeply and place your right leg behind it. Get ready to catch yourself as you fall forward, making the move look like you are actually falling down. Catch yourself with your hands and then allow your bent knee to hit the ground. You are now ready to move on to whatever groundwork you want.
 A backdrop, more commonly (and accurately) called a suicide, is a very advanced move that shouldn't be practiced until a person is comfortable with the basic elements of breakdancing.









Put down a cushion of some sort such as a mattress to practice the suicide move and stand with your feet about two feet apart and your arms out in a T shape straight out from your shoulders.
Kick your right leg out in front of you then swing it back, simultaneously jumping forward with your left leg. Tuck your body in tight and essentially perform a front flip.
Land on the middle part of your back and proceed to move into your groundwork. This move is often performed at the end of a sequence as well.

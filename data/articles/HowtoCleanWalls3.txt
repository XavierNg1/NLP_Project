 In general, after dusting the wallpaper, you can wash it with either soapy water or warm water to which a little ammonia has been added.
 Soak a cloth in white vinegar and warm water, and use this to dab the walls clean. Don't apply vinegar directly to the walls., If the mold is bad, a proprietary product suitable for the wall surface is usually your best bet––follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer.For ink, crayon and marker stains, use a liquid solvent cleaner to lift stains off, such as WD-40 or dry-cleaning fluid.
To remove grease stains, use warm, soapy water.
 Use a cloth dampened in warm water to gently and lightly rinse off the cleaning solution. Dab dry using a soft towel similar to the same process as cleaning painted walls.

 You will need 1 cup (340 g) fresh or Â½ cup (170 g) dried Elderberries and 3 cups (.7 liters) of water. To improve the taste, you can add 1 cup of honey (237 mL), one cinnamon stick, and three cloves. You can harvest the elderberries yourself or purchase them online from a health food store.If you are harvesting the berries yourself, only use blue or black berries. The red berries are poisonous.
You can find Elderberries in moist areas by rivers, roads, and in forests.;
, Put the berries, spices, and water in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce to low heat. Let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes.Remove the saucepan from the heat and use the back of a spoon or a potato masher to smash the berries.
 Pour the mixture through a mesh strainer into a small bowl. Press as much liquid as you can from the berries using the back of your spoon. Allow the liquid to cool for a few minutes and then add honey to the juice if you wish. Store the syrup in a container with a lid.


Allow the syrup to cool and then you can store it in the refrigerator. It will last for two or three months., If you do not want to make your own syrup, you can buy the syrup. Elderberry syrup is called Sambucol. Sambucol typically contains 38% elderberry extract for adults and 19% extract for children. If you buy the syrup, the amount of elderberry extract should be standardized (look for syrups with a seal of approval from United States Pharmacopeial Convention or NSF International). When you make your own syrup, you will not know how strong the syrup is. Standardized extracts may be more effective.
 If you have the cold or a flu, take 4 tablespoons of syrup a day for three days. This could shorten the length of your cold by three days. You can also use the syrup on pancakes and waffles when you do not have a cold. This may help prevent colds.Start taking the syrup as soon as you have symptoms. Treatment may be more effective if you start when you first get sick.

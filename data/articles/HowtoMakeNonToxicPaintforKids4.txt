 Once your paint is prepared, you should squirt a dab of paint onto a piece of cardboard next to the piece of paper that's being painted on. This will offer the painter easy access to the paint without having to dip into the bottle each time.


Alternatively, you can unscrew the cap of the ketchup bottle and dip in the paintbrush directly. You should only dip in the tip. This will offer the painter the best-possible control when using the paint.
 Your homemade paint may be used in much the same way as a watercolour paint. Take the brush and paint in strokes. Because the paint is coloured only by food colouring, you should apply lots of paint in order to get a decent colour.


Learning how to paint is a process that can take years by certain definitions. However, for the sake of simple homemade kid's paint, fun should be emphasized over technique.
 Give the paint at least a couple of hours to dry entirely.
 Put the artwork in the microwave for 3-5 seconds. Make sure not to put it in for much longer than that, as you may risk damaging or even burning the artwork.
 Homemade products can sometimes be as good as the real thing. In the case of non-toxic kid's paint, however, you won't get the same vibrant colours you could expect from store bought paint. Nonetheless, this won't stop the homemade concoction from being a lot of fun.

 These supplies should be available at your local grocery store. This recipe should only take you about 30 minutes and, when finished, you should have about 40 meatballs., Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C). Take your baking sheet and line it with heavy duty foil. Then position your oven safe baking rack on the foil lined baking sheet. Set this off to the side until you're ready to bake the meatballs., Add the ground chuck, bread crumbs, milk, nutmeg, kosher salt, and ground black pepper to your large mixing bowl. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly, then hand-mix the ingredients together thoroughly.You can use a spoon or kitchen tool to mix your ground chuck and other ingredients, though the thickness of the mixture may make this difficult. For this reason, you'll likely want to hand-mix the meat.
 After the meat is well mixed, tear off small pieces from it and roll those pieces into 1-inch meatballs. Place finished meatballs on the baking rack positioned on top of your pan. Roll meatballs until there is no meat left.If you're not a fan of doing this by hand, you may be able to use a melon baller or similar tool to scoop the meat into a meatball shape. Then deposit the meat on the baking rack.
Try to leave a little space between meatballs. Those that are too close could fuse together while baking. Should this happen, use a knife or kitchen scissors to cut the meatballs apart after they are baked.
 At this point, your oven should be preheated. Take hold of the pan and transport the baking rack and the meatballs on it carefully to your oven. Bake the meatballs for 5 to 10 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked.If you're unsure whether or not if your meatballs or finished, take a knife and cut one in half. If the meat is still red, they likely need a little more time.

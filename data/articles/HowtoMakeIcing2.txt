 Place the ingredients in a saucepan and bring them to a boil over medium high heat, stirring constantly. When they come to a boil, remove them from heat., Stir them in with the boiled chocolate mixture, then place the saucepan back on the burner over medium heat. Stir the icing and cook until the butter is melted and the ingredients are completely combined. Remove the icing from heat.
 As the icing cools, beat it with a spoon until it becomes thick and glossy. When it becomes difficult to move the spoon through the fudge icing, it's ready to use.


This icing has a loose consistency, so pour it over your cake or cupcakes rather than using a knife to frost them.
If the mixture seems too loose, return it to heat for a few minutes to allow it to thicken.

 Colour the parts of the clock handout. Each student can can decorate it any way they like.;
, This means the circle and the arrows.
 Don’t use too much glue, just enough to ensure that the paper is attached.
 First, join the minute hand, then attach the hour hand to the drawing pin. Second, attach the drawing pin with the arrows to the paper plate in the circle. Be sure you can move the clock hands freely.
 From the number 12 down to the number 1, draw 4 lines, then from 1 to 2, the other four lines, and so on between the numbers.
 Draw a line towards each number that indicates the hour. So, in number 12, draw a line and the number 0. In the number 1, draw a line and the number 5, then in the number 2, draw the number 10 and so on.
, Divide the class into groups. For instance, you can divide the class into five groups of students if there are forty of them. Each group will have a chance to say and show a time.
 What time does she get up?
Camila watches TV at 4:50 after doing her homework. What time does she watch TV?
Lucy has lunch at 1:50. What time does she have lunch?

, Meanwhile, the other students have to write their own answer down on paper. If the student is right, the group will win a point. Make at least three rounds. Give some sweets to all of your students at the end of the game, telling them "well done!".
 Then you can check that their answers are correct, letting you know how much learning is still needed.

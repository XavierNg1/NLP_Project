 There is reason that melatonin is the number one important ingredient for a better night’s sleep. Melatonin is the hormone that naturally regulates your body’s sleep function. Keep in mind that melatonin alone might not be enough, especially if you find that you are still restless throughout the night. Melatonin is especially recommended for older individuals or those that have faced sleep difficulties for their entire lives – both of these groups have been proven to have lower amounts of natural melatonin in their bodies.;
, Valerian root has been used for millennia to help combat insomnia and to promote a better night’s rest. Without using valerian root, individuals might find that their sleep is still restless. Valerian root can also help those individuals who are light sleepers and who are easily awakened throughout the night.


Be advised that it stinks pretty badly.
 There are a number of vitamins that help to promote sleep and restfulness. These include the full range of vitamins, so look for a product that contains multiple ingredients. Vitamin C has been shown to help individuals better settle down for the night and to get the recommended eight hours of sleep. Many sleep disorders and symptoms of fatigue have been related to Vitamin D deficiencies. As a bonus, getting enough Vitamin D can also help to enhance your mood.
 In addition to the other key ingredients that were mentioned, watch out for other components of a supplement that can help to promote better sleep overall. Magnesium can contribute in numerous ways to an individual’s overall health, from lowering their blood pressure to promoting a healthier nervous system. These factors can make an individual better able to get a good night’s rest. Potassium has been linked to the deepest of the sleep stages, so getting enough of this mineral can help ensure you are reaching this important sleep stage.

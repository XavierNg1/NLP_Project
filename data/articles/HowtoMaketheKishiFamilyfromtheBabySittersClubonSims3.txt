  She needs short, straight hair, glasses with dark rims, and conservative clothing.  Her traits should be Genius, Neat, Computer Whiz, and Unflirty. Her favorite color should be a neutral color.,  Go all out with her hair - just make sure it is long!  Use the first choice of eyeshadow, the blackest possible eyeliner, the pinkest possible blush, and the reddest possible lipstick. For clothes, the more neon the better on her everyday and athletic outfits, but keep the clothes matching.  Give her the traits Good, Artistic, Natural Cook, and either Slob or Technophobe. For her favorite food, choose cookies, cobbler, key lime pie, or peanut butter and jelly. (The first three would be in keeping with her passion for junk food in the books. Peanut butter and jelly is included here because Claudia is slightly childlike without being childish.),,,,,,,

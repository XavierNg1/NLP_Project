 Sometimes, no matter what you try, toolbars and browser redirects just won't go away. For cases like these you will need anti-adware software. These are free programs that scan for and remove adware and malware from your system. Popular programs include Malwarebytes Antimalware, Spybot Search & Destroy, and Adwcleaner.


All of these programs should be downloaded directly from the developer. Avoid sites like Download.com or Softonic, as they will attempt to install more toolbars.
Unlike antivirus programs, you can and should install multiple anti-adware scanners. They will not conflict with one another and each may pick up something that the other missed.
 Run each of the scans after you have finished installing the programs. Running scans may take a while, but you will likely get several results. Ensure that all of the results are checked, and then remove them using the removal tools provided by the program.


For more detailed instructions, see this guide.
For better results, run the adware scans while in Safe Mode.
 After running your anti-adware scans, run a full scan of your computer using your antivirus program. Run the scan again in Safe Mode. Remove any viruses or other threats that appear during the scan.
 If you just can't get an infection to go away, your only other option may be a complete reinstallation of your operating system. This is actually less daunting that it may seem. The most time-consuming process is typically backing up your important files, but if you have a back-up system already in place then the time investment is minimal. See the following guides for detailed instructions on reinstalling your operating system:


Windows Vista
Windows 7
Windows 8
Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and Earlier
Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and Later
Ubuntu Linux

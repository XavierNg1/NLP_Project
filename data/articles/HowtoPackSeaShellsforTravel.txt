 Rinse them in water thoroughly and take out all the sand in them. You'll also have to see that there aren't any living creatures in the shells.
 It is suggested you bring along your own containers. Bottles with wide openings, your lunch box, or some old empty tubs of cream cheese and such are good. If you don't, however, have any such on hand, then try looking for them. Empty bottles of mineral water are great to use., Fill them to their full capacity so that the shells don't have space to bang around and break. If that doesn't work for you, then stuff in some cotton, socks, a handkerchief, or basically just anything that fills space and is soft., You can roll them in socks, or fold them in shirts other items. Thicker things like sweatshirts are great.

Put them in the pockets or roll them into socks to make sure they don't fall out when you unpack.
The more fragile or breakable shells should always be wrapped in clothes.
 Be sure to place them in the middle of the suitcase, not the top, bottom or edges. Chances are your suitcase will be stacked one upon the other and that's not good for your shells., Happy holiday!

 Place your skillet over medium heat. Allow to warm up for a few minutes before adding your ground beef. As ground beef will leak grease when cooking, there is no need to add butter or oil., Add your ground beef. To get it to cook evenly, break up the slab of meat into several large pieces using a spatula.Once you have several small pieces of meat, break these up as well. Continue poking the meat with your spatula until you've broken up the larger pieces into small chunks of beef.
When you're done, the beef should be in even crumbles dispersed on the skillet. This way, they will cook more evenly and faster.
 Beef must be cooked until there is no more pink showing. This is very important, as pink ground beef can cause illness. Stir the meat occasionally as you cook it to make sure it cooks evenly.Make sure you break apart bigger meat crumbles to check for signs of pink.
 Once the beef is completely cooked, throw the onion, turnip, and carrot into the skillet with the beef. You should also add the rosemary and garlic. Use your spatula to stir the vegetables, beef, and herbs together., Stir the mixture occasionally as it cooks to prevent the vegetables or beef from sticking to the bottom of the pan. You should cook it until all the vegetables are completely tender. This takes around six minutes.

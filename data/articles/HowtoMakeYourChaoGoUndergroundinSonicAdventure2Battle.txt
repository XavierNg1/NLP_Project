 If you don't have the stairs going up in the Chao Lobby, make a Hero Chao.;
, You should see the gigantic long pillar standing up with the Chao Transporter.
 Go next to the pillar and start jumping around like crazy.
 If the steps work, you should be able to fly around not on the garden, but in the sky.
 Then go back onto the garden, and check on your Chao. It should be underground.
 If you think this is bad for your Chao, think again. Go outside to the Chao Lobby, go back in, and the Chao will be just fine.

 Epoxy garage floors are resistant to spills. If spills are treated as they occur, they should not set in and require special cleaning. If you see anything spilled on the garage floor, like motor oil, promptly wipe it up with a rag or paper towel. This will allow you to use commercial cleaners on your floor less often., Cleaners with acidic ingredients, like citrus cleaners, and soaps can leave an epoxy floor slippery. They also tend to be more abrasive, causing your floor to wear down faster over time. It's best to stick to cleaners specifically made for epoxy floors when choosing cleaners., Keep mats near doors going in and out of your garage. This way, people can wipe off snow, dirt, and household debris before entering the garage. This will prevent dirt, grime, and dust from building up on your floor.

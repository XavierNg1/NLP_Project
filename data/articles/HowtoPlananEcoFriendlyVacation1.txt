 Travelers who want to be eco-aware while traveling can sometimes feel that adding yet another layer of "to-do's" is overwhelming. Yet, responsible eco-travel is not difficult and is generally about being considerate:


Travel as lightly as you can
Choose transportation that minimizes your impact
Stay in accommodation that aims to minimize its impact on the environment
Choose vacation activities that are eco-friendly
Be conscious that your small actions do add up, such as unplugging your charger when it's done
Be considerate of the social impacts and support the local economy, interact appropriately with the locals and if possible, contribute to local environmental projects in some way.
 There's no need to have a hair shirt mentality about eco-vacations. Eco-friendly accommodation and activities are now commonplace and often have very high standards. It's easy to find eco-travel opportunities using the internet, so you don't have to research the hard way anymore. And there is also a range of prices from budget to top end prices, so you can choose the price according to your available funds and still have a great experience.
 Email and the internet make it easy to ask in advance for the qualifications or accreditation of places you want to visit and stay at. Prefer places that use the accreditation of independent auditors rather than simply stating "eco" in front of their services. Always check the labels to avoid green washing.

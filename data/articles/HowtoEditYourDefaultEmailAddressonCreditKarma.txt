 Open your favorite browser, type http://www.creditkarma.com in the address bar, and hit the Enter button.;
, On the login screen, to the right of the page, are two text fields. Enter your email address into the appropriate box, and your Credit Karma password into the other. Click on the “Sign In” button.
 To get there, once you’re logged in and on your account’s main page, look for the arrow-down button just beside your profile photo thumbnail at the top right side of the screen. Hover over it to display a menu, and then select “Security Settings” from the list.
 When the Security Settings load, the first item on the list of things you can tweak is your email address. Below your current email address are two boxes into which you enter and re-enter your new email address.
 Before your email address can be effectively changed, you will be asked to enter your password into the “Verify current password” box purely for verification and security reasons.
 Finally, click on the blue “Save” button just below where you typed in your password. Your new email address will then be saved. Remember to use it the next time you log in!

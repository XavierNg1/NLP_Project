 Drill a hole in each timber, about 1" from the end. The hole made should be slightly larger than the threaded rod, so that the rod slides through freely.;
, Line up the timbers, line up the holes, and push the threaded rod through all three timbers.
 Put a washer on each end. Thread a nut over each end until the rod protrudes just past the nut. DO NOT thread the nut down tight to the timbers. The timbers should be loose on the rod.



Stand up the tripod, and swing the middle timber one way, and the two outside timbers the other way.
Spread the two outside timbers apart, away from each other. The threaded rod will bend a bit.
 Trellises like this tend to blow over once they are covered with lots of foliage, so they need to be anchored. This can be done in several ways:


Dig holes and bury the ends of the trellis in the ground, preferably at least 1 foot (0.3Â m).
Or, hammer three 2' lengths of reinforcing bar ("rebar", available at many building supply centers) into the ground, and wire the trellis legs onto them. Set up the trellis the way you like it, and then hammer the rebar right next to the trellis legs, following their angle into the ground. The legs can then be wired onto the rebar.
Instead of wiring the legs to the rebar, hose clamps can be used to secure the trellis legs to the rebar.

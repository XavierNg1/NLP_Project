 Place your feet at least a foot apart from each other, in the shape of a “T.” Aim the toes of whichever foot is closest to the front of the bus in that direction. Keep your rear foot perpendicular to the direction of travel.
 Stand with your weight on the toes and balls of your feet, ready to spring into action if needed. Keep your heels on the floor, but avoid settling all of your weight on them.
 Lower your center of gravity a bit more than usual. Allow your legs to absorb shock from bumpy travel before it can reach any farther upward.
 Static friction will keep your feet fixed to the floor,but your upper body may feel like it’s being pulled back as the bus moves forward. Lean into the direction of travel to compensate.
 Use your rear foot (the one perpendicular to the direction of travel) for lateral stability.
 Keep the other leg relatively straight. Inertia will propel your body forward when the bus slows down or stops.Either bend your forward knee to absorb your weight as it moves forward and use your toes to push your body backwards again, or bend your rear knee and lean backwards to keep your body relatively stable.

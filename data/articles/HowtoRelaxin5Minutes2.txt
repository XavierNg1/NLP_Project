 Ensure that there is only you on the bed and in the room. If there is someone with you who is even very quiet and gentle, their presence will distract you. Just excuse yourself from others.
 Make enough space for your body and for you to place your hands by your side in an airplane position, namely straight body, arms stretched out straight on the sides.
 Breathe in, out, in, out, five times. Do this as slowly as you can and not in a rush. Rushing the breathing will make you feel hyped up.
 Think about the place that you most like, a calm one. It should not be any sort of club, office or other busy, noisy places, no matter how much you normally enjoy them or wish to ruminate over them. Try thinking of your calm place as an image. Think for two and a half minutes.
 Flap your arms slowly about. Do not let your mind to wander off! Imagine this for one minute,

, Right, left, right, left, right and left. Move your neck up and down, up, down, up and down, very slowly.
 Hum a very soft and polite one. Do this for 20 seconds.
 Extremely slowly, open your eyes and try to yawn as much as you can. Sit up straight and fold your arms. (Your legs must be flat and stretching out, still.)

, Then try the hardest to touch your toes, your stomach gently touching your knees, all while keeping your back straight.
 You must not stretch your cheeks. Blink slowly for five seconds, then lie down again.
 Hear this sound for 3 minutes, in your mind.
 After this five-minute relaxation experience, your stress should be much reduced.

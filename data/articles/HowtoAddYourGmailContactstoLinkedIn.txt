 Just open your favorite browser, and type in https://www.linkedin.com. This will bring you to the LinkedIn home page where you will need to log in.;
, Once you’re on LinkedIn’s home page, enter your email address and password into the text fields on the upper right corner of the screen. Click on “Sign In” to access your account.
 Notice that when your profile loads there will be a list of submenus at the top of the screen. Let your mouse hover over the third button, which is labelled “Connections.” It will expand to reveal three options.
 It’s the middle option under Connections. Click on it to load the next page where you can start adding your connections.
 You will find it at the top of the next screen where there will be a list of different email services. The very first one is Gmail. Click on it to select it.


In case your email address isn’t automatically displayed, just below “Gmail” is a text box. Click inside it, type in your Gmail email address, and then click on the blue “Continue” button below.
 Once the page showing all of the connections found using your Gmail address loads, go over the list. There will be a check mark next to every contact found.


If there are people you want to remove from the list, simply click on the tick box next to their names to uncheck them, and these Gmail contacts will not be added to your LinkedIn connections.
 Just click on the blue “Add connections” button at the bottom of the screen. This will send everyone you selected a connection invite.

 People with ice powers are impervious to feeling the pain normal people feel when touching ice and snow. Talk a lot about how snow and ice have no effect on you.


If people are bundling up for a cold day, you could say, “I feel most at home in the snow,” or “The cold has never bothered me.”

, To make people think you have ice powers, run your hands under very cold water or dip your hands in a bowl of ice for no more than 20 seconds. Then, dry your hands and touch a friend’s bare skin.If they recoil or comment on how cold you are, act as if you don’t notice. You could say, “Really? I guess my ice powers are strong today.”

, When people talk about ice or snow, glance at your hands as if they are the source. You can even sigh for effect to draw attention to what you’re doing.


If they comment on a snowy day, for example, you could say, “Sometimes I just don’t know my own power.”

, Keep an eye on upcoming cold weather days. When people talk about the weather, imply that you may have a hand in upcoming wintery storms.


You could say, “I’m making it sn-…I mean, it’s supposed to snow on Tuesday,” or “I’m bringing ic-…I mean, there are going to be ice storms this weekend.”

Oak is probably the most popular quarter sawn timber. The ray flecks that oak reveals when it is quarter sawn are spectacular.
Maple is another wood that displays an attractive appearance when it is quarter sawn.;
, A 12-inch (30 cm) log will give you only a 4- to 5-inch (10 to 12.5 cm) sawn board at the widest.



The bark should be straight so the medullary rays are running straight to the middle of the tree from the outside. These rays are the ribbons that extend vertically through the tree perpendicular to the growth rings and which appear shiny.
The rays at the end of the log should appear to be in a spoke-like pattern from the center. The longer and thicker they are, the more chance you have of hitting them when you saw.
,


Split out the pith (the soft spongy part located in the center of the log).
If possible, remove the sapwood, which is the outer, lighter-colored wood. This is the part of the tree where water and sap flows. It contains moisture and will shrink when it dries. It also is more susceptible to fungus.
,, When you quarter saw, the saw actually splits the medullary ray. A quarter sawn board shows the annual rings mostly at right angles to the surface of the board, whereas a plain sawn board has rings aligned to the surface.

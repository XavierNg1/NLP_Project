 Many cosmetics include chemicals that are considered endocrine disruptors. Endocrine-disruptors are believed to interfere with the endocrine system and negatively affect people and animals. These chemicals are believed to have negative effects on the reproductive system of women.Common endocrine disruptors include BPA, DEHP, phthalates, and parabens.
The CDC states that the result of Phthalate exposure is unknown, though research has pointed to negative effects of phthalates on lab rats. They suggest more information and research is needed., Your skin is porous, which means it will absorb everything you put on it. This includes the chemicals in the cosmetics you use. Your skin has the potential to absorb colors, fragrances, toxic chemicals, and allergens.Choosing products with less chemicals may help reduce the risk of introducing carcinogens into your body. Using cosmetics with less chemicals may help you reduce the risk of causing developmental problems in children.

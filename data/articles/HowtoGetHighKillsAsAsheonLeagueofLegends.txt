 In early game, before you go to your lane for the first time, buy the first three things in the recommended section .(Doran's blade, 1 health potion, trinket.);
, This is very important for building. Just start killing minions.
 Put a trinket in one of the 2 bushes closest to the first enemy turret on bot. If the enemy engages,(Since these are humans and not bots, they will probably start attacking if you get too close) either go with it and try to fight, which I don't recommend, or you can run back and attack from a distance.
 Once you do, get volley(W). This is an important attack.
 So if you are close to killing an enemy, use it.Â Once you hit level 6, Get your Enchanted Crystal Arrow (Ultimate) This will briefly stun and slow the enemy. What I like to do is get the enemy around half health, use the ult, and auto attack or volley if they don't die. Continue charging your volley and q afterwards. Charge the ult too though.
 Although, if it is 3 or four people, you are probably going to die. Just run away and only turn back to fight if your allies are near you.

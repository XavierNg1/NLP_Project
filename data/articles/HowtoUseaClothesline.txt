 You wouldn't want to have to iron your shirts to get those marks out. Irons draw a huge amount of wattage, negating some of your energy savings from using the clothesline in the first place. Alternatively, hang your t-shirts at the seams so that they hang straight (assuming the shirt has seams, and those seams are straight).;
, This allows them to dry quickly without shoulder marks or wrinkles.


Alternatively, a you could hang shirts and t-shirts out on the line on a coathanger. This means no pegs and no marks and minimal ironing.
Or you could try hanging T shirts at the armpits; peg marks won't be seen here.
 If your clothes come out of the washer very wrinkly, lower the spin cycle; they might take a little longer to dry, but they'll dry smoother. Just don't "snap" (sharply shake) the clothes right before hanging them, as this can break the threads in them over time.Some people even put the clothes in a dryer for a just a few minutes before hanging them to air dry., That will make them more secure and less likely to blow off the line. Use more than 2 clothespins for heavy items.
 The weight of the upper part of the pants will help smooth it out while drying, lessening the need for an iron., Sun fades dyes.

 This image shows three types of clothespins. The one on the left, with the pom poms glued to it, is the style you will find most frequently in the stores. They are made in China and extremely cheap. The other two are made in the American Midwest and harder to find. They cost twice as much as the ones from China. The one shown on the extreme right has been in use since 1990. The one in the middle has been used for two years.
Compare the gauge of the metal used in the spring that holds the clip together. The cheap imported ones are better used for art projects (hence the pom poms). Entrust your wet and heavy laundry to the cheap clothespins and you may learn the hard way that they are not trustworthy. Your local Home Depot probably only stocks the cheap ones that you don't want to use. Go to your independent hardware store and ask if they will special order the sturdier ones for you. It takes a few days, but it is worth the wait. Maybe if enough people insist on the better ones, the default item stocked in stores will be the sturdy ones.

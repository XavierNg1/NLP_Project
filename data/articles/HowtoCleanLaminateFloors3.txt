 Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) white vinegar into a 30 to 32 oz (940 to 1000 ml) spray bottle. Fill the rest of the bottle with plain water and shake well to combine.Diluted vinegar is especially useful when your laminate floor has caked on mud or other stains that have caused it to become faded or dull.
Vinegar is too abrasive to be used in its pure form, so you must combine it with water.
You could also create a similar vinegar-based solution by combining 1/3 cup (80 ml) vinegar with 3 squirts of liquid dish detergent and 1 gallon (4 liters) of warm water.
 Spray the vinegar onto the floor in areas no larger than small 1-foot (30.5 cm) squares.









Do not spray the entire floor with the vinegar at once. You need to wipe the solution off the floor almost immediately, and spraying the entire floor at the same time will prevent you from cleaning off the vinegar before it starts to wear away at the protective coating of the laminate.
 Immediately after spraying the vinegar solution on the floor, wipe it off with a damp terry or sponge mop.









You could also use a soft microfiber cloth. Do not use any mops or cloths that are abrasive, however.
Make sure to wring out the mop or cloth before using it. Do not soak the floor with water, since letting moisture sit on it for too long could cause the floor to warp.
 If a large amount of water has been left behind, soak it up and off the floor with a dry microfiber cloth.









If only a small amount of water has been left behind, you may allow it to air dry without fearing damage to your laminate.

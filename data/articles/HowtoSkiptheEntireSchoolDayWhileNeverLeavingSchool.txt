 Walk into the school like it's any other day; be sure to stay calm! Instead of going to your locker, go into one of the bathrooms.;
, Write "OUT OF ORDER" on the piece of paper and tape it to the front of whatever stall you want to hide in. once this is done, simply duck inside the 'out of order' stall and wait.


Try not to make the 'out of order' sign look too similar to your own handwriting or you will get caught. Also if you have seen 'out of order' signs on the stalls before, copy them to further reduce suspicion.
 Wait in your 'out of order' stall until 10 minutes after your first period class has started. Once your class has started, simply walk out of the stall (make sure nobody's around!) and roam for a few minutes.
 When the end of first period comes, what do you do? Grab your stuff (if you brought anything) and sneak back into your out of order stall, then simply wait until the next class begins.
 If they're too far away, such as in another building, then you might want to move closer just in case.
 Keep in mind that nobody had seen you in any of your classes. For example, you could try bringing a wig and a lot of makeup (for girls) or hair gel and borrow some makeup from your mom, sister, girlfriend etc (for guys). Then, simply walk out of the building calmly and either walk home or catch the bus!

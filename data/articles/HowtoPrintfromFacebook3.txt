 Printing a specific screenshot is a good way to limit the amount of information on the page while preserving the visual quality of the subject.


For example, if you just want to print a picture of your status with a couple of comments, using a screenshot is preferable to printing the whole Facebook page.
You can also perform this action on a PC or on a Mac.
 If you're trying to print a photo, you'll first need to open the photo in question.


You can also save the photo in question by tapping ... and then selecting Save Photo.
 If you're using an iPhone, you'll need to press the Home button and the Lock button simultaneously. Android users may have to experiment with different combinations, but you'll generally need to press the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously.

In the case of old, pre-4.0 Android models, you'll press the Power and Home buttons at the same time.
 You can do this in a variety of ways:


Via email as an image attachment
Through Facebook Messenger as an image
By uploading it to a cloud service (e.g., Google Drive)

, Try to save it somewhere easily accessible (e.g., your desktop)., If you're using a Mac, you'll need to open the screenshot instead.
 Mac users will need to hold down Command and tap P. Doing so will bring up the print preferences menu.


If you're using a Mac, you can also click File in the top left corner of the screen and then select Print.
 Depending on what you want your printed product to look like, you may have to alter things like the size, the color settings, and the style of printing per page.
 As long as your computer is connected to a printer and the printer is set up properly, your screenshot should begin printing.

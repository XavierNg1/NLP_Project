 You can use a trick to copy blank text into a Snapchat caption box, increasing the space you have to write your caption. The quickest way to do this is to use the Notes app on your iOS device.;
, Tap the "New Note" button in the lower-right corner to create a new blank note.
 This will create multiple blank lines in your note. Limit yourself to four or five lines.


This trick only works if you enter blank lines. Typing and copying any text will cause this trick to fail.
 A menu will appear when you release your finger.
 A box will appear around the blank lines. Make sure you've only selected blank lines. This won't work if you've selected any text.
 This will copy the blank lines to your iOS device's clipboard.
 Once your text is copied, you can take the Snap you want to add your long caption to. You can tap the shutter button in Snapchat to take a photo Snap, or press and hold it to take a video Snap.
 The caption field will appear over the center of the Snap.
 A menu will appear after releasing your finger.
 This will expand the caption bar to give you multiple lines to work with.
 You can move the cursor to any of the blank lines and begin typing. This allows you to create captions with more than one line.If you pasted anything besides just blank lines, even a single character, you won't be able to go back and add text after pasting. You must paste just blank lines.

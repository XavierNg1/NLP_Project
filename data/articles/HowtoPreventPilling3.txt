 Any fabric can pill, but there are some fabrics that are more prone to developing pills than others. If you find you're often battling with pilled garments, avoid fabrics that pill the most:


Synthetic materials tend to pill more often than those made from natural fibers. Synthetics that are known to pill include polyester, acrylic, and nylon.Blended materials that are made of both synthetic and natural fibers are also prone to pilling.
Wool is one of the natural fibers that is known to pill.
 The looser the weave or knit of a fabric, the more prone it will be to pilling. This is because loose fibers will move around more and rub against each other, leading to pilling. Loose-knit fabrics tend to be more pill-prone, while tightly woven fabrics will have the lease trouble with pills.The harder it is to see through a fabric, the tighter the weave is.
Denim, for instance, has a very tight weave, and almost never pills., Some fabric items, such as bed sheets, is measured by thread count. Typically, the higher the thread count the better the quality, and the longer the threads will be. Longer threads mean less pilling, because there aren't any short threads to come loose, get tangled, and form pills.


While garments aren't usually graded by thread count, the same holds true for higher-quality clothes with longer threads.

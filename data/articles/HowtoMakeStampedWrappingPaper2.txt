 You will be sticking your shapes to this to make a stamp. Don't worry, this stamp will not be permanent. If you want to change the design later on, you can simply peel off the current sheet, and add more foam pieces to it.


If you can't find one, you can use a rolling pin instead, and wrap tape (sticky-side-out) around it., Keep your shapes smaller than 1 by 2Â½ inches (2.54 by 6.35 centimeters). The simpler shapes you use, the better. The color of the craft foam does not matter.


If this is for Christmas wrapping paper, consider cutting Christmas-tree shapes instead, and then using a skewer to poke holes into them to make the ornaments., You don't need to use any glue, because they will stick to the adhesive. The handle part of your lint roller will be the bottom part of your design.Consider adding additional pieces. For example, a piece of baker's twine will add some nice movement to your pattern., Choose some white or brown craft paper or butcher paper. Cut the paper to the size you need, then spread it across your work surface. Tape down the corners, or weigh them down with paper weights.
 You will be rolling this stamp across your paper, so make sure that everything is evenly coated.
 Roll the roller across your paper from side to side. Start at the top of the paper and work your way down in horizontal rows. Re-ink your roller stamp whenever necessary.
 Hand-stamped wrapping paper is perfect for any gift, but it works especially well for handmade gifts for that final, special touch.

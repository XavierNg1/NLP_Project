 As with adding, this method only works if you have like fractions. Like fractions are fractions that have the same denominator, which is the number below the fraction bar. To learn how to subtract fractions with unlike denominators, you can read Add and Subtract Fractions With Unlike Denominators.

For example, 810{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}} and 89{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{9}}} are not like fractions, because they have different denominators.

The fractions 810{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}} and 310{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{10}}} are like fractions, because they have the same denominator (10).
 Your focus will be on the numerators. The numerators are the numbers above the fraction bar.

For example, if you are subtracting 310{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{10}}} from 810{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}}, you would first calculate 8−3=5{\displaystyle 8-3=5}.
 Do NOT subtract the denominators.For example, 810−310=510{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}-{\frac {3}{10}}={\frac {5}{10}}}.
 This should be your final step when working with fractions, whether you are adding or subtracting. In school your final answer usually needs to be simplified, or reduced. To do this, find the largest number that evenly divides into the numerator and denominator.Divide the numerator and denominator by this number to find the simplified fraction. For more information on how to do this, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 5 and 10 can both be divided by 5:5÷5=1{\displaystyle 5\div 5=1}10÷5=2{\displaystyle 10\div 5=2}So, 510{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10}}}reduces to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.

 In one type of CCV, the principal sign of infection is diarrhea. The diarrhea is usually serious, explosive, and runny, but generally doesnâ€™t contain mucous.The feces may be green, yellowish, or even orange. Your dog may also experience vomiting.The diarrhea usually lasts for a few days.
This type of CCV affects the digestive system, and this is the most common type of CCV infection in dogs. Diarrhea from this type of CCV is the most common symptom in dogs.
However, since diarrhea is a general symptom with many possible causes, just because the dog has an upset stomach doesn't mean he has coronavirus.
 In the other type of CCV, respiratory problems are the most common symptoms. The respiratory ailments the virus may cause include coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge.If your dog has other respiratory problems, he may end up with pneumonia.
Respiratory coronavirus is another type of canine coronavirus. This virus affects the respiratory system. This type of CCV is not as common as the digestive type.
 While diarrhea and respiratory problems are the most common symptoms, your dog may present with other symptoms. For example, your dog may become lethargic or depressed. He may also run a fever or have a loss of appetite.These symptoms may point to other illnesses, so you should take your dog to the vet immediately to get him checked out.
The symptoms for parvovirus and CCV are very similar. However, parvovirus is deadly, while CCV is not. You should always take your dog to the vet to get a correct diagnosis.

 Temperatures fluctuate greatly during the fall. Mornings will be chilly, afternoons will be hot, and evenings will be cool again. If you are at work or at school all day long, you may not have the time to change your clothes. The best way to manage this is by wearing layers, which you can take off as the day grows warmer.;
, If you live in a place that gets cooler weather during fall, consider wearing some short-sleeved or long-sleeved shirts; these can be worn under cardigans, or over lacy tank tops. You may also wear turtlenecks and button-up shirts and blouses. If you live in a place that gets warmer weather, you can wear tank tops and short-sleeved shirts. Here are some more ideas:

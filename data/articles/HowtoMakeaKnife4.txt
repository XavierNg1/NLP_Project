 The best way to heat treat a blade is using a forge. For smaller blades, a torch can work as a substitute. For a forge, either a coal or gas forge will work.


Prepare your hardening bath. To cool the knife, you will need to douse it in a hardening bath. What you use depends on the type of steel, but for 01 you can use a bucket of motor oil. You need to be able to completely submerge the blade in the bucket.
 Keep it heating until the metal is orange. Tap it against a magnet to see if it is hot enough. When the steel reaches the correct temperature, it loses its magnetic properties. Once it does not stick, let it cool by air. Repeat this process 3 times.


On the 4th time, instead of letting it air cool, douse it in the oil bath. Be aware that there will be fire when the blade is put into the oil, so be sure that you are properly protected.
When the blade is hardened, it can break when dropped, so handle carefully.
 Set your oven for 425Â°. Put the blade on the middle rack and cook it for 1 hour. Once that hour is up, heat treatment is complete.
 Use increasingly finer grits of paper, going past 220 and up to around 400 grit. Polish the blade if you want some extra shine.

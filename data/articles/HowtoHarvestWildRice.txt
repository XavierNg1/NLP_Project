,, You can use two wooden sticks called knockers; see the video below for the motion needed.
 The arrays of spikelets at the top of the plant harbor caterpillars (called rice worms), small rice hoppers, several species of spiders, ladybird beetles, and other insects. The carpet of rice on the bottom of the canoe will probably be teeming with life.
, The trick here is to dry the rice and make the "husks" brittle, but not burn the rice. It takes a moment to work out the temperature. It's useful to remove the pan every now and again, along with lots of moving and flipping of the rice.


Here are the parched rice grains, which turn a golden brown after being heated (they were very light tan).
, Use the balls of your feet and move your heels left and right, twisting the "hulls" off the grains. For this process, you need something that grips the rice, like braintan (or rubber soles are used a lot today). You do not stamp up and down on the rice (this doesn't accomplish the prying and twisting that is needed to rip the "hulls" off).
, Much of it flies away within the "vacuum" that is created by the downward motion of the bowl, and other, larger material can be cleared by the hand or blown away with a light breath.
 Notice that there are lots of long grains (some broken ones too), but no chaff to get in the way of enjoying the rice.

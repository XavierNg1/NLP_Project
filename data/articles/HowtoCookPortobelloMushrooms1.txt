 Position your oven rack so that it is in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.;
, Use a damp or dry cloth to wipe your mushrooms clean. Remove the stems. You can discard the stems or chop them up and cook them.


You can also slice your mushrooms if you prefer.
To remove stems, hold the cap of the mushroom in your dominant hand and gently twist the stem with your other hand.
You can scrape out the gills with a spoon if you prefer.
 In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 2 1 clove minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot, salt and pepper to taste, and a sprinkling of fresh or dried herbs. Whisk together until mixed.
 Place your mushroom caps (and stems if desired) in a large Ziploc bag. Pour your marinade mixture into the bag and gently work it around the mushrooms. Seal the bag and lay it flat in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. If you marinade your mushrooms for longer, they can soak up more marinade than they can handle and become mushy.


It helps to flip the bag occasionally.
 Using metal tongs, gently remove your mushrooms from the bag and place them on a baking sheet sprayed with non-stick cooking oil. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, use metal tongs to flip the mushrooms and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
 Enjoy as an entr√©e or as a side dish. Serve with any left over marinade as a dipping sauce.


Drizzle with Balsamic vinegar reduction or an oil & vinegar dressing.

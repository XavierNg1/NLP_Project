 If you and your recipients have access to an FTP (file transfer protocol) server, you can upload the file to it and then they can download it through an FTP client of their browser.
 You can use third-party compression programs like WinRAR and 7-Zip to create multi-part archives. The recipient can then download each smaller file and then combine them into one archive, which can then be opened to access the contents. The biggest downside to this method is that the recipient will need the same program that you used to create the parts, as well as some basic knowledge of how to combine the pieces.

 Many bikes have a quick release lever that you simply pull and turn counterclockwise. In addition to the quick release lever, most mountain bikes also have an axle that you’ll slide out after unfastening the quick release. Some bikes have heavy nuts that secure the wheels in place, which you can remove using a wrench., Once you’ve taken the wheels off of the bicycle frame, you’ll need to expose the cartridge that holds the ball bearings. For the front wheel, just twist or pop off the axle endcaps at the hub, or center of the wheel.For the rear wheel, you’ll also need to pull out the freehub body as well. Simply pull it out of the center of the wheel., Use a utility knife to carefully pry off the cartridge seal. Take care not to warp or damage the seal or the cartridge races, which hold the ball bearings in place.Be sure to store the seals and the other parts you removed in a safe place to avoid losing them.
 Use a rag to wipe away as much debris as possible from the cartridge. Grab an aerosol degreaser with a small straw, spray into the cartridge, then wipe away the degreaser. Spray into the cartridge with WD-40 to eliminate any water residue, as the degreaser will contain some water, then wipe away excess WD-40., Liberally repack the cartridge bearing with bicycle grease. A grease gun, which you can find online or at a bike shop, is the best way to access the cartridge’s tight spaces. If you live in a wet area, pack more grease into the cartridge to protect the bearings.Once you’ve cleaned and repacked one wheel, repeat the process on the other.
 Snap the seals back over the cartridge bearings. Reinsert the rear freehub body and pop the endcaps onto the wheel hubs. Realign the wheels with the bicycle frame and fasten them by tightening the quick releases or nuts.

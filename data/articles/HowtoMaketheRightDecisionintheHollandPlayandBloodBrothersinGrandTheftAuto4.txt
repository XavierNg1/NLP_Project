 In this mission, Playboy X want you to kill Dwayne, his old master. The thing is, Dwayne calls you and asks you to do the same thing. Who will you take out? X is to kill Playboy X and D is to kill Dwayne, if I am correct.;
, Killing Playboy X will result in Dwayne being grateful and offers his friendship. This will unlock his ability to send two gang-members to your location almost anytime, AND he will give you the house of Playboy X, the guy who you kill. Not only does this mean an extra place to save and store your car, a secret clothing set in inside there... Killing Dwayne results in Playboy X giving you some money, but cuts all ties to you in the end.
 I suggest Playboy X because Dwayne's ability is almost invaluable to me and we all want an extra safe house in the game right?

, They will meet in a park while you are on top of a nearby building with a sniper rifle. A McReary family member will fall, but which one?

, Killing Francis gets you nothing but Derrick's gratitude. Killing Derrick results in Francis thanking you and giving you a better explanation of the LCPD Most Wanted system and the ability to call off any 1, 2, or 3 star chase.

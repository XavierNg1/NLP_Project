 Hold the glittery items in front of you and spray them liberally with hair spray from an aerosol can. Make sure you get into all of the nooks and crannies of your garments. If you’re dealing with a large amount of glitter, turn the items inside out and spray the interior, as well. Allow the hair spray to dry completely.Avoid using hair spray that doesn’t come in an aerosol spray can, since the mist won’t be fine enough to be effective.
 After the hair spray has completely dried, place the items in your washing machine. Wash them as you normally would. Once the cycle is compete, remove the garments and place them in the dryer. Dry them as usual.Once dry, pull the clothing out and shake them out. They should be glitter-free.


Do not put any other clothing in with your glittery items or you risk transferring the glitter. Wash and dry them by themselves., To prevent the glitter from spreading onto future loads of your clothing, thoroughly clean the inside of both the washer and dryer before doing any more laundry. Get a sponge damp and wipe down the interior parts of your machines. Make sure to get into the nooks and crannies. Clean your dryer’s lint trap thoroughly.If you suspect glitter has fallen into the slot that your lint trap slides into, use your vacuum cleaner with the hose attachment to retrieve it.

 A Moebius cast on requires the same basic items as normal knitting in the round. You will need to have a pair of circular needles that measure at least 32‚Äù. You will also need a ball of yarn.Make sure that your needle size is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Check the yarn label to find the recommended needle size.;
, To start your Moebius cast on, you will need to make a slipknot. You can easily do this by making two loops and pulling one loop through the other.Slide the slipknot onto the needle, and then tug on the tail of the working yarn to tighten the slipknot. Move the slipknot so that it is on the wire., Next, you will need to make a loop in the wire of your circular needles. They should have a natural loop in them, so you can let them go into this shape. When the wire is in a loop, align the needles so that they are right alongside the edges of the loop., With your circular needle wire in a loop, cast one stitch onto your needle so that it is parallel with the slipknot you cast onto your wire., Next, you will need to cast a stitch onto the wire. To do this, take your right needle and bring it into the wire circle and then under the circle to the other side. Then, yarn over, and bring the needle back to its starting position., When the needle is back where it started, loop the yarn over the needle again. Then, you will follow this up by bringing the needle back through the circle again and yarning over again., Keep repeating the sequence of bringing the needle through the circle and under the wire, yarning over, bringing it back up, and yarning over again.Keep going until you have filled the circle with stitches.
If you are following a pattern, then keep going until you have the recommended number of stitches.

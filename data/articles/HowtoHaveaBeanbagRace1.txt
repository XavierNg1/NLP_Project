 This distance can be as long or as short as you desire. Generally, mark a start and end point 20 ft (6 m) away from each other. You might want to decrease this distance for especially young kids, or increase it for adults.You can use a line of tape on floor, cones, or a personal item, like a shoe, to mark your boundaries.;
, An even number of players works best for this style of beanbag race. If that's impossible, the team with less players should choose one player to run twice. Split all those who want to play into two teams., Have both teams line up at one of your marked off lines. This will be your starting line. Place two beanbags, one for each team, on the starting line. Allow a few feet (1 to 1.5 m) of space between beanbags.Smaller sized beanbags are preferred for this race, especially for younger children, as these will be easier to scoop up and hold with the chin.
 When the game starts, one player from each team should pick up one beanbag from the starting line with their chin. They must carry the beanbag with their chin from the start line to the finish line and back again without dropping it.You may want to count down to the start or use your phone to make a starting noise, like a siren, bell, or whistle.
At no point during the beanbag race are players allowed to touch the beanbag with their hands.
Players who drop the beanbag should return to the start line, return the beanbag to the ground, scoop it up in their chin, and try again.
 When players return to the starting line, they should drop the beanbag as close to the starting line as possible. The next player then must pick up the beanbag with their chin and repeat the process until all players have run.
 The first team to rotate through all their players and cross back to the starting line wins. If you'd like to play again, you might want to shuffle players between teams.

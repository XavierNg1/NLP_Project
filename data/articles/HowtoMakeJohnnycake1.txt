 Get out a medium mixing bowl and measure 1 cup (120 g) of white cornmeal and 3/4 teaspoon of salt into it. Use a whisk or a fork to stir the cornmeal and salt together., Bring 1 cup (236 ml) of water to boil. Slowly pour the water into the bowl of cornmeal while you stir it. Keep stirring the mushy cornmeal.You can heat the water in a pan on the stove or use a water kettle.
 Slowly pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk into the cornmeal mixture and stir it well. Set the batter aside while you heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Grease the skillet with bacon drippings or shortening.The batter should be pretty thick, since there isn't very much liquid in it.
You don't need to heat the milk before you add it.
 Once the skillet is hot, scoop a spoonful of batter and drop it into the pan. Press down on each johnnycake, so they flatten to 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Flip them over with a spatula once they're golden brown on each side.You can probably fry half a dozen johnnycakes at a time. If they begin to stick to the skillet, spread more bacon drippings on the pan.
 Fry the rest of the New England johnnycakes in batches. Set them on a serving plate and serve them with:Butter
Maple syrup
Applesauce

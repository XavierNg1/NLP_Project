 Start by cutting the tomato into quarters. Start from the top, slicing down towards the bottom. You'll end up with two haves. Slice each half into two pieces. Now you have quarters of the tomato that you can easily remove the seeds from., The seeds are held on to the top of the tomato by a bit of flesh. You can slice through it, going down towards the bottom. It only takes a little cut to get through it, but be careful of your fingers when cutting it. Use a tiny knife or spoon for this purpose., Now that the flesh is cut, you can simply remove the seeds. Run a knife under them, or use a spoon to scoop them out. You can place them in a strainer over a bowl, so that you can retain the juices for another part of the recipe.

 You will need this extra fabric to make the hem. If you are going to be hemming a skirt lining, plan on making it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the finished skirt.
 Consider using a hem gauge to measure up from the bottom of the skirt to the cutting point. This will help ensure that you are cutting an even amount off all along the hem. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a measuring tape or ruler instead.


If you are cutting a skirt lining, cut it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the skirt itself.
 Try to use a higher thread tension for this. This will help make the hem easier to fold later on. It will also create a sort of guideline for you, so you won't have to make as many measurements.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric.
 Lift the iron up and down as you press; do not move it side to side. You should have a ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) wide hem inside your skirt at this point.
 Because the folding takes up some excess fabric, your hem will be about 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters), as opposed to an exact ½ inch (1.27 centimeters)., If your sewing machine has an edge stitching foot attachment, consider using that instead.The edge stitching foot is often labeled as a #5 foot.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric.
 After this, your skirt is ready to wear.

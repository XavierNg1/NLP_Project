 Stir to distribute evenly. Allow for a few minutes cooking to see how much liquid is soaked up.









Use fresh oats. If the oats are stale, this stale flavor will transfer to the stew, spoiling it.
Ground oats/oatmeal can also be used for a less obvious addition.
Add more oats if needed. Always err on the side of using as less as possible to achieve thickening, to avoid making oat stew. If too many oats are added, they will be too obvious in terms of both texture and taste, and may spoil the stew.

 If your cat is snoring but you can’t tell if it’s a benign snore or the sign of a more serious health issue, take your cat to the vet. Your vet will examine your cat more thoroughly than you can at home and determine if the snoring is a cause for worry., If your vet says that your cat’s snoring is nothing to be concerned about, ask them to suggest medication that you can give your cat. For example, Snore-Stop is used in dogs and cats to lubricate their airways and reduce snoring. Your vet can tell you the best and safest type of medication to stop your cat's snoring.If you do use medication to decrease your cat’s snoring, be sure you follow the directions very carefully. You don’t want to over-dose your cat.
 Snoring in cats can be caused by obesity, so getting your cat’s weight down can help reduce snoring. Your cat is likely overweight if they have a little pouch of fat between their back legs. You can also tell if your cat is overweight if, when you look down at your cat from above, you don’t see a clear indent at their back hips.

If your cat is overweight, you can try feeding them different food – lots of brands have a “healthy weight” formula. You can also encourage more exercise in your cat by playing with it more. Chasing games are especially good at getting your cat’s weight down.

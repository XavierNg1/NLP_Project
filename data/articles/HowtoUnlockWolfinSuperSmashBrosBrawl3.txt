 If you're not interested in playing any of the single player content, you can unlock Wolf after playing 450 Vs. Brawl matches. Once the 450th match has been completed, Wolf will challenge the winner of the match to a fight.
 After you reach the match requirement, Wolf will challenge the victor to a fight. Once you beat him one-on-one, you will be able to select him from the Character Select screen.

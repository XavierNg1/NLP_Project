 You may need a larger lunchbox if you are carrying a lot of food for extended trips away from home (even if your extended trips simply mean long workdays). If you use a lot of hard-sided containers, or if you carry a large water bottle or Thermos, plan for the size of those items, too.;
, Insulation might not be so important if you have a short commute and there's a fridge you can use when you get there. Otherwise, if you want to be able to branch out from peanut butter and jelly, get something insulated and use a freezer pack to keep it cool until lunchtime.
 Do you want to stack things or place them side by side? Do you want everything in one compartment or do you want to keep certain things separate? Do you need a separate pocket for a napkin or fork? Do you need features to contain an ice pack or keep a beverage bottle from tipping?

, Plan to use it for at least a full year.
 Make sure they will make a loaded lunchbox easy, comfortable, and secure to carry (won't pop open or tip over).
 If your soup or drink leaks, or if that nice, squishy peach gets squished, at least the mess will be contained and not all over the rest of your stuff.
 For heavy use, this may mean a hard-sided mini cooler, but many soft-sided lunchboxes have plastic or foil liners that can be wiped down and even removed for cleaning.



For adults, a plain outside will do fine for the office, but choose fun characters or sophisticated quilting or handbag styling if you prefer. If it's been a few years, look again. There are many styles to choose from.
For kids, choose something fun. A favorite cartoon character might be worth the extra expense if it helps convince your younger child that what's inside is fun. For older kids, it's probably best to let them choose the style, so long as it fits everything it needs to.

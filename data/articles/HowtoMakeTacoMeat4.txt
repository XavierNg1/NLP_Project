 Chop the pork into bite-size pieces using a sharp kitchen knife.


Note that the pork might be slightly easier to cut if it is still cold and a little frozen in the center. The pork should be mostly thawed, however.
 Place the pork into a large resealable plastic bag and add the spices, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil, and the lime juice. Turn to coat and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.


The pork can be marinated with only the spices, rather than the oil and lime juice, but adding the oil and juice will allow the flavors to blend into the meat more thoroughly. Acidic lime juice breaks the meat down while the oil moistens it and distributes the flavors.
You could also let the pork marinate in a glass baking dish covered with plastic wrap.
 Heat your remaining 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a large, heavy-duty skillet over medium-high heat.


Allow the oil to heat for several minutes until it begins to glisten.
You could also use corn oil, canola oil, or olive oil instead of vegetable oil.
 Add the cubed pork and marinade to the hot oil and fry until it begins to brown. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and let simmer until all the juices evaporate.


This could take 4 to 8 minutes, depending on how large your pieces of pork are.
Remove from heat once the pork has finished cooking. Serve or store the taco meat when done.

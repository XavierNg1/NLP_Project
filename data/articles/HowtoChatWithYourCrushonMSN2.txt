 Once you get to know each other a little better, teasing will be a great way to flirt with your crush. This will show that you appreciate your crush's quirks and that you don't take life too seriously. Here are some great ways to tease your crush:


If he's really obsessed with a particular hobby, band, or activity, you can poke fun at him about that. If he's obsessed with his guitar, for example, you can say, "How much time did you spend with your girlfriend today?"
If you like sports teams who are rivals, you can tease him about how his team is going to lose that day without being too annoying about it.
Don't take your teasing too far. There's a difference between poking fun at someone and insulting him or her, and it can be hard to tell the difference on the Internet.
Show that you can be teased, too. He'll be impressed that you're confident enough for him to make fun of your foibles too.
 Your crush will be impressed by your quick wit and sense of humor. It can be tricky to show your scintillating sense of humor online, but if you can pull it off, your crush will be impressed. Here are some ways to wow your crush with your wit:


Be quick. If your crush says something clever, say something back as quickly as you can to show that you can play ball.
Be clever. Make a joke about a subject he knows a lot about to show that you're well-read and understand what's going on in the world.
Be sarcastic. A little bit of sarcasm can go a long way. If you're having a hard time in biology class, you can pretend to gush about how much you love dissecting frogs. Your crush will be charmed by you if you set the right tone.

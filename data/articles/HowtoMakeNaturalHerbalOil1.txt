 Fill a clean glass, lidded jar with your chosen herb. You should pack the herb relatively loosely in the jar. Fill the jar with your base oil. Make sure to cover all of the herbs with the oil. Leave half of an inch at the top of the jar. Cover the jar tightly.Pickling or preserving jars work very well for making your own herbal oil.
Dried herbs work best because they do not contain water that can cause mold. If you don’t use dried herbs, let them wilt for about 12 hours, then crush them with a mortar and pestle before putting in the oil.;
, Place the jar on a shelf where it gets plenty of sunlight during the day. Let the mixture sit for two weeks, mixing it by turning it upside down and then right side up twice a day. After two weeks, add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the oil and mix.Let it sit on the sunny shelf for two more days. Mix it by inversion twice a day.
 After it has set for 16 days, the mixture is ready to pour out and use. Don’t use the oil straight from the jar. You need to filter it first. Pour the oil through a cheesecloth into a new clean glass, lidded jar. This catches all of the herbs, leaving you with just herbs.Store the jar in a cool, dry, and dark place.
If you want a stronger oil, add new herb to the already-infused oil and repeat the process once more.

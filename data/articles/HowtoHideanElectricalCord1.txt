 One of the easiest ways to hide an electrical cord is by positioning it behind furniture. Try hiding an electrical cord behind a desk or dresser. You can also easily hide an electrical cord by positioning it behind a bookcase.
 If you need to hide cords that are close to the floor, try creating a secondary baseboard in front of your existing baseboard. You can then hide the electrical cord between the two baseboards.For example, you can create a secondary baseboard that looks like a white picket fence, position it in front of your existing baseboard, and hide the cord between the two baseboards.
 You can also hide an electrical cord with tape. Try using clear packing tape to affix the cord to an area that is not the focal point of the room, like the leg of a chair or the back of a table. Then run the electrical cord down the length of the leg toward the electrical outlet., If you are concerned about cords dangling from a mounted appliance, like a television or computer screen, try drilling a hole below the base of the appliance. Then drill a hole near the floor or electrical outlet and feed the cord through the holes.

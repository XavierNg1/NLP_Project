 A campaign is basically composed of five departments: political, communications, fundraising/financial, data, and field. If you aspire to work for a campaign, you’ll need to learn a skill that is transferable to one of those departments.Field operations manage volunteers, register voters, forge relationships with community leaders, and conduct get out the vote efforts. Many operatives begin their careers in field, so it’s a good area to apply for if you have no experience. If you’re good with the public, are totally committed to the candidate, and can work eighty hours a week, field might be for you.
Communications crafts messages, writes press releases, ads, and speeches, and deals with the media generally. If you have a background in writing or journalism, communications might be the job for you.
Fundraising and financial departments bring in the money and help decide how it will be spent. They find and research donors, manage the candidate’s “call time,” or fundraising calls, and help create budgets.
The data department uses demographic, economic, polling, and population data to tell the campaign where the voters are, and which voters to target first.Political mainly gathers endorsements and surrogates. Unless you have established relationships with governmental and party officials, you may have to work a few campaign cycles before you move into political.
 The best way to stay abreast of openings on campaigns is to connect with your local party organization. Most of the time, the party is going to be aware of a candidate’s run before anyone else, and candidates will usually ask party leaders for staff recommendations.
 Once you find a position you are interested in, polish your resume and apply. As with any job, it helps to have connections and references within the sector, and you want to put your best foot forward when you submit a cover letter and go on an interview.

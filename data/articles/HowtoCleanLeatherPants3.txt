 Before you start to wear your new leather pants, take a moment to spritz them with a leather protectant product. These usually come in small spray bottles are available at most clothing stores. Just one pass with the spray will protect your pants, to a limited extent, for an entire season.As with any product, test out your protectant on a small area of your pants before applying it all over.
 Lay your pants out on a towel. Take a bit of the conditioner into your hands, it will have a soapy feel, and gently rub it into the surface of your pants. Keep rubbing in small circles until the product is absorbed entirely. Repeat this process every month to keep your leather pants feeling soft and flexible.Make a homemade version of leather conditioner by mixing three parts of olive oil with two parts vinegar in a small bowl., Instead of folding, hang your pants by their straps on a wooden hanger. If you are worried about dust, place them inside of a cotton garment bag. If they are hanging next to other clothes, keep them away from dark fabrics, as they may discolor the leather., Call ahead to your dry cleaner to check if they accept leather goods. If they do, when you bring in your pants make sure to point out any stains or areas of concern. Also, if your pants have a matching top or other accessory, get those cleaned as well.Some dry cleaners are considered leather specialists. This means that they follow practices that are less likely to damage your pants, but this extra level of service may result in a higher bill.If you do point out a stain, it is even better if you can tell your cleaner where the stain came from and how long it has been there.

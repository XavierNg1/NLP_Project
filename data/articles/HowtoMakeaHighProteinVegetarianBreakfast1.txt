 First, melt your butter in the microwave or a small saucepan on the stovetop. Add the milk and maple syrup once melted. Whisk until everything is evenly mixed., In a large mixing bowl, stir your buckwheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together until they are evenly combined. Pour in the wet ingredients and repeat. Add more milk if desired to thin the batter if it’s too thick for your taste., First, crack the egg over the rim of a small bowl. Separate and discard the yolk before pouring the egg white into the bowl. Whisk the egg white with an electric mixer, then add it to your batter and fold it in., Coat the bottom of a skillet with cooking oil or butter. Turn the heat to medium. Once the oil heats up, pour ¼ cup of batter (59 ml) into the skillet for each pancake. Let the bottom of each pancake cook until holes begin to break along its top. Flip the pancake over and cook the other side for roughly 15 to 30 seconds.

 Put an ice pack or ice inside a towel and apply the towel to the area of your head or neck that hurts. Leave it there for 10–15 minutes at the most.Alternatively, you can apply an ice cube directly to the muscle that hurts and move it along the muscle, back and forth, for a little while. Because you’re using ice, don’t hold the ice on your skin in one spot for a long period of time or you may damage your skin or nerves.
Applying an ice pack to the base of your skull and top of your neck can help headaches radiating around the front of your head and face.
 Moist heat, like a wet towel or water directly on your body from a shower, is recommended over dry heat, like a heating pad. You can apply the moist heat to any area of your face or neck that is in pain for 15–20 minutes.Heat doesn’t always work as well as cold because it can cause inflammation in some areas, rather than reduce it. If you don’t find heat works for you, switch to cold.
 Sometimes the best outcomes result from using both heat and cold at the same time. One such method is to apply a cold pack to the base of your head or the top of your neck, plus a moist, warm towel on your upper back and lower neck area. To add even more variety, put a cold pack on the right side of your face and a hot towel on the left side of your face — all at the same time. Switch the hot and cold items on your face every five minutes. Do this for up to 20 minutes total.

 If you need a new eye doctor, contact your insurance company for a list of covered providers in your area. Alternately, ask your general practitioner for a recommendation. You can also ask your family, friends, or coworkers if they recommend their eye care provider.Finally, you can visit the website of a professional organization of eye doctors such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology (http://www.aao.org/) or the American Optometric Association (http://www.aoa.org/?sso=y).
 You will need to be able to discuss your needs and concerns with your doctor in clear and accurate terms. Read the information about LASIK or related eye surgery that is provided by reliable sources such as the Mayo Clinic or research institutes.


Avoid using any sites that are actively advertising for LASIK eye surgery when you conduct your research. Since they are advertising the procedure, they are not neutral sites.
 You will need to have a doctor examine your eyes to confirm that you are a good candidate for the procedure. A regular eye care provider will be able to give advice for your particular needs, and she may be able to recommend an experienced surgeon to perform the procedure.


Pay careful attention to what your doctor tells you. Your initial research will help you discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives to LASIK surgery intelligently and effectively with the eye doctor. It will not replace the doctorâ€™s expertise.
 Check that your surgeon is certified. Before committing to the procedure, also ask the doctor who will perform the surgery questions that establish their knowledge of the procedure: how many LASIK surgeries have you performed? is my refractive error within the advised range? am I in the best life-stage to get this procedure?


Beware if a doctor provides vague figures about how many procedures have been performed at a medical center. Make sure your doctor tells you the number of LASIK surgeries they have performed personally.

 After transplanting, ideal temperatures range between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 27 degrees Celsius). Bell peppers also need plenty of light to grow. A sunny window may accomplish both requirements, but even the sunniest window may not be enough. Fluorescent grow lights generally work much better. Keep the lights no less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the top of the plant for 14 to 16 hours each day., Thoroughly soak the soil every few days, allowing the top of the soil to become just barely dry in between each watering.
 Bell peppers grow best in soils with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.Add ground agricultural lime to the soil if you need to increase the pH. Add compost or fertilizer to the soil if you need to decrease the pH.
 Using a cotton swab, gently rub pollen from the anthers on a male flower. Swab the pollen into a female flower, applying it onto the large pollen-collecting center stalk, called a "stigma." Pollinating the pepper plant will increase your yield.
 Once they reach a usable size and an appropriate color, the peppers should be ready to harvest. Use sharp, clean shears to make a clean cut, leaving a stem that is about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in length.

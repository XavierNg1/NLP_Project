 Look at pictures of Sir Isaac Newton and study his face carefully.;
, If you have natural wavy hair, you're in luck you don't need to use the iron curlers or straighteners. Skip this step.
 Skip this step if your hair is naturally brown, gray, or white. This step is optional since there are a few pictures of Isaac Newton with blonde or black hair. If your hair is red, dye it brown, gray or white.
 Sir Isaac Newton wore: Egg white blouse- crumbled. Black haired over coat that went down to his shin. Hairy gray pants that went down to the top of his ankle. You must wear something similar to the 1700s fashion. Wear a buttoned coat, get a powdered wig (optional), wear black buckle shoes, a white ruffled shirt, long white stockings up to your knees, and shorts up to your knees.
 In the earlier part of his life, Newton was a deeply introverted character and fiercely protective of his privacy. Even in his maturity, having become rich, famous, laden with honors and internationally acclaimed as one of the world's foremost thinkers, he remained deeply insecure, given to fits of depression and outbursts of violent temper. The term “darkness” can be applied to much of Newton's personality. Adjectives that have been used to describe facets of his personality include “remote”, “lonely”, “secretive”, “introverted”, “melancholic”, “humorless”, “puritanical”, “cruel”, “vindictive” and, perhaps worst of all, “unforgiving”.
 Don't laugh or smile and don't be mean to others. Draw a line in the middle of your chin for a dimple. Isaac Newton has a dimple on his chin.
 Isaac Newton was left handed.

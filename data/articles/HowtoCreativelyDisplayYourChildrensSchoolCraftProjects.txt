 Let them know that they are free to hang anything here, using anything to hang the items with. You can fix the paintwork and plaster after they grow older! It is very easy to invite creativity into your living space when you dedicate one wall to this.;
, Use rope and clothes pins to make a hanging tree. Tie the top of the rope to the ceiling and let it dangle. Hang the craft from the rope using the clothes pins or other similar items. This can be placed anywhere in the house that you feel is suitable, or even in several places.
 Keep their artwork forever by decoupaging it to a storage container that is always on display. If the box is in their room, they will love seeing their own artwork on it. And as they grow older and less interested, it becomes a wonderful keepsake for you.
 Think about where children spend most of their time. The playroom, their bedrooms, and even the tree house or fort. Great places to hang, sit or otherwise display their own handiwork.
 Paintings make great gift wrapping for special family members. Small crafts make great Christmas tree ornaments or other special occasion displays.
 Take photos of their paintings, drawings and crafts and turn these into iron-on transfers. What prouder way to display your children's prowess than to wear it?!

, There are t-shirts, mugs, rugs, and other items that can be turned into your child's canvas. Send images of your child's artwork or craft to such a company (search online) and have it turned into an endurable keepsake.
 This is especially great for showing your children's artwork at work. Take photos, upload them into a screensaver program and show off!

, All craft and artwork created by your children has potential for display. You just need to reach into your creative self to work out how, rather than viewing it as more dust-collecting or as something that is for keeps but only in the bottom drawer. Good luck!

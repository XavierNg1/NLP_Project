 Not all herbs grow well indoors. Short-lived annuals like coriander, dill and garden cress, do not produce continuous crops and are not well suited for indoor growth.


Consider the following varieties of herbs that will yield healthy plants indoors: Grolau chives (Allium schoenoprasum), Fernleaf or dwarf dill (Anethum graveolens), English mint (Mentha spicata), Greek oregano (Origanum Vulgare hirtum), Blue Boy rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), Creeping savory (Satureja repandra), Broadleaf thyme (Plectranthus amboinicus), Spice Globe basil (Ocimum basilicum minimum) and Dwarf Garden sage (Salvia officinalis compacta).;
, How many herbs you grow should be determined by how much you will use them. If you use rosemary springs in roasted chicken every week or make homemade pesto from basil leaves regularly, you will need larger quantities of those herbs. If you only use a scattering of oregano on an occasional pizza, then 1 plant should suffice.
 Many potted perennial herbs will provide continual harvests throughout the winter when provided with the right growing conditions. Consider bringing in perennial herbs like rosemary, sage and tarragon to grow indoors.


Avoid transplanting perennials herbs planted directly in the garden. The transplant shock may kill the plants that normally would return the next growing season. Only choose perennial herbs in pots to grow indoors during the winter months.

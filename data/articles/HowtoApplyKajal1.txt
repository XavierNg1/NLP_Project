 To prevent the kajal from smudging, remove excess makeup, oil, and sweat from your eyelids and the skin around your eyes.









Use makeup remover to clean off any eye makeup left from a previous application.
Dip a cotton pad in cold water and brush it over your eyelids. Doing so should help dry the skin without the use of harsh chemicals while also tightening the pores. Allow the water to dry naturally., If you have notably dark circles beneath your eyes and you wish to create a cleaner look, apply concealer to the area before applying the kajal.









Choose a concealer close to your natural skin tone and lightly dab it onto the dark patches beneath your eyes. Blend it into the skin, working carefully to avoid getting it into the eyes themselves.
 Kajal comes in a variety of forms. Thin pencil sticks are the easiest to use, but you can also find powders, liquids, and gels. Regardless of what you choose, invest in long-lasting waterproof formulas since they'll be less likely to smudge.


For subtle or controlled looks, a kajal pencil typically works best. Sharpen the tip of the pencil periodically to keep the lines thin.
If you want to create a thicker look, you may wish to consider traditional kajal powders that need to be applied with your fingers. Liquid and gels can also create a heavier look, and the applicator wands they come with are typically easier to control.

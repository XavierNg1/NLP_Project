 The acronym DISH is a tool to recognize signs of cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) in cats, starting with the letter "D" for disorientation. Observe your cat's behaviour for things such as aimless wandering, staring at walls, looking around with confusion, or staying in a corner as if it is stuck. Disorientation might also include loss of balance and falling., For the “I” in the acronym DISH, observe your cat’s interactions to note irregularities or changes. A normally independent cat suddenly becoming clingy may be a sign of cognitive dysfunction, as would a normally affectionate cat avoiding the opportunity to cuddle. If your older cat looks at you with confusion or seems to not recognize you, CDS is a likely reason. , A common symptom of CDS is an altered sleep pattern. If your cat normally sleeps through the night, note if it is demonstrating night owl tendencies instead. This might be evident if your cat sleeps all day, or if it makes noise or vocalizes loudly while you are trying to sleep., The loss of your cat’s long-held housetraining skills may be a sign of CDS. The most obvious example would be your cat’s use (or non-use) of its litterbox. Note repeated incidences of your cat eliminating outside of its litterbox, particularly if the litterbox is clean.

Apply 3 or 4 inches (8-10 centimeters) of mulch to your garden bed.If you are container gardening, you can use 3-5 centimeters in your pot.
 Get two buckets of the same size. Drill twelve holes into the base of one, and then put it into the other bucket. Put food scraps into the top bucket, and the fermented liquid will drip into the bottom bucket. You can use the liquid to fertilize your plants, and add the food scraps as compost to your garden. In this way, you can improve the moisture and health of your garden soil., Add worm castings and compost to your garden soil to improve its structure and ability to retain moisture. Your garden soil will stay moist and retain nutrients for longer with the regular addition of compost.

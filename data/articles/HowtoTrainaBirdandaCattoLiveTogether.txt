,,, If the cat jumps up to the cage and tries to attack the bird, spray water at the cat. If the cat just looks up or does nothing, do not do anything.


Since cats dislike water, they will realize that they will get "punished" if they try to attack.
Do not pull your cat away when/if they attack. The bird will not get hurt, and the cat needs to stay there in order to learn.
Even if the cat doesn't do anything, still keep your guard up.
 Be patient, as this may take anywhere from 2 minutes to even 30 minutes. It all depends on what your cat does.


Refill the spray bottle if you have to, but still keep an eye on the two.
 This step needs two people: one to hold the cat and one to bring the bird.
 If the cat tries to attack once the bird arrives, spray him/her with water and press the stop button on the leash.


Make sure the bird does not fly: try calming the bird and holding it's feet.
, Then release the cat without a leash in front of the bird.


Remember, if the cat lunges, go back to keeping him/her on a leash.
Never leave the two together unsupervised.
 With the training and your reassurance that the cat won't attack, they should be fine together.


The full course of the training process should take about a week and a half.

 Your lower abdominals are a critical part of being able to row faster and longer. Use workouts like yoga and pilates as well as traditional core exercises like pushups, crunches, and leg lifts to work out your lower abdominal muscles., Stand with your feet shoulder width and hold the bar on your chest so that it runs under your chin. Front squats will develop your core strength, upper back, and quadriceps, which are all muscles that are heavily used while rowing.Keep your elbows high to maintain good posture.
The bottom portion of the front squat resembles the position you're in during the catch.
 Deadlifts are great because they mimic the action that you do during the drive. Your knees are bent and must drive up. You finish the lift with your shoulders and back, which are the same muscles you utilize when you row., The pulldown machine will work out your shoulders, back, and arms. This is a great exercise to help build power and explosiveness in the final stages of your drive. Grab onto the pulldown grips and pull them down in front of to your chest and down to your waist.

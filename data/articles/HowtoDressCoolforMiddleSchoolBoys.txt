 There are many different "cool" styles such as punk, preppy, surfer, etc. Your best option is to just add a touch of your favourite style to a basic jeans and t-shirt outfit. For example, you can add sunglasses and a beachy shirt for a surfer style.;
, Now that you have the style you like, add to it. If you like emo, but also if you like the color blue, why not merge them together? Don't be afraid to be original!

, If you are unsure if you like the style or not, don't be afraid to ask a friend on his/her opinion. If you don't need someone's opinion, then look at yourself in the mirror. Do you think that hip-hop isn't really for you? Are you pressured into dressing like the others just to fit in? If you think that you are pressured, then that style isn't for you.
 Some items that will suit anyone and make great editions to your wardrobe are:

Slim fit jeans. Make sure these fit perfectly, not too baggy or tight.
Basic T-shirts. These can be plain or have a graphic design, whichever you prefer.
A good quality hoodie. This is something that will be so useful in colder weather. Choose a color like grey, navy or burgundy that will match any outfit.
At least two button down shirts. One smart one in a color such as navy, and one plaid flannel.
A nice pair of sneakers (not the same pair as the ones you wear for sport!). These can be worn everyday. You will probably want a stylish brand such as Nike or converse.
 Belts, sunglasses, watches and hats particularly snapbacks, can look good. Just stick to one accessory at a time though. You don't want to over do it.
 Try to match it because it matters a lot in making a good outfit. Try to match one or two colors at first and then slowly start to experiment. Find colors which you like and you think will suit you. An example of a good match is as follows:


White T-shirt, unzipped black zip up hoodie (sleeves rolled up), dark blue jeans and black vans, add a black or white watch if you want.

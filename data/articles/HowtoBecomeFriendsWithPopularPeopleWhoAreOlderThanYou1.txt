 Popular kids are usually well dressed,so your chances of befriending popular kids will increase if you look cool yourself. Spend some time online, with magazines, and making observations in day-to-day life to see what the popular kids are wearing, and try your best to dress similarly.


Keep in mind that trendy clothes or devices alone will not win you friends or bring you long-term happiness.Pick cool styles that express who you are rather than trying to wear all the latest high-priced fashions to look just like someone else.
If you don't have money for a whole new wardrobe, don't worry. At vintage stores and thrift stores, you can often find cool clothes at a fraction of the price of buying them new. This can also help you develop a style of your own that is unique, but still hip and appealing.;
, It's a cliche, but it's true: a lot of popular people are athletes.If you are at all athletic, consider trying out for a sport you like. This will help you fit in better with the popular kids, both your age and older.
 Research shows that there are two kinds of popular kids--those that are friendly and do well in school, and those that are mean and do poorly. The research also shows that the "bad" popular kids don't stay popular as they get older (i.e. in high school).If you want to hang out with older, popular kids who actually STAY popular, you want to fit in with the successful ones. So, try your best in school so you can fit in with the people who will have lasting popularity.
 Spend some time learning what the older, popular kids are into, outside of fashion. Pick up some magazines and look online to find out what the hottest trends are. For example:What music are they listening to?
What TV shows or movies are they watching?
What apps or social media sites are new and popular?

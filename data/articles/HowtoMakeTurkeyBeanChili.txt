 Add the onions and allow them to start cooking for a couple of minutes.;
, Cook, stirring regularly, until the meat is no longer pink.


It isn't essential, but if desired, drain off any extra fat/juices once the meat is cooked.
 Stir it up so everything is evenly mixed.


If you have real stock on hand, feel free to use a cup of that instead of the powdered bouillon.
If you're a huge fan of tomato flavor, you can increase the amount of tomato in the recipe, up to double; however, if you're adding more tomato, you may want to skip the bouillon to avoid watering down the mixture too much.
 Make sure that all the beans, except the chili beans, are rinsed and drained; you want the chili beans to keep their spicy flavor, so dump in the liquid for that can, too.


If you love beans, feel free to add other varieties or extra cans; chickpeas/garbanzo beans and white beans also work well in this recipe.
 This combination makes a medium to spicy chili, so if you're looking for a more mild flavor, start with half the amount of jalapeno and spice and work your way up, tasting along the way.


If you accidentally over-spice, a dash of lime juice can help even out the flavor again, and it adds a little zesty flavor without adding heat.
 Then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or more. As long as you keep an eye on it to prevent it drying out, you can keep it simmering for a lot longer without harm, especially if you prefer less liquid in your chili.
 Offer your guests some grated cheese, sour cream, and chopped green onions to go with the chili. Serve alongside some crusty bread or on top of rice, or pour a little over oven-baked fries and top with cheese for some homemade chili cheese fries.

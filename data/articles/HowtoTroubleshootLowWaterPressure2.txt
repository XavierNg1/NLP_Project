 Shaped like a bell, the PRV is usually located on the line where it enters the home or office.


Adjust it to see if it affects your overall water pressure. There will be a screw on the valve. To increase water pressure, tighten it by turning it clockwise. To decrease water pressure, loosen the adjusting screw by turning it counterclockwise. Replacement may be necessary if the valve has failed or broken. These can be purchased at hardware or plumbing supply stores., This valve can influence water pressure, even if it has been turned slightly.Most homes and buildings have a master shut-off valve. This is located near the PRV valve or in a separate box near the water meter.
This valve can shut off water to the entire home, and restrict flow if it is slightly closed.
Turn the valve so it is completely open.
 If the problem is resolved, the source was likely the PRV valve or water shut-off valve


If you are still experiencing water pressure issues, you may have a water leak. Water leaks are a common source of low water pressure in a house.
You should consult a plumber to fix a water leak or mineral buildup in your water lines.

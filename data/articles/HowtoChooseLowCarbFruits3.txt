 Fruit preserves containing 100% fruit are a great way to get low-carb fruit into your diet.Most fruit preserves have a ton of added sugar, as this is what helps preserve the fruit and keep it from molding. Look specifically for preserves with no added sugar, as this will significantly lower the amount of sugars (and therefore carbs).
 Fruit juices often contain sugar at rates equal to soda or other sweet drinks. Juice pressed from whole fruit as well as juice made from concentrate contains high levels of sugar (which means high levels of carbs), and is therefore not a good option if you want to choose low-carb fruits.If you want to continue enjoying fruit-flavored beverages, squeeze a lime or lemon wedge in a glass of sparkling water for a fizzy, fruity treat.
Alternately, you could dilute a fruit juice by mixing an equal portion of water and fruit juice together. This will reduce the carb levels of the juice., More sugar means higher carb levels. Check the packaging of any canned, prepackaged, or dried fruit, and develop a preference for dried or canned fruits that are labeled “no added sugar” or some similar commitment.Canned fruit packed in syrup has higher sugar levels than fresh fruit. Canned fruit packed in light syrup has less sugar than canned fruit packed in regular syrup, but still more than fresh fruit. The best canned fruit will be packed in water or 100% juice.Dried fruits often contain added sugar, but not all dried fruits contain added sugar.
Prepackaged low-carb fruits are a great choice, but be sure that they do not have added sugar.

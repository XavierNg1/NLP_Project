 Some Pokémon must evolve at a certain time. Below is a list of Pokémon that evolve via happiness, organized by evolution method.


Level up with high happiness: Golbat, Chansey, Pichu, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Azurill, Buneary, Munchlax, Woobat, Swadloon, Alola form Meowth, Type: Null.
Level up with high happiness, during the day: Riolu, Budew, Eevee -> Espeon.
Level up with high happiness, at night: Chingling, Eevee -> Umbreon.;
, A Luxury Ball will increase certain happiness-increasing effects by 1. In Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Sun, and Moon, the Friend Ball is also a good option, as it sets the caught Pokémon to 200 happiness.
 The Soothe Bell will increase all happiness gains of that Pokémon by 50%.
 You Pokémon will gain happiness after a certain number of steps, which vary by game. Using the bicycle will speed this up (or in the case of Sun and Moon, the Tauros Charge).
 The EV-lowering berries are Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, and Tamato, and they will lower EVs in a certain stat. The vitamins are HP Up, Protein, Iron, Calcium, Zinc, and Carbos, which increase EVs, as well as Rare Candy, PP Max, and PP Up, though these are rarer. Vitamins increase happiness less than the berries.
 A Pokémon's happiness will be increased when it levels up in battle. However, if it faints, happiness will be decreased by 1, so be sure to heal it or switch it out when at low health.

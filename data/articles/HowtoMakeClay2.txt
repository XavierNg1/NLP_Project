 You will need 4 cups (560 grams) of flour and 1 Â½ cups (420 grams) of salt. If you wish to add some glitter, you can do so now. You can use fine, scrapbooking glitter or chunky, craft glitter, but the fine glitter will be easier to mix. You can add as much or as little glitter as you like.
 Before you add the water to the flour and salt, you will need to decide whether or not you want your clay to be colored. If you want some colored clay, add a few drops of food coloring to the water and stir it with a spoon to mix it all together.
 You will need 1 cup (225 milliliters) of water. Stir the mixture until everything is just combined into a dough-like texture.
 The cooking oil will help make the clay soft and prevent it from becoming crumbly.You will need 2 to 4 tablespoons, depending on how dry and crumbly your clay is.
 Using your hands, press, squish, and knead the mixture until it turns into a dough. If it is still too dry, add a little bit more cooking oil.
 You can use this clay to make fun shapes again and again.
 If you want to play with this clay later, put it inside an air-tight container. You can also sculpt a figurine and let the clay dry completely overnight.

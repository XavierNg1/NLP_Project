 The best way to prepare to compete on the show is to be familiar with the show itself. If you are selected to be on the show, you'll want to be 100% familiar with the structure of the game, the rules, etc. Practice for your own turn by guessing along with the contestants and seeing if you can win.


In addition to watching the show, do puzzles like you were asked to do at the audition. Keep your brain fresh to stay mentally prepared.
 The Wheel of Fortune website offers several online games you can play to practice and hone your skills. You want to be ready if you get picked to be on the show, so try to practice a little every day.


There are also a number of Wheel of Fortune games available for virtually any console. You can literally have Wheel of Fortune going 24/7.
 Contestants have 18 months to make an appearance on the show. Sometimes you'll be on in a few weeks or months, sometimes it will take over a year. They try to get a good geographic cross-section of contestants represented each week.
 They're free! If you're in the LA area, spruce up your vacation with a trip to see Pat and Vanna. It's inside Sony Entertainment studios, formerly home to the historic MGM studios.


You can write in, go online, or call. And remember: never pay for tickets. Some people try to sell them, but it's a scam. Real Wheel of Fortune tickets are always free.

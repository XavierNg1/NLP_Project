 You have to learn everything you can about the live music business before you can even think about how to break into it. Get to know its various aspects. If you’re interested in working for a band, you’ve probably gone to a good amount of shows. Have a conversation with everyone who will talk to you, from the venue tech crew to the band’s production team., What are you good at? Are you business minded, great with numbers and fine print? Are you a technical kind of person, who’s great with the audio and visual stuff? Do you love reaching out to people and telling about them something you’re passionate about? Decide what skills you have that line up with a band’s needs: management, production, and marketing/promotions.
 Sometimes jobs in live music require a college degree. Figure out what you want to do, then enroll in classes if a design or business degree is required. Focus on gaining an apprenticeship if your chosen field requires technical training rather than formal education.

 Put one foot in front of the other and rock your hips forward and back. Give the Groove hoop a firm push and throw it across your waist, remembering to keep your hips moving forward and back. Now you are groovehooping.;
, To perform your first trick, keep the hoop going with the rhythm of your hips and start walking. Take small steps around in a small circle so that you are turning inside the circle and its turning on you. Stop walking and focus on keeping the hoop spinning.
 Start groovehooping and when you are ready spin around in a circle lifting one leg to spin back to your starting position. Remember to keep your hips moving! This trick stalls the hoop and looks impressive too.
 Now it's time to let your imagination flow. There are no rules with groovehooping. Try all the dances and moves you can think of.

 Police officers may only set up roadblocks and checkpoints for special situations beyond the normal needs for law enforcement.These “special situations” include when police officers are concerned with:Drunk drivers (the most common)
Border security
Apprehending specific criminal suspects

, If law enforcement officers set up a roadblock, they may stop all cars that drive to the roadblock, random cars, and/or cars matching a description of a vehicle involved in a crime. Officers are not supposed to profile the driver or passengers.


If you are stopped and you believe that the officers are profiling you for any reason, continue to cooperate with the officers and call a lawyer as soon as you can.
 If you are stopped at a roadblock, you should act the same way as you would have if you had been pulled over for a traffic violation.


If law enforcement officers have set up a roadblock, they can stop every vehicle and ask for documentation or request that every individual take a sobriety test. In this situation, you cannot refuse to take the sobriety test without being arrested.While the officers do not have probable cause to suspect that you have been drinking, they do not need it in this situation because they are testing everyone.
 Sometimes, the police will set up a roadblock and not stop anyone. Instead, they will see who diverts and gets off the road at an exit right before the roadblock. If the police see you get off the road at an exit right before a roadblock, they may stop you.Avoiding a roadblock is probable cause for the police to stop you. However, because the police are not stopping you for the specific purpose of the roadblock (i.e. drinking), they may ask you why you avoided the roadblock without automatically asking you to take a sobriety test.

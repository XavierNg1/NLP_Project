Go shopping. Even if don’t want to spend a lot of money, take your time perusing stores, and treat yourself to something small that you’ve been wanting. In some areas during statutory holidays (e.g. Christmas and Easter) you may be out of luck as many venues will be closed, so check at least the day before, if not sooner.
Go a movie or a play. Going to see a movie or show alone can be a fun experience. Pick something that you really want to see.
Take a class. Use your holiday as an opportunity to try something new like swing dances or painting. Check community newspapers for a calendar of classes and events during your holiday. Use sites like Groupon to find discounted classes in your area., Take the time out of your holiday to pamper yourself.


If you’ve been putting it off, get a new haircut or color. This will make you feel your best.
Get a luxury treatment you wouldn’t normally, like a massage or a facial.
If you don’t want to pay for a treatment, you can create your own spa day.
 Whether you want to go out to your favorite restaurant or cook at home, splurge a little on food.


This could be as simple as stocking up your fridge before your holiday, so you don’t have to worry about going to the grocery store.
Get a little fancy. Make a cheese plate, and buy a nice wine just for you.Or, just spend some time plating up your favorite junk foods instead of eating them straight from the bag.
Even though you’re on your own, clean up right after you eat to keep your holiday and space relaxing.

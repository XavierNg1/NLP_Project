 You can adjust this line to get different face shapes for different types of characters.
 Again, your eyes will vary depending on the character you're drawing. Girls/young children/heroes/protagonists' eyes tend to be larger while boys/ tomboys/adults/ and antagonists have narrow eyes; but it's really up to you. Eyes are one of the most important features of manga, they say a lot about the person and their mood. Drawing the eyes narrowed shows thoughtfulness/ anger, drawing them bigger and rounder with bigger pupils shows surprise. Eyes that are drawn wide open with small pupils shows fear.
 A straight or curved nose, a small mouth. Boys noses are bigger: when showing happiness they're usually high up and rounded, slanted eyebrows show anger, upwards slanted eyebrows show surprise etc.
 This is the fun part! Anime/manga hair is very unique and you can make it however you want.

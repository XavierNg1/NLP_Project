 This is a virtual storefront that allows you to search and download applications, games, and themes for your device. If you don’t already have BlackBerry World on your phone, it’s easy to get:


Open the web browser on your device. The web browser icon looks like a globe with an arrow circling it.
Go to the BlackBerry World site to download the app. Scroll to the bottom and click "download.";
, In BlackBerry World, select “apps.” Type “Skype” into the search bar. Select the official Skype app from the results.


The Skype icon looks like a blue cloud-like circle with an S inside.
 Click “download” and the process will begin automatically.
 Once the app has downloaded, a Skype icon will appear on your phone. You can launch Skype from there, by signing in with all your regular login information.


Skype on BlackBerry allows you to send instant messages, videos, and files to people all over the world, provides free voice and video chats on 3G or Wi-Fi to other Skype users, and lets you sign in with your Microsoft account to access your Windows Live friends and contacts as well.

 Open the can of beans, pour the beans into a colander and rinse them under cold running water.
 Place a dutch oven or heavy cooking pot on the stovetop and turn the height to medium. Add a high-heat cooking oil, such as safflower or coconut oil, and heat for one to two minutes.


At this point you can add aromatics if you wish, such as chopped onions, garlic cloves, carrots or other seasonings., Heat the beans to a low simmer and stir occasionally.


You can also add water or stock to the beans if you want more of a sauce consistency or are making soup.
 Canned beans come precooked, so you really just need to heat the beans to the desired temperature for three to five minutes.

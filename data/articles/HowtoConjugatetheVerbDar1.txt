 The main verbal mode in Spanish is the indicative, used in affirmative and negative clauses. When we want to talk about a current action we use the present indicative, the most basic form to express ourselves.As an example we are going to use the same example sentence across the different verb tenses. In this example the verb has no idiomatic meaning, but when use in idioms, the conjugation rules keep the same structure.Example: John gives a present to Mary. John le da un regalo a Mary

yo: doy
tú: das
él/ella/usted: da
nosotros/-as: damos
vosotros/-as: dais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: dan;
, The preterit indicative form of dar is used to talk about a moment in the past when something was given and the action was completed and followed by a different one.Example: John gave a present to Mary. John le dio un regalo a Mary

yo: di
tú: diste
él/ella/usted: dio
nosotros/-as: dimos
vosotros/-as: disteis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: dieron

, Use the imperfect indicative when talking about something definitely or concretely given in the past when the action could have been interrupted by another action in preterit.Example: John was giving a present to Mary when the baby cried. John le daba un regalo a Mary cuando el bebé lloró

yo: daba
tú: dabas
él/ella/usted: daba
nosotros/-as: dábamos
vosotros/-as: dábais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: daban

, Use the future indicative for actions that will happen in the future and they are already confirmed to happen. In this case, you might need this tense for speaking about the action of giving to someone something already planned in a future.Example: John will give a present to Mary on the weekend. John le dará un regalo a Mary el fin de semana

yo: daré
tú: darás
él/ella/usted: dará
nosotros/-as: daremos
vosotros/-as: daréis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: darán

, Using the conditional indicative tense will help you when you want to talk about something that will happen in the future if another second action is done. In this case, something will be given or not as a result of the conditioned action. It can be translated as would or could give.Example: John would give a present to Mary if he would have bought it. John le daría un regalo a Mary si lo hubiese comprado.

yo: daría
tú: darías
él/ella/usted: daría
nosotros/-as: daríamos
vosotros/-as: daríais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: darían

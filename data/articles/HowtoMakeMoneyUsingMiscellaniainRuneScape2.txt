To do this either fish on the docks, cut down the trees, mine some coal, or rake some weeds. All resources you collect go to the workers which make them happy. Once they are at 100% approval then you can stop.






Do not kill peasants or steal from stalls, these reduce your approval rating by 3% and 5% respectively.
Raking is by far the fastest to do this, but you have to wait for the weeds to regrow, mining is the second fastest, but chopping trees and fishing you can do AFK.






You get no items from doing these tasks and only 1 exp each something you get.
 Having your subjects collect resources for you.

Go into the castle and talk to Adviser Grim. Talk to him tell you get to the screen on a map of your kingdom. Up in the left hand corner of the screen should be a picture of coins. Click on the deposit button and put in 1.5m gp (1,500,000).






Once you have deposited money next you need to tell your workers what to do. On the same screen you will see bars with arrows next to them. For maximum profit, put 5 (Half the bar) on mining, 5 on trees, and 5 on herbs.
 You can collect from your kingdom once a day, but for max profit, you'll need to wait a week., Talk to Adviser Grim and you will be able to collect what your workers have gathered for you. You will also notice that all that money (1.5m) isn't gone. There should be around 800k left in there still. This isn't a mistake this is part of the strategy. You see your workers work best with 750k or more in the coffers. so if you add extra money that just means you won't have to go back every day to deposit money.
 Then just wait a week again to go back and you can repeat this as much as possible.

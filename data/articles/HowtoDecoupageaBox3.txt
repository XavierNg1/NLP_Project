 If you're using single pieces of paper, cut to the dimensions of the box as required. If using many different pieces of paper, cut these out separately, to be pasted onto the box in the order of your choice.
 If working with large single pieces of paper, it is recommended that you work only 7.5cm/3 inches at a time.
 Attach the paper to the base, then sides of the box. As you stick the paper in place, always run your fingertips across the paper to smooth away air bubbles and wrinkles. Work from the middle to the outer edge on each surface.
 The same application principles apply. However, outside edges should always fold over to the inside, to provide a smoothly seamless and finished look. Press down neatly when overlapping edges, to ensure that the lid will sit in place properly.


If using individual pieces of paper, overlap them neatly and in interesting ways. It can sometimes help to make a plan of where particular images will go, to make sure that they stand out well.
 Attach the paper to the underside of the lid first, then the inside edges. Then cover the outside of the lid.


In some cases, you may prefer the inside edges to neatly cover any overlapping external paper(s). In this case, do the outside edge first, then the inside edge.
 Do this both inside and out of the box. This layer protects the paper and gives a nice glossy finish to the box.
 This isn't necessary, as the paper will already look great. But if wished, you can also top with a bow, flower or other decoration.

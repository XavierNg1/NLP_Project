 This spell is used to bind a person away from you. Despite popular belief, it is not black magic, and it does not cause any harm to the person it was cast upon.
 This could be an item of clothing, a comb or hairbrush, a book, or any other object the person frequently uses.


Since the person won't be getting the item back, try to find something small that they won't miss. A hairpin, pencil, eraser or another school supply item might be a good choice.
Since the item is going to end up in a stream or river, try to choose something that isn't going to pollute the water. A small piece of paper or cloth will eventually break down, a bit plastic object won't.
 Wrap a long piece of ribbon around and around the object to bind it. As you work, recite these words: "(Name of person), I bind you from causing harm to me, to others and against yourself." Repeat the words until the item is completely bound.
 Go to a river or creek and face away from it so your back is to the water and the current is flowing away from you. Don't attempt to do the binding spell in a lake or pond, because the item will just sink to the bottom instead of getting carried away.
 It is imperative that you do not look back. Walk away from the spot where you tossed it and reflect on the binding spell. If you performed it correctly, the person would be bound to stay away from you or stop the behavior that has been bothering you.

 Encourage your hair to grow long by applying a hair mask once or twice a week. Make your own natural oil mask or purchase over-the-counter hair masks at your local drug store.To make a hair mask at home, combine 1 cup coconut oil with 1 tablespoon macadamia oil, almond oil, and jojoba oil. Massage the mask into damp hair and let it sit for ten minutes. Then, shampoo and condition your hair to remove the mask.
 Castor oil is a natural substance that can encourage hair growth.Applying a castor oil hair mask can lead to hair that grows longer and healthier.Begin by massaging your scalp with 1 cup of castor oil. Allow the oil to fall from your scalp onto the strands of your hair. Once your scalp and hair are covered, use a plastic shower cap on your head to keep the oil in place. Spread a towel on your pillowcase before you go to sleep so you do not get oil all over your pillow.
Let the oil sit on your scalp and hair overnight. Wash and condition your hair the following morning to remove the oil.
 A hot oil massage can help to breakdown any oil or dirt on your scalp and stimulate hair growth from the roots of your hair. Use natural oils like coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, and argan oil.Warm up the oil on a stovetop or in the microwave. Make sure you test the oil before you apply it. It should be at a comfortable temperature that is not burning to the touch and will not damage your scalp or your hair.
Use your fingers to gently massage your scalp with the warm oil in slow, circular motions. You can do this after you have taken a shower. You can also ask a friend or partner to massage your scalp for you. Make sure you massage the oil in your scalp for fifteen to twenty minutes.
After fifteen to twenty minutes, shampoo your hair well to remove the oil.

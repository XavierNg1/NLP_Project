 The fresher and tastier the fruit you choose is, the better your sorbet will taste in the end.Getting local fruit that is very fresh is often the most cost-effective way to get tasty, ripe fruit.


The amount of fruit you get will determine how much sorbet you have. In order to make a quart of sorbet, try to get about 2 pounds of fruit (which should yield about 4 cups of puree).;
, While you can make sorbet with any fruit, some fruits (such as citrus and pomegranate) are more challenging for beginners. Fruits that are high in pectin (such as berries) or high in fiber (such as strawberries, peaches, mangoes, or bananas) make getting a creamier sorbet texture easier., Wash your fruit, remove any tops, cores, seeds, or ends, and cut into smallish pieces. Cutting the fruit ahead of time will make the pureeing process go more smoothly.
 Use a food processor or blender to puree your fruit.Make sure that the mixture is free of lumps and remove any errant seeds that got through. You should have about 4 cups of pureed fruit. If you have less, you might want to puree a little more fruit to have the right balance of fruit and sugar.
 This step may be optional, depending upon the fruit you’re using and what kind of texture you’d like for your final product. If you want a delicate texture, strain the fruit.If you don’t mind a rougher texture, you can leave the pulp in.

 You will want a solid, long-lasting base, so consider applying two coats. Provide enough drying time between coats to create a smooth, solid surface for the snowflakes.
 Draw three lines on one side of your nail. The lines should consist of two diagonal lines and one straight line.


Don’t draw the lines straight across the nail; instead, only draw them halfway to the middle.
 Draw two short lines like arrow tips at the top of each long line. Leave a small amount on the top of each long line to give the look of a real snowflake.
 The bottom two lines should be slightly shorter than the top two lines.

 Choose well tailored trousers for the best effect.


Darker tones work well with such dresses.






Avoid stiff fabric around the bottom zone.
 Choose straight lines for the best effect; A-line skirts are ideal.


Again, darker tones are best.






Avoid anything that clings to the hips, such as pencil skirts.
 Capri pants will accentuate the pear shape and can even increase the sense of size around your bottom zone.
 Always wear good quality jeans.

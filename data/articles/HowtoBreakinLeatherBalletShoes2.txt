 When shopping for new ballet slippers, don't be tempted to buy the ones that fit with room to spare, get a size down and stretch them to fit your foot exactly. Buy a pair of leather ballet shoes in a size lower than your normal size.
, It should be very very tight, even painfully so.
 Cover every part.
 Push it until it stretches as far as it will go.
, Pull your ballet slippers on––it will be a bit of a challenge, but persevere. Put on another pair of socks over the shoes.
, Repeat the whole process a few hours later, and leave in a warm place each time.
 Mark where to put elastics on, then take off and sew them in.
 In about a week's time they will soften and mould exactly to your feet, leaving perfect fitting ballet shoes that will last you for ages.

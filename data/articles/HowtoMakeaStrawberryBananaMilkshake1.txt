 Rinse the strawberries, chop off the stems, and cut them in half. Next, peel the banana, then cut it into slices. You can use fresh or frozen fruit; frozen fruit will give you a thicker milkshake., If you don't own a blender, you can use a food processor instead.
 2% or whole milk is recommended, but you can experiment with other types of milk too.
 Strawberry ice cream or vanilla ice cream are popular choices, but you can also try chocolate ice cream instead for a tasty twist. If you'd like a healthier milkshake, try frozen yogurt instead., From time to time, you may need to pause the blender, and scrape any unmixed milkshake towards the bottom with a rubber spatula. Keep blending until everything is smooth and evenly combined. There shouldn't be any streaks, swirls, lumps, or clumps.
 Your milkshake is essentially done, but if it isn't to your liking, you can still tweak it. For example, if it is too thin for you, you can add in some more ice cream, frozen strawberries or bananas, or even an ice cube or two. If it is too thick for you, add in more milk. Be sure to blend the milkshake well after each addition.
 You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it with some whipped cream and colorful sprinkles.

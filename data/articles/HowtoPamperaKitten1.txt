 Kittens are delicate, so you should start with a soft bath with baby soap and an extra soft cotton towel.;
, First pour about an inch of lukewarm water into your sink or tub. Carefully place your kitten in the tub and gently pour some of the existing water over the kitten's back.


Most cats don't like water. If you need to bathe your cat, use a small spray bottle to spritz the areas that need washed, then wipe down the cat with a towel.
 Add a small amount of baby soap to your hand and lightly scrub the kitten's back and legs.
 Remove the kitten from the bath and immediately wrap it in the towel. Carefully dry it off. Don't let it get cold.

If "Earth" is called, the player to whom the ball is thrown has to mention something that lives on the earth, such as a lion, a cat;
if "Air" is called, something that lives in the air, such as a bird species;
if "Water," something that lives in the water, such as a fish; but
if "Fire" is called, the player must keep silence.
 Always remember not to put birds in the water, or animals or fish in the air; be silent when "Fire" is called, and answer before ten can be counted. Breaking any of these rules means that a forfeit must be paid, which can be decided on before starting the game.

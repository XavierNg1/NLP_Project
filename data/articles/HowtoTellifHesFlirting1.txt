 While touch doesn't necessarily guarantee that he's interested or flirting, there are definitely certain touches make it more likely. You want the touches that are more charged, and less "friends."


Friendly pat-on-the-back touch means that he’s comfortable and friendly with you, but not necessarily flirting. Likewise, high-fives, fist bumps are more likely a friendly action than a flirtatious gesture.
A lingering hand touch or a hug that goes on a little longer than with his friends are more likely to be signs of flirting, or that he's interested in you.;
, Eye contact is one of the biggest parts of flirting. It creates a charged between two people and it can mean that he can't take his eyes off you. Lingering eye contact, eye contact that goes on for longer than normal, is especially a good sign.He’ll want to look at you, especially if he’s teasing you (teasing is another good sign of flirting), this way he can see what your reaction is, or just admire how you look.
If he’s smiling or grinning at you, even better; flirting should be fun, smiles between two people can signal communication and interest

, People tend to subconsciously mirror the actions of those that they like. When you're with him, notice if he mirrors your actions, such as taking a sip of coffee a few moments after you do and so on.Notice things like: is he seated facing towards you? Does he make sure to keep in your line of sight so he can look at you? Does he lean forward when you speak?
If he’s facing away or looking elsewhere, turning away in a middle of the conversation, crossing arms or legs and pulling back, probably he’s not flirting with you.
 Men tend to raise their eyebrows slightly upwards when they're talking to a woman they're interested in. You'll want to observe what his eyebrows are doing when you're with him and when he's with other people to see whether it's different.

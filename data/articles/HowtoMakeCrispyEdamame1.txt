 Some oven temperatures vary so check your oven to get a good idea on heat.


Prepare the pan before roasting the edamame. Liberally coat with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil to keep the edamame from burning. Since edamame has a slippery exterior, choose a pan that has sides. If the edamame slips toward the sides, this means the beans won’t end up in the oven.;
, Rinse the defrosted edamame in a colander under cold water. Drain all the water off the soybeans completely to ensure that they will crisp well in the oven.
 Ensure that the edamame is spread evenly throughout the pan, in a single layer. The beans should not be lumped on top of each other.

Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to drizzle over the top of the edamame. You may need more olive oil depending on the coverage. Coat each bean well in the oil so that the cheese, salt and pepper adheres evenly.






Sprinkle cheese over the top of the edamame. Be sure to hit every soybean with the Parmesan.






Add a dash of salt and pepper to taste. You may want to pull back on adding too much salt as the Parmesan cheese is already fairly salty.

 If the cookies or biscuits have bee made using honey or a syrup, they need to be left on the baking sheet/tray for a few minutes to cool before removing them.


If left too long, they will need to be returned to the oven for a few minutes to soften again.;
, Using a wide palette knife that has good give, slide under the baked biscuits or cookies and transfer them to wire cooling racks to finish the cooling.
 Instead, cool down the sheet or tray by running cold water over the back of it. Then add the dough to the tray before baking the next batch.

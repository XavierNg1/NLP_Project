 This is the simplest and easiest method as you will be storing the files directly in your website's domain itself and on your web host's servers. Of course, the drawback to this method is that if people hotlink directly to your files, your bandwidth will be eaten up pretty quickly. Also, most web hosts usually only give an allocated amount of space which may run out if you use it extensively.;
, These websites allow you to upload your files to their server and hotlink the files from there. Not only does this save you some bandwidth as you are not hosting your own files, but it also allows you to keep a large number of files on the web host. This is one method to safely store files through web hosting. However, the fact that the files are hosted on a remote server also means that they can go down anytime, and they can also be deleted anytime. It would be prudent to keep a backup of your files either on your own server or on your computer just in case.
 Online image directories such as Flickr, Imageshack and other such image hosting directories may be a good solution for you to remotely host your pictures. The drawback however, is that with high resolution pictures you may tend to hit the bandwidth cap of the host very quickly. Of course it is always better than using up your own bandwidth. For the larger image directories such as Flickr, they have little downtime and would be a good alternative to storing your image files through web hosting.

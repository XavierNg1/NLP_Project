 Black widows and brown recluses are the only two types of dangerously poisonous spiders in the US. They both reside in warm climates and prefer dark, dry places like closets and wood piles. Here's what to look for:Black widows are large, glossy black spiders with a red hourglass shape on their belly. They are found throughout North America. The bite may feel like a pinprick, and the site of the bite will be slightly red and swollen. Within thirty minutes to a few hours, however, intense pain and stiffness will begin. Severe abdominal pain, nausea, fever or chills may develop. Black widow bites are generally not fatal to healthy adults, and an anti-venom exists to relieve symptoms. Brown recluse spiders can be many different shades of brown, but they have a violin-shaped marking on their back and long, spindly legs. Their bite initially stings, then deepens into intense pain over the next eight hours. A fluid-filled blister that turns into a steadily-enlarging open sore appears, and permanent tissue damage is preceded by a blue and red “target sign” around the wound site. Other symptoms include a fever, rash, and nausea. Brown recluse spider bites can produce scarring, but have caused no deaths in the United States. There is no anti-venom, but treatments of bite lesions exist via surgery and antibiotics.
 See a medical professional immediately for treatment. Move as little as possible to further slow the spread of venom.
 This will help prevent infection.
 This will help slow the spread of the venom and bring down the swelling.
 If the bite is on an arm or a leg, elevate the limb and tie a snug bandage above the bite. Be careful not to cut off circulation!

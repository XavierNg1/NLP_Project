 Inspect your shed’s entrance for gaps between the door and its frame. If any are present, seal the door using weatherstripping or a draft strip.Pay special attention to the entrance’s corners. If the shed is large enough, and if you’re brave enough, get inside, close the door, and see if any light is visible where the door meets its casing.;
, If your shed has windows, apply a silicone or acrylic latex caulk to seal any gaps in the casing. Check the roof’s soffits and fascia boards, and use caulk to seal any cracks you find.Inspect the shed’s structure regularly to make sure no gaps or cracks have formed, and reapply caulk when needed.
 Some sheds feature vents and other openings, such as entry points for utility wires. Use the finest wire mesh you can find to seal vents (preferably 1/16 inch or 1.5 millimeter). Plug any utility holes with caulk, expandable foam, or steel wool.Wear gloves when cutting and installing wire mesh, since the edges are razor sharp.

 Think of nice things you can do to put the mother at ease or increase her comfort.


If you are taking a break to get a snack or drink, ask if there is anything you can bring her. Offer to get extra pillows, a blanket, or other comfort items from a nurse.
Avoid complaining about feeling tired, sore, bored, or nervous. You are there to provide assistance and share in a wonderful experience, and complaining about your own discomfort or discontent is unlikely to improve the motherâ€™s experience.
Purchase a gift in advance or bring flowers with you to the hospital to show your love and encouragement to the mother.
 Labor and delivery can be challenging and even upsetting for many women.


If you sense the mother is no longer comfortable with your presence, offer to leave for a moment or temporarily give her some privacy.
If the mother requests that you leave, obey her wishes and remember that she is probably just overwhelmed; it is not necessarily a reflection of your relationship with her. In some instances, she may just want a few minutes without her guests, after which you may be able to return.

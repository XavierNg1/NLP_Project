 Poster putty adhesives are often known as Blu-Tac, Sticky-Tac etc.


Play dough is another option that will work just as well as poster tack.;
, Roll it into a small ball.
 Roll and dab the ball all over your hands, it will collect the glitter onto the tack ball. Continue until the glitter has all come off.
 Toss the tack in the disposal and give your hands a good wash in warm, soapy water. You're good to go now.

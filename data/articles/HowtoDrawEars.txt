 Place the large circle above the small one as shown, leaving some space between them.;
, These shapes serve to give the ear a basic structure. This is probably the most essential stage of the process, so make sure your lines are up to par.
 Draw another set of large and small circles, and add two curved lines.
 Loosen up a bit as you do this (no one really has circles and straight lines for ears you knowÂ :D). A real-life model for the ears would greatly help you if you're having a hard time envisioning exactly how you want your ears to look, and if no one's around/willing to help you, Google Images can always provide a photo or two.
 Apply some shading if you're not going to color directly.
 If you want, you could add in more details (shadows and highlights). And don't forget to practice, practice, practice!

 In order to do this, you need to understand what can be replaced for the standard ingredients in a cake recipe, while also accepting that it will take trial and error before you get the replacement elements sufficiently accurate to produce a good quality cake. The following list may help you when experimenting to create your own cake that doesn't have eggs, sugar or dairy, or any such combination as befits your needs:

Replace eggs with: 1 tablespoon flax seeds, ground finely or 1 tablespoon chia seeds added to 3 tablespoons of warm water. Mix together, then chill for 15 minutes before using.Or, try 3 tablespoons applesauce for each egg or 1/2 mashed banana for each egg.Commercial egg replacer mixes are another good option. Other substitutes can be found in How to replace eggs in your cooking.
Replace milk with: Water, plant milks, seed milks and even leftover drinks such as lemonade, soda or fruit juice. It can be fun to experiment with different flavors for tasty outcomes.
Replace cream with: Coconut cream, soy cream, rice cream, and so forth. There are also fake cream recipes available with a quick search online.
Replace butter with: Oil (coconut, macadamia, olive, etc.); unsweetened applesauce;puréed pumpkin or avocado;coconut oil or butter;; and non-dairy yogurts.Replace sugar with: Artificial sweeteners that can be baked, syrups that you don't mind using (some people are concerned with these too), fruit juice, mashed or puréed fruit, dried fruits, spices, coconut milk, etc. In many cases, it's just best to cut down on the amount used rather than avoid it completely––many recipes do use too much sugar and it can be halved or even reduced to a quarter of the original amount and it will still taste great.

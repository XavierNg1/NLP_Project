 It might seem like the most obvious thing in the world, but finding a therapist you trust and like is very important to treating mental illness. Regular therapy sessions are vital to keeping track of your mental state, emotional well-being, and any impending or current episodes of illness. If you feel your therapist is not a good fit, find a new one.
 Communicating with your therapist is crucial to receiving the best possible treatment. If you refuse to talk to your therapist and aren't willing to take their suggestions, you cannot expect to get anything out of therapy. If, however, you work on the things you have spoken about with your therapist between sessions, your illness will become more manageable, and most importantly, you will be the one taking charge of your own life.
 Your therapy is about you, and if you do not make your needs clear, your therapist cannot help you with them. Even the best therapist is not a mind reader, and as therapy often involves dealing with fears and past traumas, it's important for both you and your therapist to know your boundaries.

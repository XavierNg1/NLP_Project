You can also make your own simple candle by adding any oil that burns (including vegetable oil) to a mason jar. Add a lantern wick, and your favorite scents from your kitchen or essential oil cabinet, such as cinnamon or clove., Another option to add scent to your home is to use a wax warming system. These systems often don't require an open flame, so they are safer to have on. You simply plug them in, turn them on, then add scented wax to the warming area. The wax releases happy Christmas smells into your home.

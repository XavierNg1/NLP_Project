 The survey area can contain a wide array of habitat. You should become familiar with the boundaries of the area, any prominent topographical features found inside your area, and any anthropogenic development within your survey area. Familiarity becomes more important with larger area or when you are conducting a survey in a wilderness area.;
, It is much easier to use quadrants rather than transects when using a recorder. Each quadrant should have an area of 500 m if the space will allow. This will insure that no two sampling sites are to close together and limits the possibility of recording the same individual multiple times.
 After the area is sectioned off into quadrants each section should be assigned a number. You can then run the numbered sections through a random number generator to find the sections that will be used for recording. All recording should be done in the center of the selected quadrant.
 It is important to be on your research site at 15 minutes before first light. Some neo-tropical birds sing only 1-3 songs in the first 5 minutes of daylight

, When you arrive in your survey area you should assemble and test all of your equipment to ensure that there is nothing missing, broken, and that you have fresh batteries in your recorder.
 When moving to your recording site it is important to be as quiet as possible and not to move too fast. Fast and loud movements will alarm birds and scare them out of the area. Once you reach your recording site quietly find a comfortable position and sit silently for at least 5-10 minutes. It can take up to 15 minutes for birds that may have been scared off or alarmed by your presence to move back into the area.
 During your recording you should not be making any noise that can disrupt the bird songs and calls. You should record in a circular pattern using the directional microphone to record in each direction for about 3-4 minutes. Each site should be recorded for roughly 30 minutes to ensure a large data set. When your recording is complete at that site quietly leave site and start moving to your next site.
 It is recommended that you use an audio program that allows you to splice and edit the recorded track to identify individual bird species .List species in the order in which they were recorded

, Separate your list into groups of 5 keeping each recorded species in the order in which they were recorded. For example, if you recorded 2 Spotted Towhee, 3 American robin, then 2 American Crow, 1 Song Sparrow, 2 Spotted Towhee your list would look something like this;



Group 1

Spotted Towhee
Spotted Towhee
American Robin
American Robin
American Robin



Group 2

American Crow
American Crow
Song Sparrow
Spotted Towhee
Spotted Towhee



, The groups that you have collected will be represented in the X axis.The Y axis will represent each new species recorded.


Given the list above your first point would be 5 because there are 5 new species recorded. Your second point would only be 2 because there are only 2 new species represented in that group. Continue plotting in this pattern until no new species has been represented in a consecutive 5-6 groups.

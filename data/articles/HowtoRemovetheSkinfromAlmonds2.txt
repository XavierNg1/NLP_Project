 Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C), so it will be the correct temperature when you put the nuts in. While the oven heats up, you can lay your almonds and sheet pan out., Pour your almonds on a baking sheet, running your hand over them until they’re in a flat, even layer. If you can’t put the nuts on the pan in a single layer because there are too many, use two sheet pans or do the nuts in batches.Overlapping your almonds will cause them to heat unevenly and may make removing the skins more difficult.
 Place the nuts in the oven and toast them for up to 15 minutes. Look through the oven glass for any areas that become overly dark, as this can make your nuts bitter. If you notice overbrowning, remove your almonds. It can help to shake the pan every five minutes while toasting to keep the nuts from burning.The nuts are ready when the exteriors turn golden brown.
 Using an oven mitt to protect your hand, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Cool your almonds until they are no longer hot, but still warm to the touch. It’s best to cool the pan on your stove or another heat-safe area away from pets and children., Pour the almonds into a tea towel on the counter. Using another tea towel, rub the almonds vigorously from the top to loosen the skins. The friction created by both towels will cause the now-flaky exteriors of the almonds to come off.

If any stubborn bits of exterior cling to your almonds, rub them individually with the towel to remove the skin.
 When all the skins have been removed, pick the clean, skinned almonds off the towel and put them in a bowl to use in your favorite recipe.The toasted, skinned almonds will keep for up to two weeks at room temperature and up to 6 months if stored in a zip-top bag in the freezer.

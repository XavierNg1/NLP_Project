 Wash 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of small, Yukon gold potatoes and gently scrub the skins. Cut the potatoes into bite-sized cubes and place them in a large pot or Dutch oven. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the potatoes by about 1-inch (2.5 cm).If you prefer, you can cut the potatoes into thin slices instead of cubes.
 Turn the heat on to high, so the water begins to boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low and let the water bubble gently. Simmer the potatoes for about 10 minutes, so they become soft. Drain the potatoes and put them into a large serving bowl.You could steam the potatoes in a steamer basket instead of boiling them.
 Slice 1 ripe avocado in half and remove the pit. Scoop the avocado flesh into a prep bowl. Dice a bit of red onion, so you get 2 tablespoons. Place this in the bowl with the avocado. You'll also need to dice 1/2 cup (75 g) of cucumber and put it in the bowl.Don't worry about slicing or cubing the avocado, since you'll be mashing it.
 Add the rest of the dressing ingredients to the prep bowl and use a fork to mash the ingredients together. The avocado should thin out and hold the dressing together. You'll need to add:2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste
Black pepper, to taste

, Scoop the avocado dressing onto the cooked potatoes in the serving bowl. Use a large spoon to gently stir the salad together. The potatoes should be coated with the dressing.Avoid making this recipe too far in advance, since the avocado may make the dressing turn brown if it sits for very long.

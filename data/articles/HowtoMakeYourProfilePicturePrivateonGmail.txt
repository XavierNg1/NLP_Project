 Open your browser of choice. Once your browser is open, type www.gmail.com on the address bar and press "Enter." This will bring you to the Gmail’s sign-in screen.;
, To log in, click on box in the center of the screen and enter your e-mail address, then click on the box directly below it and enter your password. Click on the "Sign In" button below the information to access your account.


Once you are signed in, you will be on your main Gmail inbox page. If you look on the right side of the screen, you will notice a small gear that you can click on.
 Select the gear, and a drop-down menu will appear. Go down to the Settings button, which will be the fifth option from the top. This will bring you to the Gmail settings page.
 It should be the default settings menu.


If for some reason you find you are on another menu, look at the top of the screen directly below "Settings." The first option on the right side reads "General"; click on that to ensure you are on the General Settings page.
 It will be about half-way down your Settings page. You can tell that you are in the right spot because you will see your profile picture right beside the menu.
 You will see a blue link above your picture that says “Change picture.” If you look to the right of the Change Picture link, you will see two options: “Visible to everyone” and “Visible only to people that I can chat with.”


There is a bubble next to each option. In order to make your picture private, click the bubble next to the second option.
If done correctly, the only people who will be able to see your picture is those who are added as a contact.
 When you are satisfied with your changes, the last thing you will need to do is scroll to the bottom of the page. There is a Save Changes button you must click on to finalize the changes you made.

 Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce to a simmer and cook for five minutes.
 Pour the pickling brine on top, leaving at least 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space at the top of the jar.
 Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Lower the jar of jalapeños into the water, being sure that the water covers the bottom 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the jar. Let the contents of the jar process for 10 minutes, and then remove the jar from the water.
 Allow the peppers to continue pickling for 4-5 days before opening.


Be sure to refrigerate the jar once it has been opened. As the mixture cools, the lid of the mason jar should make a popping sound, which signifies that it has been sealed properly. If there is no popping sound, then refrigerate the jar once it reaches room temperature.
Use jalapeños within two weeks of opening.
 Try slicing up the peppers and adding them to salsa, tacos, fajitas, and any other Mexican dish.

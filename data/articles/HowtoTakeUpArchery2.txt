 In fact, some will take up bow hunting without ever doing actual hunting.
 Bow hunting takes concentration and just being good at hunting.


It is not a surprise that bow-hunters are more likely to subscribe to the rules of fair chaseand more likely to hunt for food.
 Compound bows have a string that wraps around with the aid of cams.


Compound bows are best for hunting because the arrow flies faster/farther and is more accurate. Compound bows often have sights that are used to visually assist the archer aiming the arrow at the target.
Compound bow hunters use arm and chest protectors, since a compound bow string has a lot of torque and can cause injury if you don't have protection. Larger breasted women often will use a shotgun instead for this reason.
Hunting can also use a re-curve bow or a longbow, but that is less common for reasons mentioned above.
Some enjoy using a crossbow.
 Hunting groups are pretty common in the USA. You can simply go to a hunting store near you and ask if they have a club.


Bow hunters will show you where they shoot. Shooting in the woods is different from being on a range, and takes getting used to.
 It doesn't matter if you are shooting deer, elk, pigs/javelina or more exotic game.

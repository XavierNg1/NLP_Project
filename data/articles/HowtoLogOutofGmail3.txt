 If you want to log out of the Gmail app, you can either remove your account from the device entirely, or just disable it in Gmail. Removing the account entirely will sign you out of any other Google apps, such as Search or YouTube. Disabling the account in Gmail will just remove it from the Gmail app, keeping you signed in for your other Google apps.
 This will allow you to adjust your account settings.
 There are two ways you can sign out of Gmail from this menu, with different effects:To just disable your Gmail account in the Gmail app, toggle the account Off in the "Manage Accounts" menu. You will still stay signed in to any other Google apps on the device.






To remove your account entirely, tap "Edit" in the upper-right corner and then tap "Remove" for the account you want to delete. You will be signed out of all Google apps.

 Pour equal amounts of the gelatin into separate bowls. Use one bowl for each flavor/color combination you're making.
 Each bowl requires only about 4 drops of food coloring and 1/2 teaspoon or less of flavoring. Add a little at a time until the liquid meets your desired taste. These combinations make for excellent gum drops; choose from among them, or design your own:


Cherry flavoring with red food coloring.
Lime flavoring with green food coloring.
Licorice flavoring with purple food coloring.
Blue raspberry flavoring with blue food coloring.
Peach flavoring with orange food coloring.
 Each color should go in a separate mold. Place the pans in the refrigerator to chill overnight.


To make multi-layered gumdrops, with a different color and flavor in each layer, chill one layer at a time. When the first layer is set, after a few hours, pour a second layer on top and return it to the refrigerator.
Don't attempt to cut the gumdrops until they are completely chilled and set.

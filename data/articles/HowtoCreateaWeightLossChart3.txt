 If you don't want to design your own chart in Excel, you can download some pre-designed Excel templates that will chart your progress.


Type "weight loss spreadsheet" into your favorite search engine and hit the "search" button. A variety of options will come up.
You can download these Excel spreadsheets directly onto your computer. All you will need to do is plug in your data (such as height, weight, and the dates) into their corresponding columns.
If you do not want to fill in your spreadsheets digitally, you can download pre-printed sheets and then manually write in each piece of data.
 After you have downloaded the spreadsheet, make sure that you continue to use it after you first open it. Set a reminder on your phone or computer to remind you to complete it.
 If you are working from a download, you will need to save your work regularly. You might also want to save the spreadsheet to a cloud service such as Dropbox or Google Cloud. Saving it on a cloud will preserve it in case anything happens to your computer.

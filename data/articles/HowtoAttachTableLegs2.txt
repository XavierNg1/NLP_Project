 You can find unfinished legs and all the hardware necessary to install them at most large hardware stores.
 Ensure that they are equidistant, so that your table is level. This form of attaching legs is best for unfinished tables that will be covered, upholstered or layered with another piece of wood.


Make sure that the hole is approximately the size of your T-nut and no larger.
 Continue until it sits in the hole and there isnâ€™t any space between the top of your table base and the metal.
 Measure and mark the exact center at the top of the leg. Drill a pilot hole, then twist the hanger bolt into the leg.


Use a pair of locking pliers to tighten the hanger bolt.
If you purchased legs with pre-installed hanger bolts, you can skip this step.
 Then, twist a regular nut onto the top of the bolt to keep it in place. Repeat with the three additional legs.Test your table to ensure it is level before you finish it or attach the top layer.

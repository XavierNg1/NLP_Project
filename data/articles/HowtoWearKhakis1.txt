 A flat-front khaki provides a more modern and sleek look than a pleated khaki. This removes visual weight from your legs and keeps your khakis from looking too much like a school uniform. Make sure your khakis are hemmed properly and donâ€™t pool around your ankles., Wide-leg khakis make your legs appear larger than they are and can make your look seem messy. Look for a khaki that tapers slightly from the thigh to the ankle. This will provide a more tailored and polished look to your pants., Choose khakis that fit well around your hips rather than high up near your belly button or low above your pubic bone. This midrise is most universally flattering. It also provides the most visual balance., Cargo pants add bulk to your frame and are an outdated style. Look for khakis that have four pockets, two in the front and two in the back. This is a more modern and updated look when wearing khakis.

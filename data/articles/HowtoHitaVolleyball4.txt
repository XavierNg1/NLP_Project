 A set is usually the second hit made after the ball is on your side of the court. This type of hit sets up a teammate to spike the ball onto your opponent's side.Your fingers should be spread out and make a triangle shape with your pointer fingers and thumbs very close together but not touching.
 When the ball comes to you, move your hands above your head, and rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing up towards the ceiling.









Keep your fingers spread and in the triangle shape, but separate them to put more space in between them as the ball comes to your hands.
 Once the ball has contacted your hands, immediately extend your arms and use your wrists to push the ball upwards and towards a teammate.








Straighten your arms completely when you release the ball for the follow through.

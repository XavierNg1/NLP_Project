 Use a leather cleaner to remove dirt and oil before you begin your repair. Use a small pair of scissors to trim any long fibers hanging from the surface. Leave loose fibers that are shorter, or that you can’t access with the scissors, as they won’t interfere with your repair.You can purchase leather cleaner, binder, filler, and sealer separately or together in a professional repair kit. You can find the products you’ll need online or at your local home improvement store.
 Apply a small amount of leather binder to a clean, dry sponge, then coat the entire affected area. Check the product’s label for instructions about drying time, and allow it to dry completely before applying the next coat. For best results, apply 8 to 10 coats of binder to the scratched surface., Use a 1200 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the area where you’ve applied the binder. Use gentle, circular motions. Sand until you’ve created a smooth, even surface across the area undergoing repair.Blow away any residue or wipe the surface using a microfiber towel after sanding.
 Use a palette or putty knife to spread a thin layer of filler over deep scratches or gouges in the surface. Wait 20 to 25 minutes for the filler to dry. Apply as many coats as you need until the scratches or gouges are level with the surrounding surface., After applying filler and letting it dry, sand the surface once more with a 1200 grit sandpaper. Use an alcohol-based leather cleaner to wipe down the repaired area, then give it several minutes to dry.The cleaner will remove any residue and prepare the leather for recoloring.
 If its container doesn’t come with an applicator, use a clean, dry sponge to apply a thin layer of leather colorant. Let it dry according to its instructions before applying additional layers. When you’ve colored and blended the repaired area, apply three to four thin layers of a leather sealer for a robust, flexible finish.

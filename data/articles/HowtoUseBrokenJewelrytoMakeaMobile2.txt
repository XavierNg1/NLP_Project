 Depending on how you plan to string your mobile you will either need to drill holes through the base or add small nails along the top so you can tie your strands.


If you are using a base found in nature, clean and/or sand the item so it can be maintained in the home. You may also want to add a clear coat of sealant to add a more polished appeal.
 Begin by stringing the smaller pieces first. Wind string either around or through the jewelry pieces depending on how the jewelry is constructed.
 String the strands either through the base and knot at the top or wind around the small nails that were adding during the prep phase.

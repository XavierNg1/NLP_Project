 If cleaning the ink stain with hairspray wasn’t fully effective, you may need to use rubbing alcohol, which is a more powerful cleaning solution. To begin, place the stained portion of the dress over a cloth or paper towel, just as you did before you sprayed with dress with hairspray., After you lay out your silk garment, pour about 2 teaspoons (9.85 ml) of rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) to a clean cloth. Use a clear rubbing alcohol as opposed to wintergreen alcohol, since the green pigment of wintergreen alcohol can stain your silk dress further., Once you add the rubbing alcohol to the clean cloth, dab at the stain with gentle tapping motions just as you did when using the hairspray. Continue patting until you don’t see any more of the ink lifting from the stained portion of the dress., Rubbing alcohol can sometimes leave a faint ring-like stain where it is applied. However, if you use a hairdryer to blow hot air on the stain directly after dabbing with the rubbing alcohol, you won’t have to worry about the ring- like stain.Use the hairdryer to blow on the stained area until it is dry. Make sure to use the hairdryer directly after dabbing so that the rubbing alcohol doesn’t have time to dry.
 If dabbing with rubbing alcohol didn’t work to fully remove the stain, repeat the process of dabbing the stain with rubbing alcohol and drying with hairspray until the stain is removed or you aren’t making any more progress in lifting the stain.If you were successful in removing the stain, launder your garment as usual. If you didn’t fully remove the stain, try another method to get it out.

 Dry shampoos come in the form of a powder or a dry spray-on product that you apply to the roots of your hair. You can purchase a commercial product or improvise by making your own. For a homemade dry shampoo recipe, read to the end of this article.;
, Remove hair bands, hair pins, and clips. Comb it to make sure there are no tangles.
 Sprinkle the powder you chose over the top of your head, especially in the areas that tend to get oily, like your bangs and part. Use your fingers to distribute it.









If you use a spray bottle of dry shampoo, hold it 6 inches (15.2Â cm) from your head and spray. Hold it far enough away so that the shampoo settles evenly over your head.
If you wish,brush your hair so the dry shampoo is distributed down the length of the hair shafts. Focus mostly on the roots, but if the rest of your hair needs freshening up, add a little more to the tips.
This might get messy, so do it over the sink or be ready to sweep or vacuum when you're done.
 Wait 5 to 10 minutes for the dry shampoo to absorb the oil from your hair. If you have particularly oily hair, it may take a little longer.
 Turn your head upside down and brush out all of the powder. You can use a hair dryer to help the process along.

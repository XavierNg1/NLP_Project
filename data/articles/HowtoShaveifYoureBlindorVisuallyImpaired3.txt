 Before you try to shave, spend some time touching your skin to learn its basic shape. Pay special attention to places like the curves of your face, armpit, or legs (depending on which area you want to shave).Don’t shave your genital area by yourself. The risk of injuring yourself is too high., As you work, remember to use your finger as a guide. Use overlapping strokes to ensure that you shave smoothly and evenly. Shaving against the grain (the direction your hair grows in) will give you a closer shave, but can also increase the risk of razor burn, so you may want to vary the technique depending on which area you are shaving. For instance:Work against the grain if you are shaving your legs. Slowly shave one long, even row up your leg. Then reposition your finger and razor slightly to the side and make another pass.Shave with the grain if you are shaving your face. When you have shaved with one stroke, reposition your finger slightly and shave the same area, this time at a 90 degree angle.
 When you are done, rinse your skin and dry it with a towel. Using your hand, check the area you shaved to make sure you removed all shaving cream or soap if you used it.After you’re done, you can apply moisturizing lotion or aftershave if desired., If you are using an electric trimmer, it will come with a series of attachment guides that will make sure your hair is trimmed at an even length. If you keep the same attachment on the trimmer, you can be sure that you will always look the way you want to.

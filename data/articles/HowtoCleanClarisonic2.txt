 After you’ve removed the brush head from the Clarisonic handle, turn on the warm water at your sink. Run the bristles under it to thoroughly wet them.You can also clean the brush head immediately after you’ve used the Clarisonic so the bristles are already damp.
 Once the brush head is damp, apply a small amount of dishwashing liquid to the bristles. If you prefer, you can use a hand soap or facial cleanser to wash the brush.It’s not necessary to use an antibacterial soap because the brush heads are made of nonporous nylon that is designed not to harbor germs or bacteria.
 After you’ve applied the soap to the brush head, rub the bristles back and forth against your fingers or hand to really work the soap in. You should massage the soap into the brush for 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure that it is fully clean.If the brush head seems particularly dirty, you may want to use a clean toothbrush to scrub the soap into the bristles and the surface of the brush head.
 When you’re finished working the soap into the bristles, turn the sink back on. Rinse the brush head under warm water to remove all of the dirt, oil, and soapy residue., When the brush head is clean, allow it to sit out to air dry. You can replace it on the handle and let it dry like that, or leave the brush on a towel by itself to finish drying.You can place the brush cap back over the brush head even while it’s drying. The cap has holes in it to ventilate the brush head so air can still reach it to help it dry.
You should remove your brush head and give it a thorough cleaning at least once a week. However, be sure to rinse the brush head well after each use.
Even with proper cleaning, you should replace your Clarisonic brush heads every three months.

 Sunlight and even other bright lights in your house can help signal to your body that it's time to get up. By getting into bright light just after waking up, whether by going outside or flooding your bedroom with light, you alert your body to the fact that it's time to start the day, giving you more energy for the morning., Caffeine can give you a boost of energy. It stops the cells in your body from accepting adenosine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that tells your cells to sleep. Caffeine tells those same cells to wake up, and it encourages faster brain function.Coffee, tea, and many sodas all contain caffeine. For instance, a cup of green tea has 24 to 45 milligrams of caffeine in a cup, while a coffee can have anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams.Try not to drink more that 200mg (one to two 5-oz cups of coffee) each day.While this number can vary depending on your weight, sensitivity, and sex, but you should never drink more than 600mg a day (between four and seven cups). And avoid caffeine pills, which people often turn to when overtired. These can be very dangerous and even fatal.Because you build up a tolerance if you drink coffee every day, try to save it for the times when you really need it., A warm or hot shower can make you feel sleepy instead of awake. However, you can counteract the effect by using a cold-hot-cold cycle at the end. That is, when you're finished cleaning yourself up, switch the shower to cold for 30 seconds. Next, switch it back to hot for 30 seconds. Finally, go back to cold for 30 seconds. This cycle gets your blood pumping and increases your energy for the day.

 In order to create C and C++ programs you must have a C/C++ compiler installed on your operating system. If you don't have a compiler installed on your system, please consult the appropriate method for installing the GNU C/C++ compiler on your Linux system. If you are on a Windows operating system, check out How to Install MinGW (Minimalist Gnu C/C++ Compiler) on Microsoft Windows.;

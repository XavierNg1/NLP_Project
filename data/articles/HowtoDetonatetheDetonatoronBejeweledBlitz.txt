 The game link or shortcut can be accessed from your Facebook News Feed page under the “Apps” section. Click on the link for the game to load it.;
, Once the game loads, you will have to choose the game mode between Standard and Party. Click on the “Play” button under the Standard mode.
 Before you begin the game, you will have the option to equip up to three boosts. The boosts are displayed below with their respective costs in coins.
 To have the Detonator available on your game board, you can buy it pre-game and equip it for use. This boost costs 3000 coins.
 When you’re ready, click the “Play Now” button to begin your game. Your game board will load and you can find the Detonator at the lower left corner.
 Play your game, and don’t mind the Detonator at the start. You won’t need it during the early seconds of the game.
 If you have matches to do near the Detonator, don’t be afraid to do so. The boost won’t go away even if you explode a Flame Gem adjacent to it.
 Don’t use these right away. Collecting them and using them at the right moment can hugely impact your score.
 There’s really no perfect moment to use the Detonator boost. You just have to use it when it’s most impactful. Since the Detonator acts like the Last Hurrah event, you will need some multipliers, Power Gems, and Hyper Cubes on the board to feel its force.


If you’ve collected enough from Step 3, go ahead and use it. Click on the boost to detonate, and watch your game board as it explodes gems on screen.

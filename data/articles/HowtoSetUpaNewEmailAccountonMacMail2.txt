 Click the Mail icon in your dock, which is the postage stamp with the bird on it. This should open up Mail on your computer.
 You can choose between iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, AOL and Add Other Email Account, but if your email account is not listed in the common accounts when first launching the application, you will need to set it up manually.


This is required if you want to set up a company email with your Mac Mail application.
Choose “Add Other Email Address,” which is at the bottom of the accounts list.
 Click “Add Other Email Address” will take you to a box with a few account choices. Make sure to click “Add Mail Account” then press “Create.”

, The next setup screen will require you to enter the necessary details like your Full Name, Email Address, and Password. Key those in, and press “Next.”

, Now you will have to choose the Account Type. This is information that your company will have to provide you, so make sure to contact your company’s IT department for this information. You will also need to ask for the Mail Server, which you will key in at this setup box as well.


If you know which Account type your company uses, click on its tab (either IMAP or POP), then enter the Mail Server. Enter your username, and password for that mail server.
If you forgot your username and password, contact your company’s IT department for help.
Once the info is keyed in, press “Next.”

, In some cases, a Certificate Verification will appear, telling you that your server cannot be verified. Ask your IT department if this happens to you, and they will tell you what to do.
 Now, you will be able to hit “Connect.” The next screen will ask you for info on your outgoing mail server. Under SMTP Server, input your mail server from before, as well as your username and password. Click on “Create.”


Your company mail will then be set up, and the messages from the inbox, as well as incoming mail will be aggregated in the Mac Mail application.

 You can use any web browser, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox to view your Facebook friends.


Use this method to view Facebook’s "smart" friend lists (such as Close Friends and Family) as well any custom friend lists you’ve created.
If you’re not signed in, type your Facebook account information into the blanks at the top-right corner of the screen, then click Log In.
 It’s in the left panel in the “Explore” section. If you don’t see Friend Lists, click See More at the bottom of the section to view hidden options.
 When you click a list, you’ll see recent Facebook posts made by people on that list.


To edit a list (or see who's on it), select a list, then click Manage List at the top-right corner of the screen.

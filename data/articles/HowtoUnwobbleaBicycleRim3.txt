 If your wheel can't stay in true, shows noticeable bending or denting, or your spokes won't stay tight, you'll need a new wheel. Oftentimes you'll need to true a wheel after a crash, which can loosen spokes, but it is not always possible. If you find yourself working and working without results, the rim is likely shot., The half turn, two quarter turn system won't work if the spoke is noticeably looser than the rest. Simply tighten this spoke on its own until it feels about as tight as the spokes around it, then move on to the more precise adjustments.
 Is the rim really out of true, or do you not have the wheel in the frame properly? The best way to ensure this is to release the wheel as if you were about to take it off the bike. Then squeeze the brakes to hold the bike in the center of the frame. Re-tighten the wheel into the frame and then let go of the brakes, leaving the wheel in the dead center.
 When you lose a spoke, you can keep riding for a bit if you have not other option to get home. But the increased pressure on the other spokes will warp and bend your wheel if left for too long, eventually causing more spokes to break and potentially ruining your rim permanently.

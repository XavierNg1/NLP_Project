 When selecting a name for a kitten, remember you will eventually have a full grown cat. Therefore, you want to pick a name that will age with the cat. A name like Baby may seem cute now, but your cat will not be a baby forever. Pick names that won't sound silly when your cat gets older., Some kittens change in appearance over time. This can sometimes be hard to predict. You can't, for example, know precisely how big a kitten will grow. Some kittens may change color over time as well. If you're picking a name based on your kitten's appearance, consider the likelihood of its appearance changing.You may want to avoid naming a kitten with a white coat based on its appearance. White coats are subject to change color with time.
You should also take size into consideration. Tiny may be the runt of its litter now, but could easily grow into a very large cat.
Also, think about the cat's voice. A very squeaky meow may inspire you to name your cat Mouse. However, cat's meows tend to deepen over time, especially in males.
 If you're drawn to similar types of names, this is particularly easy to do. It can get confusing if you have too many pets with similar names. This will make it difficult for your kitten to recognize its own name. If you have a dog named Addie, do not name your new kitten Maddie. If you love names that start with "L," keep in mind that differentiating between Lucy and Lulu can be challenging for animals., If you name your cat something with an obvious nickname, chances are people will use it. Rather than exhausting yourself correcting people, opt for a name with nicknames you don't mind.For example, if you name your new kitten Maxine, people are bound to call it Max. If you name a kitten Rose, people will call it Rosie. If you dislike either of these nicknames, go with a different name.

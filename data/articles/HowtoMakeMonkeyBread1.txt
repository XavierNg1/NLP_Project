, Place it in a small saucepan and heat it until melted. You could also heat the butter in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish. When the butter is melted, place it in a large mixing bowl.
 Remove the biscuits from the tube. Place them on a cutting board and slice them into fourths.


You can slice the biscuits in half, rather than into fourths, if you prefer larger pieces of monkey bread.
Leave the biscuits whole for even larger pieces.
 Put the biscuit pieces in the bowl with the butter. Pour the cinnamon and sugar into the bowl. Use tongs or two spoons to toss the biscuit pieces in the butter, cinnamon and sugar until they get completely coated.


If you want to make savory monkey bread, substitute chopped rosemary and minced garlic for the cinnamon and sugar.
Sprinkle in chocolate chips or add 1/2 cup of maple syrup for a different spin on this monkey bread.
 Use a spoon to transfer them from the mixing bowl to a baking dish such as a cake pan. Use a larger pan if you want monkey bread with crispy edges. For gooey monkey bread, use a smaller, deeper pan., Place the dish in the oven and bake the monkey bread for about 10 minutes, or until the top is flaky and golden brown. Remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Have guests pull off pieces when they're ready to eat.

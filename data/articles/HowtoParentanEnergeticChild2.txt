 Highly energetic children can become engrossed in playtime or other activities. Suddenly being told to stop what they are doing will jar them and often make them upset. Instead, you can give them a notice a few minutes before it is time to move to a new activity.For example, you might say something like, “You have five minutes of playtime left. Then we will get ready for bed.”

, Children of all ages struggle with the balance of control between themselves and their parents. Giving your child choices will help them to feel in control of their lives. This will make transitioning from task to task much easier. Your child will also be able to stay on task more effectively if they have some say in what they are doing.For example, you could offer your child a choice between bathing before dinner or after dinner. This is a win-win. Either way, they take a bath, but they get to choose when.
 Energetic children are easily stimulated. This stimulation can be overwhelming when they aren’t sure what to expect. To help your child be prepared for their day to day life, keep a steady routine to the best of your ability. Things like a regular bedtime, regular meal times, and consistent naps will help your child stay grounded through the day., Most parents feel that retaining parental authority is important, and ‘losing’ a battle undermines that authority. To avoid getting into a contest of wills with an energetic child (who may have much more willpower than other children of the same age), make sure that you aren’t picking insignificant battles. However, when you do need to intervene in your child’s behavior, don’t hesitate to do so.For example, if your child is mixing different colors of Play-Doh together, it might be worth letting them continue playing. In contrast, if they are rubbing said Play-Doh into the carpet, you should probably intervene.

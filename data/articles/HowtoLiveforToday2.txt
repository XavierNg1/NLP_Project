 Instead of buying lunch, buy groceries and cook a meal. To buy ingredients, walk somewhere you can buy them, such as a corner store, a farmer's market, or a grocery store. Buy as many parts of the meal from scratch as you can.


For instance, if you would normally buy a chicken sandwich, consider baking bread, saut√©ing some chicken, and making fresh mayonnaise and quick pickles.
Visit a pick-your-own orchard and pick fruit that is in season. Eat some, bake some, freeze some, and make sauce from the rest.
 Living fully in the day means not filling in all the empty space. Do nothing, or do one thing at a time. When you eat, focus on your food. Let your mind wander. You are likely to remember things you need to do when your mind wanders: make a note of them, and continue doing nothing.
 So much of living in the day means allowing yourself to be open in the moment. Leave yourself vulnerable to any thoughts, senses, and feelings that come to you. Rather than interpreting or judging them, let lean into them.If you feel yourself getting worried, distracted, or unhappy, do exercises that help you regain the present.


Name the emotions that come to you. Do not shut out unpleasant thoughts or feelings, but say what they are, and what you think brought them up.
You don't need to go deep, in fact you want to avoid spiraling into negative thoughts. Negative thoughts don't usually lead anywhere but back to themselves, so it's important to recognize them and let them go.
Turn your attention to your senses. Notice what you can see, smell, hear, and feel in the moment.Feel the breath coming in and out of you. Take deep breaths and let them out slowly. Focus only on your breath for a while.Relax your whole body by tensing and relaxing each muscle in turn.

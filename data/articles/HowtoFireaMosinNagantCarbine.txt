 Many Mosin-Nagants on the market today are over 70 years old, and you must ensure that the barrel is free of obstructions and significant corrosion. Has a gunsmith checked the head space, or do you have the field "head space" gauges? Are the receiver and barrel both unblocked? Is everything clean? Check over everything before you even think about firing it.;
,, The Mosin-Nagant is a single shot, bolt action rifle with a top feed magazine which holds 5 rounds. Ammunition can be inserted into the magazine with a stripper clip, or fed in one at a time. Single rounds can also be loaded directly into the chamber. On the Stripper Clip, make sure that the rim on each cartridge is in front of the rim on the cartridge beneath it. The rifle can fail to chamber a new round if is not, even though there is a built in device to prevent such interference.
 Mosin-Nagants are typically a tight-actioned weapon, so make sure you use enough forward force to engage the bolt and push it down completely into the firing position. Often, the machining on surplus Mosin-Nagants was poor, so the bolt may be stubborn. Ignore the impulse to strike it with your hand. Instead, apply steady force to it until it breaks free.
 If safety is not engaged, align your sights exactly on your target.
 Make sure to pull straight back, not to the side. Additionally, try to use the fatty pad of your finger rather than the crease at the joint, as this improves accuracy.
 Adjust the elevation and windage of the sights accordingly.
 This will remove the "salts" that can pit them.
 This is especially true if you use most ammunition (surplus, up through mid-1970s), which is typically using Berdan Primers containing mercury perchlorate (this converts to salts after firing). However, some new ammo you buy from Wolf, etc. use non-corrosive Berdan or Boxer primers.

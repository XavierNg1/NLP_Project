 There is a shortcut in Bowser Castle in the Special Cup. When you get to the roundabout, don't use the normal exit, keep going round and you will go past lasers and get to another exit. Go through that path minding the thwomp and it will cut off the corner.;
, This only works if you have a speed mushroom. Near the beginning of a lap, there is a gap with a river flowing under it. Use the mushroom to speed over the gap and you will cut the corner. It's also possible to do it with a drift boost, but only certain karts can do this mushroom-less cut.
 There are 2 shortcuts in this race. The first one is when you get to the bridge. Use a mushroom to speed over the water to the dock. The second is over the bridge and behind a crate. You have to use a mushroom because it will slow you down otherwise.
 After the tunnel to the left is a hill and you can use a mushroom to get up that hill. Go across and back down and it will cut the corner. Mind the cars when you come back down to the road.

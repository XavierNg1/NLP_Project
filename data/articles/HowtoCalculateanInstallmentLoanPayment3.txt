 You can do this search through Google, Bing or your favorite search engine. Choose a reputable website that does not ask for any personal information. There are plenty that are easy to use that fit this profile.
 Each one works a bit differently, but they will all ask for the same information. The interest rate, loan amount and number of payments. This is listed in the loan documents.


If you are estimating payments for a loan you are considering, many of the sites also include probable interest rates for that type of loan.
 Enter the information into the boxes or cells in the loan calculator. Every site works a bit differently, but almost all of them make it easy to enter the data.
 It is always wise to double check this and make sure it makes sense. For a 12 month loan of $1,000 at a 5% interest rate, a monthly payment of $500 would not make sense. Check a second site to confirm the number if you are at all uncertain.
 Try to change some of the original data like interest rate or total loan amount to understand how each one impacts the monthly payment. This will make you a much smarter consumer if you are still searching for a loan.

 One way to find more time for your adult children is to delegate or reschedule tasks that you don’t absolutely need to do. For instance, let dusting the house wait until tomorrow so that you can head out to the theatre with your adult children. Or ask your coworker to swap assignments with you so that you can sneak out of the house to grab dinner with your adult children., One of the main reasons that families don’t spend time together is that they simply don’t make a point of getting together.Include spending time with your adult children on your planner or calendar, just as you would with any other appointment or meeting.Just call your adult child up and ask, “How would you like to get lunch on Sunday?” If they are not free Sunday, propose the following weekend or ask, “What is a day that works for you?”
Remember, everyone is busy, but you only have one life. You might regret not spending more time with your adult children if you don’t take time to do so.
 There are many reasons you might appeal to in order to justify not spending time with your adult children. Some of these reasons might even be premised on your own consideration of their time and well-being. For instance, you might think, “My kid’s busy with their own family/life, so they don’t have time to see me.” However, if you continually allow your thinking and habits to be swayed by excuses, you will end up never spending time with your adult children., In addition to random lunches or get-togethers with your adult children, set up some regular occasions when you can get together with them and their families. For instance, perhaps you and your adult children gather every Sunday, or during every first Sunday of the month to play board games or go for a bike ride.

 If your friend has no issues with mailing and receiving letters, write the "From" address as your friend's address.


Be sure you have permission from your friend first.
 PO boxes can be a bit expensive, and you may not be able to rent/access one if you're underage. However, if you receive a lot of mail and don't want the mail to go to your home address, think about a PO box.
 If your parents check the mail, get in the habit of checking your mailbox before your parents do, so you can take a look through the letters. Maybe you get a reply that you don't want your parents to find out about.


Checking the mail can also become a chore!

, The from address is not only used for postal service identification, but it is usually used for reply.


Note that if the letter cannot be delivered for any reason, it will be discarded since it has no identification.

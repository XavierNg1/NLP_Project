 When a problem asks you what a fraction of a whole number is, the problem is one of multiplication, and you need to multiply the fraction and the whole number. Look for the keyword of. When you see of in a word problem, you need to multiply.For example, if the problem asks, “What is 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294{\displaystyle 294}," you need to set up 56×294{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\times 294}.
;
, To do this, give it a denominator of 1. Remember, the denominator is the number underneath the fraction bar.

For example, you would change 294{\displaystyle 294} to 2941{\displaystyle {\frac {294}{1}}}. So the new problem becomes 56×2941{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\times {\frac {294}{1}}}.
 Remember that the numerators are the numbers above the fraction bars.

For example, 5×294=1,470{\displaystyle 5\times 294=1,470}.
 Place this number under the product of the numerators.

For example, 6×1=6{\displaystyle 6\times 1=6}, so 56×2941=1,4706{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\times {\frac {294}{1}}={\frac {1,470}{6}}}.
 To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator. This will give you your final answer as a whole number or in decimal form. If the result is not a whole number and you need the answer written in the form of a fraction, you should reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.

For example, 1,470÷6=245{\displaystyle 1,470\div 6=245}, so 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294=245{\displaystyle 294=245}.

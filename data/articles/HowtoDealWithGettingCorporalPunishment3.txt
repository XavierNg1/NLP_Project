 If you are in immediate danger and the physical harm is becoming abusive, call 9-1-1 immediately. If you are not in immediate danger but would like to employ the help of the local police, you can call your local police non-emergency line and talk to the police department about your concerns. When you call the police you will likely be filing a report. When you file a report you document the physical harm and create an official record that can be used in court.


In some localities you may even be able to file a report online.
You do not need to be 18 to file a report so do not be afraid to call the police if you need to.Unlike going to civil court, creating this sort of report may result in criminal charges being brought. If criminal charges are brought, a prosecutor may bring a case against the offender and it may result in that person being imprisoned for a period of time.
 Most states have hotlines you can call to make a report with child protective services.When you call, you will talk to an individual who will ask you some questions about the abuse. Be prepared to tell the person on the other line where you live, what your name is, and how they can get ahold of you. In addition, if you feel comfortable, you should reveal the person who has been abusing you.
 If you have been physically injured or are bleeding, you need to get to a hospital. If you are able to get yourself there, consider going alone. However, if you are not able to go by yourself, ask another parent to take you or ask a family friend. When you go to the hospital, explain how you were injured and who caused it. This should raise a red flag with the hospital and they may even be required to report the injuries.

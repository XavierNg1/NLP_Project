 Put the attorneys in the order you feel are best to worst. This will be based on your comfort level with each, their track record, and the responses of their references.
 Most private injury cases are taken on a contingent basis. This is a fee arrangement in which the attorney gets paid a percentage of the amount they get you either at settlement or at trial. If you do not get a settlement or win your case, the attorney does not get paid. Contingent fees can vary from 25% to up to 45%. Some states have limits beyond which an attorney cannot ethically charge a higher percentage. Be sure to find out if this percentage is applied to the gross or net amount won. Then net amount is the amount won minus any external costs, such as expert fees and copying charges., Be sure you know who is responsible for costs. In some cases, you can negotiate a lower contingent percentage by agreeing to pay for the costs of the case, such as expert fees and copying charges, or you can negotiate the firm to be responsible for costs by offering a higher contingency percentage. Whatever option you choose, be sure your fee agreement is in writing and that it covers both fees and costs.

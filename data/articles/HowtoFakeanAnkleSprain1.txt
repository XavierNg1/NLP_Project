 A true ankle sprain would cause pain when you put weight on your foot. To fake a sprain, you should walk with a limp and avoid putting too much weight on your ankle.;
, To seem convincing, you should pretend that moving your ankle provides you a moderate amount of pain. Your ankle is likely to be examined by a teacher, parent, or healthcare provider. They will begin by moving your ankle from side by side. When this happens, show that it is painful, but do not overact.


Overacting may seem less convincing or result in your family or doctor running tests to determine the problem.
 Avoid moving your ankle from side to side or up and down as much as possible. If a doctor or healthcare provider looks at your ankle they might compare its range of motion to that of your unhurt ankle. A true sprain would limit your range of motion in the injured ankle.

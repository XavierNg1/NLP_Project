 You're most likely to get hired if you can work any time any day; this gives you points with the managers right off the bat. If you can't give all of yourself, try to give as much as possible. Keep in mind that if you are in school, especially if you tend to procrastinate, work may interfere with your studies; don't be afraid to ask for less hours, at least give a week's notice if you are going to be absent.;
, This means having an ID (Driver's License or Passport), your Social Security Card, bank account number and other necessary documents to your work orientation. Any other documents needed will be mentioned during the interview.
 Know all of them by the book - this means the managers can count on you to be their right hand person and that's who you want to be. Don't be afraid to ask questions during your first few months, just don't ask when a manager is busy.
 They are an excellent source of information, and will begin to guide you in the proper direction. Some managers are okay with being friendly, but some may be inclined to be more professional. Respect both and remember that the manager on duty sets the tone for the shift. Don't expect special treatment just because a manager is friendly- they are still your superior, and it is their job to ensure you are doing yours.
 Even if you know how to do everything already, allow the manager(s) to show you how it's done. This may be annoying, but you may learn a thing or two you didn't already know before. You will probably start with the fry station. Cook it as you normally would, dump it into the tray, salt it and mix. The 4 sizes used are kids/value, small, medium and large (formerly Biggie). Cook quickly and make sure to not waste fries; remember, if it's not busy, only one batch per tray. The two nugget types are regular and spicy, the size choices are 4.PC, 6 piece and 10-piece, which go in the value, small and medium cartons, respectively.

 When planning your visit, you'll want to consider both the month and the day of the week in order to reduce the time spent in queues as much as possible.

Go during the off-season months. The least busy months are from April to May, and from September to November. These months have reduced wait times as they are when the park has just opened/closed, schools have gone back, and there are no special events on. Avoid going to the park in peak summer months. Every day in the summer is busy, leading to queues of up to 4 hours per ride.
Visit the park during the week if possible. The best days to go are Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays, as on these days the queues are up to four times shorter since most people are in school or at work.;
, It's important to bare travel time in mind so that you'll ensure you get to the gate on time and avoid waiting in long queues there. You can get most of the way to Thorpe Park using public transit by taking a train (or another form of transportation) to Waterloo, then hopping on a train to Reading (they leave every 20 minutes), and getting off at Staines. It's about 30 - 40 minutes if you take the slow train. Once at Staines, you have a few different options:

Take the Thorpe Park Bus, which is faster than the local bus but more expensive (£3.70 for a return).
Take the local bus, which is a bit slower, but the tickets are cheaper (£2.40 return).
Walk, but keep in mind that the park is 4.8 km (3 miles) away, so it could take up to an hour to get there.
 Fastracks enable you to skip the normal queue and enter a special, shorter queue reserved for Fastrack pass holders. If you would like to purchase a Fastrack, it's a good idea to pre-order them online before you go, as the park only sells a limited amount of them each day and they often get sold out.

 Click Start and select Log Out or Switch User. This will take you to the Welcome screen, where you can select a user.


If you are the only user of your computer, chances are that your account is already an Administrator account. You can double-check by opening the Control Panel and selecting User Accounts. Find your account and look for the words "Computer administrator" in the account description.
 When you are on the Welcome screen, press Ctrl+Alt+Del twice to open the Windows NT login window.
 If you created an administrator account, enter in the account name and password to log in. If a dedicated administrator account was never created, type "Administrator" into the "User name" field and leave the Password field blank.

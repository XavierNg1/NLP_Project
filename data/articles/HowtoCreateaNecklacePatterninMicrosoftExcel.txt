 However, a basic understanding of design principles, such as what happens to a curve when one adds to it versus when one multiplies to it, would be helpful. Here, a basic adjustment is added to the Garthwaite Curve. That adjustment happens to be {0,0} but the user is encouraged to substitute their own values and observe the effects of so doing.

Edit Go To cell range E4:F1444 and, using either the Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Chart, All/Other, Scatter - Smooth Line Scatter. If not using Chart Wizard, a small chart should appear atop the data. Copy or Cut and Paste the Chart to the Chart worksheet you create anew now, into cell A1, and expand the chart by hovering over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes the double-headed arrow allowing one to pull down and to the right the chart, expanding it. Using Chart Layout, Select Data Series 1 and Format Selection Line Weight 1. Then select the Plot Area and format Fill grey. Then format Chart Area sky blue fill. Insert Picture WordArt whatever text you feel is appropriate, and format it by clicking on the Home Ribbon tab and using the edit tools.
Hold down the shift key and copy picture to the Saves worksheet to be created anew, along with the formulas and pasted values from the top rows of the Data worksheet.
It would be a good idea to Insert New Comment on the original values and formulas of the Data worksheet so that renormalization is a few steps away. Done.

 Set two baking sheets inside the oven. Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius). Allow both the pans and the oven to fully preheat.To make cleanup easier, you may want to line the baking sheets with foil or parchment paper.
 Place 4 turnips that have been peeled and cut into ½-inch (13-mm) sticks in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil, and toss well so that the turnip fries are well coated.While olive oil provides the best flavor, you can substitute canola or vegetable oil if you prefer.
 When the fries are coated with the oil, mix in 2 tablespoons (10 g) of grated Parmesan cheese and ¼ teaspoon (2 g) of garlic salt. Stir the turnips well to ensure that they’re evenly seasoned.If you like, you can add other spices or seasonings to the fries. Crushed red pepper adds a spicy kick.
 Once the fries are seasoned, use a potholder to carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the fries out on each in a single layer, and allow them to bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.Because the pans will be very hot, take care when handling them so you don’t burn yourself.
 After 15 minutes, use a spatula to turn the turnip fries over and rotate the pans. Let the them bake for another 8 minutes, or until they are a golden brown., When the fries are finished baking, remove the pans from the oven. Transfer the turnips to a platter and serve while they are still hot.You can serve the fries with your favorite dipping sauce, but a parmesan aioli is an ideal option.

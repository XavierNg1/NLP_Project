If you want to imitate any of the other characters: the link to the full list can be found in Sources and Citations.;

 If you want to appear bald, cover it with a rubber cap instead of shaving it off. Another option is to look up the character's hair color and hairstyle.

 Watch any episode of South Park to get the hang of it, and practice in front of a mirror.

 The first thing you need to do is to think positive! Think of something that they won't think of in a thousand years!


How are they abusing you? There are many ways they abuse you mentally and physically. They abuse mentally by: Telling you you are not pretty or handsome, calling you names, swearing at you. They abuse physically by: Punching, kicking, or slapping you.;
, If you are mentally abused go to steps 4-6, if you are physically abused go to steps 7-10.
 Here's how to handle it. You have to think of some way that you can think to yourself, I am opposite of everything they say, since they say bad things about you.
 You might be able to use that against them. Say you are known to hang out with boys, if you are a girl, and the other girls don't like that, so they start picking on you saying stuff like, "Wow! Way to flirt...." You can say back, "No, I call it having guy friends, and that is something you don't have, so get over it," and walk away.
, Here's how to handle it. If they go up to you and start pushing you around, say, "Hey enough OK? I am tired of you picking on me." And get up in his/her face. If they tell you, "No I don't have to back away from you," And they push you again, walk away.
 Walking away is the easiest thing to do. Even though you might get pushed again, keep walking until you get in front of the principal's office, and if they push you again, try to get the principal to notice, they will do something about it.
 This might be the hardest thing you have to do in your life, but standing up to them and trying to become their equal without touching them is the best way to show them that you are not a punching bag, you are a human being and you want some respect.

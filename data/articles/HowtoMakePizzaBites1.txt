 Get out a mini muffin pan and spray it with non-stick baking spray. Set it aside for later use. As you are doing this, preheat the oven to 400°F (204.5°C).A regular muffin pan is okay to use as well if you don’t have a mini muffin pan.;
, Roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Cut the dough into 24 triangles. The triangles should be around the same size as if you were using a round glass or cookie cutter, but with three pointed edges. Put each triangle into a cup in the muffin pan. Leave two ends of the triangles sticking out of the pan so that you can remove them from the pan easier later on. Only a small portion of the ends need to stick out because the dough will expand as it cooks., First, put one tablespoon of tomato sauce into each cup of dough. Then, put pepperoni on top of each dough triangle. Add in the rest of the ingredients, like the olives and mushrooms. Finish by topping each dough with mozzarella sauce and parsley., Put the mini muffin pan in the oven and bake for fifteen minutes. The bites should be cooked through, and the dough should be browned when they are finished baking. Allow them to cool for a few minutes and serve warm.Cover the leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for no longer than a few days.

 Add 1 cup (125 g) of self-raising flour and 1 cup (300 g) table salt to a bowl. Use a spoon or fork to blend the two together completely.








To get the puffy texture, you must use self-raising flour in the paint.
Use regular table salt for the paint. Sea and kosher salts are coarser, and may alter the texture of the paint.
 Once the flour and salt are fully mixed, slowly stir water into the bowl. You can add up to 1 cup (237), but only mix in enough to create a smooth thin paste that has a similar texture to yogurt.








If the paint thickens up at any point when you’re using it, you can simply mix a few drops of water into it to thin it out again.
 When the flour mixture has the proper consistency, separate it between several bowls. Add a different color food coloring to each bowl and mix well to create several different shades of paint.








Start by adding a small amount of food coloring and seeing how you like the color. If you want a deeper color, add more food coloring.
 When you’re happy with the color of the paints, use a paintbrush or cotton swabs to paint it in a design that you like. Use heavy paper or thin cardboard because the paint may soak through thin paper.








Allow the painting to dry for several hours to overnight to ensure that the paint is set.

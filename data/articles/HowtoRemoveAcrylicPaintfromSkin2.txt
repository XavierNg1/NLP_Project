 Wet the affected area with warm water to loosen the paint and lather up with a mild liquid detergent. Get as much of the paint off as you can using the soap and water. Dry the area thoroughly with a towel before applying baby oil.


Due to the repellent relationship between water and various oils, the baby oil will have trouble working if the skin is still wet., Squeeze an ounce or two of baby oil directly onto the paint spot and massage it into the skin. Work the dried paint away with the tips of your fingers, or with a cotton ball or sponge if the stain is particularly stubborn. Baby oil is proficient at breaking up and dissolving dried-on acrylic and oil-based paints.Baby oil is one option that is much gentler and more beneficial to the skin than paint removers that use harsh chemicals as their primary agents.Using a mildly abrasive implement like a cotton ball or sponge will help scour paint out of the deeper contours of the skin.
 Run some warm water over the area again to wash away the dissolving paint. If necessary, use another dab of baby oil on remaining stains. In addition to erasing tough paint spots, the baby oil will also leave your skin feeling smooth and moisturized.

 Made of rubber, it can stay in your body for 12 – 14 hours at a time (so you won’t have to take it out at school) and can provide you with the ultimate in privacy. With a menstrual cup, no one at school would know you’re having your period. Keep in mind that they are uncomfortable for some people — the only way you know if it will work for you is to try it out., Look for a sweatshirt or jacket with an inner zippered pocket. Place your smallest pad or tampon inside so you don’t have to take anything different with you into the bathroom. This can help you keep your privacy.
 This could work in either your backpack or your locker. Keep tissues in the container as well, but hide your supplies inside. You can wrap a tissue around the pad or tampon and take it with you from class to the bathroom.
 If you can’t see through the bottle, people won’t know that it contains your supplies, and you can easily take it with you to the bathroom. Make sure that you’re allowed to have pain relievers at your school and that your bottle wouldn’t be confiscated.

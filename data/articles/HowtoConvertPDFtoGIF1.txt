 "Preview" is a default picture-viewing app; the icon resembles a couple of photos with a circular viewing glass on top of them.


If Preview isn't your default PDF-viewing app, you'll need to click and drag your PDF over to the Preview icon and drop it there to open it in Preview.;
, This option is to the right of the "Preview" text.
, The Format option won't display obscure file formats by default; holding down the Option key when clicking Format bypasses this tendency and gives you the option of saving as a GIF.The "Option" key is nestled between Control and âŒ˜ Command at the bottom of your keyboard.
 You can also rename your file and choose a save destination from here.
 You have successfully converted your PDF to GIF format!

 Boil about one cup (240 mL) of water and then add two bags of chamomile tea. Allow it to steep, becoming a potent tea.Chamomile, like lemon juice, has the ability to naturally lighten hair. Because it is not acidic, it is more gradual and less damaging to your hair., For this recipe, you’ll want to juice three large lemons. Slice them into halves and squeeze them over a container. Watch for any seeds that fall into the juice, and remove them.If you have a hand juicer, you can use it to make this step a bit easier.
 By adding one tablespoon (14.79 mL) of coconut oil or almond oil to your lemon juice, you’ll help protect your hair against damage. The oil provides moisture and nourishment, which will help counteract the drying properties of lemon juice. Then, mix in one teaspoon (4.93 mL) of cinnamon. Cinnamon has lightening properties, so it will work with the chamomile and lemon juice to lighten up those strands., The best way to do this is to pour everything into a spray bottle and shake. If you do not have an empty spray bottle to use, you can simply mix everything together in a bowl. Stir thoroughly.
 Only put it on the areas of hair you wish to lighten. You can spray it all over your head, or select strands to highlight. Apply it before you head outdoors, and the sunshine will activate the lighteners, helping to lift pigment and lighten your hair. The oil will help to keep your hair hydrated and healthy.

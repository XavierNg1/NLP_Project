 Though making new friends is part of the fun of going out, you should avoid giving too much personal information to someone you just met, unless that person has been vouched for -- like if she's the best friend of one of your best friends. But even then, be on the look out. Do not mention that you came alone. Say you are waiting for friends to arrive or someone is picking you up soon.


If you meet someone you like, make plans to meet in a coffee shop, at a restaurant, or at an amusement park, rather than giving out your home address or place of work.
Don't mention exactly where you live, even in passing.
Giving out your cell phone number is okay if you want to. The main idea is that you take time to really know this person and get a feel for the real guy or girl, not just that first impression.
 Remember that good people are like sunny days - there are lots of them. Just because you're being careful doesn't mean you need to be afraid that everyone is out there thinking about how to get one over on you. Be prepared - not paranoid. Remembering that there are more sunny days than days when lightning strikes is useful. Lightning is dangerous, maybe deadly - but rare.
 If you want to stay safe and not make yourself a target, have a blast, whether you're with girlfriends or by yourself. People will be less likely to take advantage of you if you look like the life of the party instead of hanging out by yourself in the corner. And remember to relax once you're in a safe environment -- you won't have a good time if you don't. Once you've reached your destination, settle in and resolve to have a good time, no matter what.

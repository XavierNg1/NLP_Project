 Try to choose herbs that you like to cook with, such as basil or chives. You may also want to buy more than one of each type of herb, in case some of them do not make it.
 Don't go any larger, or the young plant will spend too much energy on expanding its root system, and less energy on growing tasty leaves.Try to choose a terracotta pot. It will keep the soil from becoming waterlogged and moldy.


Most nursery herbs will come in cheap, plastic pots. These pots are temporary. Herbs (and other plants) are not meant to grow in these pots for long periods of time.
 Do not use a pot without drainage holes. This is important. If the pot does not have proper drainage, the water will sit and cause the roots to rot.
 Ideally, the soil should also contain some vermiculite or perlite to help the soil drain better. Some gardeners will also recommend soil meant for growing vegetables, because it helps the herbs produce bigger, healthier leaves.


If you bought basil, rosemary, or thyme, consider adding a spoonful of crumbled eggshells. This will help raise the soil pH, which these plants prefer.
 Loosen the soil by gently tapping on the sides of the pot or by squeezing the sides of the pot. If there is a drain hole, try pushing up through it to nudge the plant out of the pot. Turn the plant on its side and allow it to slide out. The entire plant, roots, and a good chunk of soil should come out.
 Dig a hole in the soil large enough for the roots to fit into. Carefully slide the herb into the hole. Pat the soil around the herb. When you are done, water the herb until the soil is damp, but not soaking wet.
 Don't worry if the leaves turn droopy at first. This is simply the plant adjusting to its new home.To learn how to further care for your herbs, click here.

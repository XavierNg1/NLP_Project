 This is the most important step. If a 4.0 is your number one priority, you will get it. This means you will be ready to sacrifice things such as going out with friends, keeping up with your favorite television shows, and sometimes sleeping.;
, If attendance is part of the grade, always show up. You should attend class regularly regardless if attendance is required.
 This means study consistently (it may be daily) and don't crash study. Learning to study for long periods of time is an important skill as well. It may be hard or impossible at first, but it can be mastered.
 Only go out when you don't have work to do.
, However, if you are at a point where you are not sleeping regularly, a job may be a good thing to cut out. I recommend finding a job where you can study like university library or secretary position.
 Take a hard class or two with two easy classes. Don't take chemistry, calculus, zoology and trig all in the same semester. Be careful of the tricky 1 or 2 credit courses. They can be very time consuming, even more so than a 3 or 4 credit class. Sometimes, you will have to take a full course (generally after higher level major classes have started and gen eds have ended), and a study schedule becomes critical.
 You are there to learn so don't moan about going to class -- see it as an opportunity to improve yourself. Take pride in your commitment to your studies. However, do not neglect the fact that you will become depressed and will have no friends if all you ever do is study. Staying sane is half the battle, and having friends should remain a priority.

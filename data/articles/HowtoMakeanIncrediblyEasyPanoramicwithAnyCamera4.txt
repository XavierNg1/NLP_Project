 Tap on the camera icon or press the button on your phone to start your camera.



The exact location of the Options menu varies from phone to phone, but there should be an option to take panoramic photos there.
 Once the panorama option is active, you will see an arrow on your screen. Move the phone across your subject in the direction of the arrow.


Stay as close as you possibly can to the center line.
 Once youâ€™ve shot what you wanted, simply click on the Done button. Your phone will stitch your photos into a panorama automatically.

You can view the image among your other photographs.

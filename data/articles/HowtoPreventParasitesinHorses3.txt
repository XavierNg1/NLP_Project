 When horses defecate in their stalls, parasite larvae can crawl up the sides of the stall walls. If your horse licks the walls, it could ingest the larvae and become infected. Clean the stall to prevent parasite infections.At a minimum, muck the stalls once a day. Tips for cleaning horse stalls are below:Use proper cleaning equipment: metal pitchfork, broom, scrub brush, a large bucket to hold the manure, and a wheelbarrow.
Keep your horse out of the stall when cleaning. Either tie up your horse outside the stall or put it out on pasture.
Remove the manure with the pitchfork and place the manure in the wheelbarrow. Sift the bedding through the pitchfork to minimize how much bedding you need to replace.
Clean the water bucket with clean water and a scrub brush.
For an intensive cleaning, remove everything from the stall to sweep and disinfect the floors and walls. Disinfect the water bucket as well. Allow the stall to dry completely before restocking the stall. 10% bleach is a good disinfectant.
 If your horse eats off the ground, it could ingest parasite larvae while eating. To prevent this, put your horse’s food in a rack or trough.Clean the rack or trough regularly with clean water and a scrub brush., Adult bot flies tend to lay their eggs on the insides of a horse’s knees, where a horse could easily lick them up.The eggs are tiny and white. To remove them, you can use a fine-toothed comb or a dull blade.


If you use a dull blade, be careful not nick your horse’s skin and cause bleeding.
Bot knifes are also available that can remove the eggs. In addition, you could use sandpaper or a synthetic stone grooming block.

 Notice if they're becoming very drunk, or if they're being cornered by someone who won't leave them alone. This way, you can swoop in if you see trouble.


Women are most likely to be raped, but men and non-binary people can also become victims. Keep an eye out for all your friends.
Never leave someone behind!;
, If you're in public, getting in between the assailant and victim is usually enough to delay or stop the issue.
 In social situations such as parties, you can use common courtesy to intervene. This will cut off the potential rapist, as they would have to seriously break social rules in order to continue.


"Do you want to get some air?"
"I love this song! Come on, let's dance."
"Do you want a ride home? I can call you a cab."
"Erica! Hey, how have you been? I haven't seen you in forever!" (You can do this to strangers too. They will play along out of gratitude.)

, Most potential rapists aren't ready to shoot anyone who gets in their way; they're just pushy, entitled people who think they can get away with taking what they want. Show them that they'll be met with resistance, and their resolve usually falls apart.


"Knock it off. She said no."
"He can hardly walk. Leave him alone. My friends and I will take him home."
"Excuse me, sir? Your car's being towed."

, You can ask your friends, or friends of one of the parties involved, to help out. You may also wish to involve the bartender, the host of the party, or a security guard. Don't be afraid to call campus security or the police.


In the United States, if you, the victim, and/or many bystanders are people of color, you may have concerns about the police killing or brutalizing you instead of focusing on the crime. This is not fair or right, but it is a possibility you will have to weigh when deciding whether to call.
 Turn off the music or the lights. This will distract the potential rapist and make it clear to everyone that there's a problem here.

About 3 pounds (1.4 kg) watermelon with the rind and seeds removed, cut into large chunks
2 ripe tomatoes, cored and cut into wedges
2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice
Salt and black pepper
4 ounces (110 g) crumbled feta cheese

1⁄4 cup (59 ml) olive oil

1⁄2 cup (120 ml) chopped basil or mint, for garnish

, You can blend until smooth or keep the mixture at a chunky texture for this recipe, depending on your preference. Add the garlic clove first and pulse the blender a few times to chop it.
Add 3 lb chopped watermelon, 2 chopped ripe tomatoes, 2 T lemon juice, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.
Blend the mixture until it is smooth or chunky. You can add a few ice cubes during this process to keep the blender working.

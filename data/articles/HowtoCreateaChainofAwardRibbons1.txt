 The ribbon or string must be strong and of a suitable length.
 Lay the award ribbons down, side by side. Do you want them right next to each other, or with a gap between them? This should be included in the final measurement. Also leave a little bit extra at each end of the ribbon or string, for hanging with.,, There are several possible ways for doing this, including these ones:

Attach the award ribbons from any loop or hanger the ribbons have; or attach a loop to them.
If the award ribbons don't have a hole in them, you might consider punching one into it and threading it onto the ribbon or string.
Just staple or tape the award ribbons to the ribbon or string length.
Clip in place using small hair clips, paperclips or small stationery clips.
 And you're done!

 In a pan, slightly heat the oil.Add the gram flour and ajwain seeds to the heated oil. Take care to not allow the oil to get too hot and burn the gram flour.
 Occasionally stir the mixture. Remove the pan from the heat once you see the gram flour turn a slight brown color.
 Add another tablespoon of sunflower oil to the chicken mixture. Allow the whole mixture to marinate in the fridge for another 30 minutes.

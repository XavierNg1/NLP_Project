Join an affiliate program network (Clickbank or Commission Junction). Affiliate programs are when you will advertise a product for a specific seller. Every person that is forwarded to the seller’s website through your advertising, you will make a percentage of the profit, it’s that simple. The seller will provide you specifically coded links that you can post anywhere on the internet, and these links will refer back to your program every time someone uses them. On your blog you can have PPC ads which generate revenue for you. After a while, it’s money straight into your pocket.;
, This is where Myspace comes in. With Myspace, you can use bulletins, messages, or comments to post these links, but you have to do so carefully and discretely. You don’t want it to look like spam. So you need to create a good profile on Myspace that looks attractive.
 With a large friend list, you can reach all of your friends with the push of a button. This is where it can become tedious and boring.
 Now, here's where it can get tricky. You don’t want to make the bulletins seem like huge advertisements. So one method some use is to make up an interesting story that will make other Myspacers want to follow your link. Sometimes, it's even a good idea to create a landing page with some non-advertising information on it, and stick your affiliate link on that page. It might save you from being flagged for spam.
 If one type of bulletin is not working, try changing it around, or changing your landing page.

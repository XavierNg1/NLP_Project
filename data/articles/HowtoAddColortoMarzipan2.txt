 Cover your cake or form the marzipan decorations you want to use while the marzipan is still in the state of its natural color.
 Allow the marzipan to dry overnight.This makes a good surface to paint on, one that is not too moist.


Choose a dry, cool place - do not refrigerate., Choose your food coloring medium based on the strength of hue you want to achieve.


Liquid food coloring is water-based and produces lighter colors than paste.Paste has the strongest color.For a subtle, more delicate color, use powdered coloring., Wear disposable food preparation gloves and an apron or smock., Adding water allows you to achieve the color you want and a thinner consistency.Put a bit of food coloring in the bottom of a bowl.
Using your paintbrush, add water from a cup into the bowl until the food coloring is as diluted as you desire.
 Dip a paintbrush into the diluted food coloring paint you have just created, and brush it on the marzipan figures.


You can dip the paintbrush directly into undiluted food coloring to add strong definition to certain details â€“ for example, the lines in a petal or leaf., For a watercolor effect, dilute clear, alcohol-based imitation vanilla with a small amount of water in a dish.Pick up powdered coloring with a paintbrush and swirl it into the water and vanilla mixture.
Apply to the marzipan with a paintbrush to create shading and/or the illusion of texture.
 You can achieve even more detail by adding petal dust to the coloring.The marzipan should be already shaped but not yet dry.Pour some petal powder onto a saucer.
Use a clean, dry paintbrush to add luster to the marzipan.

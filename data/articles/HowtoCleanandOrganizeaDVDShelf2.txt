 Use the sorting approach suggested in the previous method above to further divide the movies and TV shows by category (family, children, etc). By having piles of each genre or type of movie/TV show, you can simply work across piles per folder.
 These can be purchased from music stores, storage stores, etc. Allot a folder per genre or type of movie/TV show as decided by your sorting piles. Check that each folder will be able to contain all the DVDs from each pile; if not, allot more folders to each pile as needed.
 Handle with care so as to avoid dropping them or placing fingerprints all over them.
 Stick to one genre or type per folder, to make it easy to find movies and shows again.


It can be helpful to remove the case front labels, cut them to fit the folder and place them in the folder behind the relevant DVD. That way, you'll be able to find the right location to return the disk with ease. This also alerts you to missing DVDs, just by looking.
 If you intend storing the folders on their sides, a label should be added down the spine too, to make it easier to locate the DVDs when searching for something to watch.

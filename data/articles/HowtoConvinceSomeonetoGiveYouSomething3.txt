 If you are overly stressed, you will not appear confident. You have to present yourself in a calm and collected manner for another person to trust you and want to give you something. Take a few deep breaths and relax before talking to them.You can also give yourself a pep talk. Say to yourself, "I deserve to get a raise. I'm going to be confident and respectful when I make my request."

, Take some time to get your thoughts in order. You can make notes, if necessary. For example, if you want to borrow several things from a friend, write them down so that you don't forget.

Your notes can also include things about why you are making the request, and how it could benefit both of you.
 Avoid using filler words like “uhm” or “well.” These words make your request less concise and make you appear less confident. You should say what you want in the clearest way possible.For example, instead of saying, “Well, uhm, I would really like it if you would give me, uh, that poster,” you should say “Can I have that poster?”

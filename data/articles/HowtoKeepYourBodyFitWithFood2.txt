 Foods rich in dietary fiber help you control your hunger and lose weight in a number of ways.


High fiber foods have a higher "chew factor." Put simply, they take longer to eat, increasing your sense of satisfaction.
Foods that are high in fiber take longer to exit your digestive tract. This means you feel fuller longer.
Foods containing soluble fiber such as oatmeal and beans help to stabilize your blood sugar over the course of the day. This means you don't feel as hungry.
Fiber also helps to lower cholesterol in some individuals and bulk stool for better digestive health.
 Dietary fiber is found in a wide variety of foods, so adding this important element to your diet may be easier than you imagine. Try high-fiber cereals, beans, vegetables, nuts and seeds, and fruits., While your body functions best on a high fiber diet, if you haven't previously been eating much fiber it will need time to adjust. Start by introducing one high fiber element and then continue to improve your diet incrementally. You may replace your low-in-fiber corn flakes with a raisin bran cereal, for example, and then wait a few days before introducing salad with your lunch.

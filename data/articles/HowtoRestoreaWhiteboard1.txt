, WD-40 is a light oil that will keep the board slick. This allows you to write on it without the ink drying into the board and leaving permanent marks. While it may make the board a bit slippery, it will be usable., When done, dry everything with a paper towel. The board should feel a little slick with the oil, but it should not be pooling up anywhere or visible. Wipe in a circular motion to ensure the whole board is evenly coated.

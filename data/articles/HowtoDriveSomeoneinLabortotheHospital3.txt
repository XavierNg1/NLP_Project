 If you're prepared to drive the woman to the hospital and there doesn't seem to be a medical emergency, you can certainly do so. But, if it will take you more than 15 minutes to get to the hospital and something seems to be unusual with the labor, you should call an ambulance. To call an ambulance:Give the woman's details, address, and phone number. Be calm and clear when giving the information. Explain the medical emergency and follow any directions that the emergency dispatcher gives you.
 If you're on the way to the hospital, but it doesn't look like you'll make it before the woman delivers the baby, pull off to the side of the road. Call 911 and follow their instructions until help arrives.Keep in mind that you probably won't need to deliver the baby yourself, but it may be helpful to know the basics of how to deliver a baby just in case.
 Call for help or someone to drive you to the hospital. If you feel like the baby may be coming, get down on the ground and try to find a towel or blanket to wrap the baby in. Remain calm until help comes.Don't hesitate to call the hospital you intend to deliver at and ask for an ambulance if no one can drive you to the hospital and you're in labor.

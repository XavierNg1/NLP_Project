 The routine will help you settle in and feel less intimidated by the change in schedule. If you wake up early, you will have more time so you don't feel rushed.


If you finish your routine early, then you have free time! Do one of your absolute favorite things, such as your special interest, until it's time to go. Set an alarm or ask a family member to remind you when it's time to go.
 Wearing something you love can give you a confidence boost and help you feel ready to face the day.


Try wearing something that has stimming possibilities, like a soft fabric, a hoodie with strings, or a bracelet you can fiddle with.
 Being early will help you find your first class and get settled in. Bring along a favorite book to read once you have found your class.


Make sure that you have figured out where you need to go. It may be to your first class straightaway, or it may be going to Special Ed.
 The first day is usually pretty casual. You don't have to push yourself, nor do you need to feel bad if everything goes perfectly. You have plenty of time to settle in, get to know people (if you want), and find a routine that works for you.

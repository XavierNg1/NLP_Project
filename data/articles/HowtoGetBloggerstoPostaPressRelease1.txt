 This is a hard balance to create; however, it is important that it is not bland, but also not too poetic or cliched. Figure out 3 to 5 keywords that should appear a few times in your press release that explain the industry, the brand and the product.


A blogger wants to feature top quality content. Your press release must be top quality, with a short but catchy description of the product or event. Include links to exceptional pictures, quotes and other exclusive content.;
, There are a number of things this could entail, including coupon codes, good affiliate marketing percentages, free tickets or products, exclusive content to feature on their website or another creative idea. A blogger wants to see the benefit in advertising your press release for the blog and the readers.
 Include the following things in your press release to make it more valuable:


Include quotes. Quotes from the people creating the product allow bloggers to have a piece of "on the record" information right from the source. It is better to have the information straight from the source than for a blogger to have to guess why you have done what you've done.
Always provide additional information. Let the reader know where they can learn more. The blogger should be able to do additional research instead of just giving 1 story. Connect the press release to what is going on in the world, community and other stories.

 In order to get a good view of the ROI, you must add up the investment, which is usually the price of the ad, the labor used to create it and any other software or web programming required to track the ad.


The cost of general website tracking may seem like a large investment at first, but it shouldn't be reflected as an investment for a single ad. This upfront investment will allow you to track many ads at once, so you may choose to split the investment over a series of ads when you calculate return on investment.
 New advertising campaigns should be checked at least a few times per week, if not daily. Ask this person to regularly gather data on your campaign's metrics that can be used for reports.
 Divide the return or sales figures for a period by the cost of the ad during that period. This percentage is your ROI.


If you are not selling products on your site, then you should monetize your metrics to figure out the ROI. For example, if you are gathering contacts in a database, establish how much each person's information sells for and multiply that by the number of people in the new database. If you are looking for an increase in page views, divide the number of new views by the investment cost to get a ratio of cost per view.
 Calculate the ROI for all your advertising campaigns for the same period. Rate their effectiveness and remove all ads that are not profitable or give very little ROI.

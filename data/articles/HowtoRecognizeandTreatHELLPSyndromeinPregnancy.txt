 Particular reason for HELLP pregnancy has not been known yet. No doctor or physician can tell that why this happens. But at the same time there are various symptoms of this disease which can alert a woman to seek treatment. Some of these symptoms are as follows:


Severe pain in the abdominal area.
Severe and constant headache.;
, If you feel any of these symptoms in the final trimester, visit your doctor at once. The doctor may order additional blood tests to look for other signs of HELLP such as:


Increased number of protein molecules in the urine.
Increased blood pressure.
Disturbed level of enzymes of liver.
Decreased number of platelets.
, Although no particular cause is known as yet, there are certain risk factors for this disease in pregnant women. These reasons are mentioned below:


Pregnant women more than 40 years old
Previous history of HELLP
Obesity
Twin or multiple pregnancy
First pregnancy
Hypertension

, There are many treatments available for this problem.


The principal treatment can be the sudden, early delivery of your baby to save him from the disease. This disease is harmful for your growing baby as it can stop the growth of your baby. As well as bringing about increased blood pressure in the mother, it reduces the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby and that ultimately leads to the reduced growth of the baby.
If the mother is facing bleeding due to reduced number of platelets, then a blood transfusion is the way to overcome the syndrome.
If the situation is not too severe, then steroids can be helpful in decreasing the seriousness of this disease.

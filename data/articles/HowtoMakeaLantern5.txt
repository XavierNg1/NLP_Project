, To do this, fold the top of the bag over in a slow, circular motion, moving around the bag.
 Pull out the gussets (the folded-in parts) on both sides of the bag and work the bone folder around the top fold until the fold is clean and the bag is flat (with the gussets out and flat too)., Use a pencil to stencil in a design on the front of the bag, then cut out the shape with a craft knife. Place a piece of cardboard inside the bag as you cut to protect the back of the bag.


If you don’t want to make a design on the bag, you can move down to the step in which you add grommets to the sides of the bag.
 Place 1 grommet in the middle of each side of your bag, roughly 1/2-inch down from the top of the bag. To find the center, use the crease from the mid-line of the gusset as your guide.


Note that it’s not necessary to hang your lantern. Some people simply drop a tea light into a white bag and leave it at that!

, To fasten the wire securely to the bag, pull it through the grommet and then twist the end of the wire upwards along the rest of the wire.


Before you had a tea light to the bag, make sure that the wire is securely fastened to the bag.
 An electric tea light is highly recommended, as a regular tea light can pose a fire hazard, particularly if the lantern is hung somewhere where it might be jostled.

, If you are already in your destination country, you may be able to find hostels through print media such as the local telephone directory. You may also be able to find hostel items posted on bulletin boards or in local newspapers.
 Today's travel publishers offer a treasure trove of information for those who want authoritative advice on lodgings, entertainment, legal issues, health and safety topics, and almost anything else under the sun for planning a European vacation. Popular travel titles can get you great recommendations on hostels almost anywhere on the continent or across the channel in the UK.
 In many European cities, there are individuals who will meet you in the old city or wherever tourists arrive from the urban metro line to guide you toward a specific hostel. Travelers should use their best judgment in taking these recommendations, since not all of the smaller hostels are completely legitimate. However, you may be able to get a recommendation from a local shopkeeper or someone in the area who does know about which local hostels are the best.
 Individual national or provincial governments might maintain a list of hostels in their region. A general site for the European Union also offers a wealth of information on European hostels as a whole.

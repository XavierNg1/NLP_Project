, etc. Do not confuse these bands with true Hardcore/Gabber, such as Angerfist, Neophyte and Art of Fighters. These bands are significantly better than the type of hardcore you will be listening to, and if you mix styles and start listening to gabber by mistake, you will be far too hardcore to be hardcore.
 Is it also acceptable to wear tight black jeans or low distressed jeans, with a studded-black belt. For the shoes, either skate shoes by DC or Emerica, or low top basketball shoes, and an ill fittingÂ ' band t-shirt. Optional is a band hoodie, and an army (box) cap, with writing or a sticker still on the Brim (Volcom, Atticus and Stussy have a great range).
 For example "mosh for glory, fight dance to hurt people". But don't fake it, if you're not feeling it, or you will get flamed on the boards.
,, Use "hXc" as often as possible.
 The more the better.
 Not only is it real HxC, but very respectable in modern society.
 Use the gym, a lot.
 Being HxC doesn't mean being a total jerk. Respect is the number one rule in Australia Hardcore

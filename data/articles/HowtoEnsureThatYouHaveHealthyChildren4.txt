 Diets high in saturated fats and trans fats are a major contributor to childhood obesity. Fats are a necessary component of a healthy diet, but it’s important to distinguish the good from the bad. Favor unsaturated fats from fish, avocados, snd nuts as well as sunflower, canola and olive oils. Reduce saturated fats from butter, palm oil, cheese, cream, ghee, lard, and fatty meats. Do your best to avoid altogether processed foods high in trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil), namely most fast food, packaged snack food, fried food, pizza, pastries, spreads, and margarine., Non-natural sugars added to soft drinks, many juices, most processed sweets, and processed foods in general are known to be major contributors to childhood obesity and diabetes.Added sugars tend to be found most commonly in processed snack foods. If you’re serving or packing a snack for your child, go for fresh fruits, nuts, and raw vegetables instead of canned drinks with added sugar or potato chips, pretzels, and similar packaged foods.
 Most people consume about twice as much sodium (9-12g) than recommended daily doses (5g), and children are particularly vulnerable if they have a diet high in processed snacks and meats. Excessive sodium intake combined with insufficient potassium levels elevates blood pressure. Increase your child’s potassium intake by serving plenty of vegetables, fruits (especially avocados and bananas) and nuts, and avoid processed meats such as cold cuts, bacon, plus salty snacks and cheeses., Foods rated as having a high glycemic load cause unhealthy fluctuations in blood sugar levels, which have been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Foods with a low-to-medium glycemic load include whole grain bread, wheat tortillas, muesli, oatmeal, skim milk, apples, pears, watermelon, cashews, peanuts, green peas, carrots, and parsnips.

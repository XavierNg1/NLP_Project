 In the fashion previously described, heat water, blend the heated water and shredded coconut, and strain it into a bowl. After that, you're ready to add your syrup ingredients to the mixture.
 Put your salt, coconut palm sugar, cacao powder, vanilla, and sunflower lecithin into your coconut milk. Whisk these ingredients until the mixture is consistent throughout.


You can substitute maple syrup (Â¼ cup or more, depending on your taste) for the coconut palm sugar., A sealable container with a pour spout or nozzle works well for storage. Before serving the milk, give the container a shake while the lid is closed.


Shaking the container before serving will stir up any ingredients that may have settled to the bottom.

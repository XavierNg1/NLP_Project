 By default in newer versions, the debug information has been reduced. you can enable the full debug screen from the Options menu.


Open the Options menu and select "Chat Settings." Disable "Reduced Debug Info.";
, This will display a readout of debug information for Minecraft. The key is typically F3, but this may vary depending on your computer:For desktop PCs, pressing F3 will open the debug screen.
For many laptops and Mac computers, you'll need to press Fn+F3.
On newer Mac computers, you'll need to press Alt+Fn+F3.
 You'll see a lot of information on the debug readout. Simple coordinates are labeled "Block," while the detailed coordinates are labeled "XYZ." You'll also see a "Facing" entry which will tell you which direction you are currently facing.
 Your location is determined based off of the starting block for your Minecraft world. The "Block" entry displays the three coordinate numbers (XYZ) without labels.


"X" is your location to the east or west of your starting block (longitude).
"Y" is your location above or below the starting block (elevation).
"Z" is your location to the north or south of your starting block (latitude).
 This will help you grasp how the coordinate system works. If the "X" value is negative, you're to the west of the starting block. If the "Z" value is negative, you're north of your starting block.


While you typically start at X,Z:0,0 (unless that block is in the water), your starting location's Y value will typically be around 63, since this is the sea level.

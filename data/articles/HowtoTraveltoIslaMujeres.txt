 Though Isla Mujeres has a very small private planes airport, the usual method for tourists is to fly into Cancun, Mexico, and then catch the high-speed ferry over to the island. Flights and hotels can be booked through your local travel agent, or for additional savings, one of the premier online travel websites.;
, Originally, son's of local fisherman would take small launches over to the mainland and pick up visitors for their stay on the island. Eventually, Isla Mujeres established a regular ferry service, making runs to Puerto Juarez once or twice a day and in the last few years, every half hour.
 There are luxury accommodations on the island from $500.00 plus per night to moderately priced hotels $80.00-$175.00 per night. There is even an international hostel that includes a continental breakfast and starts at $7.00 per night to $33.00 per night.
 You can rent a taxi, but perhaps the real charm of seeing Isla Mujeres is in renting either a moped or a golf cart.

Just mix five drops of tea tree oil, five drops of citronella oil, five drops of eucalyptus oil, one cup of water, and five drops of peppermint oil. It will smell heavenly. Pour this mixture into a spray bottle and spray liberally about your home.You can also dab a few drops of this mixture directly on your dog or cat (between its shoulder blades or on its paws) to make it less appealing to fleas. Alternately, spray their collar a few times.
Spray your home regularly. When the scent has worn off, you’ll know it’s time to spray again.

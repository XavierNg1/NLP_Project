 For playing the concert snare drum, the accepted grip is the matched grip. Pinch each stick between your thumb and pointer finger about a third up from the butt. Wrap the other 3 fingers loosely around the butt for control.
 When learning elementary strokes or playing marching percussion, the tendency is that rolls, flams, and drags are played in an "open" style, meaning that each stroke is distinct. When playing concert snare drum, however, strive to close your multi-stroke rudiments as much as possible. This style of playing is more lyrical and blends better with orchestral or symphonic music., Because the snare drum's sound is such a tight, percussive "crack," it projects well even when played softly and can easily overwhelm fellow musicians if played loudly. For this reason, listen to fellow musicians and play at a slightly lower dynamic level than you think you need to. You can produce a softer sound from the snare drum by playing near the edge of the head.

 Take your mind off suffering by volunteering to help others who are suffering in different ways. For example, you could volunteer at the local homeless shelter or soup kitchen to help people who struggle to get enough to eat and pay their bills. Thinking about how other people are struggling, too, will help you feel less alone in your fight against arthritic pain., Much unhappiness stems from an inability to really identify what it is you’re worried or unhappy about. While it might be easy for you to recognize that the physical pain of arthritis makes you unhappy, you might have a harder time understanding or recognizing the deeper fears arthritis inspires.For instance, you might fear that people won’t respect you, or people will think you are weak just because you have arthritis. Analyze your thoughts carefully and write these fears down.
Simply writing your fears in a diary or journal can lead to a more positive tomorrow.Talk to a trusted friend or therapist about your fears, so that they can help give you objective perspective.
 It is unrealistic to feel good about your situation all the time, even for people who don’t have arthritis. While you should always try to look on the bright side, don’t beat yourself up for feeling blue.Honor that you are having a bad day, and tell yourself "tomorrow will be better."


Don't try to put on a brave face for the sake of others, or out of fear that others will think you are weak. Be honest about your feelings and fears.

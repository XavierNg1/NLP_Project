 Wine is highly acidic (both red and white), which of course wears on the enamel of your teeth. If it is a sweet wine there is also a significant amount of sugar in it. The combination of these is not a good thing for teeth., High in sugar and carbonated with enamel weakening CO2, soft drinks are one of those dietary disasters that provide nothing positive and are detrimental on many levels. Their high acid content strips enamel from teeth like paint thinner removing layers of paint.


Corrosive acids like phosphoric, malic, citric, and tartaric are the culprits. Clear, citrus-flavored bubbly beverages are pinpointed as the worst, dissolving enamel at a staggering 2-5 times more than colas.
 Studies have shown sports drinks are even worse for your teeth than soft drinks or energy drinks. They contain large amounts of citric acid, sugar, and caffeine, not only damaging tooth enamel but the roots as well.
 While some fruit juices and most if not all fresh squeezed juices contain a great many vitamins, they also contain a lot of natural sugars and most are high in acid content. Even OJ, the least acidic and whose processed juice is often fortified with calcium and vitamin D, should be followed up immediately with a good rinsing.Cold pressed juices often have other juices that even out the alkaline so that they are not nearly as harmful to your teeth. Make sure, however, that you check before buying so you can be sure to do whatâ€™s best for your teeth.
 These beverages, including caffeine and alcohol, cause dehydration which in turn lowers the beneficial effects of saliva. As saliva serves to protect the enamel of teeth (by creating a mineralized coating which is also a pH neutralizer), this in turn exposes teeth to damage they normally would easily avoid.

 Don't go in thinking that you're going to make the team, because truthfully, you never know. You'll be less upset if you don't expect getting on the team.;
, You don't see your name on the list. It's one of the worst feelings ever. Before you have a breakdown, take some deep breaths.
 Going to the bathroom is the most common place. Let it all out. Sometimes, doing this can make you feel a whole lot better. After you're done, leave the bathroom looking okay.
 Most sports teams in Middle School (excluding wrestling, cross country, track, and swimming) only take 14-25 athletes. Most teams in an average size school will have at least 30-70 athletes trying out for sports like basketball, volleyball, softball and soccer. So remember, you're not the only one who got cut.
 Of course you're upset. You may be angry, sad, disappointed or just plain confused. All of these feelings are normal, and gradually these feelings will fade away.
 It isn't varsity. You're not going to college for free because you got on the seventh grade basketball team!

, Do you like a certain club like drama or languages? Or maybe you'll play a new sport! Find an activity that's entertaining and offers more opportunity for you to participate and grow (who wants to make the team but be stuck on the bench during games, anyway?).
 If you got cut from volleyball, but want to make basketball or softball, practice that! Maybe you'll be better prepared for that sport next season.
 If you don't make it this year, try again next year! Who know? Maybe you'll make it!

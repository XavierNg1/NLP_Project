 You can also use a 24-hole mini muffin, but you will need to adjust the cooking time.

Make sure that the baking rack is set in the center.
 A basic frittata contains eggs, salt, and pepper. You will want to add in additional ingredients to make it more flavorful. Great choices include things like bacon, cheese, ham, sausage, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Dice and chop everything into smaller pieces.

Make sure that any meat you will be using is already cooked.
Consider sautéing onions and peppers beforehand.
 Crack the eggs open into a large bowl. Add in the salt and pepper. Whisk everything together until the yolks break, and the mixture turns pale yellow.You can use more/less salt and pepper.
If you want lighter frittatas, use 6 eggs (yolks + whites) and 4 egg whites (no yolks).Consider adding in ½ cup (120 milliliters) of whole milk. This will make the frittatas creamier.
 Use a soup or sauce ladle to fill the wells. This way, you can ensure that each well gets the same amount. Do not fill the wells all the way to the brim. This leaves room for the add-ins., Each well gets 2 to 3 teaspoons of the add-ins. You can get really creative and mix-and-match. If you are making these for you family, consider setting out the add-ins in separate bowls, then let everyone create their own mini frittata., Check them after 20 minutes. They will puff up as they bake, and slowly deflate once you take them out of the oven. They are done when they are set in the middle.If you used a mini muffin pan, bake the frittatas for 8 to 10 minutes. Check them after 8 minutes.
 Use a fork or mini spatula to pop them out of the muffin pan. If you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge, and eat them within 3 to 5 days.

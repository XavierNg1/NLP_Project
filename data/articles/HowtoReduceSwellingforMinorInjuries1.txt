 Take time off and don’t put extra stress on the injury. If it’s lower-body, try not to stand or move too much. Don’t walk or run if it’s a joint (i.e. ankle, knee, hip).;
, The ice is cold enough to constrict blood vessels in the area and cause numbness.Use a bag of ice, or a cold compress. You can also grab something from the freezer, such as a bottle of water or bag of veggies, to reduce the swelling.


Do not use ice for more than 20 consecutive minutes. Tissue damage could be a consequence.Apply the ice multiple times per day for 2-3 days. Do not put the ice directly onto the skin. Use a towel or something similar as a buffer.
Apply the cold pack as soon as possible. Ice works best on recent injuries., Compression, or constricting the injured area with an elastic bandage (like an Ace bandage), will help decrease swelling. Be sure to research how to wrap specific injuries. For instance, when wrapping an ankle it is recommended to encircle the foot twice, and then move in a figure eight fashion around the ankle and foot while leaving the heel exposed.Don't wrap it extremely tight. This can cut off the blood supply. If you experience tingling, numbness, additional pain, or any swelling lower than the bandage, you may have wrapped it too tightly.
Loosen the bandage if it gets too tight.
Swelling is minimized in the area compression is applied.
Injuries often display weakness and need extra support provided by the wrap.
Bandages used for more than 2-3 days may point to a larger issue which needs medical attention., When the injury is elevated higher than the heart, gravity helps bring the blood back towards the heart, and it’s more difficult to pump towards the injury. Place the injury on some pillows or blankets to keep it comfortable., Be sure to keep flexibility in the injured area by remaining mobile. Work slowly and increase range of motion as far as you can progress.

 There are safe treat recipes found on wikiHow, YouTube and in a big book called Happy Hamster (a cookbook for hamsters with hamster-safe recipes).


Place treats inside toilet tube rolls. This provides enrichment as the hamster needs to find the food, climb inside, then maybe even roll around a bit. Or, make it harder by closing down the ends, so that your hamster has to work harder to get at the treat. Expect the toilet roll to be destroyed; remove once the treat has been consumed.
 This will give the hamster new exploring options and it makes cleaning out the cage more entertaining for you too.


If possible, buy your hamster a bigger cage 360 square footage plus. Hamsters with bigger cages live longer and are happier and healthier.

 For example, teach the words: it, she, he, was, am, I, will, etc. Make them go over those words several times, as revision is good reinforcement.;
, As they are beginners, use some easy-to-pronounce-and-understand words.
 That is, pronouncing the word sounds. Make them say these words in sounds and when grasp this concept, teach them new words.
 Make it interesting by colorful flashcards and a comfy, bright classroom. If the atmosphere is bold and attractive, students will learn with greater ease.
 Choose some appropriate simple sentences. Write them out in attractive colors and have the children read them. If they can do word reading, they can do sentence reading as well. If they cannot, go back and revise.
 First spell the starting word of the sentence with the phonetic method and so on. Encourage the students to spell the words out with sounds and then have them read the sentence bit by bit.


Make sure that the students are not stressed. Give them breaks and have light gossips to have a light mood.
 Better yet, use picture sentences to tell them what is going on in the sentence. You could even borrow picture books with one sentence on one page. It sounds childish but this is the step to improve sentences. Do not rush through the sentences. Repeat the concept if they have not grasped it but with a different example. Children stress out if they are given the same lessons over and over.
 First teach small sentences, then big sentences bit by bit, patiently.
 Paragraphs will be easy for the students when they have a clear concept of words and sentences and pronunciation.
 Use books with colorful illustrations. When they have familiarity with the books, layout and paragraphs, the process will be easier. If they do not improve, do not punish them; instead, encourage and guide them.
 This will improve their sense of reading.

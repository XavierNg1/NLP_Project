 Perhaps the easiest way to pick healthy soups are to pick those that include vegetables as the main ingredient. Veggie-rich soups will often be low in fat and cholesterol but high in nutritional value.


Many veggie-rich soups may have a simpler ingredient list than other soups. For instance, you’ll see a wide variety of vegetables such as celery, peas, and carrots as ingredients.
Try Asian-oriented soups like vegetable hot and sour soup or vegetable Thai noodle soup.
Think about vegetable soups that are season appropriate. For instance, buy or prepare a squash soup or bean and mushroom soup in the autumn or winter. In summer or spring, make gazpacho., Cream-based soups and chowders are full of dairy products, and thus, high in fat and cholesterol. As a result, you should stay away from these soups when you can.


Stay away from cream of broccoli, cream of mushroom, and cream of corn.
Although it might be tasty, don’t eat New England Clam Chowder if you are counting calories.
Look for vegan “cream of” soups. You’ll be surprised to find a decent selection of vegan alternatives that use cauliflower, peas, broccoli, or other ingredients to create creamy soups.
Focus on tomato-based chowders like Manhattan Clam Chowder., A simple way to alter a recipe to make it healthier is by substituting vegetable broth for meat broth. By eliminating meat broth, you’ll decrease the cholesterol and maybe even the saturated fat content of the soup. In the end, you’ll be able to make your favorite recipe just a bit healthier.


Make your own vegetable broth using your favorite vegetables.
Use store-vegetable broth to substitute for meat both. For instance, use vegetable broth instead of chicken or beef broth.
If you must use meat-based broth, focus on chicken broth. It will likely have less saturated fat and lower cholesterol.

 Just like factoring without recourse, you want to know how much of a cash advance you will receive, and you want to know what fee you will be charged. When factoring with recourse, your company is liable if the accounts can't be collected. Because of this, you have to record a liability upon sale of the receivables called a "recourse liability."

, For example, imagine you sell $10,000 worth of receivables to a factoring company that offers you an 80 percent cash advance and charges a 2 percent fee. Based on historical data regarding your receivables collections, you estimate that the recourse obligation is worth $500. This means you expect that about $500 of these accounts will not be collected, and you will have to record the associated loss.


To record the journal entry, debit Cash for $8000, debit Due from Factor for $1800, and debit Loss on Sale for $700. Credit Recourse Liability for $500, and credit Accounts Receivable for $10,000.The Loss on Sale account now includes both the factor's fee and the expected loss due to doubtful accounts. In keeping with the conservatism principle of accounting, the loss is recognized even before it is incurred. A gain will be recorded later if the accounts are actually collected.
 When the factoring company is paid, they will pay you the retainer. In the example above, assume all the accounts are collected. To record the journal entry, debit Cash for $1800, debit Recourse Liability for $500, credit Gain on Sale for $500, and credit Due from Factor for $1800., If some of the accounts are not paid, you must buy those accounts back from the factor. In the previous example, assume that $9500 of the accounts was collected and $500 defaulted. To record the journal entry, debit Cash for $1300, debit Recourse Liability for $500, and credit Due from Factor for $1800.

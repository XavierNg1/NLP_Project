, Chemicals are usually applied from the center of the pond outward, doing small sections at a time. Spraying an entire pond at once can cause too many plants to decompose and may rob the aquatic life living beneath the surface of valuable oxygen. To avoid this, apply the treatment to the most overgrown areas of the pond first before tackling other small sections after a few weeks pass.
 Applying an herbicide directly to the lily pad may work, but oftentimes, you will need to apply a surfactant beforehand to dissolve the protective wax coating on the outer surface of the pad. Spray the surfactant onto the top of the pad liberally.
 Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most commonly used for lily pad removal, but imazapyr-based herbicides will also work.Both are broad spectrum, non-selective herbicides that essentially kill any surface plant they come into contact with, but neither kills plants hat live under the surface of the water.
 Follow the instructions on the herbicide's label to determine an appropriate dosage. Usually, aquatic herbicides are sprayed directly over the top of the lily pad until the surface is thoroughly and evenly coated.
 The herbicide will kill the plant, leaving dead plant matter floating on the surface. Wade or row into the water and rake away dead lily pads. Pull up the roots, if possible. While the herbicide should have killed the roots, it will not be good for your pond if too many dead roots linger at the bottom and are allowed to decompose.
 Wait two to three weeks in between applications, spraying one small section at a time to prevent the ecosystem of the pond from becoming unbalanced. After the entire pond has been covered, go back over areas that were already treated if too many of the lily pads survived the initial application.

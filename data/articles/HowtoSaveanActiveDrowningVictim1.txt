 Active drowning victims are conscious but are struggling and unable to call for help. They also may be thrashing their arms. It is very important for you to recognize these signs early as people will become submerged in 20 to 60 seconds.An active drowning victim will bob in and out of the water with his or her mouth being just above the surface of the water. The person is not making forward progress either.Someone who looks as though they're having trouble, but isn't yelling for help, may not have enough oxygen to call out.;
, No matter your experience or training, having others assist you is a good idea.Yell to others that someone is drowning. Call emergency services immediately, especially if the person is floating face-down., Remain calm and figure out how you can best rescue the person based on the location and type of body of water the person is in. Find a flotation device if you can. If the person is close, use a reach method. If the person is further away, use an ocean rescue method.It may take a few seconds to get the person's attention. Stay calm and continue to talk to them.
If you have one available, a shepherd's crook can reach someone beyond the range of a reaching assist in a pool or lake.
Use a ring buoy or other easy to throw rescue device to reach a victim further away from the shore; this is also used in an ocean rescue.

Dive into the water and swim to the victim as a last resort, when the victim is out of reach.
 Stay calm and focused. People who panic are more likely to make mistakes and may also stress out the victim. Call to the victim that you're coming to his or her aid.

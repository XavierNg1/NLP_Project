 The easiest way to transfer music is by copying the files from your computer directly to the Kindle Fire. You can use any Micro-USB cable to connect it to your computer, which is the same cable most Android smartphones use.

Windows XP users will need to have Windows Media Player 11 installed in order to detect the connected Kindle.
You can use the Amazon Cloud to access your music files from the cloud instead of filling up your tablet's storage. See the next section for details.
 The Kindle tablet will appear on your computer as a removable drive, much like a USB thumbdrive. Open it to see the files on the tablet.

Windows - You'll be able to find the Kindle Fire in your "Computer"/"My Computer" in the "Devices and drives" section.
Mac - The Kindle Fire will appear on your desktop when connected. Double-click the icon to open it like a drive.
 Any music already on the device will be here., Unlike the Kindle e-readers, you can add your folders for better organization. The Fire tablets typically have much more storage than a Kindle e-reader as well.

You can drag and drop files from your iTunes library window directly into the Music folder on the Kindle.
The Fire tablet supports MP3, AAC, AC3, WAV, and OGG.
 Once you have finished copying your music files, tap "Disconnect" in the Kindle Fire's Notification panel. You can then disconnect the USB cable., You can open this by tapping "Music" on the Fire's Home screen., This will switch the display to all of the songs that you have stored on the device.

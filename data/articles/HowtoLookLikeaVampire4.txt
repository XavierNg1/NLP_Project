 Black hair is usually the best bet for vampires. It creates a dramatic look contrasting with your lightened face. Consider dyeing your hair a darker shade, or going all the way to jet black.


In some cases, a streak of white, purple, or red can be great for getting a vampire style in your hair. Consider darkening your hair, and include a single streak of color, as though you had your wits scared out of you at some point.
Blondes, redheads, and people with any style and color of hair can achieve good vampire looks. Any color will work, as long as it works well with your complexion., Vampire hair is usually flat, straight, and dramatic looking. Use a hair straightener after you wash and dry your hair if you have curly hair, to pull off that lank hanging look.


All kinds of cuts can look like vampire cuts, although a mysterious, full bodied cut usually has the best effect for women. Loose curls or waves can help create a sultry, mysterious appearance, depending on what you're going for.
Men can pull off long or short styles, but a slicked back medium length cut that's short on the sides will always look dramatic and ominous for a vampire. It's the classic Bela Lugosi look.
 Try having your hair long on one side and shaved near bald on the other, like a punk or techno vampire. You could also try a mohawk or dreadlocks. The vampire look is flexible and can be accepted with anything you're comfortable with. Consider nontraditional styles and cuts for pulling off your own unique look., Vampires are elegant creatures, proud of their appearance and style. However you choose to style your hair, keep it well trimmed, free of split ends, and in a shiny, lustrous condition.


Wash your hair regularly and aim to get cuts at least every couple of weeks.

 For example, if you downloaded the “Where’s My Droid?” application, go to http://wheresmydroid.com/., In most cases, you will be required to log in to the app’s tracking system with a username and password you set up at the time you initially downloaded the application to your phone.
 In some cases, you may be able to select the option to either make your phone ring so you can find it nearby, or wipe the personal data from your phone if it has been stolen.

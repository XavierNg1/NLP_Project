 Moth eggs usually enter closest by way of clothing that has been worn outside.
 Moths are attracted to wool, but they're especially apt to enter your closet if your clothing has stains from food and other items that they like to eat. Make sure you wash your clothes before hanging them up. Dry clean wool items before storing them.
 Clothes you don't wear often, especially wool winter clothing, should be stored in an airtight place.


Protect wool coats and sweaters with plastic bags.
Store winter clothing in plastic storage bags, plastic bins, or airtight metal containers.
 Moths are attracted to humid spaces, so it's important to keep the air circulating and on the cool side so they don't decide to nest there.
 Let your wool items get some sun, especially if you're taking them out at the beginning of fall or winter after they've been in storage.
 Moths are repelled by cedar, so it's a good idea to hang wool items on cedar hangers.


You can also purchase ball-shaped pieces of cedar to hang in your closet, or fill a sachet bag with cedar chips and hang it up.
Try placing cedar-scented items in the pockets of your wool items for extra protection.
 Placing moth balls in your closet is an effective way to kill moths, but the chemicals moth balls are made with are toxic to humans, and they leave a strong scent in your closet and on your clothes. Try these alternatives:


Sachets made with dried rosemary, thyme, cloves, lavender, or bay leaves. Simply fill a small cloth bag with these ingredients, tie it with a string, and hang it up.
Essential oils made from these herbs can be sprinkled in your closet or on your clothing as an effective moth deterrent.
 Moth problems can usually be solved with these simple solutions, but if you find that moths keep returning, they may be laying eggs in a place you can't reach with a vacuum or sponge. Call a pest control professional to fumigate the area and kill the moth eggs.

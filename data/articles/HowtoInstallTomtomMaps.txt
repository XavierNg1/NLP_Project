 To back up your TomTom, select restore/backup from your computer. Complete the back up of your device prior to initiating any download. It will save you time if something goes wrong with your device while you are downloading maps. By backing up your device, you are preserving the map information that was on your device.
 It is impossible to install a map that is larger than the storage capacity for your device. Different models of TomTom devices may have different storage capacities.



Verify that the size of the map you want to download is smaller than your device's storage capacity.
Compare your modem speed with the size of the map you wish to download prior to initiating the download. There are some downloads that shouldn't be attempted with slower speed modems or connections.
Consider an alternate download site if your original site can't sustain a continuous connection or isn't fast enough.
 TomTom HOME will need complete access to your computer system. Firewall and security settings can prevent maps from being downloaded correctly.

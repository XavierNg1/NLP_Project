 This is bad form and it lacks sincerity and emotion. Breaking up with someone over email is unfair, and you should never inform a close family member of a death via email. The exception concerning death is to inform people not closely related to a person in a more general manner well after the family members have all been informed.;
, It is not sensible to assume that somebody is going to be reading their email as you decide five minutes before a rendezvous that you can't be bothered going. Use the telephone (don't text!) and make sure you tell the person directly. People are also wise to the covering-your-backside routine of using email to say "Oh, you didn't know? I sent you an email". They can read the time and date after all.
 While it's OK to send a PDF invoice for payment via email, it's not OK to negotiate price via email. Misunderstandings occur all too easily. Call them up, arrange a meeting time for a face-to-face discussion and proceed from there.
 Again, as with canceling a meeting, how do you know that the person has even read it? The best way to deal with urgency is to meet face-to-face, to hammer in the urgent aspects, and to be assured that all parties concerned know its urgent.
 When the email is about a lengthy, difficult and complicated matter, email can make a mess of it. Again, have those face-to-face meetings, confirm understandings as the project proceeds by using phone conversations and only use email to flip documents between each other.
 How cold and unfeeling can you get?!

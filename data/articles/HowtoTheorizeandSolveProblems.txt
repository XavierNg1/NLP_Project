, If there are no existing theories. Because, if it does, the Scientific Method was designed to handle very, very many hypotheses.,,, They may criticize you with bothersome facts you had not previously considered, given their (at least partially applicable) knowledge and practical experience.,,, You now have a Working Theory on the face of it but what if someone comes up with quarrelsome facts? Be ready to refute those facts with claims that they are contingent on rare circumstances, next to impossible to achieve or ever occur again, or are based on bad science which you can disprove.,, Be wary of cosmic rays hitting people's DNA and causing them to mutate into entirely unknown entities, with all sorts of strange powers. Why? Because the comic books are full of super heroes and villains with highly desirable special powers, and people just might find a way to obtain same, or a very reasonable and possibly dangerous facsimile., Math has a way of boiling situations and problems down to their simple elegant essence, so take advantage of the beauty of simplicity and Keep It Simple, Stupid! That's called the KISS principle. Don't try to solve too many problems with your theory, just take on something irksome to people, or about which they know very little, or is not risky or very risky, etc.,,

Set up this equation: T1 - T2 = T1/ T2
Proceed to subtract Theory #1 from both sides: T1-T1 - T2 = T1/T2 - T1
Simplify the left and factor out T1 on the right: -T2 = T1(1/T2 - 1)
Divide both sides by (1/T2 - 1): -T2/(1/T2 - 1) = T1*(1/T2 - 1)/(1/T2 - 1) = T1
Put in the expected number of adherents or facts that represent T2: Let's say 100, because it could also represent 100%.
Substituting in 100 for T2, you should get -100/(1/100 - 1) = T1
Work out the math and get first -100/(-99/100) = T1
Work that by flipping the denominator and multiplying by it, to get -100(-100/99) = T1.
Arrive at the answer that 101.01010101 ... = T1. Better than 100%, in a way ...
Put back the numbers for T1 and T2 in the original equation to make sure it is correct: Originally, T1 - T2 = T1/ T2, so you get 101.0101 - 100 = 101.0101/100.
Solve the problem. Make sure the left side equals 1.01010101... and the right side, given you have a calculator or computer handy, you should get 1.01010101... also on the right! They're equal, the left and right sides of the equation. That is, the difference between the two theories is small, just 1.01010101 ..., and their ratio T1/T2 is also very close to Unity. Which means that these two theories are stating almost the same truth!!! There's a slight difference, yes, an advantage to T1 if being larger is advantageous (it's not, always).
Notice T1 is 101.01010101...% correct. Why? Because he's checked all those decimal 1 tiny possibilities is why!! He's forever testing against smaller and smaller problems and bothersome facts, because the number repeats forever!
You can further solve problems and you can use any number, except 1. The reason you cannot use 1, is because the equation has a step, -T2/(1/T2 - 1) = T1, where if T2=1, you get 0 in the denominator, which is undefined, or infinite, depending upon your own theory about division by zero. Let it be that the slope y/x of the x axis = the tangent of 0º (i.e. when y=0) = 0. Call that m1. And the slope of 90º, that is when y goes up forever in value and x approaches 0 infinitely closer and closer = Infinity or Undefined. Call that slope m2. Now recall your algebra and Cartesian Graph and remember that perpendicular lines, like the axes of x and y, must have their slopes multiply to equal -1. And since you can't multiply anything by "Undefined", and Infinity is not strictly speaking a number on the number line (depending on whose theory you believe), then the best we might say is that m1*m2=-1, so 0*INFINITY = -1, else those two axes are not perfectly perpendicular.
Learn that, in that case, -T2/(1/T2 - 1) = T1 become -1/0 = Infinity, which is exactly what the Cartesian Plane submits is the fact. And happily, not only is Theory #1 correct in terms of tiny details, but it's also infinitely correct! Everywhere in Space-Time on at least 1 plane, of infinitely many such planes, it is correct.
Make sure that your theory matters. Because we're all made up of very small particles, whizzing while spinning, and spinning while their whizzing, around. That's what matters, and don't let anyone tell you different.
 It works just fine with 100, even if 100 does not really mean 100%, 1.01010101 ... is extremely close to 100%. In Accounting, and Auditing, in most circumstances, for an account to be off by 3-5% with a 99% Confidence Level, makes for an immaterial discrepancy, and the firm will still have a pass on their audit, though there may be some specifics about the discrepancy way far down in the Notes to the Financial Statements, which nowadays are as important to read as the statements themselves, if you're thinking of investing that is, or divesting, as the case may be., Make your theory useful, because it matters.,

Let T+B-B = TB-B
Let T = B*(T-1), where the 1 stands for something 100% Beautiful.
Let T/(T-1) = B, by dividing both sides by (T-1), and simplifying. We now have Beauty isolated and defined in terms of Truth and 1.
Let T= any number except 1, else Beauty is Infinite, with no room left for Truth?
Let T = 12, like 12 jurors in a trial. Then, substitute 12 for T and get:
Let 12/(12-1) = B. And 12/11 = 1.09090909....
Test the original hypothesis: T+B = T*B = Omniscience (at least for 12 jurors, that is, the triers of fact.
Find out if 12+ 12/11 = 12* 12/11?
Proceed to find out that 132/11+ 12/11 = 144/11, which = 13.09090909.... or 12 and 12/11. In this case, the Jury is so beautiful in their relative omniscience, that they, by setting the sum of Truth and Beauty equal to the product of Truth and Beauty, have added a fact worth 12/11 to the Truth (=12). That's why people say "Facts are beautiful things".
 "That's a rather beautiful theory you've got there" is what you'd like to hear, of course! Who wouldn't?  ;), Just add in the proper measure, test it, taste it, feel that it's right and good when it's there and when it's gone, and you will have developed the proper way(s) to theorize, about most anything you care to acquire the facts about., As mentioned before, check them all out before you just start off willy-nilly, okay? It's alright if some people call you "ridiculous" -- it just means you've planted your flag on the Moon, when everyone said it couldn't be done! And it matters, it matters a great deal, things like that., Therefore, one might as well have started out by subtracting Truth, instead of Beauty. In that case, it works out that B/(B-1) = T, just as T/(T-1) = B, because of Commutation. It's very symmetrical, which is a hot topic now in Higher Math. It also means that T^2/(T-1) = B^2/(B-1) = Omniscience, but the two 1's mean something different in each case. With the T's, the 1 was a B before, and with B^2/(B-1), the 1 was Truth previously, when they were factored. Their graphs being entirely similar, they are two lines or curves occupying the same course in the plane, simultaneously. They're twins, as it were, or a very strong Devotee and Master. See it with your two eyes and hear it with your two ears, males and females, for 'tis Truth, and Beautiful. Above is a picture of some "schizopairs" in a "rare state of attraction" like a + b, or T*B, in an image created via Neutral Operations in Excel:
, Listen carefully, because like String Theory, which is a very Strong Theory of vibrational consonance and harmony, this theory deals with extremely minute quantities. It's called the "Base 1 Theory" and like the base 2, it has two members, 0 and 1, but the 0's are all arbitrary and being arbitrary, are not exactly a defined number; the number of zeroes is both not important and very important, if you understand such paradoxes, because 0.00000000000000... is arbitrarily as close to a definition of 0 as one could want. In a way, this is both the Base 1 and the Base 0 theory, combined -- it practically doesn't count at all, except that it's an approximation (or direct statement and definition) of the smallest entity in the Cosmos, as theorized by humans. If 1/3 = .333333333...., then 3/3 = either 1 or .99999999999999.... The base 1 is simply the 1 that allows a person to convert the discrepancy between .999999999999... and 1 into an equality, and is simply 1^-n power, as n approaches Infinity. That is, by adding .01 or .0000000000000000001, somewhere arbitrarily in all those 9's, 1 is created, depending upon how large or tiny one needs the 1 to be. That's why it's the nth power in the formula. If one asks, "but what about all the 9's to the right of where one puts 1^-n? They are infinitely close to 0, so they are of practically no consequence. It is just what is needed to solve all those "rounding errors" and discrepancies that are arbitrary in math today. That's the theory anyway ... the theory of the arbitrary 1, Base 1. It's arguable, of course, but may be just the trick Science needs to decide where they will cut off inquiry at its tiniest, for now ... it's right next to the proposal to have commas to the right of the decimal point too, like this: .00,000,000,000,000,..n. It matters very little, or quite a lot, as a teaching aid to students of the minute. I freely admit it's not as convenient as Exponential Notation, but it might help some people grasp how relatively tiny the subject matter is., For example, 1/.999 = 1.001001001001 actually, not 1 exactly. Some of those magnitudes of cyclical 1's would be fantastically large compared to a neutron's size, for example. That is a Cyclical Small Base, which is a little different than a simple Arbitrary Base, and awaits better definition ... because if one takes pi and subtracts or adds all the digits which make it equal 3, or 4, or a number arbitrarily rounded off in pi, so that pi becomes actually useful at tiny distances and amounts, one is really speaking of another arbitrary process which this author believe utilizes the Base 1, or not -- it's arbitrary. One could use this Cyclical Small Base to talk about a possible recurrence or non-recurrence of (some) physical laws at various levels of reality perhaps, because certain physical constants may fail to exist at those levels. As =1/0.9990999 = 1.00090091090991, once can dream up an infinite number of bases to count by, depending on their applicability in the realm concerned, with a given (tiny) Confidence Level, or series of them. Something exists at the practically Infinitely Small, we just have very little confidence assuring anyone that it's known or knowable., Are we talking about the 3 made up of Phi? In that case, we have a situation where we're subtracting the most irrational number from one whose generalized forms of CFE (Continued Fraction Expansion) are very regular, if infinite. It's like finding the CFE for the reciprocal of the largest prime one multiplies by to obtain 1. It's there but increasingly difficult to find I imagine -- I don't know that for a FACT. Perhaps it's easily obtained, due to the process of establishing the largest prime. Maybe not. It's probably had by a fairly simple algorithm in fact. It may be a piece of work that's very piecework. Hypothetically speaking, it may very well be do-able.

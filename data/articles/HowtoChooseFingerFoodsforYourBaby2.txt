 Your baby needs the same nutrients you do, just on a different scale. When introducing finger foods, think about the types of mashes and baby foods you will continue to use in your childâ€™s diet, then use finger foods to help fill in some of the nutritional voids.If, for example, you plan to regularly feed your baby vegetable mashes such as peas and carrots and sweet potatoes, you may want to consider introducing protein-rich finger foods such as small meat or tofu cubes.
Generally speaking, babies seven to twelve months old should get around 95 grams of carbs, 11 grams of protein, 30 grams of fat, and a variety of micronutrients such as vitamins and iron a day.Remember to check labels for nutritional content. Pay special attention to things like sugar, which is a form of carbohydrate and should be factored into your child's overall carb intake.
 Your baby needs an iron-rich diet from six to twelve months, so look for finger foods that are naturally rich in iron, or otherwise iron-fortified. Iron-fortified infant cereals are often a popular choice for finger foods, as they combine a single grain such as wheat or barley with added iron.Meats rich in iron that are safe to offer to your child include turkey, beef, chicken, lamb, fish, and pork. High-iron meat alternatives that can easily be cut up and ingested include chickpeas, lentils, beans, eggs, and cooked tofu., Cheeses are a great option for finger foods, but buying reduced-fat or low-fat cheese for your child is not beneficial. Babies are constantly growing and have very different nutritional needs than adults. Opt for whole milk cheeses instead of reduced fat to make sure your baby is getting the proper nutrients.Check the packaging to make sure the cheese is not reduced fat, low fat, or part skim. Unless otherwise stated, most cheeses are typically made from full-fat dairy products.

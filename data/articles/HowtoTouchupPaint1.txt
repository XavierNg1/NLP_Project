Soak your sponge in soapy water and wring out excess moisture.
Wash your walls with the sponge to remove surface dirt, marks or grime.
Dry the walls with a clean towel, and rub a soft cloth over the painted surface if it looks dull. Dullness occurs on some glossy, paint surfaces after repeated washing.;

Pour primer into a paint tray. Use a stain-killing paint primer for dark marks.
Roll a paint roller through the primer and up and down the tray to remove excess primer. Saturate your roller without soaking it to the point of dripping.
Roll primer over the washed area on the wall. Apply a single coat. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding with the paint application.

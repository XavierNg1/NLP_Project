 Add 1/8 tbsp (600 mg) baking soda to an 8 oz. (0.237 liters) glass of water. Baking soda has a high alkaline content. When the baking soda mixes with the water, it increases the alkaline properties of the water. Shake (if you are using a water bottle) or stir (if using a glass) the mixture vigorously to make sure the baking soda mixes in thoroughly with the water.If you are on a low sodium diet, do not add baking soda to your water. Baking soda is high in sodium.
 Lemons are anionic, so when you drink lemon water, your body reacts with the anionic properties of the lemon making the water alkaline as your body digests it.Fill one pitcher (64 oz.) with clean water. Filtered water is the best way to go, but if you donâ€™t have a filter, tap water is okay to use.
Cut up one lemon into eighths. Add the lemons to the water but do not squeeze them--simply place them in the water.
Cover the water and let it sit overnight for 8 to 12 hours at room temperature.
You can add one tablespoon of pink Himalayan sea salt to your lemon water if desired. Adding the salt mineralizes your alkaline water.
 pH drops contain potent alkaline minerals and are highly concentrated. You can purchase pH drops at health food stores or online. Follow the directions on your specific pH bottle to determine how many drops you should put into your water.Keep in mind that while pH drops increase the alkalinity of your water, they do not filter out any of the things like chlorine or fluoride that can be found in your tap water.

 At the very start of the process, get out a pen and paper and write down a list of your strengths and weaknesses as a parent. Be honest with yourself and try to be as specific as possible, even including examples when you can. You can add to this list as you go forward. It will help to ground your conversations with the evaluator.For example, you might write, “I am good at keeping in close contact with their teachers. I attend all conferences and participate in the PTA organization.”

, Give some thought to what you would consider to be the best-case and worst-case custody scenario. Are there compromise options in between that you could live with? Jot down any custody options that you are open to and be prepared to discuss why certain arrangements do not appeal to you., You are likely to be anxious throughout the evaluation process and that makes it easy to lose track of your thoughts. Carry a journal with you to write down any questions or concerns that pop up before or after your interviews or any other part of the process. Then, bring these up to your evaluator via email, a phone call, or in-person.If you have children who will likely resist talking to the evaluator you might ask, “What happens if one of my children refuse to participate in the interview with you? I will encourage him, but my son is extremely shy with strangers.”

, You as a parent is different from you as a spouse. The custody evaluation process is not specifically focused on your marriage. Try your best to separate any negative feelings about your prior relationship from the task at hand. This is easier said than done but it may help to repeat to yourself, “Focus on .”Be aware that any marital problems connected to violence or safety issues to your children are relevant and should be brought to the evaluator’s attention. Again, stay focused on safety and the other parent’s parental abilities or lack thereof.

 Choose one similar to that shown in the image. If you want it to match your bathroom theme, you can cover the black part with self-adhesive decorated plastic film or just buy the paperclip already in any colour you fancy.;
, Flatten the bottom end of the tube & attach the clip watching for the paste to ooze up at the opening. As the paste is being used up, fold the clip over without removing the clip, then open the clip, and reattach the clip over the fold Make sure that the clip holds it properly.(If you roll up the tube it will become too thick to attach the clip by the time the tube is half empty.) Put the cap back on and leave it in the glass along with the brushes or on a shelf.
 Continue moving the clip up as more paste is used over the weeks.

 You will need to use a large pan and an outdoor gas range or wood stove. You will also need a cloth syrup filter and storage containers. Avoid boiling your sap indoors, as it creates a large amount of steam.


You can use a dehumidifier to reduce the amount of steam that is produced, allowing you to boil the sap indoors.
A candy or syrup thermometer is very helpful in getting the sap to the perfect temperature.
Using a wood stove creates the best maple syrup, as it imbues the sap with a rich smoky flavor.
 Keep the sap at least 11.5 inches deep to keep it from burning. Be prepared, as sap boils down very quickly and gives off a lot of steam.


As the sap boils down, add more to keep it at the 11.5 inch level. You can add cold sap to the boiling sap, or pre-warm it.
Boil the sap until it reaches 219 °F (104 °C). This will give you pure maple syrup. If you want to make maple sugar, continue boiling until it has reached 234 °F (112 °C).
 Use a cloth maple syrup filter, available for purchase online, to separate out any “sugar sand” that formed during the boiling process. Always filter the syrup while it is hot, between 180–200 °F (82–93 °C).


Heat the syrup filter in hot water for a few minutes before use. This will help the syrup to filter better, and also kill any bacteria that might have been attached to the filter.
Store syrup that is waiting to be filtered in a closed container to help it to maintain its heat.
If the syrup cools too much, reheat it to be within the 180-200 degree range. Be careful of overheating it though, as you could burn the syrup.
If the syrup is pouring through the filter too quickly, the filter may be bad and need to be replaced. It should “ooze” more than it should pour., To extend the life of your syrup, you can keep it refrigerated once you open its container. Use in recipes and on your foods for a delicious maple flavor.

 The best coaches are also great students of the game. Find basketball games wherever you can—on television, online, or down at the local recreation center—and study them. Identify what plays or systems work best and which ones are less effective. Take plenty of notes, and go over them when the game is finished.;
, The key to being an effective youth basketball coach is recognizing the limitations of your students. The majority of young players will only be able to memorize and execute a limited number of plays. Additionally, fundamentals are more important to youth development than the execution of certain plays. Find a few easy offensive and defensive plays you can run, and study them until you have them mastered.
 If you decide to watch some games in person, approach the coaches after the game and set up a time to speak with them about any questions or ideas you may have.
 Once you’ve researched the basics, you should decide what kind of coach you want to be. Consider the following questions:



What are my primary coaching goals? Do I want to take young players with little experience and make them better? Would I prefer coaching players with some experience and guiding them to the next level?

What do I want my players to learn? What are the most important drills or lessons I can teach? If time is a factor, what drills or lessons can I omit? Is there a specific area—stamina, hand-eye coordination, lateral quickness—that I want to work on instead of others?

How important is winning? Will my players learn the same lessons in defeat that they will in victory? Do I make decisions based primarily on allowing all my players to develop their skills, or do I coach to win?

How will I measure my success? Are my players better than they were when I started? How much better? Are they satisfied with their progress? Did they have fun?

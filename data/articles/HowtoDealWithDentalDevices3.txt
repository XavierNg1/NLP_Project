 If you want to see results from your clear braces, you must commit to wearing your aligners for a minimum of 20 hours a day. For best results, only remove clear braces for eating and cleaning. Do not remove clear braces at night., Brush your aligners with lukewarm water whenever you brush your teeth. Similar to retainers, aligners should be soaked and cleaned in a denture cleaner anywhere from once a day to a few times a week.It is also best to maintain good dental hygiene while wearing clear braces to keep your aligners smelling fresh and bacteria-free. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, but ideally, brush after every time you eat to prevent food particles from getting caught in your aligners.
Use mouthwash to create a bacteria- free environment before placing the aligners back in your mouth.
Do not brush your aligners with toothpaste or mouthwash as these substances can cause damage.
 At the beginning of your treatment you will be given several sets of aligners that are meant to continually shift your teeth in the right direction and advance your progress. Be sure to change your aligners as instructed to ensure the best result, and check in with your doctor every six weeks.You will feel the actual aligner getting loose when the next one is required. This means that you need to see your orthodontist for the next stage of teeth straightening.

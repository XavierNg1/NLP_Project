 If you spill any oil on your nylon bag – including salad dressing or car oil – you'll want to remove as much of it as possible immediately. Using a towel or napkin, dab at the oil to remove as much as you can.The more oil that is allowed to sit on the fabric of your bag, the harder the stain will be to remove.
 Cover the area with talcum powder after you’ve removed the excess liquid. Let the powder sit on the stain for a minute or two., Once you’ve let the powder sit, gently brush it away with a toothbrush. The talcum powder should absorb the oil, leaving the nylon of your bag stain-free., Depending on how much oil soaked into your bag, you might have to repeat these steps. Keep in mind that you might not be able to remove all of the oil from your nylon.

 Wrap the tape close to the knuckle; this is the thickest part of your finger and you want to ensure the ring slides on comfortably. Make sure you use a cloth or plastic measuring tape; these will wrap around your finger more effectively. Using a metal tape measure is possible, but will be significantly more difficult and could even cause an injury.


Alternatively, many jewellers offer printable ring sizers on their websites. You can use these much like a tape measure, only the ring sizes are visible on the ruler itself, saving the work of converting measurements.
Don’t wrap the paper too tightly. Aim for a snug but comfortable fit.
Make sure to use the exact finger you want to size for. For an engagement ring, you should be sizing your left ring finger. This is because the size of your two ring fingers might be slightly different.The size of your fingers tends to change throughout the day. For best results, measure at the end of the day., Do this on a separate piece of paper with a pen or pencil. You can record the measurement in inches or millimeters, depending on the retailer. Many will have both measurements available but a European retailer might only have measurements in millimeters.


If using a printed ring sizer, mark the point where it overlaps directly on the ruler itself.
 You can find these charts at many online jewelry retailers. You can print this chart for easy reference, but usually you’ll just need to compare to the online chart. These charts convert measurements into ring sizes; for instance, 2.34” (59.5mm) would be a size 9.

If your measurement falls between two sizes, go for the largest size.
If using a printed ring sizer, note where you marked the overlap to determine your ring size.

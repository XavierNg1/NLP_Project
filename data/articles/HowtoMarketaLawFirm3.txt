 Sit down with a web designer who can give you a website that fits your budget and projects a professional air. Consider including profiles and online appointment scheduling.
 Make sure your firm name and your legal name are listed in all phone books, in print and online. Update your directory information by claiming your Google Places listing and adding logos or photos.
 Make it as easy as possible for someone to type your name into a search engine or URL space and find your website.
 Gather emails from all your clients, friends, co-workers and more. Offer a free consultation to encourage new clients, and send up quarterly firm updates with expert tips that clients can use.


Take extra precautions to keep your client's emails confidential. If your website does not offer a newsletter service, you can pay for a low-cost newsletter service like Vertical Response or Constant Contact. This service allows you to upload email addresses but does not list them on the emails themselves.
 Few social media accounts are a good place for professional contact with the community. LinkedIn provides the exception because it allows you to interact while sharing professional information with others.

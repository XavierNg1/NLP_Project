 A simple button-down, long-sleeved white shirt will work, but a tuxedo shirt or a ruffled shirt will look better. Look for a lacy or brocade shirt at a thrift store for extra effect.
 Tuxedo pants work best, but any simple black pants will do. Black jeans or slacks will work in a pinch, just make sure that they are very black, faded black jeans that are almost grey would definitely dilute the effect you are going for.
 Any self-respecting vampire knows that it is important to always look your best. A suit vest adds an air of elegance and sophistication to your outfit, all the better to seduce your victims. Black, crimson or silver are all good colors vest colors.
 Use a swathe of black or scarlet silk to create a makeshift cummerbund. This is optional, depending on the type of vampire look you are attempting to create. A cummerbund adds an air of formality to your vampire costume, perfect for channeling Count Dracula himself.
 Again, you are aiming for upper-class elegance with your vampire costume. Wearing your white Nike's would completely ruin the effect.

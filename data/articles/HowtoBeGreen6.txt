 Take your dog for a walk around the neighborhood, visit the park, go for a hike, walk on the beach, etc. Plus, walking is a great exercise for you.
 Foods you should eat are fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, etc. Cut down on sugars and fats and try to avoid processed food or too much meat and only eat a fast food once every two or three weeks as a treat. Home cooked meals are always the best and fruits and vegetables are very healthy for you!

The impacts of eating meat on both the environment and on people are undeniable and hugely negative. Do your research and consider what exactly you are truly putting in your body and whether or not you're okay with it. There are plenty of meat alternatives that don't involve the abuse of the animals.
If being a vegan or vegetarian is not an option for you, consider limiting your meat intake or researching to find free-range farms that kill their animals with more concern for the level of pain and fear they experience. Unfortunately, places like McDonald's and Burger King do not buy meat from the ethical meat industry.
 Instead of watching the news on TV, read the newspaper or instead of researching things on the computer, go to the library! Books are very handy and reading is a great habit and time passer.

 Bedroom, bathroom,and kitchen are all necessary for a sim's survival. But since you have enough money to build much more than that, you will probably want to.


Try to build rooms according to your sims' interests and careers. For example, if your sim is athletic, you might want to build them a home gym, and if your sim is a party animal, you might want to build them a room made just for guests.

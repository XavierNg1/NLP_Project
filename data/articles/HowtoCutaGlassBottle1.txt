 To create the line that the bottle will break off at, use a glass cutter or a glass drill bit to score a line. If you want, you can use a support system so that you get a perfect line around the bottle, otherwise you can just freehand it.






;
, Heat the line that you made with the glass cutter. You can use a small candle or a small butane torch. Focus the heat directly along the score line, and constantly rotate the bottle to get even coverage.
 When you have spent around 5 minutes heating the bottle, dip the end you are breaking off in cold water. Do this in a sink or pot full of cold water, with optional ice.
 The bottle might require more stress than a single round of heating and cooling in order to break. Simply repeat the process of heating the bottle and dipping it in cold water until it snaps.
 Use a rough square of sandpaper to clean off the edges of the glass. As you remove any sharp points, alternate to a finer grit sandpaper. You should do this as soon as you are finished, to avoid cutting yourself.
 Use the bottle to store pens, drink out of, or make a pretty vase. The options are endless!

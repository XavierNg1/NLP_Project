 Decide if you are ready to run a half marathon.


Before you run a half marathon, you should be able to complete a 3-mile (5 km) jog or run at least 3 times per week.
At the very least, you should be able to run at a steady pace for 30 minutes.
, If you are interested in a specific cause, such as environmentalism, animal rights or cancer research, look for an event that contributes to it.



Register early, as many half marathons fill up many months before the event.
Registration information may also include special requirements, such as minimum finish times, which you should account for in your training goals.

 By stretching the muscles, you help to loosen tight muscles, which helps prevent you from sustaining a potential injury. The stretching also helps to warm up the muscles by increasing the oxygen and blood flow throughout the muscles.
 These muscles include the biceps, triceps, wrists, shoulders, upper back muscles, mid back muscles and lower back muscles. This also includes larger muscle groups that make up the interior and exterior muscles in the back, such as the shoulder blades and latissimus dorsi.
 Perform calf stretches, inner thigh and outer thigh stretches, hip flexor stretches, ankle stretches and shin stretches. Also, stretch the quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteus maximus.

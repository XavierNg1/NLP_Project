 The fabric of the dress may not be sturdy enough to support a corsage on its own, especially since they are often larger than boutonnieres. If the fabric is sheer, lace, or just feels very lightweight, you'll want to incorporate a slip or bra strap to make sure the corsage stays up., You'll want to lift the fabric up away from the skin so there's no danger of poking your date.The corsage, like the boutonniere, should be pinned to the left side of the dress.


If you are pinning through a bra strap to secure the flower, use your fingers to lift that away from the skin as well.
 Hold the arrangement in place with your thumb, making sure it is positioned straight., Start from the side closest to the arm, so the head of the pin is pointing to the arm and the point of the pin is pointing toward the breast bone.


If you are using the bra strap, the pin should pass through the dress and the strap, then out again.
 The stem should be held tight between the fabric of the dress and the length of the pin., Smooth the fabric of the dress so that the corsage lays flat against the chest. If you examine the pin, it should go into the dress (and possibly bra strap), then out, then over the stem of the flower, then into the dress and back out again.

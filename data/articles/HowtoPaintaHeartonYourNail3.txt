 To draw a heart on your nail with a toothpick, all you’ll need is a base coat, a nail polish in your preferred color, red nail polish, a piece of paper or foil, a toothpick and a top coat.Avoid using a quick dry polish – this will get sticky too fast.
Try juxtaposing your red heart against a baby blue polish or changing out the red polish for gold glitter polish.
If you don’t have a toothpick, try substituting a bobby pin.
 Apply one coat of base coat on each nail, then allow the base coat to dry completely. Paint each finger nail with your nail polish of choice. Allow both hands to dry, before painting on an additional coat of polish.








Make sure all of your fingers are completely dry before proceeding to the next step.
For a fun Valentine’s Day look, paint the fingers white so the hearts will pop even more.
 Pour a small amount of the red nail polish onto the piece of tin foil or paper. Allow the puddle of polish to sit for one minute so it can thicken slightly. Dip the toothpick into the polish and make a dot on your left ring finger.








Make a second dot next to the first dot.
Use the toothpick to drag one of the dots down, creating a 45 degree angle.
Drag the other dot down to meet the first dot, creating the heart.
Do the same thing on your right ring finger.
Allow the hearts to dry completely, before painting on one coat of top coat.

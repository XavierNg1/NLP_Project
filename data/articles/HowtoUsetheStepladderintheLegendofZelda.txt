 The Stepladder can be found inside the Fourth Dungeon. It is located northwest from the starting point at the bottom middle of the map. From the starting point, move one map tile up, then take two map tiles to the left. Once you’re there, take another two map tiles upward to find the entrance to the Fourth Dungeon.;
, The Stepladder can be found seven rooms from the entrance of the Fourth dungeon. Simply follow the linear path of the level, and you’ll get to the seventh room where two spinning Bubble enemies (ball of fire with a skull inside) can be found along several random monsters.


Kill all other monsters in that room except for the two Bubbles (because they cannot be destroyed), and a secret staircase will appear.
 Enter the secret staircase, and it will lead you to an underground room where you can see the Stepladder. Approach the Stepladder to retrieve it, and leave the room through the same staircase you used to get inside.
 Roam around inside the Fourth Dungeon, or outside on the Overworld, and look for one-square wide gaps that are blocking the path, such as rivers or trenches.


The Stepladder can only cover one-square wide gaps. It will not work on large breaches.
 Just like the Raft, the Stepladder is one of the few items that don’t need to be equipped before it can be used. Move close to the edge, and as you step over the gap, the Stepladder will automatically appear, letting you cross over.
 As you step to the other side of the gap, the Stepladder will disappear, and you can continue on your journey without stopping.

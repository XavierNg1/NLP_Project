 If they don't like the idea then tell them it's a good opportunity to learn new stuff your parents or a tutor can't teach you (like how to play an instrument, and chorus, or woodshop). If they still say no tell them it's good for you to socialize, and get to know your peers. Parents may say that you are social enough because most homeschooled teens are.;
, Go with your parents and look around. You don't want to jump ahead and make a decision before making sure you like the school. Meet the staff and see if you like them, get a tour, and check out the classes they offer and the after school activities. You can sometimes shadow someone for a day to get the feel for the school. If you don't like the school and there's another in town (maybe even a private school; if you can't afford it, many offer scholarships), look around the other schools and pick the one you like the most. If you live in a small town and there's only one school you may be able to go to another school in a bigger or different town; however, some towns won't let you.
 You'll need at least one of your parents to come with your birth certificate, Social Security card, and health records (actually shot records -- can't get into school without them).
 Get at least five notebooks, 3 three ring binders, trapper is optional, pencils, pens, colored pencils, erasers, a ruler, a calculator, and a backpack (nowadays shoulder bags are in, but backpacks are more convenient).
 It will make you feel more comfortable with your new school.
 When you get someone to show you around make sure that they show you other important places like the cafeteria, the gymnasium, the auditorium (if they have one), and the locker rooms.
 Tell them what you know, also ask them about what they expect from you. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help when it's needed.

 The rice stitch is ideal for washcloths because of its rough texture. Try making a washcloth with the rice stitch using 100% cotton yarn.You will need to check the gauge of your yarn to determine how many stitches to cast on. This number will vary depending on the thickness of your yarn. For example, if you are using a medium weight yarn, then you may need to cast on 25 stitches for a washcloth. However, if you are using a chunky yarn, then you may only need to cast on 11 stitches.
 The rice stitch also makes a cute baby blanket. Try using some baby blanket yarn to make a baby blanket for your own baby or as a gift for someone.If you are using a lightweight yarn and a pair of size 8 (5mm) needles, then cast on 163 stitches. Then, begin working in the rice stitch until your blanket is complete.
 The rice stitch also creates an interesting pattern that looks great as a scarf. Try making a scarf for yourself or for a friend.

Keep in mind that the number of stitches you need to cast on will depend on your yarn type and needles. For example, if you are using chunky yarn, then you can cast on 24 stitches using a pair of size 11 needles. Then, work the rice stitch until your scarf is the desired length.

 BBQ nachos are the potato-based alternative to classic nachos. You use potato chips and pair them with delicious BBQ meat. Go to the grocery store and get these ingredients:


Potato chips: get either flavored or plain, ruffled or smooth.
Cheese: choose pepperjack, cheddar or both, shredded.
Salsa: pico de gallo is the clear winner for this dish, as anything saucier will compete with the BBQ.
Sour cream: you can skip this if you want, but it’s surprisingly delicious with BBQ sauce.
BBQ: pulled pork is available at any BBQ joint and most grocery stores. Make sure to get the sauce, too.

BBQ chicken is also delicious, but never serve anything with bones.
Vegetarian chili or baked beans are also great substitutes for meat.
 Choose a cooking dish based on your heat source, either oven broiler safe or microwavable. Build a mound of chips that covers the bottom of the pan.
 Try to get an equal amount of cheese on all of the chips.
 If you’re broiling, set the oven rack 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the heat source and broil until the cheese melts. This will usually happen in 5 minutes. Be careful not to burn the cheese. If you’re microwaving, microwave on high for 2 minutes. Let the nachos cool for a few minutes when they’re done cooking.
 Place dollops of sour cream and salsa on top of the nachos. Pile the BBQ in the middle. Sprinkle other toppings and condiments around the sides.
 Since these nachos are served with meat, you may want to offer your dinner guests a fork this time. Dish the nachos onto plates and serve with extra toppings on the side.

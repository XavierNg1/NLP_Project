 Height is the length from top to bottom, and width is the length from side to side. Let’s say your measurement gives a 24” width and a 30” length. It would be considered a 24x30 inch space to fill requirement. We can use that measurement to work backwards and find the perfect size ornate mirror.


Why should we work backwards from this measurement? For large wall mirrors, most all wood constructed frames come in standard sizes, which are derived from the size of the opening of the frame, not the outside dimensions. The opening can either hold a mirror, or a picture that is equal to that size. The standard size 24x30 framed large wall mirror contains a frame moulding that is various inches thick plus, a mirror that is size 24x30. Thus a 24x30 mirror with a 3” thick moulding is actually 24” + 3” (moulding width) + 3” (moulding width) = 30” is the actual outside measurement.






A 24x30 wall mirror with a 4” moulding would be calculated as follows: 24+4+4=32 and 30+4+4=38 So, the outside measurement is actually 32x38, even though it’s called a 24x30 large wall mirror.






Popular standard ornate mirror sizes are 8x10, 11x14, 12x16, 14x18, 16x20, 20x24, 24x36, 30x40 and 36x48. Taking these sizes in to consideration and working backwards will give the ORDER SIZE.

, Using the above example, let’s pick a frame that is 3-1/2” thick in moulding width. Earlier, we measured a space requirement of 24x30. We prefer a moulding 3-1/2” wide. Using those figures and working backwards you can find the right ORDER SIZE.


24 minus 3-1/2 minus 3-1/2 = 16” Then, 30 minus 3-1/2 minus 3-1/2 = 23” So 16x23 is the exact dimension you need, but which standard size comes the closest to matching?






Of the standard sizes available, the 16x20 most closely matches these requirements, even though the 20” length is three inches short of the target. You might consider ordering the next size larger, a 20x24, but the 20” width is 4” wider than you need, and the 24” length is 1” longer. Check your space requirements and decide which is best for you.

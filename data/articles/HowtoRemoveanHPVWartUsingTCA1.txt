Your doctor might want to know:

How long have you had HPV warts?
Do your HPV warts cause pain when touched?
Have you receive treatment for HPV warts before?


You might want to ask:

What is the best treatment plan?
How did I contract HPV warts?
Is there any danger in leaving HPV warts untreated?

, There are a wide variety of treatments available for treating HPV warts. You and your doctor should consider the size, shape, location, and quantity of warts before settling on a treatment.You should also consider the cost of treatment. TCA, podophyllin resin, and imiquimod treatments are more expensive than cryotherapy, surgical removal, and laser treatments. However, TCA is less expensive than interferon treatment. TCA typically costs $500-$1,000 depending on the extent and number of HPV warts.You can also discuss cryotherapy with your doctor. This is the process of freezing off the warts using liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe. It requires weekly or biweekly applications.Your doctor may also apply podophyllin resin in a 10 to 25% compound.There are also some medications that you can apply yourself including podofilox, imiquimod, or sinecatechins.HPV warts larger than 10 millimeters in diameter should be removed surgically.If you are pregnant, TCA is a safe option.HPV warts often abate on their own given enough time. If you are concerned about paying for or receiving treatment, consider waiting for a time to allow the warts to go away.
 TCA must be applied by a doctor.Do not attempt to apply it yourself or to have someone else apply it for you.

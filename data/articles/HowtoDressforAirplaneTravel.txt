 Airports and airplanes are full of tired holidaymakers who have no desire to look their very best. You can look clean cut and fashionable without wearing your best outfit.;
, You could wear your comfiest, maybe slightly worn bottoms and your favourite, more dressy top. Or vice versa. Your whole outfit doesn't have to be high fashion, but one piece could be.
, If you can avoid it, don't wear a belt as you'll have to take it off. Wear shoes that are easy to take off and put back on, not the ones that take ages to lace up.
, You might not get an easy time from other passengers if you're wearing a t-shirt with a racist joke or a picture of a middle finger. There will be thousands of different people with different beliefs, be respectful of that.
 Nobody will judge you for looking slightly sloppier than usual. They'll be too busy rushing around to know or care what other passengers are wearing!

 Like midday (depending on the artist/band). If you're seeing someone big, do your research. Smaller artists/bands, you can show up at like 2pm.;
, If you're seeing a big artist, unless someone is able to come and pick up all your things when Â you're going in, or you plan on leaving everything behind.



Do not bring a bag. This will slow you down as it will need to be inspected as you enter. Do not take a jacket that you will need to take to the cloakroom as this will also lose you time.
Go to the toilet locally 30 minutes before the doors open, and have a friend hold your spot, then swap. This will also save time.
 Plenty of people make up the front row, plus those in front of you will be eating their time by not following the above tip.
 O2 often have a priority queue in some places. Find out what you need to avoid being held back whilst others get in.
 Unfortunately some venues have gendered queues, meaning queues are divided to get the same gender security to search you. If you and the person/people you're going in with are mixed genders, consider meeting at the barrier rather than waiting for each other. (Apologies for this binary explanation).

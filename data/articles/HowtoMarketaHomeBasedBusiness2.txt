 Sharing your knowledge will help the community, promote your company and help you reach potential clients and customers.


Find free or inexpensive space to hold your seminar, such as a library or community center.
Ask clients if they will help you demonstrate your services. For example, if you are a caterer, ask a regular client if you can hold a cooking class in her home.
 Your home-based business can benefit from business cards, flyers, brochures, postcards and other materials that can be handed out or mailed.



Join your local chamber of commerce, and other business and community groups. Introduce yourself at meetings and events and talk about what kinds of services and products your business provides.
Talk to people. Whether you are on an airplane, in line at a store or sitting at a park, everyone around you is a potential customer. Practice communicating with everyone you come into contact with.

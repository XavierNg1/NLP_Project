 To use this method, you need to know the length of the base, or you need to be provided with a line segment that represents the base. You also need to know the measurement of the two angles adjacent to the base. Remember that the two angles adjacent to the base of an isosceles triangle will be equal. For example, you might know that an isosceles triangle has a base measuring 9 cm, with two adjacent 45-degree angles.
 If you know the measurement of the base, use a ruler to draw it the appropriate length. Make sure to measure exactly, and to create a straight line.


You can also draw the base by setting the compass to the same width as a provided line segment. Draw an endpoint. Make the other endpoint using the compass. Then use a straightedge to connect the two endpoints.
 Use a protractor to draw the angle on the left side of the base. The vector should pass a little more than halfway over the base, so that it will intersect with the other side of the triangle.
 Use a protractor to draw the angle on the right side of the base. Make sure the second vector intersects the first. Where the two lines intersect creates the apex of the triangle. The resulting figure is an isosceles triangle.

 In some cases, Comcast will work with you to save money on your existing services by offering you the discount.


If Comcast is not initially willing to provide you with a discount, mention the amount of time you have had Comcast as your provider. If you have been with Comcast for over 1 year, Comcast may view you as a loyal customer and provide you with the discount.
If you have always paid your Comcast bills on time, mention this factor to Comcast; as this may also demonstrate your loyalty to their company.
 This strategy can be used if Comcast is not willing to work with you regarding a discount; especially if the same discount is being offered by their competitors. You may then be transferred to a Comcast retention specialist, who will most likely offer you additional discounts or promotions to keep your business.


This is another important moment in which you can bring up the cost or advantages of a competing company's plans. Explain to what extent the convenience of using the other company's services makes their offer more attractive. Try to make this point early in the conversation, as this will force them to begin providing counter offers from the very beginning.
 Make sure to receive a confirmation number--either as stated by the customer service agent or sent to your email--before you hang up. Comcast agents do not have the best track record of customer service, and there are many noted instances in which the promises given over the phone have not fit with the bills that customers receiver later.Like most service providers, Comcast has a customer retention department that deals specifically with customers who threaten to cut their service or switch to a competitor. These agents are trained to be somewhat difficult to work with, but they also have the right to provide certain offers that are not widely available otherwise.If you can be extremely patient with them, you can get a deal.

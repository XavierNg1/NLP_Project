 The person sitting in front of the piano needs good ears to be able to tell whether or not you are hitting the right notes. It is very difficult to tell where your own voice is without training. Also, keep in mind that you must trust what your friend/pianist is telling you. If they say 'you're not hitting that last note right', then you're really not hitting it.;
, Or an alternative (to learn the scale degrees rather than just singing nonsense); "one, two, three, four, five, six, sev, eight" (Sev being short for seven)

, Sing the same pitches on "me-oh-my-oh-meee-oh-my-oh-meeee." Hold the top and the final pitch. Be at ease.
, Continue moving up scales a half-step at a time, using a relaxed jaw and tongue. Avoid any strain or tension in the throat or neck.
 The pitch is C. If this pitch is at your highest comfort level, C is the top of your vocal range., The pianist can identify the uppermost notes and the degree of ease you exhibit.,, The lowest note must resonate and be clear. Your vocal range will grow slowly with wise guidance, regular practice and care.

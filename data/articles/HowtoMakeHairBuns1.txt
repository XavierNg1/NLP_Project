 Brush your hair with a comb or a brush to remove any knots and tangles that may be present.









A classic bun works with clean hair and hair that hasn't been washed in a day or two, but if you are looking for a more profession style, work with clean hair. If you are looking for create a messier bun style, you can work with either clean or unwashed hair.
You can also skip this step if you are trying to create an even messier bun.;
, Collect all of your hair using one hand, with an elastic hair tie around the wrist of the hand collecting your hair. Hold the hair at the location where you want to have your bun.
 With the hand not holding your hair, pull the elastic band from your wrist (from the hand that is holding your hair), and pull your gathered hair through the elastic ponytail holder. Wrap the elastic ponytail holder around your hair about 3 times, as if you are tying your hair back for a normal ponytail. On the third wrap of the ponytail, don’t pull your hair all the way through the elastic band. Instead, leave ½-⅓ of your hair hanging out the bottom as a tail, while the remaining portion of your hair will create a loop in the upper part of the ponytail.









Buns looks great on virtually all types of hair, but work better on medium length hair and longer. This is because longer hair ensures that all of the hair can fit in the bun and be pulled back evenly.
 Pull out little pieces of your hair to let them hang loose (for a messier look), or comb back areas that have flyaways. Consider using a small amount of hairspray to keep the flyaways flat to your head.









You can add different headbands, barrettes, or other hair accessories to give your bun a bit more of a personalized look.

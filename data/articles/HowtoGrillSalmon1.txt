 Blend the dry seasonings—garlic powder, salt, and pepper—in a small bowl, and dust the salmon evenly with that.;
, Blend the lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil until it is well blended and the sugar is dissolved, and then pour into a large Ziploc plastic bag with the fish.


Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and no more than 4. Turn occasionally to mix things up.



For a charcoal grill, heap the coals to the side so you have a hot area and a warm area. Consider using real wood charcoal, as the briquettes impart a chemical taste to delicate meats.
For a gas grill, set the temperature to medium heat: 325° F (160° C).
, Discard the marinade.
, Place the salmon on the hottest part of the grill to get grill marks on it—it only takes a minute or so on each side.

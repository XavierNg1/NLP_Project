 The easiest way to add a personal touch is through your song choices. Check online for lists of common last dance songs for some inspiration.Consider choosing a song that’s meaningful for both you and your new spouse and for your friends and family.
 Think about your family or cultural traditions, and find ways to incorporate them into your unique exit. Consider doing this as a nice nod to your history, especially if your ceremony isn’t otherwise consistent with your traditions.For example, if you are of Indian descent but are not having a traditional, multi-day ceremony, find ways to incorporate clothing, dance, or other culturally relevant details.
If, for instance, you are from New Orleans or if the city is special to you, having the band or DJ play “When the Saints Go Marching In” as your guests wave white clothes would be a nod to New Orleans tradition.
 Whether you go with a traditional nod or unique, out of this world spectacle, make your exit memorable by having your guests send you off to your married life.


More traditional send-off rituals include throwing rice, wheat, or candy. You can also consider less traditional options like confetti, flower petals, or even paper airplanes. You can also go with ribbon wands or handkerchiefs  if your venue won’t allow throwing items.Bubbles, glow sticks, and balloons have all become trendier recently, and are great quirky choices if you want to make a statement.Whatever you opt for, try to choose a material that bears some special meaning for you, your new spouse, and your guests.   

, Your families, wedding planner, venue, and other sources will most likely have plenty of suggestions, preferences, and expectations. However, remember that it's your big day and your party. Remember that you and your new spouse need to make the decisions that are right for you.


If you want to make your exit by sneaking out the side door, feel free! Do whatever will allow you and your new spouse to put each other first.

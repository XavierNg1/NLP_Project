 Stenciling a gift box is a great way to add your personal, unique touch. Here's a list of what you will need:

Plain gift box
Stencils
Painter's tape or masking tape (optional)
Acrylic or tempera paint
Foam brush or stencil brush
Paint palette or paper plate
Paper weights, cups, stones, etc

, You will be stenciling one side of the box at a time. Some stencils are sticky on the back and will stick to the box on their own. If your stencil does not have a sticky back, you will need to put a piece of painter's tape or masking tape along each edge to hold it down.

If your box has a lid, then take the lid off, and stencil it separately.
 You can use acrylic paint or tempera paint. Acrylic paint will give you a nice, glossy finish. Tempera paint will give you a somewhat chalky or dusty finish, which can also be very nice.

You can also use glitter and glue instead if you want your design to be super glittery.
If you want your design to be only somewhat glittery, you glitter paint instead of regular paint., This will keep you from picking up too much paint. If you apply too much paint at once, the paint may slip under the stencil and cause smears and drips., Keep taping until the entire area is covered with paint. If the paint is too thin, apply a second, thin coat. It is better to layer many thin coats than slap on one thick coat., At this point, you can flip or rotate the box to make it easier to paint. Most paints should be dry to the touch within 5 to 20 minutes., Just because something looks dry does not mean that it is dry underneath. If you move your box too soon, you may risk smearing the paint. Most paints will be completely dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours, but you might want to check the label on the paint bottle just in case.

If you added glitter to your design, you might want to spray the box with a clear, acrylic sealer. Make sure that the spray is glossy, or your glitter will lose its sparkle.

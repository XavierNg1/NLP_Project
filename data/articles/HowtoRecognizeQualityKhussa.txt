 Many manufacturers will use inferior leather for the uppers of the khussa and some use poor quality leather for the entire shoe. To avoid this, the uppers should not be a different color leather than the soles. The shoe should look stiff, not floppy (good khussa leather starts off very stiff and then breaks in to conform to your foot). The leather should appear thick, not thin. Poor quality leather can be bad for sensitive skin and can take on an offensive odor over time.;
, Khussa are often referred to as Indian shoes, but they are made in India, Pakistan, and China. Pakistan is widely recognized as providing the best quality handmade khussa shoes. Leather is cleaned with a process using salt; Pakistan has huge supplies of salt and uses it liberally. Salt is very expensive in India and is used sparingly to clean leather. Pakistan is also world-renowned for their quality hand stitching (many high end shoes are made in Pakistan, as are sports balls, including the world's best soccer balls). Stitching techniques are passed down through families for many generations. Chinese khussa are normally very low quality and cheaply made.
 If the shoe looks slapped together, it probably is slapped together. Are there plenty of close-up pictures?

, Will they be there for you after the sale to answer questions? Do they have a return policy (does it allow returns if you get the wrong size)? Does the return policy cover shipping? If not, how much is their shipping? Is there a restocking fee? Are they easy to contact?

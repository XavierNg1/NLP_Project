 While our modern communication has taken on so many new forms--Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more--there may be a price to pay for so much connectivity. Instead of trying to be an active member of multiple sites, consider using one as your go-to social media outlet.Focus your attention on the primary social media you are already using most. Identify a platform that feels most natural to you.
Consider how the primary social media site that you use will change over time depending on your age, career, and interests.;
, You will be less likely to check your phone or email constantly if you turn off the ringer. When you receive a notification, you likely are made aware of it by a "ding" or other sound. Controlling the sound will reduce your anxiety.If you need to receive notifications for work, then learn how to limit them after hours or turn them off when away.
If you are receiving social media or news alerts on your phone, consider whether these alerts are needed. They are likely more distracting than helpful when you need to work, study, or rest.
Read digests or minutes of chat instead of checking alerts each time they occur, if these are available.
 Never feel like you have to apologize for taking a few hours or more to respond to a text, phone call, or email. Break free from the cycle of information overload by removing the social expectation of responding instantaneously.The amount of time you take to respond will set the tone for future communications.
If you want to be able to separate yourself from your work or obligations, don't make others depend on you to respond immediately.
It's okay to "ignore" some communications, and put them off until the next day.
You may also consider getting an app that will respond to text messages for you when you are busy. You can set an away message that will automatically go out to anyone who sends you a text.

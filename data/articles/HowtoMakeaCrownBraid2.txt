 Do this on the left side of your head, right above your left ear. Split this section into three parts. If you need to separate the sections by using elastic bands, feel free to do so.
 Make an 'inside-out' French braid or Dutch Braid. You want to make sure that the braid is tight, otherwise it will not look like a "crown." After you have completed the braid, tie an elastic band around the end to secure it in place. Let it hang down until the next step.
 Take 1-2 inches of your hair above your right ear. Split this section three equal ways. Braid an inside-out braid, and make sure that it is tight. Finally, tie the end with an elastic band.
 Pull it around the back of your head. The braid should rest about 2 inches above the back of your neck. Pin this braid into place using a Bobbi pin. The "crown" should appear circular, so do not pull the braid straight back.
 Pull it around the back, in the same circular motion. Rest it against the other braid. You should tuck the end of that braid, under the initial braid. Finally, pin it down using a Bobbi pin. You may want to use a few extra pins, sealing both braids together.

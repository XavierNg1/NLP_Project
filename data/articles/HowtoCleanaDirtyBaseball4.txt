 Lift the latch and pour the baseballs into the container. Baseball cleaning machines are able to scrub dozens of balls clean in just a few hours. If you need to clean many balls on a frequent basis, an expensive baseball cleaning machine might be a worthwhile investment


Choose baseballs that have roughly the same amount of dirt for each load. Cleaner balls will take less time than dirtier balls, so break the balls up into groups to get the best results.
Read your machine's owner manual to determine the maximum number of baseballs you can safely load. These machines do not typically require a minimum number.
This technique is best for cleaning well-used, very grimy baseballs., Commercial baseball cleaning machines use a dry rubber compound to clean the balls without using moisture. This helps to preserve the leather and won't waterlog the balls.This method is essentially a large-scale, extremely thorough, automated version of the pencil eraser method.
 Place the drum back on the machine. Turn the machine on and set its timer. The base will rotate the drum full of balls along with the cleaning compound. If your baseballs are still not scrubbed white at the end of the run, you can always start the machine up again.


Lightly-scuffed balls take roughly an hour to clean.
Moderate grime can be removed in two to three hours.
Baseballs caked in a serious amount of dirt may take as long as 12 hours to thoroughly clean. Feel free to leave these loads to run overnight., When the cycle is complete, remove the drum from the machine. Open the lid and remove the balls. They should be a shiny, bright white.


Leave the cleaning compound in the drum for the next load of balls. These rubber chips can be used until they've been entirely worn away, just like a pencil eraser.

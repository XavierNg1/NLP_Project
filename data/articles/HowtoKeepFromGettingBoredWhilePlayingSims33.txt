 Make a family of Sims, all with the kleptomaniac and mooch traits. Make them look scruffy (make them barefoot for example). Move the family into an empty lot. Make them sleep on park benches or at a neighbour's house. When they visit people's houses make them use their showers and eat their food.
 Make a huge family and make their children fight with each other and make their parents lazy. See if they can successfully raise their kids.
 Play as one of the pre-made families that are already living in Sunset Valley. Pick one of the richer families who have good jobs and a nice house. Make them get fired from their job and take away all of their money. Watch them suffer as their belongings get taken away.
 Make a supersize sim and make them marry a super-skinny sim. You could give the supersize Sim traits such as heavy sleeper and couch potato, give the superskinny sim the opposite. You could even mix it up and make the superskinny sim the lazy couch potato and the supersize sim athletic.
 This is extremely challenging, but make 1 parent with traits such as family orientated and good (this will make the challenge easier). Make 7 toddlers within the household. See if the adult can look after and raise all 7 toddlers without any been taken away by the social worker.

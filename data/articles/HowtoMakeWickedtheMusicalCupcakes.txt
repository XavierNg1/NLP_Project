 Line the paper cupcake cases on a baking tray (sheet) in readiness for use.;
, Half melt the butter and add it into the bowl (it is easier to mix when melted).
, Beat again until the mixture is smooth.


If you want to, try a bit to make sure it is not poisonous––just not a whole spoonful, or the whole bowl!

, Although you do not need to sieve the flour, it is best to do so as it helps to make the cakes fluffy.
 If you are using the suggested additional ingredients, now is the time to add the raisins, sultanas or chocolate chips.
, Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.
 Add the icing, sugar, water, and green food coloring. In another small bowl, do the same but use pink food coloring in it instead of green.
 Allow to cool.
 Add the green icing to 8 of the cupcakes and pink icing to the other 8 (if you are making 16 cupcakes). Divide evenly, depending on the amount of cupcakes.
 For example, you could put dark chocolate sprinkles on Elphaba's cupcake and white and pink sugar glitter on G(a)linda's.

 At the time of your initial appointment, go ahead and make a series of future ones. These additional meetings will be opportunities for your vet to check your cat’s physical condition and to discuss any behavioral changes with you. If your cat’s weight changes, the dosage may need to be adjusted, too.The careful monitoring that MA requires means that it is not a good treatment option for feral colonies or other free-ranging cats.
 Keep a close eye on your cat’s eating, drinking, and litterbox habits. Make sure that they are continuing to groom themselves. Some of the possible long-term side effects from MA include pyometra (a uterine infection), mammary cancer, and diabetes. Short-term side effects include weight loss, lethargy, and vomiting.Be aware that some of these side effects can occur immediately after you cat begins treatment.
 Make note if your cat begins to exhibit any destructive or problematic behaviors. The combination of stress and MA can make some cats start urine marking or furniture scratching. Other cats exhibit overt aggressiveness by biting or scratching., When you talk with your vet, make sure to disclose any and all medications or supplements that your cat is currently taking. If your vet is concerned about a possible drug interaction, then they may request that you monitor your cat even more closely or more frequently. MA does have some known interactions with drugs such as rifampin., When you’ve finished giving your cat MA, continue to take your cat in for yearly appointments. Also, watch for any warning signs of possible uterine infections, such as loss of appetite. It is important to catch these issues early on, so that proactive treatment can take place.

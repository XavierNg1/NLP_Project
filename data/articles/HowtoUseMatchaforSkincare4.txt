½ cup organic coconut oil
1 tablespoon green tea (loose leaf or from bags)
1 teaspoon matcha

, Once your scrub is ready, rub it gently into the skin on your body. Leave it on for a few minutes to let the oils and matcha moisturize your skin. Consider applying the scrub in shower or bathtub to avoid a mess on your floors.Rinse off the scrub thoroughly with warm water when you’re finished.

 Once you’ve constructed your sun chart, you will have a good idea of what areas of your yard get exposed to light and for how long. This information is crucial in growing a vibrant, healthy garden.


Plants are categorized by their need for sunlight and usually sorted into three broad categories: full sunlight, partial sun/partial shade, full shade. Full sunlight means at least six hours of sun per day and full shade means less than three hours of sun.Plant according to the amount of sunlight an area gets from the observations made in your sun chart.
 Maybe there isn’t one location in your yard that gets enough sun to plant what you were hoping to plant. This can be remedied by planting in a small pot or planter and altering the location of the plant to get the sun it needs. This can be a tedious process, but will allow you to grow plants that need more or less sunlight than your yard can provide.


Note: As the plants grow, the planters will get heavier and be more difficult to move.
 Hang on to your sun chart and use it as a reference the next time you want to do a round of plantings. You might also want to make separate sun charts for the different seasons and refer to those as well.


Keep the sun chart with your gardening tools or in the gardening shed if you have one.

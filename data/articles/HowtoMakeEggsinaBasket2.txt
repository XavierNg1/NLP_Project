 Spray ramekins or a muffin pan with cooking spray, or line them with parchment paper.
 Butter the bread on both sides and fit into the ramekins or muffin pan. Press them gently into the ramekins, allowing the edges to fold over each other.


Since this recipe is baked instead of fried, it is a healthier, calorie friendly variation. To cut calories and make a healthy dish, choose bread with less calories and carbs.
To cut even more calories, do not butter the bread. Instead, place it in the ramekins as is.
Another variation is to cut holes into a loaf of French bread instead of placing bread into the ramekins.Baking eggs into a French loaf is not a healthier, lower carb, calorie friendly option.
 Break one egg into each ramekin or muffin tin. Place into the oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until the egg whites are cooked. If you would like harder yolks, cook for longer., After letting the ramekin or muffin tin cool, remove the bread bowls and place onto plates. Use a knife to loosen if the bread has stuck to the pan.


Sprinkle seasonings such as salt, pepper, paprika, or garlic on top for flavor. Other options include topping with shredded cheese, bacon or ham, tomatoes, or avocado.

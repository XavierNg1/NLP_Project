 Because of its relative simplicity, there is a lot you can add to poha to suit your tastes. Some additional spices to consider alongside the onions include:


3 pods green cardamom
1 tsp ground or freshly cut ginger
1/2 tsp chili powder
A pinch asafoetida (found at Indian grocer)
1/2 tsp garam masala, This recipe gets a light, crispy texture to the potatoes that matches well with the peanuts. Use an extra 1/2 tb of oil and fry the potatoes in the oil before they are a light golden color on the outside, then add the mustard seed and continue with the recipe.


Do not fully cook the potatoes before continuing -- they will continue to cook with the onions and spices., Chickpeas, known as "chana" in Indian cuisine, can go in right before the onions, getting a nice golden brown outside in the final dish. For some people, chana is essential to a good poha recipe., Though not in many traditional poha recipes, modern chefs have begun to incorporate a variety of vegetables from around the world into poha with wonderful results. The light sweetness and quick cooking time of green peas make them perfect for poha.Try adding 1/2 cup of chopped tomatoes right before serving as well.
 This little breakfast tip is a perfect pairing of savory and spicy. Add a scoop of plain yogurt your bowl right before serving if you think it is too hot, or if you want a little tangy flavor in the poha.

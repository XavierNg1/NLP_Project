 Your intuition can also help you find the answers to difficult questions. To find an answer to a question that has been plaguing you, you may want to spend some time praying about it or meditating on it to see how your intuition responds.For example, you might start your prayer or meditation by asking out loud (or in your head), “What should I do about ___?” Then, try to clear your mind and await a response.
 Taking a break from intrusive technologies like phones, computers, and televisions can allow you a chance to get in touch with your intuition and find answers to your questions.Try taking a walk outside, alone, and without any devices that might distract you. As you walk, focus on your surroundings and try not to dwell on your question. Just allow your mind to wander and look for cues from the natural world.
 A blind reading may also help you to find an answer to a difficult question. In a blind reading, you try to figure out what your intuition is telling you by writing down three solutions and feeling out your response to those solutions.Think about your question, then write the three most likely solutions on three separate index cards.
Then, shuffle the cards and place them face down on a table.
Next, hold your hand over each card and rate your attraction to that card on a scale of one to 10 (with 10 being the highest).
After you have rated each of the cards, turn them over and see which solution you were the most drawn to without knowing what was on the other side of the card.

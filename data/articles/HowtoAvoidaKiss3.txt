 Bend backwards, a la Matrix and wave your arms about in slow motion. If you know how to fall over safely, fall as well and excuse yourself for being clumsy.
 That's right, start dribbling or letting your nose run. If the person has good eyesight, this might be enough to put them off. However, older people may not notice, or if they do, they may not care. This might be best combined with sneezing and generally looking unwell.
 Pull back from the person and act weird and uncomfortable. Go into a corner and simply stand there, saying nothing. This isn't a good one for people who know you well and will be seeing you again––it'll just be interpreted as rudeness or silliness.
 Throw a tantrum, go bat crazy or start writhing around on the grass in agony. Do anything that distracts the would-be kisser from remembering that they were about to kiss you.
 Demand that little poochie gets a kiss on his wee little nosey first before you get one. There are high chances that neither of you will get a kiss.

 If you have a tipped cigarillo, though they are not common, you will likely need a cutter.There are three major varieties of cutters--punch/bullet cuts, v-cuts, and straight or "guillotine" cuts. The punch/bullet cutter is the easiest cutter to use. Insert the cigarillo's tip into the opening, push and twist the blade, and then pull it out.
 This is not the best cutter to use since it only notches into the tip and can result in an uneven burn, but it is an option. And if you are removing the filter, this may be insufficient.Insert the cigarillo tip into the v-slot double bladed area.
Extend and then squeeze the ends of the cutter to snip the end.
Pull back the sliced tip and discard.
 The straight cutters come in single or double bladed forms, but operate mostly the same way.Insert the cigarillo tip into the bladed opening.
Extend then squeeze the ends to snip the tip.
Remove the tip and discard.

 If you don't want to block your friend, you can prevent them from seeing specific posts by editing the "Who should see this?" settings in your status field.


For mobile, tap the "Facebook" app to open Facebook.
 You'll find the status creation field at the top of your screen; it usually says something like "What's on your mind?".


On mobile, you'll need to tap the status creation field to view its options.
 This will prompt a drop-down menu with options regarding who can see your status.


The "Friends" option is below your name in the top left corner if you're on mobile.
 The "Custom" option can be used to filter out friends you don't want reading your statuses.


On mobile, tap "Friends except" here.
If you're making a post in which you tag a user, consider unchecking the box next to "Friends of Tagged" to prevent your friend's friends from being able to see your post.
 You'll need to do this in the field beneath the "Don't share with" text; you can add as many people to this list as you please.


On mobile, simply tap the circle to the left of each friend you wish to exclude from your status.
 This will reset your default sharing option to "Custom"; you can change it back to "Friends" at any time from within the same menu.


For mobile, tap "Done" in the top right corner to save these changes.

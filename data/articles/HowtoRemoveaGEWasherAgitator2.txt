 Many older models of GE washing machines (specifically those made before 1992) have agitators that aren't secured in place with a bolt.This means that you don't necessarily need any special tools to remove the agitator, though you may if chemical buildup has caused it to become stuck in place. In this case, see the section on "stuck" agitators below.


Before beginning, for your safety, be sure to unplug the machine as above.
 Brace yourself firmly against the washing machine and pull directly upward on the agitator. With some force, the agitator should come off of its mounting, exposing the drive shaft underneath. Avoid twisting or jerking the agitator from side to side.


Don't hurt yourself by straining too hard to remove the agitator. See below for more information on how to handle a stuck agitator.
If you're having trouble, you may also want to consult GE's online database of product manuals for more information., Older models of washing machines usually have a metal shaft under the agitator that requires occasional lubrication to keep the motion of the agitator smooth. As long as your have access to the shaft, ensure it stays in good working order by using a small amount of petroleum jelly (often called by the brand name Vaseline) to lubricate it.


For most models of washers, lubrication is recommended twice each year.
 The agitators in many models of washing machine (particularly more recent ones) aren't designed to be removed normally â€” instead, they require special tools or techniques that only trained service people have access to. In these cases, you may not be able to remove the agitator even if there is no obvious bolt holding it in place, so your only option is to enlist the help of a mechanic.

 Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes coined the term “impostor syndrome” to describe feelings of “phoniness in people who believe that they are not intelligent, capable or creative despite evidence of high achievement.” If you worry that you are less clever than your colleagues, it is likely that you are afflicted. The first step in overcoming impostor syndrome is to acknowledge it, and to understand that many, many people experience these feelings., The funny thing about impostor syndrome is that it leads you to ignore or discount proof that you are qualified. In order to counter this, try to embrace your successes. Don’t attribute your accomplishments to “getting lucky.” It wasn’t luck; you worked hard to get where you are and you deserve it., Words like “merely,” “just,” “only,” or “simply” work to undermine your achievements and minimize your contributions, giving your impostor syndrome fuel. Work to ban these words from your vocabulary! Edit your email correspondences to remove these words and work to strike them from your vernacular at work., Often times, impostor syndrome rears its ugly head when we begin looking at the successes (or even the shortcomings) of others. Anytime you find yourself sizing yourself up in the relationship to other people, practice stopping dead in your tracks. Remind yourself that the only useful yardstick is one that measures you against yourself., Fear and self-doubt can get in the way of your achievement, but studies have shown that people who suffer from impostor syndrome tend to be very ambitious. Let your desire for success sit in the drivers seat. Take the leap, even if you are terrified to do so. You may always have bouts of self-doubt, but at least this way you’ll also have bouts of professional success.

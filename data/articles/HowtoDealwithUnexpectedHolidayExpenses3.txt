 Save money specifically for your holiday expenses - in general, people tend to save more money when they are saving for a particular goal. Speak to an agent at your financial institution about opening a new savings account where you would save $10 or $20 a month during the year. When the holiday season arrives, cash it out for an extra boost to your shopping budget., As a general rule, air travelers who book a month and a half in advance get the best rates possible, while people who book less than two weeks in advance pay over $100 more, on average, for their fares. Prices for air, rail, and bus travel all go up around the holidays when tickets are in high demand. Book your trip at least a month in advance if possible, and take the time to look for online deals or promotions.Keep checking fares for your trip after you've booked; some airlines will reimburse you for drops in their itinerary prices.
 The best way to prepare for unexpected gift-giving (e.g. a host gift for a last minute party) is to purchase gifts ahead of time to keep on hand. Purchasing “emergency” gifts when things are on sale (right after the holidays, for example) will save you money and keep you prepared for the next holiday season. Some gift ideas to consider might be:A serving platter
Scented candles
Wine glass markers
Cheese knives
Stationery
A flower vase

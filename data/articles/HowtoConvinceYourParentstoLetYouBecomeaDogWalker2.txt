 Your parents are going to ask you a lot of questions. By being prepared for these questions, you can make a better and more persuasive case. You will also look responsible if you have the answers to most of their questions.Questions that your parents might ask are:


“Whose dogs will you be walking?”
“When will you work?” or, “What will your work schedule be like?”
“How much will you be paid?”
“How will you get there?”
“How much do you know about dogs?” or, “Will you be able to handle a dog if it becomes aggressive?”

, Approach your parents when they are not busy doing something, like cooking, fixing the sink, or helping your sibling with their homework. Also, make sure to bring up the topic when they are in a good mood. Don’t bring up the topic when they are stressed or angry.Driving in the car, going for a walk, or after dinner are examples of good times to talk.
If you want to talk, but you see that your parents are busy, then ask, “Can we talk? Is now a good time to talk?” “I have something to talk about with you. When is a good time to talk?” and “Mom (or Dad), do you have a minute?”

, When your parent feels like they are cornered, or if they feel like they are being rushed, they are more likely to say no than yes. Therefore, by asking for a delayed response, it will give your Dad or Mom time to consider your request. This will also make you look patient, and thus, mature.Ask for a delayed response by saying, “You do not need to say yes or no right away. I want you to take the time to review the information, and think about my request before deciding.”
Show some gratitude by saying, “I know both of you guys work really hard to provide for me and my sister. But, I want to start taking more responsibility for some of my things. By having this job, I will be able to pay for some of my clothes and video games. Think about it.”

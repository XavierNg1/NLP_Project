 The sooner you pursue romance, the sooner you’ll find that special someone. It may be scary, but you have to start somewhere.


Start with something as little as changing your body language. Avoid slouching, crossing your legs and arms, and stiffness. If you pull your shoulders back and relax you become approachable. To break the ice and dive into the dating world, you could try finally going out with that acquaintance who's been crushing on you.

You may not be totally interested in every person you date, but it will give you experience.

, For instance, instead of using your smartphone to distract yourself, take the initiative to look around your regular spots. Your future sweetheart may be closer than you think, so try talking to someone you find interesting.


Strike up conversation with someone you often see at your favorite coffee shop.
Ask a colleague out for a casual drink after work.
 You may meet someone special while doing something fulfilling. This special someone might not be your usual type, but that could bring you fresh experiences in love and life.

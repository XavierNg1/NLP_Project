 Using your ice scoop, fill a metal decanter (or just any cup you have really) and dump it into the iced coffee container. Repeat 10 times. The container should just about be full to the top with ice.
 Using the coffee machines, brew five pots of regular coffee (two bags for every one pot). Pour all five pots into the container with ice.

 Cucumbers need the soil to reach at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) in order to grow. Starting the crop in early July is common and will yield a harvest in September.
 The legs of the stake should touch the bottom of the pot, and the stake itself should stand straight without needing additional support.
 Pack the mix into the pot, carefully packing it in around the stake. Do not make it too compact, however, since your cucumber plant's roots need loose soil to grow in. Leave approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of empty space between the surface of the soil and the rim of the pot.
 Try to wiggle it around in the pot. If it still moves around a lot, pack more potting mix around it to make it more stable.
 The hole should be about 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) deep. You can create it by using your pinky finger or the rounded end of a pencil.
 Planting more seeds than necessary will mean that you will have to thin out the cucumber plants as they start to grow, but only planting one or two seeds per hole reduces your odds of success.
 Do not squish the soil into the hole, since doing so may damage the seeds. Instead, loosely drop it over the seeds.
 The soil should be thoroughly and noticeably moist. Do not supersaturate the soil, however, since puddles of water may end up scattering the seeds.
 A thin layer should prevent the soil from drying out too quickly.
 Cucumbers thrive in warm conditions, and the extra sunlight will keep the soil nice and warm.

 Speedtest.net is one of the most commonly recommended apps for broadband speed testing., You can skip this step if you’re just checking the speed of your cellular data network. Your smartphone should be the only device connected to the wireless network while the test is run.
 You can skip this step if you’re testing the speed over Wi-Fi.


Android: Drag down the quick settings menu, tap “Wi-Fi”, then flip the switch to the off position.
iPhone: In the Settings app, tap “Wi-Fi”, then flip the switch to the off position.
 The app will perform a series of tests by sending and receiving from a nearby server.
 When the test has completed, the results will appear on the screen. If the results don’t match up with what you’re promised by your data/network provider, give them a call to discuss the results of your test.


Your ISP’s website should show the purported speeds for your particular plan.

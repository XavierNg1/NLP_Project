 Some problems or situations will not provide you with the radius. Instead, you may be given the diameter of a circle. If the diameter is drawn into your diagram, you can measure it with a ruler. Alternatively, you may just be told the value of the diameter.

Assume for this example that the diameter of your circle is 20 inches.
 Remember that the diameter is equal to double the radius. Therefore, whatever value you are given for the diameter, cut it in half and you will have the radius.

Therefore, the sample circle with a diameter of 20 inches will have a radius of 20/2, or 10 inches.
 After converting the diameter to the radius, you are ready to use the formula A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}} to calculate the area of the circle. Insert the value for the radius and perform the remaining calculations as follows:


A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}


A=π102{\displaystyle A=\pi 10^{2}}


A=100π{\displaystyle A=100\pi }


, Recall that your area is to be reported in square units. In this example, the diameter was measured in inches, so the radius is in inches. Therefore, the area will be reported in square inches. For this sample, the area will be 100π{\displaystyle 100\pi } sq. in.

You can also provide the numerical approximation by multiplying by 3.14 instead of π{\displaystyle \pi }. This will give a result of (100)(3.14) = 314 sq. in.

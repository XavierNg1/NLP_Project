 You are adding the extra length so that you can close the crown later on.
 Try to find a stiffer wire that holds its shape when you form a circle with it. This will create a nice, sturdy base for your crown.
 Overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54). Twist them close, or wrap florists tape around the seam. If the wire is very stiff, gently bend it into a slight oval shape so that it can fit the wearer's head better. This will be the base of your crown.
 Start at the seam, and start wrapping the tape around the wire, like a candy cane. Be sure to overlap the tape a little bit. This will make your crown sturdier. It will also make it easier to attach your flowers to the crown later on.
 Leave a 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long stem at the end of each flower. You will be using this to attach the flower to your crown. It would be a good idea to use wire cutters when snipping the stems; most silk flowers have wires inside the stems.


Consider saving some of the leaves as well. They can make great filler.
 You can add as many or as few flowers as you like. Your entire crown can be covered, or just the top part. Here are some more ideas to get you started:


Arrange the largest flowers in the middle, and use smaller flowers towards the end.
Alternate between large flowers, such as roses, and smaller flowers, such as baby's breath.
Use either warm or cool colors for a unified look. For example, if you want a fall or summer fairy princess, you can try red/pink, orange, and yellow. If you want a winter or ice fairy princess, try green/turquoise, blue, and purple.
Use contrasting colors, such as white, yellow, and sky blue.
 Pick up your first flower, and hold it against the crown. The stem should be parallel to the wire. Wrap green florists tape around the flower and wire. Be sure to extend the tape ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem.
 To create a very full crown, position the flower right over the first flower's stem. To create a thinner, more delicate crown, position the flower just behind the first flower's stem. Wrap florists tape over the stem and wire. Be sure to extend the tape ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem.


, Try using both sheer and solid ribbons for more texture. Cut your ribbons twice as long as you want them to be; you will be folding them in half later on. Generally, about shoulder-length works well.


Consider using varying lengths for a more organic effect.
Smaller princesses may need shorter ribbons so that they won't get caught on anything.
 Gather all of your ribbons together. Fold them in half, all at the same time. Take the folded part (the loop) and place it against the back of your crown, right where the seam is. Take the loose ends of the ribbon, and pull them through the loop. Gently tug down on the loose ends to tighten the loop. You should now have twice as many ribbons trailing down the back of your crown. For example, if you used four ribbons, you'll end up with eight ribbon strands.,

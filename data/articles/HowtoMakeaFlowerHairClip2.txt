 You will be pulling the flowers apart and rearranging them to make your own flowers. Get a few different types of flowers in different shapes, sizes, and colors so that you will have more shapes and colors to work with..


Great fake flowers to use include roses, chrysanthemums, and mums.
 They should pop off easily. Discard the stems, as you won't be needing them. If you want, you can save the leaves for filler.
 Pull the plastic nub off of the back of the flower. Then, pull the different layers apart. Discard the plastic stamen, center, and nub.


If you want, you can separate the petals into different groups based on shape, size, and color. This will keep your work area more organized and make it easier for you to find what you need.
 Make sure that you keep the layers stacked. You can combine more of the same flower to create a fuller flower. You can also take out petals from a flower you don't like., Thread your needle and tie a knot at the bottom of the thread. Push the needle through the center of all of the petals, starting from the bottom flower. There should already be a hole in the center of each petal; use this hole as your guide.
 Some beads have a very small opening, so you may need to switch out your sewing needle for a beading needle. Once you have the bead on the thread, switch back to a regular sewing needle. Beading needles are too delicate to go through all of those petals.Try using a pearl bead, or a faceted crystal bead.
 Once you have your bead on the thread, hold it against the petal. Then, push the needle back through the petals again and tie a knot at the bottom.
 This will make the flower more sturdier. The felt circle should be big enough to give the flower support, but small enough so that you won't see it when you look down at the flower.


Try to choose a color of felt that closely matches the color of your flower.
 If you saved any of the leaves, glue those down onto the clip first. Then, glue the flower down.

 Especially if you're playing this game with friends, be sensitive to the fact that some people are self-conscious about their crushes. Don't force or peer pressure anyone to play, and if you get the feeling that someone might be uncomfortable, let that person know that you can stop at any time. The results of this game are random and just for fun.;
, This simple game only really requires a pen or pencil and a piece of paper. However, you may have even more fun when played with friends. Sharing your potential flame with a close friend can help you bond while you investigate your feelings for a certain someone.
 On your sheet of paper, write your first name and that of the person you are interested in. You should use your proper name instead of a nickname. You will be looking the letters shared between your names to measure just what sort of relationship you and this other person might have.
 You should do the same for all repeated letters as well. For example, since the names Samantha and Alexander both have the letter A, you should cross out all A's in both of names. Do this with all letters until there are no matching letters remaining.

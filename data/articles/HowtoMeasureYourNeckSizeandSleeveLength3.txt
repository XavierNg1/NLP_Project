 Men's shirt sizes come in a two-part number. The first number listed on the tag of the shirt is the neck measurement, and the second one is the sleeve measurement. For example, a shirt may be sized as 16/34. Use both your neck and sleeve measurements to find the right size.
 If the shirts you are browsing don't offer an exact measurement but rather the traditional "small," "medium," or "large," options, you can use your measurements to find the equivalent in this style of sizing. Use the table below to determine the best size of shirt for you.

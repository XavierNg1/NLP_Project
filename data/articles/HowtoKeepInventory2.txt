  Inventory control comprises the methods you use to maintain your optimum level of stock.  You can use whatever combination of methods that makes sense for your business.  The first step in inventory control is prioritizing inventory to determine the most important items to manage.
  This is a method of controlling stock levels by categorizing inventory into three categories.  It is also known as “stock control according to value,” “selective value approach” or “proportional parts value approach.”  The purpose is to set priorities for attention to management of these materials.  Using this method helps companies to reduce storage expenses and to preserve expensive materials.Group A consists of expensive items.  These items typically represent 10 to 20 percent of total inventory but 50 percent of the value of inventory.  You would invest the bulk of your efforts in controlling these items.

 Group B represents 20 to 30 percent of total inventory and approximately 30 percent of the value of your inventory.  These items require moderate inventory control measures.

 Group C represents 70 to 80 percent of total inventory but only about 20 percent of the value.  Routine procedures can be used to control this category.
  A continuous system means that you are ordering a fixed amount each time you order.  You order this fixed amount each time inventory reaches a predetermined level.  You would use this method with the items you categorized in your “A” category.  These are the expensive items that you want to track carefully.  You don’t want to spend a lot of money in carrying costs, but you don’t want to run out of them, so you continuously monitor how much you have.,  This mathematical formula is used to determine the optimum level of stock.  It is a continuous method of inventory control.  You use it to determine the fixed quantity you should order each time you place an order for these items in your inventory.  You would use it with your “A” category of inventory items.The formula for EOQ is Q=2AS/I{\displaystyle Q={\sqrt {2AS/I}}}.

 In the formula, Q = the quantity per order, A = the annual amount needed of the item, S = the cost per order and I = the inventory carrying cost per unit per year in dollars.

 For example, suppose you sold basketballs.  The cost per order is $400, the carrying cost is $10 per unit per year and you have a demand of $20,000 basketballs per year.

 Q=2∗20,000∗400/10=1,265{\displaystyle Q={\sqrt {2*20,000*400/10}}=1,265}

 The optimum average order should be 1,265 basketballs.  If the annual demand is 20,000, then you will have to place 16 orders in a year (20,000/1,265=15.8{\displaystyle 20,000/1,265=15.8}).
  This means you reorder items after a fixed time period.  An order is placed for a variable amount after a fixed amount of time has passed.  For example, once per month you place an order for an item, and the amount varies depending on how much the item was used in the previous month.  This method works well for the items in your “B” and “C” categories.  You don’t have to keep control so strictly how much you have on hand, and you can accept the risk of over-ordering by ordering in bulk.

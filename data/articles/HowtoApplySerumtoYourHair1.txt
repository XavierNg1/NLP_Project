 Check the labels and compare the hair serums to find one that fits your hair needs. There are different types of hair serum you can use depending on your hair type and preference. If you have thin hair, you may want to try a thickening serum. Or if you have fine hair, there are also lightweight serums for people whose hair does not require as much moisture. If you style your hair often, there are hair serums that also protect against damage due to heat. There are also specifically designed serums to enhance the curls in curly and wavy hair, those that add high gloss, and on the other side, there are hair serums used to create a more natural looking hairstyles.You can find a range of hair serums at any department store or pharmacy.;
, This is an optional step. Some people find that adding serum to the ends of their hair before they wash helps to fight the frizzing and drying caused by the chemicals in shampoos. To protect your hair while you wash, use more serum in your hair than normal. Apply 3-4 squirts of serum to the midsection and especially the ends of your hair.








Wash and rinse your hair as normal, making sure to wash all of the soap out of your hair.
 Another way to use serum requires that you apply the serum to soaking wet hair. When you shower, it is a good idea to use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that are good for dry hair. Or if you have wavy or curly hair, you can buy anti-frizz shampoo and conditioner or shampoo and conditioner for curly/wavy hair hair.









Consider doing a “no-poo” routine for cleansing wavy and curly hair. If you are trying to create more natural waves, there are shampoos without cleaning agents that rough up the cuticle and create frizz.
If you are planning on only applying the serum to your styled hair, you can skip this step.

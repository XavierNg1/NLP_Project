 If you have a plane, switch it to a sphere. It doesn't matter which material you use, you can always change it. However, while creating your cube, sometimes, switching from a reflective to non-reflective and back, can help you fine tine your cube.;
, Start pushing down on the top.
 Like clay, if you try to hurry things up, it will mess it up.
 It is easy to think you are doing great because it looks 'cubish' and then when it gets turned, there is a big old round spot on the back!

, Also, resize your brush as needed. If something starts to get a lip on it, use a smaller brush to get rid of it. Keep rotating it.
 Try changing colors to see if the different reflections will help you out.

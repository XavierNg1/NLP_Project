 You will be taken to the dashboard of the Pinterest website.


If you have the application downloaded and cannot remember your username and password, there is a reset system that will help you retrieve your password; all you need is you e-mail address.
 This will bring up a menu with the first one reading “Account Settings.”


Typically, the menu button on any smart phone is the button with 2 lines on it.
 A new list will come up. This will allow you to change multiple things about your profile.
 You can now start editing the information in your profile:


Change your name and username. If you are not happy with either, you can change them to anything you like. Just click on the box with the name on it; for example, clicking on the one titled “Username” will let you change your Username.
Customize your country and language. It is as simple as changing your username. Click on the title you want to change and type in your preference.
Change the password on your Pinterest. This is optional; just keep in mind that this requires you to enter in your old password first for security reasons.
Edit the networks you are connected to. You have the options of being connected with Facebook, Google, and Twitter. All you have to do is click on what you want to sign in as and enter your username and password for that site.
Adjust your push notifications. This determines if you want to get a text whenever there is any activity to your account, such as messages. All you must do is click on what notification you want to receive. To deselect, you just click again.
Deactivate your account. This option is, of course, if you want to deactivate your account.
All you have to do is click it and double confirm your decision, and it will delete your account.

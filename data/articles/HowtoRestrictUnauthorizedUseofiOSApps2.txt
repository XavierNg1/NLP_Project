 Tap “Settings” on your iPhone or iPad home screen to launch the Settings menu.
 Tap the “Enable Restrictions” button to enable restrictions on your device.
 To protect the restrictions you’ll be setting, you have to lock them via a passcode. A “Set Passcode” screen will appear. Enter a four-digit passcode by tapping on the number pad. Re-enter it to confirm. This same passcode will be needed to make future changes to your restrictions. Make this something difficult for others to guess.
 If you want to prevent others from installing apps on your iPhone or iPad, tap the toggle button for “Installing Apps” to disable it. Nobody can install apps anymore without your passcode. This way, you can keep your device free of junk or unnecessary apps that consume a lot of space. You can also prevent unnecessary purchases of apps for download, especially when you have your credit card info stored with your Apple account.
 If you want to prevent others from deleting apps on your iPhone or iPad, tap the toggle button for “Deleting Apps” to disable it. Nobody can delete or remove apps anymore without your passcode. You won’t want your apps and the data you keep in them to be removed by mistake.

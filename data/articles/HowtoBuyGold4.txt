 Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) aim to track silver and gold prices and are generally bought through a stockbroker. They are much like derivative contracts that track prices, but they differ in that you will not own the underlying metal assets.


Two examples of ETFs are Market Vectors Gold Miners and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners.

The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF attempts to replicate (before expenses and fees) the yield performance and price of the New York Stock Exchange Arca Gold Miners Index. The portfolio contains gold mining companies of all sizes from around the world.
The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF debuted in 2009. This ETF has become quite popular among investors seeking to have indirect access to gold assets. Although similar to the Gold Miners, the Junior Gold Miners focuses on smaller companies involved in an ongoing search for new sources of gold. Because these companies are less established, there is more risk involved.



Term of Investment: Short term. There is a fee assessed each year that deducts from the amount of gold backing your investment, making this an expensive way to invest.

Nature of Investment: Medium risk. Because a typical ETF investment can be short- term if you prefer, risk can be minimized.
 Use the same broker you would use to buy stock, a mutual fund, or shares in a gold ETF, such as GLD and IAU on the New York Stock Exchange. A gold exchange-traded fund is designed to track the price of gold while maintaining the liquidity of a stock.


Note that gold exchange-traded funds do not give you the ability to physically control the gold. Therefore, some gold advocates believe this is an inferior way to own the commodity. Another disadvantage is that ETFs trade like stocks, and you may have to pay a commission to buy and sell on the exchange. Moreover, any capital gains you realize must be reported for tax purposes.

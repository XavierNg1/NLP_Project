Take note of hot flashes. One of the most common menopause symptoms, hot flashes can cause women to sweat uncontrollably or feel uncomfortably warm indoors and outside.
Track irregular periods. Most women are not considered menopausal until their periods stop, but there might be some spotting or irregular bleeding.
Look for vaginal dryness, as well as changes in sexual desire and sleeping patterns. Night sweats and insomnia are often common.
Pay attention to mood swings and irritability. Depression and anxiety that you do not normally feel could be due to menopause.
 Your doctor might recommend hormone replacement therapy, as well as alternative remedies such as yoga.


Discuss how herbs and herbal supplements might help you. Be sure to mention any medications you are taking so your doctor can warn you about potential reactions and side affects.

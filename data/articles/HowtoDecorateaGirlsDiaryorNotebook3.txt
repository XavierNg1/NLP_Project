 This is one of the easiest ways to decorate your cover. Buy some stickers or gems with adhesive backs and place them wherever you like. For an extra layer of protection over flat stickers, brush on a layer of decoupage adhesive (like Mod Podge).
 Washi tape is a type of decorative tape that comes in a variety of colors and patterns. Cover your entire notebook with strips of washi tape, fold the edges of the tape inside the cover, and create a tidy border by cutting off the excess with a precision knife.Alternatively, just add a few strips as accents wherever you’d like.
 You can use whatever you’d like: decorative “found object” embellishments, buttons, small stones, or anything else you can imagine.If you don’t have a glue gun, you can affix the objects with a strong craft adhesive like E-6000.Whatever type of adhesive you decide to use, take care to work in a well-ventilated area and read the directions and safety warnings carefully.

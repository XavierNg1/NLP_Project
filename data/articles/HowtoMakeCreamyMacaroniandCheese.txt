 You'll want to prepare all of your ingredients before you start cooking, so everything is ready to go!;
, Start by shredding your cheddar cheese if it isn't already. Also cube your Velveeta so it melts down better.
 If you're going to add the bacon, then you'll want to precook it. Go ahead and take around 6 or 7 strips of bacon and cook it till its crispy enough to crumble. After its done cooking, set the strips on paper towels to soak up grease.
 Start boiling the water for the macaroni, when its at a rolling boil add the elbows and a tbsp of olive oil so the macaroni doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot. You'll want to cook everything else while your macaroni is boiling. It should be tender or al dente after 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the macaroni.
 To make a roux, you'll need the Butter, flour, and milk. Melt down the butter in a medium sized saucepan, and whisk in the flour. After the flour is absorbed there will be a paste looking mixture. Now its time to add the milk. SLOWLY- whisk in the milk and add the Velveeta. Cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes until thick. It will be VERY thick.
 Make sure you stir in the cheese evenly.
 Take the bacon strips after they've cooled down and crumble them with your fingers into the mac-n-cheese.
 This is an awesome recipe and kids love it!

 Not all levels have Grumpy Cropsies in them. If you happen to be on one, continue with the next steps. Grumpy Cropsies look just like the regular cropsies, but they are angry and dirty.
 There are several options you can explore, depending on your level and available boosters, to remove or avoid these Grumpy Cropsies:


Using the Shovel booster—Tap or click the Shovel booster from the top right corner. The button has a shovel icon on it. This booster can remove any single cropsie on your board. Point the shovel to the Grumpy Cropsie you want to remove, and tap or click on it. It will be removed from your board.
Using the Clean-Up booster—Tap or click the Clean-Up booster from the top right corner. The button has a two-faced apple on it. This booster will turn all Grumpy Cropsies into regular ones. Watch all the Grumpy Cropsies on your board be turned into regular cropsies.
Moving the Grumpy Cropsies to the grass—There will be levels where you can see patches of grass. If you happen to be on one, you can use these to turn a Grumpy Cropsie into a regular one. If you can, swap and move the Grumpy Cropsie on the grass. Once it settles there, it will be turned into a regular cropsie. You can now use it to match with other regular cropsies.

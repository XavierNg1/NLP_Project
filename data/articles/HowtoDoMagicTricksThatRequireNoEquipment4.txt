 This is a difficult trick to pull off, since the audience needs to be looking from exactly the right angle. Find a friend who's willing to take a look while you practice, and help you figure out the best way to position yourself while you try the steps below.
 Pick a pair of pants that has pant legs that hang down partly over your foot or shoe. The best pants will hide your heels, but keep the toes and center of your feet visible., Tell the audience you need space to concentrate, and to avoid falling on them when the levitation magic ends. The audience should be about 8–10 feet (2.5–3 meters) away.Make a big deal of "finding the right spot" to convince your audience that this is difficult.
 This is where a friend will come in handy, since you might have to experiment with this at different angles to find out where the illusion looks most convincing. Usually, the magician stands about 45º away from the audience, so the audience can see the back of your heels and your entire left foot, but cannot see the tip of your right foot.You can also think of this as standing on a clock face. Your toes are pointed at 10:30 or 11:00, and the audience is standing at 6:00., Make a big show of how difficult levitation is, and raise your arms into the air slowly as though your were pulling yourself up. Push up on the toe of your right foot only, where the audience can't see your foot. Raise your right heel, and your entire left foot, trying to keep them even with each other. Keep your left foot parallel with the ground. "Hover" for just a few seconds in this position.
 After a few seconds, drop back down to the ground. Bend your knees and ankles as you hit the ground, to make it seem like you fell from a taller height than you actually did.

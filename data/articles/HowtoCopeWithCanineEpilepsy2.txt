 Reassurance is important after a seizure; your dog is likely to be scared, confused, and disoriented, so soothe the pet by stroking it and speaking to it with a calm voice and a low tone. Keep your dog relatively static until it has regained its bearings and is acting normally. If the dog begins walking or running too soon after a seizure, it could fall and injure itself, run into the walls, or fall down a flight of stairs.Dogs will be unable to control their bowels or bladder during a seizure, so you may want to have towels or plastic bags on hand to clean up urine or feces.
If your dog overheated during the seizure, rub it down with a damp towel or bring a small fan to blow air gently over the dog.
 Living with and caring for an epileptic dog can be intensely draining and stressful for the owner. To reduce this stress and to help yourself mentally and psychologically cope with caring for your dog, first try taking a series of five deep breaths. Hold each breath for a few seconds and then fully exhale—the repetition of this breathing practice will decrease stress and help you calm down.It’s also important to be physically active to help reduce stress. Taking a long walk or practicing yoga—even for as little as 15–20 minutes—can help your mind decompress, and reduce stress and worry.
 Having a healthy network of close family and friends that you can talk with will allow you to cope with the stress that results from your dog’s epilepsy. Don’t hesitate to explain your canine-related worries and anxieties, and talk through whatever aspects of your dog’s condition cause you the most concern. Talking through problems will help you feel better, and friends may present solutions to problems that have concerned you.Additionally, use time spent with these family members and friends to get some time away from your epileptic dog; this will allow you to focus on other aspects of your life. Do fun activities with friends: see a comedy show, go to a movie, or take a hike.

 Don't be tempted to buy seed that is past the expire date because seed deteriorates after that time. If you do get seed post the expiry date, make sure it's a bargain and don't be disappointed if it refuses to germinate or produces poor plants.;
, Having too much seed and nowhere to plant it will mean that the unused seed will go to waste. For the most part, it'll expire before you get the chance to use it for the next year's season.
 If they cannot stock such seeds for you, go online. There are many mail-order companies willing to send these to you. Check the terms and conditions though, to make sure you can return rotten or expired seeds if received that way.


Most garden centres and nurseries only stock the most popular seed varieties; you will find a lot more variety available online.
If purchasing seed online from a country outside of your own, check the quarantine laws. You don't want to spend a whole lot of money just to have your shipment rejected at the border because the seed is not permitted into your country.
 That way you won't forget to make sure to get the seeds into the ground before that time.


Some seeds are less durable than others. For example, carrot seeds have a very short shelf life and need to be resown each year. On the other hand, pea and pumpkin seeds might be happy to wait another year, depending on how they're stored.
 After purchase, if you don't intend using the seeds immediately, they'll need to be stored until you're ready. Place them in a cool, dry part of the house (the pantry is often good). Do not open the packets until you are about to plant them.

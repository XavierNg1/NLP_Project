 Look in department stores for cheap ones, or a thrift store.;
, to form points. Sew it or use some fabric glue (fabric glue takes a while to dry) into the points that Dawn has on her fabric.
 Once again, you might be able to find scarves at a department store, but if you can't find them buy some red fabric, cut it into a shape of a scarf, and use that.
 If you can't find pink or the right kind of pink, buy a white skirt and some pink dye and dye it.
 For the boots, you'll probably have to really search a lot or improvise. If you want the boots to be a bright pink, rain boots are the way to go! They're pretty, shiny, and waterproof!

, You should be able to find a plain white baggie at a thrift store. As for the pink Pokémon symbol, you can try finding a Pokéball stencil, placing it in the center of the baggie, and coloring it in with pink permanent marker or fabric paint. You could also just paint or draw it by hand.
 Dawn wears yellow barrettes, so these are probably pretty easy to find. If you can't find any, you can use yellow hair chalk to resemble them.
 It might be possible to purchase these online. If not, a red watch will do or buy a red sports watch. You could also make your own Poketch, but chances are that it might break.

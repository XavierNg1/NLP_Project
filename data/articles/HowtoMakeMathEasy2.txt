 You may be inclined to say things like, "Well, I wasn't very good at math, either." However, it's better to encourage them to step up to the plate, so to speak. You could say, "Math may seem hard now, but if you work at it, you're going to get so much better!", Some teachers don't do a great job of showing kids how math is useful. Just like with younger kids, you can talk about how you're using math in you're everyday life, then challenge them to solve the problem in your place. For instance, if you're at the grocery store, have them figure out which is the better deal on a bottle of ketchup., Like younger kids, playing board games with older kids can help develop math skills in a low-stress environment. For older kids, try games like Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, Sheriff of Nottingham, or even Ticket to Ride., Plenty of apps and even video games help develop math skills with older kids. You can try apps like Mathmeter, Wuzzit Trouble, or King of Math, available on most phones and tablets.Online video games, particularly ones that have currency and require puzzle-solving skills, can help older kids work on skills, too., Once kids get down the basics, you can start working on concepts instead. That way, kids need to actually put some thought into how to solve it. As they get older, you can increase the difficulty.For example, you could ask how long it will take you to get home, if you're traveling at a certain speed and going a certain distance.
You could also ask questions, such as "How long will it take to add water to this pool?"

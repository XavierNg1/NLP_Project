 In order to solve any physics problem you must know which equation to use. Writing down all of the known information is the first step to finding the right equation. If you are given the final velocity, time, and distance, you can use the following equation:


Initial velocity: Vi = 2(d/t) - Vf

Understand what each symbol stands for.


Vi stands for “initial velocity”

Vf stands for “final velocity”

t stands for “time”

d stands for “distance”



, Once you have written the known information and determined the proper equation, you can fill in values for the appropriate variables. Carefully setting up each problem and writing out every step of the process is important.


If you make a mistake, you can easily find it by looking back at all of your previous steps.
 With all of the numbers in place, use the proper order of operations to finish the problem. If you’re allowed, use a calculator to limit the number of simple math mistakes.


For example: An object with a final velocity of 3 meters (9.8 ft) traveled south for 15 seconds and covered a distance of 45 meters (147.6 ft). Calculate the object's initial velocity.

Write the known information:

Vi = ?, Vf = 3 m/s, t = 15 s, d = 45 m


Divide distance by time. (d/t) = (45/15) = 3
Multiply that value by 2. 2 (d/t) = 2 (45/15) = 6
Subtract final velocity from the product. 2(d/t) - Vf = 6 - 3 = 3 Vi = 3 m/s south
Write your answer correctly. Include a unit of measurement, usually meters per second or m/s, as well as a direction the object was traveling in. Without providing information about the direction, you only have a measurement of speed rather than velocity.

 Instead, write "Apt. 6," "Room 52," or "Box 230."
If you don't know what the number stands for, you may use the number sign, but make sure you leave a clear space between the symbol and the actual number. Instead of #6, write # 6.Capital letters are preferred, but your letter will still be delivered if you write in upper and lowercase letters. Just make sure it is legible and no one line is longer than 40 characters, or the scanner will not be able to read the address.

 Stand up straight, keep your shoulders back and hold your head up.;
,


Be kind and do nice things for others-when people compliment you and thank you, you'll feel better about yourself.
Let your feelings out by writing in a diary.
Let the past be the past. Forgive yourself! Everyone makes mistakes, and you deserve a fresh beginning. Learn to forgive others, and learn to forgive yourself. Say out loud, 'I forgive myself for _________." It'll make you feel better and help keep it out of your mind.
Put positive statements where you will see them everyday: "I am beautiful" or "I have a lot of courage" on your mirror or your refrigerator.
Don't define yourself by what you have or haven't done. Celebrate accomplishments, certainly, but don't put yourself done because you haven't done this or that.
Be who you really are, and trust yourself!
Give yourself hugs. Sounds cheesy, but it works.
Do what you love and indulge yourself.
Know how to say no to people.
Treat yourself like your very best friend. Don't compare to others, and accept yourself the way you are.
 But only a little. You'll want to use casual makeup such as bronzer, blush, eyeshadow, and mascara.
 Nobody wants a girl who is all up in their face. However, never be too much of a pushover.
 If you are super mature, wear a bold red ruffle skirt, and a black tank top tucked in to your skirt. You can use any colour, depending on how mature you are.
 Have mature friends, that respect you, and think that all of them, and you, are mature.
 Maturity is part of growing up. Embrace it!

Flip through fashion magazines and pick out pictures of outfits you love.
Cut a few pictures out and use them as "cheat sheets" to guide you when you go shopping.
 If you do not already have a few basic pieces in your wardrobe, add them.


Own at least one pair of well-fit blue jeans in a classic style, such as boot-cut.
Purchase one nice pair of soft material dress slacks with an interior lining.
Consider a simple, flattering skirt in a neutral color. A knee-length A-line skirt flatters most body types and can often be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.
Buy a few tank tops or camisoles that you can wear beneath jackets and low-cut blouses.
You should definitely own one fitted white button-down shirt.
Consider purchasing a blazer or jacket that you can wear over a variety of blouses.
 The idea is to improve your wardrobe, not keep it the same.


Look for daring patterns and colors that intrigue you, even if you would not usually consider them.
Pick one current trend you find appealing and shop for a piece that falls in line with it.



Accentuate your upper body by selecting shirts with patterns, bold colors, and interesting necklines if you have a pear shape body.
Conceal your midsection with empire waist tops and full skirts if you have an apple shape.
Create lower curves by wearing full bottoms with visual interest if you have an inverted triangle shape. Think jeans with flares and skirts with bold colors, patterns, and ruffles.
Add dimension to your shape with print, texture, color, layers, and other details if you have a rectangle shape.
Accentuate your waist using voluminous skirts, nipped waist tops, and draping fabrics if you have an hourglass shaped body.
 Avoid settling for another bland piece you can only feel neutral about. If you do not absolutely love a piece you try on, save your money until you find something you do love.

 The standing thigh stretch is a great way to open up your quads and front side of your lower body. However, not everyone has the same amount of flexibility, and if you’re new to the stretch or coming back from an injury, you can modify the stretch by using accessories to help deepen the sensation.Try wrapping a yoga strap or towel around the top of your foot, by your toes. Bend your knee and come into the pose.
Grip both ends of the strap with the hand that corresponds with the foot you’re bending.
 For people with lower back pain, doing the thigh stretch while standing may cause aggravation and elevate the pain they’re already feeling. If you have lower back pain, try doing the thigh stretch while lying down on your side.If you’re lying on your right side, bend your left knee and kick it back to touch the left heel to the left butt cheek.
Grab your left ankle with your left hand and hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
Make sure to switch and do the right side as well.
 If you’re very flexible or have lots of experience doing the standing thigh stretch, try taking the stretch one step further. Deepen the stretch by grabbing your ankle with the opposite hand.If you’re stretching your right side, use your left hand to reach behind your body and grab onto your right ankle.
If you can’t reach your ankle, you can also make a grab for your right foot.

 Most trays hold 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of liquid in each compartment, but you should verify this first by measuring out tablespoons (milliliters) of water into the tray's compartments. Knowing how much the tray can hold will allow you to plan out how much lemon juice you can preserve.
 Use a small ladle or small pitcher to make the process easiest. For the sake of consistency, try pouring equal amounts of juice into each compartment in the ice cube tray.
 Place the ice cube tray or trays into the freezer for an hour or two, until the juice has completely frozen. Frozen juice is of a softer texture than frozen water, so the cubes will not be as hard as standard ice.
 Remove the cubes of lemon juice from the ice cube tray and transfer them into a resealable plastic freezer bag.
 Seal the bags and store them in the freezer. Lemon juice can be preserved this way for several months.

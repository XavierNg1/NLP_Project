 These trees are native to North America. They can grow very large and they are usually quite straight. Their flowers are smaller and white.The flowers will appear in long narrow clusters after the leaves come out in the spring.
If you see orange colored fuzz along the midrib of various leaves, it’s probably a black cherry tree. Otherwise, it’s likely a chokecherry., These trees are used to produce the cherries sold commercially. Sometimes these trees are called sweet cherry or sour cherry trees. They have small, white flowers with 5 petals that bloom before the leaves grow completely in the early spring.Sweet cherry trees have more leaves than sour cherry trees. Sweet cherry trees have leaves with more than 8 pairs of veins for each leaf. Sour cherry tree leaves have fewer than 8 pairs of veins per leaf.

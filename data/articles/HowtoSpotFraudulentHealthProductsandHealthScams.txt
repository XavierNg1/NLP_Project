 If the product claims to cure cancer or arthritis (cures which medical science has not yet endorsed), the product is most likely a scam.;
, If a company is not willing to discuss their ingredients or if a product is advertised to use an ancient formula or special, "top secret" ingredients, the product is most likely a scam.
 Watch for words or phrases that typically encourage sales. Some fraudulent health products will use words such as "amazing" or "incredible" in their ads to encourage you to buy the product.
 Be aware that health scammers and fraudulent producers have been known to publish fake testimonials to burnish their image and boost sales.


Look to see if the reviews and testimonials are all positive or have consistently high ratings. If there are no negative or even neutral reviews, the product may be a scam.
Look at the time and date stamp of every testimonial and review for the health product. If the positive reviews were all published within 48 hours of each other, it's possible the manufacturer hired people to submit fake reviews to meet a certain deadline.
 Legitimate producers will offer a free trial period and a full refund if you are not satisfied with results.

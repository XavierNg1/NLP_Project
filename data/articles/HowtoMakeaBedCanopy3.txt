 You'll need 1 or 3 adjustable-angle metal flag brackets (the stronger the better), a dowel rod to fit the flag bracket, and long fabric.
 You can have one at the center for a really regal look, or you can use three to get more of an expedition tent look. Mount the first at the center of the bed and the other two (if you want them) directly above the sides of the bed. These must be installed in your wall studs or they will not be strong enough., Put the dowel rods into the pole holder. You should be able to put it all the way in (it should not be too tight). If it is loose, you can make a better fit using wood shims or cardboard pieces.
 Center the fabric on the center pole and drape the ends over the sides of the bed or the hole poles, depending on the style you went with.

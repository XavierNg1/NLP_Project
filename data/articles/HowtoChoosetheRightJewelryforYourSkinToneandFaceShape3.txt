 You can choose jewelry that enhances or offsets your body type, depending on your goal. You can draw attention to, or away from, certain body parts, or balance proportions using strategically placed pieces. To draw attention to body parts you are proud of, wear jewelry with bold colors on or near those body parts.
If you are a larger person, wear larger jewelry. Petite people should buy smaller, daintier pieces. Scale your jewelry to your bodyâ€™s size.
 Some people are proud of their eyes. The eyes are the doorways to our soul, right? Maybe. They are certainly one of the first places people look when they talk to us. It makes sense that you might want to match your adornments to your eye color. Blue eyes look best with blue gemstones like blue topaz and sapphire. If you want to contrast the blue of your eyes, wear gemstones that are pink sapphire or spinel.
Brown eyes match best with red gemstones like garnet and ruby. To contrast brown eyes wear deep blue gemstones like blue sapphire.
Hazel eyes go well with green gemstones like emerald and peridot.
Green eyes also look great with green gemstones like jade and emerald.
 Some people prefer to match their jewelry to something less tangible- their personality. Most people end up doing this naturally, why not get ahead of the curve and do it on purpose? Outgoing, bold people tend to wear large pieces like big, bold rings or many bracelets on one wrist.
Reserved people are more likely to be wearing one small gemstone, or a pair of earrings, maybe with a ring to match it. Usually a favorite piece.
Eccentric people tend to go after vintage pieces. Something that is one of a kind, not worn by anyone else.

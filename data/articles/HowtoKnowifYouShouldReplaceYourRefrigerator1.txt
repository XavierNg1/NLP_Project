 As a rule of thumb, if repair costs are 50% or more of the cost of a new fridge, you should buy a new fridge. There are two main reasons to do so. First, as refrigerators age, they will need more and more repairs. Second, replacing an older refrigerator gives you the opportunity to get a more efficient model that will reduce your energy costs., Different types of fridges are more prone to needing repairs and have varied overall lifespans. For instance, built-in refrigerators are generally worth repairing. In general, however, any fridge that is only a year or two old is worth repairing., Side-by-side fridge and freezer appliances are usually worth repairing for the first five years of their life, and fridges with a bottom freezers are usually worth repairing for seven years or so. Fridges with freezers on top can usually be repaired within the first three years of their life, but may need to be replaced in seven years or less., Refrigerators are expected to last between 10 and 20 years. If yours is at least 10 years old and has begun to have issues, itâ€™s simply time for a replacement. Not only will repairs on older models be more expensive, the fridge will likely need additional repairs sooner than later, and a newer model will be more energy efficient., If you find that you are not using all of the space in your present refrigerator, consider replacing it with a smaller model. For instance, if your children have grown up and moved out, you may find that a full size fridge is no longer necessary for your household.

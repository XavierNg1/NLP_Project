 Consider your thoughts on every political, cultural, religious, and scientific topic that you find interesting. Even if your only interest is something simple like video games or movies, explore that interest in your mind. By talking about information and opinions rather than emotions and relationships, you will be able to keep your cool and avoid painful topics, without alienating the girl as a friend.


Because you are already enthusiastic about these topics, you will find it easy to talk about them when you have a captive audience – in fact, you may find it difficult to stop talking once you start.
 Obviously, a shared activity can be interpreted as a date by either party, so it is important to avoid planning things like going out for dinner together. Instead, have pastimes in mind for those times when you find yourself alone with the girl you like in your house, or hers, or in a car with nothing to do. Carry a deck of cards, or even suggest taking some time to help each other study. Just keep it pedestrian.


The important thing is to avoid situations where mixed signals can enter the equation, such as cuddling together on a couch or stargazing on a country road. Remember, you want to get over her, not make things worse. Always have a backup plan to avoid this kind of “romantic” downtime.
 Meditation has several benefits, not the least of which is improved clarity of mind. Even a person who is experiencing a tumult of emotion on the inside can stay calm for long enough to have an evening out with a friend if he or she learns to focus ahead of time. At its most basic, meditation is as simple as breathing deeply and being still in a quiet place while focusing on yourself. Tell yourself that you will stay in control and remain focused on getting over your attraction, and carry that focus with you when you go to see her.

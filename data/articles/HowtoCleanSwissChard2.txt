 Some people wash the Swiss chard before storing it in the refrigerator. However, it might be best to clean Swiss chard right before you plan to cook it. This keeps any excess moisture from accumulating on the leaves, which can lead to wilting and mold., Swiss chard can be stored in your refrigerator for five to seven days after washing. Store it in a plastic bag in the vegetable bin. To make Swiss chard last longer than seven days, make sure it is completely dry so it will last longer or don't wash it before placing it in the fridge. You also can store it without washing to make it last longer. Chard can last up to two weeks if stored properly.If you wash the chard before placing it in the refrigerator, let it drain in a colander or dry it with a cloth to remove the moisture.
 Prepare the chard after washing so it will be ready to cook later in the week. Cut off any spots you see on the leaves. Fold the leaf in half and cut away the stems. Then store it so it will be ready when you want to cook it.The stems are edible and can be quite tasty. They are tougher than the leaves, so they require a longer cooking time. This is why separating the stems and leaves is important.

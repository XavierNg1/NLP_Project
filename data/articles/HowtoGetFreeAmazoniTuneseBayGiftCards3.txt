 This program allows members to earn points by writing articles about topics of their choice, uploading pictures or videos, and by commenting on other member articles.


Topics for articles, pictures, and videos are decided upon entirely by the author. There are numerous groups that members may join to discuss topics with members who have similar interests.
 The more people that read your articles, the more points you will earn. Write quality articles to help you stand out and draw readers to your work.


Be aware that you will have to put a significant amount of time in writing articles before you see good rewards. You may be better off writing for profit on another website so that you can earn actual money for your work.
 Once the designated number of points have been earned, you can redeem their points for free gift cards from a number of businesses, including Amazon.


Gather also offers a direct payment to PayPal, from which members can then purchase gift cards from iTunes or eBay.

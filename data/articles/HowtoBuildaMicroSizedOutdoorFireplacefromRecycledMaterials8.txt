, The steel wire ends show the angle the damper is pointing, they should be vertical. If you're not sure, look down the chimney to see what's happening inside.
 It might take a little while to catch, depending on the type of fire log you bought.
 This is easiest to place on the edge of the grate and slide it in with the pokers until it touches the first pellet. The second pellet will catch from the first; when you see the first stop flaming and become a little ember, you can push the second pellet further in. The pellets make very little ash, and the glowing remains will slowly burn down and fall through into the bottom of the sardine tin.
 This will take practice to determine when is best to add the next pellet.
 If you see the flame and smoke start to come out the front of the firebox, open the damper some until this stops. The most efficient operation is when the smoke all goes up the chimney, but is restricted enough to slow down and heat the cans, causing them to radiate the heat out. Every fireplace will be different, so you will need to experiment with how to best work the damper.
 There will be a little smoke when this happens, but not as much as normal wood would produce. Let the fire go out completely and allow the fireplace to cool before moving or disassembling the chimney.

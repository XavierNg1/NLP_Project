 If you are suffering from a ruptured disc, you are likely dealing with pain that may increase at night. Going to bed when you’re not tired can make falling asleep difficult, and this can be even more challenging with spine pain. Try to go bed only when you are tired., The light emitted by phones, computers, and other devices can confuse your body into thinking it is still daytime. This can make it harder to fall asleep at night. Try to turn off all devices about half an hour before bedtime., A good night’s sleep is easier if your bedroom is completely dark and the temperature is cool. Try using blackout curtains to block any incoming light from your bedroom windows. Keep the temperature cool, yet comfortable., Both alcohol and caffeine can disrupt your sleep. Try limiting the amount of caffeine you consume, and don’t consume caffeine after 2 or 3 in the afternoon. You should also limit your intake of alcohol in the evening, as it can contribute to fitful sleep.

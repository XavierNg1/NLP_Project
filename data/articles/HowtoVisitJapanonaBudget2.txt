 An international plane ticket is expensive but if you shop around and pick your travel time well, you can spend a lot less. If you buy from a travel agent and come to Japan in April or May, you will pay almost $2,000. If you use the internet to find your ticket and come in early March or the rainy season (June), you can spend as little as $750. Compare prices for tickets to Narita Airport and Kansai Airport––sometimes one is quite a bit cheaper than the other.

Be careful not to twist! Twisted rounds cannot be fixed; if you're not careful, you'll have to start completely over. What you end up with will not resemble a hat.
 Around and around and around you go! Try your hat on at different times to gauge how many more rounds you should make.









The circular needles create a brim that rolls automatically. Because of this, you'll need to knit for a bit longer to account for the lost length.

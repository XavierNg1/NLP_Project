 Viewers, also called peep holes allow you to see who is on the other side of the door. Install wide-angle viewers at eye level on all exterior doors. If you have to open your door to see, your locks won't do you much good. Try to find peep holes with covers to prevent people from looking back in with special tools, like a reverse peephole viewer.

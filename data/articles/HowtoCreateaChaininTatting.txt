Rings can be made only with the shuttle thread wound in a complete circle around the left hand (see illustration).
Chains can be made only with a thread wound halfway around the hand.;
, To achieve a chain from a ring, you need to use the shuttle thread and a ball thread.
, When you make the ring, use the shuttle thread in the regular manner.
 When the ring is completed and you wish to make a chain, turn it so that the base of the ring is held between the thumb and forefinger (see illustration).
 Do this in the same way as for the shuttle thread but instead of making a complete circle, wind it twice around the little finger to control the tension (see illustration).
 Do this in the same manner as in making rings. (Picots and joinings are made in the same way as on rings.) When you have finished the chain, pull the stitches close together and put down the ball thread.

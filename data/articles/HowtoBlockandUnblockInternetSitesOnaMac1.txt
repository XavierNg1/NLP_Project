 There are two different ways to manage your child's access to the internet:


Choosing "Try to limit access to adult websites automatically" will block adult websites using Apple's default list. You may add or remove websites to this list with the Customize button.
"Allow access to only these websites" blocks all sites not specifically listed below this option. Add and remove sites using the + and - buttons.
 To block access to adult content through apps, click the App tab and adjust settings as desired. To limit access to the computer to certain hours, visit the Time Limits tab.
 To unblock all websites, select "Allow unrestricted access to websites." This will not disable parental control settings in other tabs (such as Apps and People).

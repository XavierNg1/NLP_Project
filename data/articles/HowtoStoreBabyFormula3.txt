 Check the expiration dates on any formula containers before purchasing or preparing them for your baby.
 Remember to always shake the ready-to-feed liquid formulas before opening the can, as the ingredients will separate as they settle.
 Follow all of the directions carefully. The proper measurement of water and formula is vital. Too little water can lead to dehydration whereas too much water can cause an insufficient supply of nutrients.
 Use water that has been labeled safe for water consumption by the state or local health department or sterilize it yourself by boiling water for 2 minutes to kill any germs. Always allow water to cool for approximately 45 minutes before adding formula to it.


Keep in mind that bottled water or filtered water does not necessarily indicate that the water is free from bacteria. Filters need to be changed within a required amount of time to avoid possible bacteria growth.
 Shake the bottle vigorously for a few seconds to distribute the temperature evenly. Shake a few drops of the formula from the bottle onto your wrist. If it feels a bit too warm allow more cooling time.
 If you are going to make a batch of formula, make only as much as you will need for the next 24 hours. This can help you cut down on waste and save a little bit of money in the long run.

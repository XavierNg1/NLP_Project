 Sitting your baby upright may help relieve the pressure in her diaphragm. The gas that is distending her stomach will rise to the surface, allowing her to burp and release the pressure.;
, Hiccups are spasms of the diaphragm. Breastfeeding your baby may help her diaphragm relax, stopping hiccup attacks in their tracks. Refer to this method on preventing hiccups while feeding.


Be sure to feed your baby slowly so that she does not suckle too much milk too quickly. Pause to burp her at intervals, and give her plenty of time to digest.
 Burping, especially between feedings, brings trapped air to the surface of your baby's stomach. This can help relieve the gas buildup that could lead to hiccups.
 Sucking on a pacifier can help regulate your baby's breathing and relax the diaphragm.
 Fill a glass of water about halfway full, and pull a tissue tight across the rim to regulate the flow. Gently give your baby a few small sips of water. Be sparing.


Babies do not need to drink water until they are six months old--up til that point, they get all of the hydration that they need from breast milk or formula. Giving a baby younger than six months too much water can interfere with her body's ability to absorb the nutrients in breast milk, as well as curbing her appetite by making her feel full.

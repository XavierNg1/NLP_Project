 If it is available, join it. Make sure you have a partner.;
, You can look at the scripts provided, or check online. You can use a script from a funny skit, sketch, book, movie, anything!

, If you and your partner think you should do it, start cutting it. Cut parts out, re-arrange, and edit the script so that it fits your needs.
 The speech needs to be 7 minutes long. Time yourselves.
 At speech meets, go to the Humorous Duo section and wait for your turn. Once you are ready, go up.
 You are required to write your own introduction.
 Angle towards your partner, but never look at him/her. That is an automatic disqualification. In scene transitions/character changes (you or your partner may be required to perform multiple characters), slide across, switching places (again, not looking at each other).
 Once the round is over, you may leave.

 Sit on the beach.


Listen to everything: the rhythm of the waves, the birds, the people (if they're are any around)
Feel: the wetsuit (if you need one in your climate), the softly abrasive sand between your toes, the sun, wind or rain on your face.
Smell whatever comes into your nose: the sea, the sand, the seaweed, the sunscreen.
Connect with that..your environment! Stretch, try some basic yoga stretches. Don't worry about anyone, just get in tune. Do what feels right to you. Breathe. Deeply. And relax again.;
, In order to connect with that band of energy, that wave, you need to well...open your eyes and watch! It doesn't matter if it's a little whitewash shore break or a small perfect wave, just watch it, get to know it.. Its brothers and sisters will be along soon - and you will be playing with them!

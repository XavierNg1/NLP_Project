 If your basement does not already have a bathroom and kitchen, you'll want to plan on adding them. A bathroom is a necessary requirement, and building codes should be kept in mind regarding aspects like head space over the toilet and GFCI electrical outlets. In a very small unit, you could consider adding a kitchenette rather than a full kitchen. To install a kitchen from scratch, you will need to run new plumbing lines, as well as gas lines for a gas stove and ductwork if you want to install a ducted range hood.
 A basement that was not designed as a separate dwelling may not have a layout that will be attractive to tenants. When planning changes to the layout, consider whether the apartment will be a studio, a 1-bedroom, or a 2-bedroom. Remember that even in a small unit, partitioning off a separate space as a bedroom will usually allow you to command a higher rent.
 The final step is to consider all the aspects that will make the unit more attractive to tenants than other rental properties. Unless you are trying to command a very high rent, finishes do not have to be top-quality, but they should not be worn and damaged. Painting the walls and installing inexpensive carpet are 2 economical methods for quickly freshening a basement space.

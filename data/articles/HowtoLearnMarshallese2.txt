 This book was originally written for the WorldTeach Marshall islands program for use by its volunteers. It can be freely distributed to anyone in any form. It introduces Marshallese to the beginner. It is organized into 102 two-page lessons, each with a main grammar point and a vocabulary section. There are also Marshallese dialogues, general tips, and pronunciation practice in many of the lessons. Each lesson is designed to be a manageable chunk of new material that could be learned in one sitting.
 The Marshallese-English Online Dictionary is the most complete Marshallese dictionary and it is the standard for spelling in Marshallese. Apart from English definitions and word variants, it also includes example sentences that show how words are used in sentences.

It's purpose is not to provide translations of sentences but to show how specific words have been translated in the past by human translators.

 You don’t want the rumor mill or shared friends to spread the news. Avoid telling your friends and family, because they may say something to another person, and in a matter of no time your partner could find out. With the speed of today’s online information, there is a good chance information will break before you have your discussion., Chances are there have been problems for some time. Keeping things going because you don’t want to hurt her feelings may inadvertently cause more attachment, and more pain. When you make up your mind the relationship should end, make the call as soon as feasible. Don’t mess around with further communication., Think about what would make it most convenient, what would ease the pain. Avoid any specific times when your soon-to-be-ex may be busy, at work, or occupied with anything important.


You don’t want to ruin a location she loves. Find out her schedule and try to plan a day and time that won’t lead to tainted memories of a specific place., Depending on her processing style, it may be kind of you to provide time to mourn. The weekend works as a great emotional buffer, two days for crying, calling friends, and getting over the news. If your soon-to-be-ex is not that into you, and is likely to shake off the breakup quickly, then breaking the news on a Monday may work just fine. She’ll likely soak it in during free time.

 Add 3 cups (180 g) of shaving cream, 1 cup (125 g) of flour, and 1 cup (225 ml) of white glue to a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they’re just combined.








Avoid overmixing the paint so the air bubbles stay in the shaving cream and give it a puffy texture.
 When the ingredients are combined, set out several smaller bowls. You’ll need one for each color of paint that you plan to make. Use a spatula to add a little of the paint mixture to each bowl.








It's a good idea to use disposal plastic bowls because the paint can stain your dishes.
 When the paint mixture is divided into the bowls, add the food coloring of your choice to each one. Stir the paint until the color is fully incorporated.








You can also mix tempera paint with the flour mixture to color the puffy paint.
 When you’re happy with the color of the paint, use a spatula to add each shade to a separate squeeze bottle. You can use a brush to apply it, but it’s usually easier to squeeze it out than paint it on.








If you don’t have squeeze bottles, you can put the paint in sealable plastic bags and snip off a corner to squeeze the paint out of. Instead of having to wash the squeeze bottles when you’re done, you can just throw away the bags.
 When you’re ready to use the paint, squeeze it on in a design of your choice. Be sure to use heavy paper, such as poster board, tag board, or cardboard, because the paint is heavy and can soak through thin paper.








Allow your paintings to dry for 24 hours to ensure that the paint is fully set.

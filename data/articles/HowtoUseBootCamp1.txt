NTFS partitions are required for Windows Vista and Windows 7 installations. You will not be able to transfer files to this partition when you are in OS X.
FAT partitions allow you to read and write files to the partition from within OS X. However, they have a maximum size of 32 GB. Windows XP can be installed on either NTFS or FAT partitions.



If the "The disk cannot be partitioned because verification failed" dialog appears, repair your main drive with Disk Utility, reboot, and retry partitioning with Boot Camp Assistant.
If a repair and reboot doesn't work, make sure that you have a backup of all your personal information and files, reboot from your Mac OS X installation disc, and erase the disk using Disk Utility. Restore from your backup and try to repartitionÂ  with Boot Camp Assistant again.

 It’s important to act as quickly as possible with beetroot stains, so try to remove any excess pieces or drops of beetroot from the fabric right away. Lift the pieces off directly with your fingers and blot excess liquid with a dry paper towel or disposable cloth.Try not to spread the stain more as you remove pieces and droplets.;
, Immerse the stain in cold water so that it doesn’t set into the fabric. If possible, start with the edges of the stain and gently massage the fabric under the water as you work your way into the center. Keep running cold water over the stain until the water runs clear.Never use warm or hot water on a new beetroot stain because it might cause it to set into the fabric.
 If you can’t immerse the stain under cold running water, take an old kitchen towel or cloth, soak it in cold water, and then dab at the stain. Try to absorb as much of the red-purple color as you can.Rinse the towel with more cold water in between dabbings, so as not to re-apply the beetroot to the stained fabric.

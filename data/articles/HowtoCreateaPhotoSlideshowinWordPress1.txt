 Open an “Add New Post” page.;
, It’s at the left above the post editor box. A dialogue box will then pop up.
 This is if you haven’t added your photos yet.
 You can do this either by clicking the “Select Files” button, finding the photos on your computer, and uploading them; by clicking “Insert from URL” and entering your image URLs; or by simply clicking and dragging photos from your computer to the box.
 Open the drop-down menu that says “Images,” and select “Uploaded to this post.”

, All the images you’ve uploaded should be selected by default. Click them to deselect, and re-click them to re-select.
 Do so after you’ve selected the images.
 Do this on the next page by clicking the text box beneath each of the images.
 Just click and drag them into your preferred order.

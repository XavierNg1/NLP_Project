, This is a crucial step to getting rid of your tamagotchi. Hungry Tamagotchis aren't happy tamagotchis, and you know what happens to unhappy tamagotchis... Basically, not feeding it will get things to fall apart. Sounds horrible, but if you're desperate, starve it.
 Another crucial step. Just imagine a person in a room full of this sort of waste: if nothing else, they'd die from the fumes eventually.
 Combined with the poop step mentioned above, this is another small detail that will help you kill your tamagotchi.
 If you've just fed your tamagotchi too many snacks or it naturally gets sick, don't give it any medicine. This will most definitely hasten things up - a sick tamagotchi is not a healthy one.
 Playing games with your tamagotchi makes it happy, and that's not going to kill it off. So just leave the tamagotchi alone - don't do anything with it. Simply treat it like a battery chicken and it'll save you some time in the end.
 Again, giving your tamagotchi positive attention will result in making it happy and that won't help you at all. Don't praise your tamagotchi, pet it, or do anything which makes it happy. Leave it by itself, alone.
 Press the button on the back of your tamagotchi toy and save yourself the time of waiting for it to die. After resetting it, a new egg should appear and you can start over just like new.
 It makes them very unhealthy, gives them toothaches, and will definitely shorten their lifespan.

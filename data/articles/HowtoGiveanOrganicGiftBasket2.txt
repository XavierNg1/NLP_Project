 A standard bathing basket includes fragrant soaps, shampoos, lotions, bubble bath, and bath salts. Thankfully, you can find organic versions of each of these products. Finding multiple product types that are all within the same scent family will create the greatest harmony and provide the most use. On the other hand, you can also theme your bath gift basket around one product, like organic soaps, and provide variety by offering the recipient multiple scents or organic brands.
 Aromatherapy is the art of altering oneâ€™s emotional state through the use of scent.


Use organic candles. Organic candles are made from organically produces and harvested wax, such as beeswax or coconut wax. The candles are also scented with organic oils.
Try organic potpourri. Potpourri is an air freshener made from a mixture of dried out flowers and fragrant spices. You can make your own organic potpourri by drying out organic flowers and materials grown in your own garden or you can purchase pre-made bags of organic potpourri. Include several different combinations in the basket.
 This is especially useful if the recipient is highly fashionable, has sensitive skin, or has just recently made the switch to an organic lifestyle. Organic make-up, ranging from mineral blushes to all-natural lipsticks, is cruelty-free and is often less harsh on the skin than standard cosmetics, making a beauty basket filled with organic cosmetics even lovelier than its inorganic counterpart.

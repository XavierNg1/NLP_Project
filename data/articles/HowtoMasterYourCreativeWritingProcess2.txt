 Revising is essential no matter what kind of writer you are. Take the time to reread your work. Try putting your writing aside for a while, so you can come back to it with fresh eyes.
 Check for awkward phrasing by reading it aloud. Sometimes it can be hard to really proofread your work because you are so familiar with the words you have written. Try reading your writing out loud in order to give yourself another perspective and see what your words sound like together.
 If you’re worried about losing something good, just save the original in another file and start rewriting. That way, you can rewrite without worrying about destroying your original copy. You may find that after rewriting, there are certain aspects of both versions that you want to combine.
 If a piece of writing isn’t working, try taking a different approach to it. Write it from a different point of view, such as third person instead of first, or try writing it from a different character’s perspective.
 One unique way to rewrite something is to read through the piece once, and then try to recreate it without looking at the original.


This technique works especially well with poems, as it may help you decide what you really need to keep in the poem.

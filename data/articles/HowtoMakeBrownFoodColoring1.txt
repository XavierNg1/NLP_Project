 Red and green, orange and blue, or yellow and purple can all be combined to make brown.You can use liquid or gel food dye. Gel food dye is usually preferred because you don't need very much to get vivid colors.;
, So for every 1 drop of red, add 1 drop of green.Mix your colors in a glass or stainless steel bowl. The dye can stain plastic bowls.



Mix red and yellow in a 1:10 ratio (1 drop red to 10 drops yellow) for tan.
Add 1 drop blue for a darker brown.
Add red or yellow if the dye looks gray or black.Add orange and green to lighten a red and green mix and make tan.Add 1 drop of black dye for a very dark brown.
 You may think you have the perfect shade of espresso brown and then find the next day that is has deepened to almost black. Mix your dye lighter than you think you want so it has room to develop.If you are dying frosting, consider making it 1-2 days ahead of time so you know the true shade you are working with.If your frosting still isn't dark enough, add a drop of black dye or more of your brown.
If your frosting is too dark, add a little of the white frosting to dilute the color.
 It often takes a lot of brown dye to make a rich color, but you risk ruining your frosting, playdough, etc. by drowning it in liquid.

 At the very least, you need to give your parents some time to see you in a new light. Now that they know you smoke marijuana, they may spend a few days looking at you differently, trying to determine if you're high at the moment. Just keep being your normal, kind self and this will pass when they realize that, in reality, nothing has changed except their knowledge of the situation.


Most parents think marijuana is still a big deal, and dangerous. It will take some time to realize that this isn't the case.
 Since marijuana is rarely habit-forming, this shouldn't be difficult. That said, marijuana is an easy scapegoat if you aren't showing up at work, neglecting to do your homework, or spending all of your money on good bud. Your parents love and care about you, and want to see you succeed. If they believe (whether rightly or wrongly) that marijuana is hurting your future, then you'll face much stiffer resistance in the future.


Even if you parents are okay with smoking, you don't need to flaunt it or do it first thing every day. They will appreciate if you don't always smell like weed.
Show them that you can be productive while high, either by doing chores, cooking, working on a hobby, or exercising. Don't be a couch potato and they have no reason to get mad., If you parents aren't taking the conversation well, resist the urge to go into attack mode. This will only make it more likely for them to escalate as well, leading to unforeseen consequences and high tensions around the dinner table. If they don't seem receptive, remind them that this is not a choice you've made lightly, and you've done your research. By turning things repeatedly back to facts and data you can prevent an unwinnable argument over opinions.

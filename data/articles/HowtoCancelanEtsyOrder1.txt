, On the right side of the order information, under the words “Not Shipped,” you should find a link that says “Request Cancellation.” An auto-generated message to the seller will pop up on your page.
 You can add more information here, such as your reason for cancellation, or any other details that the seller may need to know about the order. You can even re-write the message entirely, if you wish.

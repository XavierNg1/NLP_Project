A fleece that has no plant matter in it: Remove sweaty and fribby (side) pieces. Remove back wool if short, tender, mushy, or earthy. Removed britch wool from the sheep's hind quarters if it is too coarse or hairy.
If the fleece has burrs or seeds in it: Work around the selvedge edge and remove burry parts. Trim as above.

Totally covered in burr/plant material: Remove a minimum amount of fleece (the sweaty, fribby, stained piece, and dags.)

 Your journal should be easy to write in and attractive to you. You can get journal with ruled lines to help you keep your writing neat or one with completely blank pages if you'd rather choose the size of your writing. Some journals are bound so that they open flat, which can make writing easier. Others may have places to keep a pen or pencil or some of your treasured mementos. Small journals are easier to take with you wherever you go. You can purchase a journal with a design you like or customize one with stickers, photos, or artwork.
 Since this is a daily journal, you obviously want to write in it at least once a day. You can also decide on a minimum amount you want to write each day: a sentence, a paragraph, a page, or whatever. Maybe you want your journal to focus on a specific subject, such as your fiction writing or a new sport you're just starting.
 Right when you get home or shortly before bedtime are good times to write in your journal, but you can pick any time when you are able to spend a while writing. If you have a time set aside for writing in your journal, you'll be more likely to stick with it.
 If writing in your journal starts to feel like a chore, you might stop doing it. So keep it enjoyable. Make sure your goals are reasonable. Look at it as a way to unload everything you've been to on bad days and to record good days so you can always remember them.

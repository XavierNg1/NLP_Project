 Administering buspirone in tablet form is most common, since the tablet is considered the safest and most efficiently absorbed method. However, it’s also available in liquid and transdermal gels. If you have trouble giving your cat pills, discuss other dosage forms with the vet., You can administer buspirone in liquid form using a syringe dispenser. Insert the syringe into your cat’s mouth between its cheek and teeth. Pull the plunger to squirt the medication into its mouth, then massage its neck or blow onto its nose to encourage it to swallow the medicine.The syringe-like dispenser doesn’t have an actual needle, so there’s no need to worry about pricking your cat.
A cat is more likely to accidentally inhale liquid medication than a tablet. To prevent accidental inhalation, avoid holding your cat’s head back when administering liquid medication. Take care to squirt between its cheek and teeth instead of in the back of its mouth.
 While a transdermal gel is absorbed less efficiently than a pill, it could be the only safe and feasible method if your cat won’t tolerate other dosage forms.Measure the proper dosage amount by rotating the applicator nozzle. Depending on the vet’s instructions, apply the medication either in your cat’s ear or directly onto its skin.Part your cat’s fur to apply a transdermal gel directly onto the skin.
Always wear gloves when applying the gel.

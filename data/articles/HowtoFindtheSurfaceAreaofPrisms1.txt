 The nice thing about prisms is that the matching end pairs make it easy to determine a lot of the individual measurements without having to solve for anything. Any measurement that is given for one of the end shapes (ex. height of the triangle, radius of the circle) also applies to the matching shape at the other end. Moreover, if you know the length of one side of the prism, you know the length of all the sides. Distribute these numbers as necessary around your prism to see what you have to work with.

 You can separate the sections of paper and notes by tab dividers. This is neater and much more convenient way. The best kind of tab dividers are the plastic ones with folders because you can count on them more.
 Most binders have a paper slip on the spine which you can slide out, write your subject on, and slide back in. Doing this ahead of time will save you time later. If not, then just use a 2 inch binder and just put on the side, ALL CLASSES, it should work.
 Some courses require more note taking than others, but it's a good idea to be prepared nonetheless.
 Some teachers will tell you the specific sections to put in your binders. It is not recommended to name your tabs ahead of time, because it can make the teachers unhappy and you very frustrated. This may be a waste of time if you are in a lower grade. Doing this is only recommended if you are in middle or high school. Though some middle schools are specific so it's best to wait if you are starting in middle school. (Or if you switch classes in Elementary School, which most don't.)

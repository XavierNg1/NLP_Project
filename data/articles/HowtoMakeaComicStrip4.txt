 First sketch the frames. You will need to decide, based on the amount of dialogue in the script, what panel will need to be largest, smallest, etc. Just make sure that you keep within your size constraints.
 Next sketch in where the characters will go. Make sure that there is enough room for speech balloons. Try to place them in a way that the panel will not look too full or too empty.
 Sketch in where the speech bubbles will go. Remember not to cover characters or take up too much of the frame. Keep in mind that sometimes changing the speech bubble's shape can be used to indicate a particular voice. For example, a bubble with a shape like a cartoon sun (with the pointy edges) can make a character "sound" like they're yelling. Take advantage of this.


For good examples of speech bubbling, see online comic Dumbing of Age or print comic Pearls Before Swine.
 After you know where the characters will go, you can sketch in a background or other objects if you want. Some comic strips have very detailed backgrounds, some only include the basic objects that the characters interact with. You can go anywhere in between or beyond.
 Go over your sketch lines with something dark and a little more permanent, so that they look clean and professional. Remember to use line width variation and other artistic tricks. When you're done you can erase the sketch lines.
 With the comic mostly drawn, you can add in text to the speech bubbles. Make sure to use a consistent font and text size. Even if a bubble is smaller, the text should always be the same size. Larger or smaller text indicates, respectively, whispering and shouting. Also make sure to use a legible font.
 If you want to, you can color your strip. Keep in mind that coloring is time consuming, and will significantly change the number of strips you are able to get done in a certain period of time.

 Pour your milk of choice in a small saucepan, then place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. If you are watching your sugar intake, use unsweetened soy, almond, coconut or cashew milk.


Even nonfat dairy milk contains about 12 grams (0.3 ounces) of sugar per 8 ounce (236.5 ml) serving, which is why if you have diabetes or are trying to avoid sugar, it’s best to drink unsweetened soy, almond or coconut milk.;
, While the milk is heating, add in the 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of unsweetened cacao powder along with 1 teaspoon (4.93 ml) of the sweetener of your choice.


Stevia extract and agave nectar are both all-natural sweeteners. Stevia is a calorie-free sweetener extracted from an herb that does not raise your blood sugar. #*Agave nectar is a syrup extracted from the agave plant. It has about 21 calories per teaspoon and does slightly raise your blood sugar, though not nearly as much as regular sugar.Splenda (also called Sucralose), Sweet’N Low (Saccharin) and Equal (Aspartame) are all artificial sugar substitutes. They contain zero calories and do not affect blood pressure. However, they do have a distinct aftertaste which some don’t like.
 Keep heating the hot chocolate, stirring until the cacao powder and sugar substitute have dissolved completely. Continue heating the hot chocolate until the drink is hot enough., Once the cacao and sweetener have dissolved and you are satisfied with the heat of the hot chocolate, remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the hot chocolate into the mug. Serve the hot chocolate alongside your favorite sugar-free treats!

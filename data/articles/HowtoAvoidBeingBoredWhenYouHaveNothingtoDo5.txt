 While most websites update their sites regularly, they can still feel stale when you’ve read them for the last 5 years. Try finding something new by searching online for your interests. Simply switching up your online habits may be enough to kick your boredom.


Ask friends what sites they visit every day.
Use aggregate sites like Reddit and Digg to find new websites under your interests.
Use “suggested videos” on YouTube to find new channels or producers similar to your favorites.
 The internet is full of free online games. Visit trustworthy websites with large collections, such as Kongregate, Armor Games, or MoFunZone.
 Thousands of artists put comics online for free, and many of them have archives going back for years. Use collections like Top Web Comics or The Web Comic List to browse the top-rated webcomics, or search the collection for topics you enjoy.
 YouTube puts together massive playlists for people to browse, from music to sports to miscellaneous recommended videos. Hulu.com and Netflix.com have large collections of full-length movies and television shows, and depending on your region, you might be able to watch some of them for free or sign up for a free trial.
 If you have a lot of time and have no idea where to go, find sites dedicated to lists of ideas and entertainment. Visit Urban75, or take a tour of the internet on The Useless Web or StumbleUpon.

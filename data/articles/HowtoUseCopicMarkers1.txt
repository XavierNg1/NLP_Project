 There are four types of Copic marker - sketch, ciao, wide, and classic. For hand lettering, the wide marker with a chisel nib is a good choice.Working on good paper is also essential for hand-lettering. When practicing, plain printer paper works just fine. Because Copic markers are alcohol-based, they won’t destroy or erode regular paper like water-based markers do.You may also use grid paper if you want to ensure the straightness and uniformity of your letters.;
, Wide Copic markers are good for practicing easy, larger fonts. Learning hand-lettering is also one of the best ways to learn how to line draw and shade. Beginners can learn by working on simpler fonts and eventually moving onto fancier lettering as they improve.


Try a font that is familiar to you first. Choose one you like from a book or one that you’ve found online. Draw it in a larger size with a pencil first, then go over it in Copic marker.
 Start with the lightest shade, then add darker shades on top. Choose colors from the same color family when blending, such as a light blue and dark blue.


Always begin with the lightest color as the base, then add on layers of the darker color.
 Colorless blender markers will help create seamless, shaded letters.


You can also create unique effects by smearing the edges of each letter with the blender.

 The process for taking screenshots changed between Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1. This was done to allow devices that don't have a Windows button to still be able to take screenshots. If you don't know which version you have, you can quickly check.


Tap "Settings" → "About" → "More info". The "Software" entry will display which version you are running. You cannot take screenshots on Windows Phone 7.5 or 7.8 without a third-party app.

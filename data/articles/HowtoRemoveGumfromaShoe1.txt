 Take your gum-ridden shoe and put it in a plastic bag, such as a large food storage bag or a grocery bag. It doesn't matter if the entire shoe doesn't fit in the bag, just make sure the part with the gum is pressed against the plastic.;
, Press the plastic bag firmly against the piece of gum for several seconds. You need the gum to stick to the plastic before freezing, otherwise this method won't work.
 Clear a space in your freezer for the plastic-covered shoe. If the shoe is not fully inside the plastic bag, you may want to keep it away from any food items, to avoid spreading any germs.
 This will give the gum a chance to freeze onto the plastic bag. Once frozen, remove the shoe and the bag from the freezer.
 The gum should stick to the plastic bag instead of your shoe, leaving your shoe gum-free!

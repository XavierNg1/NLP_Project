 Their toll-free US number is 1-800-331-0500. At the prompt, say “Customer Service” to speak with a service representative.


Tell them you need assistance transferring your old GoPhone plan to a new SIM card.
Provide the GoPhone SIM card ICCID number (found on the SIM card) and the new MicroSIM ICCID (from the iPhone 4 "About" screen or from iTunes).
Provide your iPhone's IMEI number, printed on the Micro SIM's caddy or from the iPhone "About" screen.
AT&T will recognize from the IMEI and ICCID that you are using an iPhone 4, and will notify you that they can do the transfer, but can't enable internet usage. Agree to this, and get the GoPhone account transferred to your new MicroSIM.
 Start iTunes, attach your iPhone, and follow the prompts to activate the phone

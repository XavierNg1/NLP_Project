 First peel the papaya, then cut it in half and remove the seeds. The seeds of the papaya are very abrasive, and leaving them in the mask could cause you to scratch or damage your skin., Papayas contain enzymes that firm the skin and eat away the top layer of skin, which will help to reduce the appearance of wrinkles over time.Be sure to add the whole papaya to the blender for maximum enzymes!

, The milk will help make the texture of the face mask more manageable, but milk also contains alpha-hydroxy acids that encourage the production of collagen to fill in wrinkles., As you spread the mask on with your clean hands, gently massage the papaya and milk into areas with pronounced wrinkles. Relax and wait about 30 - 45 minutes for the mask to dry completely. When it is dry, rinse with lukewarm water, dry your face, and then apply moisturizer.
 While it may take weeks, or even a few months, to see results, keep applying! Just be sure to make a fresh mask each time, as the mask only keeps for up to 12 hours in an airtight container.

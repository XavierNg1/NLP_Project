 Urine is one of the most common pet odor problems. For people whose dog spends a lot of time in their basement, figuring out how to remove the urine smell from concrete or cement can be tricky. The first thing you’ll need to do is locate the source of the urine smell.


If you catch your dog in the act, or shortly after, this will be easy, you just look for the wet spot on your cement.
However, dried stains can be harder to find. To find a dried urine stain, look for any areas that are discolored or any rings on your floor caused by a puddle of liquid.
If you are unable to locate the source, try using a blacklight to identify any previously soiled areas.;
, If you’ve found a fresh puddle from your dog, clean up the urine as quickly as possible to keep it from seeping into the concrete any more than it already has. You can use a towel, paper towels, or kitty litter to absorb any liquid that is still on the ground., Once you have removed the excess liquid, scrub the concrete with dish soap and warm water to remove any stains left on the concrete. Avoid using a wire brush as this can scrape the concrete., Urine can be tough to clean because traditional cleaning products do not break down the uric acid crystals in urine. To get rid of odor and stains from urine, use an enzyme-based cleaner. Apply the cleaner according to the directions on the packaging.Most pet supply stores carry pet-safe enzyme-based cleaners.
You can also try making your own enzymatic cleaner by combining three parts water to one part vinegar, baking soda, and dish detergent. Generally, however, store bought enzymatic cleaners have been found to work better on urine stains and smells.

 Knowing your strengths and your achievements will help you feel good about yourself and will enable you to find the confidence you have within.

, You deserve to feel good about yourself. Eliminate negative thoughts you have about yourself and replace them with positive ones. Try to remember that, despite your problems, you are a unique and valuable individual.Identify negative thoughts, such as “I am a loser,” “I never do anything right,” or “No one likes me.” Replace these thoughts with positive ones, like, “I am great,” “I am smart,” or “I have friends who love and support me."

, If you can, try to avoid situations where you feel you are being treated badly or where you are made to feel badly about yourself.


Instead, frequent places and surround yourself with people who make you feel liked, comfortable, and valued.
Some places where you may feel people treat you badly are unavoidable. If you are bullied at school or at work, tell someone whom you trust like a parent, teacher, counselor, friend, supervisor, or school psychologist.

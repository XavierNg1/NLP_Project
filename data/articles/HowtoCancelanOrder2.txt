 Try to do this as soon as possible, since online shipments usually go out fast. If the item has already shipped, you may not be able to cancel it.
 Find the order that you want to cancel in the list of orders.
 Press it. If there isn’t a button that says this, look for customer service contact information.


Some companies prefer that you cancel orders by phone or through email., Submit your cancellation. Alternatively, use the email address provided to cancel the order.


If you are submitting a cancellation request by email, make sure to include your name, the order date, the order number, an account number, your address, item descriptions and the reason for your return in your email.
 If you don’t hear anything within one or two business days, it is a good idea to call a customer service number to ensure your request has been received.

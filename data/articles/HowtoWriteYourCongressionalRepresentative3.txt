 In your email web browser, begin a new email and enter the representative’s email address into the address bar. You should title your email something like, “Vote no on HR 2111.”


You should still include your home address and full name, especially if you want a reply.
 Though email is typically thought of as a less formal way to communicate, you should make your email as professional as possible. You should send your email from an appropriate email address, like a business account. Use an easy-to-read font, like Times New Roman or Garamond, and make sure that the font size is legible.


Your email address should be something professional, like yourname@gmail.com rather than something like barbiegirl123@gmail.com. You could also use a school email address if it ends in ".edu."
Make sure that the signature in your email is appropriate. Some people have an automatic signature that says, "Sent from my iPhone" or "Sent from mobile." You should temporarily disable this feature if you are sending the email from your phone.
 Your email will be structured in the same way as a letter, but it can be helpful to look at sample emails to get an idea of the proper structure and syntax.You can look at form emails that your favorite nonprofits share, or from different advocacy groups.

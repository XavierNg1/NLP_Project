 It's easy to change an inexpensive notebook into a personalized gift just for the receiver.


Purchase an old-fashioned, black and white composition book (usually smaller than a regular notebook and with the pages sewn in).
Cover the book with aluminum foil, gift wrap or fabric being sure to wrap it around the edges. Use spray adhesive to secure it to the inside of the cover. You can even use duct tape which comes in many colors and patterns to cover the book.
Add stickers, photos, magazine cutouts, and handwritten words (inside jokes, names of recipient's children) reflecting the recipient's interests.

Write a short note on the first page about how much the recipient means to you.;
, If you're into paper or card making, create a set of cards or stationary using an image you've painted/stitched/drawn/printed, etc. You can either repeat the same image on each card or change them up. You can even make your own envelopes to go with the set of cards if you're really ambitious. Place it all into a small box and affix a ribbon that can be tied shut to keep it all neatly together.

 Use this method if you know:

two or more different speeds; and

that those speeds were traveled for the same amount of time.

For example, if Ben drives 40 mph for 2 hours, and 60 mph for another 2 hours, what is his average speed for the entire trip?


, The formula is s=a+b2{\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b}{2}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the average speed, a{\displaystyle a} equals the speed for the first half of the time, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the speed for the second half of the time.In these types of problems, It doesn’t matter for how long each speed is driven, as long as each speed is used for half the total duration of time.

You can modify the formula if you are given three or more speeds for the same amount of time. For example, s=a+b+c3{\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b+c}{3}}} or s=a+b+c+d4{\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b+c+d}{4}}}. As long as the speeds were used for the same amount of time, your formula can follow this pattern.
 It doesn’t matter which speed you substitute for a{\displaystyle a} and which you substitute for b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the first speed is 40 mph, and the second speed is 60 mph, your formula will look like this: s=40+602{\displaystyle s={\frac {40+60}{2}}}.
 Then, divide the sum by two. This will give you the average speed for the entire trip.

For example:s=40+602{\displaystyle s={\frac {40+60}{2}}}s=1002{\displaystyle s={\frac {100}{2}}}s=50{\displaystyle s=50}So, if Ben traveled 40 mph for 2 hours, then 60 mph for another 2 hours, his average speed is 50 mph.

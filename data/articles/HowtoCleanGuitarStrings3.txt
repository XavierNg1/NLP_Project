 Your skin produces natural oils that combine with dust and dirt from the environment to create grime that can stick to your guitar strings.You may not even see the grime that is building up on your guitar strings, but that doesn't mean it's not there, causing extra stress to the strings, making them become dull. By cleaning your strings regularly you help slow down the process of oxidation that breaks down the material in your strings., Particularly if you're having a performance in a hot, humid, or dusty place; under lights that might make you sweat; or during an exhibition when you might be nervous and prone to sweating, it's a good idea to clean your strings during your sessions. Whenever you take a break between songs, especially to get new sheet music or a drink of water, take a moment to clean your guitar strings.
 Particularly if you let your guitar sit in an open-air stand and it's been a long time since you last played it, you may want to consider cleaning it before you use it. This will ensure that any dirt or dust that has settled from the air is removed before you begin playing, preventing the sweat and natural oils from your hands from combining with the particles.

 "Back to back" refers to a distance from the back of one 90ยบ bend to the back of the other. In other words, this is the distance between the two parallel lines of a U bend, measuring from the outside edges. To create the first bend of the U, follow the instructions above for a stub up bend.
 Measure the distance the two bends need to fit between, such as the distance between two parallel walls., Place the bent stub end of the conduit against a wall. Measure from this wall along your conduit, to the desired length. Mark the conduit at this length using a permanent marker or pencil.
 Unlike the placement for the stub bend, the bender's handle should be pointed away from end you measured from. For bends like this, line the star symbol on your bender head up with the mark.If your bender does not have a star symbol, refer to your bender's instructions.
If the distance between the bends is too short for your bender, use the stub up system instead. In other words, turn your bender the other way, subtract the take-up distance described in the stub-up section, and line the conduit up with the arrow mark instead.
 Place the length of conduit you measured flat on the floor. Apply firm pressure on the foot pedal until the conduit bends to a 90ยบ angle. Checking this angle with a level is highly recommended, since it's important that the two bends of the U are parallel.

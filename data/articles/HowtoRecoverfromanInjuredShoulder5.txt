 The following exercises are more advanced and will demand more from your shoulders than the previous ones. Only attempt these after your strength has increased greatly, and you no longer feel any pain while completing them.


The push up is done in a similar fashion to the wall push up, except it starts on the ground opposed to standing upright. Stretch out until your legs and upper body are extended. With your hands at shoulder width and in-line with each other, lower your upper body while allowing your elbows to travel at a 90-degree angle to your body. Stop yourself when your elbow is at a 90-degree angle or when your upper arm is in-line with your body. Extend your arms back to the starting position.
The dumbbell thruster/press (above) begins in a standing position with dumbbells in both hands (this position is essentially a modification of the first exercise given in step three). Bring the dumbbells to a starting position even with your chest. Raise the dumbbells straight up while keeping your forearms perpendicular to the ground. After fully extending your arms, pause for one second and then slowly lower the weight to the starting position.
The one arm row begins by having your right arm and right leg resting on a bench while your left leg and left arm (holding a dumbbell) is down in a full extension of the arm. Pull the weight towards you and let your upper arm follow closely to your side. After your arm has reached 90-degrees with your body, pause for one second and lower the weight back to the starting position. Be sure to keep your back as straight as possible and in a neutral spine position.

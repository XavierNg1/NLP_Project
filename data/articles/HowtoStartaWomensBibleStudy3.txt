 Again, pray for an open mindset and open hearts to what the Lord has to say.
 A good trick for this is to first give them a chance to find it and then read it quietly to yourself. Once you are done reading it, most of the ladies should be done reading. If it is a small group, you can ask them if most of them are done. Reading it silently and then out loud often reinforces it in the brain. Plus, the repetition of the passage helps people remember it easier.
 Remember the questions you wrote earlier? Pull these out and ask the ladies the questions on the sheet. Let the ladies share their thoughts about the scripture. Once you have asked at least 3 questions, open it up for anyone to share their thoughts about the passage. This will create an openness and break any ice that might be there.
 Write down these prayer requests in a notebook so that you can pray for them throughout the week.
 Pray for those who requested prayer and thank the lord for the time that he has provided to have a bible study.
 You have created a wonderful resource to all women alike to enhance their walk with Jesus!

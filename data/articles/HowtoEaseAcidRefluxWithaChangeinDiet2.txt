 There’s no such thing as a perfectly reflux-friendly diet. However, eating a well-balanced diet high in fiber can aid digestion and potentially improve reflux symptoms. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis – these provide some fiber and nutrients you need.


Bananas, melon, peaches, pears, berries – these are all good choices. Just stay away from citrus.
Avoid toppings and sauces that contain onions, garlic, tomatoes, or other irritants.Green leafy veggies and root vegetables like potatoes, yams, beets, parsnip, and carrots are good complex carbohydrates and fiber sources.
 Whole grain rice, pasta, bread, couscous, and oatmeal add fiber and nutrients to your diet. Fiber aids in digestion, and adds to a healthy diet without irritating reflux.Try to include a mix of fiber sources in your meals – regularly eat fruits, veggies, whole grains, and legumes like beans, nuts, and lentils., Eating eggs may help with reflux symptoms.Because the yolk of the egg contains much of the fat, you’re less likely to get reflux with egg-white only options. For other protein, eat low-fat meats like fish, poultry, or lean cuts of red meat.Eat meat that is broiled, grilled, sautéed in olive oil (not butter), or baked – not fried.
 Eating ginger may help speed up digestion, lowering the risk of reflux. You can drink ginger tea, or add ginger right to your meals in fresh, dried, or powdered form. Fennel, an herb thought to relieve bloating, might also be helpful., Probiotics are tiny “good” bacteria, usually found in fermented food. Though it’s not scientifically proven, these foods might help balance the bacterial flora in your intestines and improve reflux symptoms.You can try eating small amounts of these foods to see if you experience relief:


Yogurt with live cultures
Kefir (a sour-tasting, fermented form of cow’s milk)
Kombucha (a fermented tea beverage)
Raw sauerkraut, pickles, or kimchi

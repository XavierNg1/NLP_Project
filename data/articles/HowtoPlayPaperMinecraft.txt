 This step is not so easy (unless you have graph paper), but it will get easier. Start by drawing the ground and then putting lines down it. Then, draw lines across it.


Add some trees and animals. Try adding some animals like sheep and pigs because those are vital for your survival. Start by drawing a rectangle and a square to the right or left. Draw little rectangles under the rectangle. If it is a pig leave it the way it is. If it is a cow, it should be bigger than the pig. If it is a sheep leave it the same size as the pig but make its body gray. Then add some trees. Make them as many blocks high as you want just remember to add some leaves.

, You will need an inventory. Try making it on the other side of your paper. Draw what you want your character to look like. Make three rows of nine on top of each other so it can store things. For your hearts and food, draw ten hearts in a row across and then ten apples in a row across.
 Draw coal ores, red-stone ores, iron ores, and every single type of ore.
 You will need to craft stuff like crafting tables too so start doing that.If you do not know how to craft just look it up.
 You need to know what time it is so you should change the sun to a moon and the moon to a sun. A sun is just a big block in the top right corner. Tho moon is the same thing just that it has three little squares in it.At night you should spawn some zombies and skeletons. Zombies are you just that their head is black and they can only spawn at night. Skeletons are you just that they have xed out eyes, carry bows, and can only spawn at night. Creepers can only spawn at night but they can survive in the sunlight. Spiders can spawn at any time.
 You want to explore right? Well if you do go get another sheet of paper and draw you new world. Enjoy!

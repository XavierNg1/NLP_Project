 Select a special photo to grace the top of the gift. Consider a photo that will take up a good portion of the gift top without distorting the image.


In lieu of using the actual photo, have it copied and/or increased to accommodate the project.
Use a black and white photo for the photo wrapping for an added old timey touch.
 The photo that you will be affixing to the top of the gift is the star of the wrapping, so you donâ€™t want it to compete with a wild pattern.
 Use double-sided clear tape (or a small tape loop) to hold it in place.
 Tie the ribbon or string completely around the package to hold the photo in place and add a decorative touch.

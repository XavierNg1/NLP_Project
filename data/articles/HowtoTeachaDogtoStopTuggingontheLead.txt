 If your dog goes through the front door before you, this may seem harmless and normal but it has put in its head that its priorities come before yours. You are the top of the pack, so you deserve the respect to go through the door before your dog!


If this is the case, whenever your dog pushes through the door before you, hold its leash short and behind you, then step out of the door first. Once you are out of the house, invite your dog out to join you. Following this first step can help hugely with the respect you get from your dog.;
, Once out on your walk, make sure you have the lead at its full length. If you have an extendable leash, it's recommended that you get a plain rope/leather leash that is one length only.
 This is time for you and your dog to bond and exercise together.
 As soon as there is tension on the leash which makes your arm straighten, or the leash itself go straight and tense, stop right where you are. Wait until the lead goes slack and your dog relaxes again.
 Repeating this process can be irritating but by the end of all the hard work, hopefully your dog will have gotten the message and will calm down and pay more attention to the exciting smells and games to play rather than pulling like a steam train.
 They should be ones that are easy to break up and easy for your dog to quickly snack on.
 Gently clench your fist

, Bring your hand (with the treats in it) up to the top of your rib cage/below your chest.
 Keep your dog's attention on the hand containing the treats.
 Each time your dog relaxes and walks by your side, even if its focus is on the treats, reward it with one or two small bits of the treat.
 This is another good way to try to teach your dog to walk on the leash nicely if it doesn't respond to the first option.

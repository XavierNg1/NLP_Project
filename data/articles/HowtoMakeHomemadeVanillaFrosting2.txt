 Be sure to pick a saucepan large enough to fit a mixing bowl inside. Fill the pan with a few inches of water, and set it on a burner turned to medium heat. When the water is simmering, place the mixing bowl inside the pan.Don't use too much water. You only need enough to get the mixing bowl hot; make sure you don't use so much that water gets into the mixing bowl.
Heat the water only to simmering, not boiling.
 Place the egg whites, sugar, and corn syrup in the bowl. Use a spoon to stir them together. Switch to a whisk and keep stirring as the mixture heats up and the sugar dissolves.
 Use a candy temperature to check the temperature of the mixture. When it reaches 160 degrees, it's ready for the next stage.


Be sure not to let the mixture get hotter than 160 degrees; otherwise, it will burn.
You can check to see if the mixture is hot enough by examining the texture; the sugar should be completely dissolved, and the mixture should look clear. It should take about 2 minutes.
 Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the icing until it whips into fluffy, glossy peaks. Add the vanilla and keep beating for a total of five minutes. Remove the icing from heat and keep beating if necessary until the frosting reaches the texture you desire. It's now ready to use on your cake or cupcakes.


7 minute icing is a popular choice for birthday cakes, since it has a pretty white color and classic vanilla flavor.
You can flavor this icing with lemon or another type of extract as well.

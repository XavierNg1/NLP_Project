 Imagine the havoc you'll be able to cause with a Lego rubber band machine gun! If you have access to an electric motor, the mechanism can be surprisingly simple - all you need is a gear centered at the back of the gun's beam which can turn via the motor.More elaborate Lego machine guns can even incorporate "minigun" style rotating barrels.Stock up on rubber bands before going on a rampage with one of these.
 A high-powered Lego sniper rifle allows you to cleanly and precisely annoy your targets before they even see you. All sniper rifles will have an extra-long, sturdy beam to accommodate the long, strong rubber bands that will leave welts on your opponents. Advanced Lego sniper rifles can even incorporate a bolt-action firing mechanism and a mounted scope for extra accuracy., Building a tiny, concealed Lego gun is the perfect way to take out an unsuspecting friend or hit someone who thinks you're unarmed in a game of Lego tag. All you'll need to do is make a really small, basic lego gun - just a beam and a firing mechanism. Then, load it and strap it under a long sleeve or hide it in a rolled-up newspaper and BLAM! Your mark won't even know what hit them. Be creative - use your skills to make a Lego gun trap or hide your ninja gun in a crazy place!

 The Snapchat icon is yellow with a white ghost on it.;
, If your camera isn't already in selfie mode, tap the icon at the top-right corner of the screen to switch the camera mode.
 Doing so will allow Snapchat to scan your face and position the filters according to its size and shape.


The face scanner may not work in very low-light conditions.
 The filters appear toward the bottom of the screen after your face has been scanned. A preview of the filter will appear as you swipe across it.
 It's the large circle button toward the bottom-middle of the screen. Doing so while you have a filter selected will take a picture Snap of your face with that filter on it.


Certain filters are better suited for taking videos. To take a video, tap and hold the circular camera capture button for the duration of the video. Videos can last up to 10 seconds long.

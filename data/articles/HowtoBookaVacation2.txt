, Call your airline you would like to take (that operates for that particular country) and get a PNR # from them and reserve your seats on the plane. It is good because you will have done it accordingly and if you don't get the visa for your destination, you may always cancel your booking.
 You may book your room in the particular hotel online and pay in on arrival or you may go and book it there and then but it is good to get it done in advance so that you do not have to wait at the hotel.
 While he/she may take charges for his/her services, it is always considered a good decision especially for tours so that you are spared the trouble of going around and getting everything done.
 During your stay it is better to get a car arranged full-time rather than getting a taxi. You can go anywhere you want anytime and the car will be available. (Just give your driver a break for lunch and dinnerÂ :)

, Now it is time to check if you get the visa on-arrival at the airport of the particular city or you have to apply. Apply from the visa application center of that particular country in your area or from the consulate/embassy/high commission. It is a necessity. Without it, you are sent back or if you get in without it, you're arrested. The visa application center reserves a right to deny a visa if you do not have all the documents submitted, too many court charges pending or things like that.
 It is a possibility that you may get ill there for whatever reason (climate change, normal; etc) so it is always good to get a travel insurance.

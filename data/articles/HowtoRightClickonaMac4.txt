 Mac makes its own mouse for this - the Magic Mouse (and its predecessor the Mighty Mouse), which doesn't appear to have two buttons, but can be programmed so that the right-hand side responds like a second button. If you don't want to buy a Mac mouse, any two button mouse can be programmed to work with a right click on a Mac.
 This is often as simple as plugging in the USB dongle and using it right away, but if your mouse is more complicated, follow the directions it came with.
 Any mouse with two built-in buttons should just work right away. You'll be able to right-click, as you otherwise would on another computer. However, a Mac-specific mouse like a Magic Mouse might need the settings adjusted to enable this.


Under the Apple menu, click "System Preferences" and then "Mouse".
Change the setting to enable "Enable Secondary Click". After doing this, you'll be able to click the right-hand side of the mouse, like a regular right-click button.

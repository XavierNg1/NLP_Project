 This menu is in the upper left corner of the menu bar. “About this Mac” will open a window with system information that displays your operating system version. Your OS must be between 10.4 and 10.5 to use Wiiji.
 This will open a list of system settings.
 Bluetooth is required for detecting the wiimote.
 Double click the installer, then double click the icon in Applications to launch. Once launched, Wiiji will automatically begin scanning for wiimote devices.


Before starting, make sure your Wii console is powered OFF or else it might interfere with the bluetooth detection.
Wiiji runs in the background and is accessed from a menu in the menu bar.
The initial scan window lasts ~15 seconds, if you miss the scan window you can select “Rescan for Wiimotes” from the Wiiji menu in the menu bar., After 1-3 seconds, the lights on the wiimote will flash and then the wiimote will appear listed in the Wiiji menu bar.
 Launch your game and select joystick or gamepad from the options menu. Your wiimote will function like a normal bluetooth game controller with the directional arrows and A/B buttons working as game inputs.


Games will usually allow you to customize what each gamepad button will do from the settings menu.

 Every operating system has a command line interface that will allow you to run the Ping command. The Ping command operates virtually identically on all systems.


If using Windows, open the Command Prompt. Click the Start button and enter cmd into the Search field. Windows 8 users can type “cmd” while on the Start screen. Press Enter to launch the Command Prompt.
If using Mac OS X, open the Terminal. Open your Applications folder, and then open the Utilities folder. Select Terminal.
If using Linux, Open a Telnet/Terminal window. It is most often found in the Accessories folder in your Applications directory.

In Ubuntu, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal.

, Type ping hostname or ping IP address.


A hostname is typically a website address. Replace hostname with the website that or server that you want to ping. For example, to ping wikiHow’s main web server, type ping www.wikihow.com.
An IP address is a computer’s location on a network, either locally or on the internet. If you know the IP address that you want to ping, replace IP address with it. For example, to ping the IP address 192.168.1.1, type ping 192.168.1.1.
To have your PC ping itself, type ping 127.0.0.1.
 The results will be displayed beneath the current command line. See the lower section for how to read the output.

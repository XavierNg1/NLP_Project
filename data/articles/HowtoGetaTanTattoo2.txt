 Make sure that it is a design you can make with a cream substance such as sunblock. You can either draw the design directly on the skin or use a stencil. If you don’t have a stencil of the shape that you like, you can always make one. Simply draw it on a sheet of paper and then use an X-acto knife or another kind of blade to cut out the inside of the shape., Do this before going out in the sun or lying in a tanning bed because you want it to be as pale as possible so it shows up well. If you’re feeling crafty, you can use a brush to apply the sunblock, but your fingers should work just fine. Whichever method you choose, make sure that the application of sunblock is fairly thick like a paste so that the sun can’t shine through it.You’ll probably want to apply a sunblock with a high spf of 30 or above if it takes you a while to tan. You won't have to reapply it as often., Then, go out in the sun or lay in the tanning bed for however long is necessary for you to tan. Remember not to smear the sunblock. If the sunblock gets smeared, your tattoo might be ruined because the shape might change. Don't stress if it does smear. Just work quickly to fix it.
 Since your skin is like a sponge, it will slowly start to absorb the sunblock, and over time the sunblock will probably shift around. So, you’ll need to reapply it or touch it up until you are tan.


Be careful to reapply neatly so you don’t mess up your design. Once you’ve set out in the sun long enough to tan, remove the sunblock.

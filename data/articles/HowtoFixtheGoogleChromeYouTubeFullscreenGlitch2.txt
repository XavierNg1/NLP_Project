 Some Chrome users report that they’ve been able to put a video into true full screen mode by duplicating the problematic tab., It doesn’t matter which video, as it’s just for testing purposes.
 This is the icon at the bottom right corner of the video. Once clicked, the video should launch in full screen mode—though if you’re running into the bug, part of the browser will still be visible.
 The video should retreat back into its YouTube page, making the tab(s) once again visible.
 Do this right on the tab itself (at the top of Chrome). A brief menu will appear.



Feel free to close the original tab, as it’s no longer needed.
 The video should appear in full screen. If the video takes up the entire screen without showing parts of the browser, this workaround works for you! If not, try another method.

 After the shooting is over, roll up the backdrops on a plastic tube.


Do not fold the backdrops. Folding the backdrops for a longer time will result in wrinkles.
 Or to save money, buy rigid PVC plumbing pipe (about $10 for a 10-ft section) and roll the backdrop up tightly and carefully. Be careful not to introduce new wrinkles when you roll it.
, Or, install shelf brackets on the wall to keep them.

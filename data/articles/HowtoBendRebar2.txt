 One of the first steps for trying to bend rebar is to use appropriate safety gear. You must have eye goggles and glove, at the bare minimum. It may also help to wear long sleeves and pants, protecting your arms and legs. Work in an open, free space where there are not a lot of people.Cut rebar can be jagged. Any exposed ends should be covered by OSHA-approved rebar caps., Some experts suggest choosing thinner rebar, such as a 1/4-inch design, for smaller projects where users will need to bend this steel into different kinds of shapes. If you need anything larger, however, you should consider trying professional and mechanical methods, as bending by hand will be difficult and dangerous.The type of rebar needed is not purely up to choice -- there are important structural codes that you need to follow when constructing.
 The issue of whether heating rebar can help individuals to bend it is under a significant amount of debate. Some experts and experienced steelworkers maintain that heating rebar is appropriate, and can help individuals to bend it effectively. Others point out dangers and consequences of heating the steel, saying that this is not a good general practice for changing the shape of a piece of rebar. At the end of the day, follow this simple guideline: if it is "non-weldable rebar," then don't heat it up at all. If is isn't, go ahead if you think it will help., In order to bend rebar, you will need to hold one side of it in place, then pull down on the opposite end to bend it. As the vise holds the rebar in place, it bends right where the vise stops and the "free" section of the bar begins.


Make sure your vice is well-anchored to your work bench.
Your bend should be right at the end of the vise jaws., This makes it easier to hold and bend. The longer this pipe, as well, the more leverage you can get on the rebar, making it easier to bend. The longer your lever, or the free area outside of the vice, the less power you need to make your bend., Slowly and carefully press down on the steel pipe covering your rebar until you get your desired bend.


For precise bends, you'll likely need a mold. You can cut and carve wood blocks, for example, and bend them the rebar around that. For even more precise bends or thicker rebar, you will need to move on to professional equipment, however. These machines come with dies that you bend the bar on top of to get the perfect angle.
 The sudden impact of a sledgehammer, for example, leaves you little control over the final shape. What's more, over bending damages the steel surface and can cause the bar to break of fail down the line.

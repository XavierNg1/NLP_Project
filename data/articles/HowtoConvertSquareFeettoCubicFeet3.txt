 Not all questions are going to tell you outright that they want you to find cubic footage. What you need to remember is that cubic footage is just a measurement of volume -- so any volume question you're asked with feet in the measurements (ft3{\displaystyle ft^{3}}), is likely asking for cubic feet. Some example problems might ask:

If the square footage is 10ft2{\displaystyle 10ft^{2}}, and the height is 5ft{\displaystyle 5ft}, what is the volume?

What is the volume, in feet, of the garden?

How many cubic feet of water could fit in a square box with a base of 23ft2{\displaystyle 23ft^{2}} and a height of 2ft{\displaystyle 2ft}? (Note: "base" means the flat bottom, or square footage.
 This is best seen in an example. Say you have a 100 square foot backyard area to plant a garden and need to know how much topsoil to buy. Before buying anything, you need to know how deep your soil will go. This is your "height" measurement, telling you how high the soil must go. For example, say you need, at minimum 6-inch holes for each plant:

Make sure all units are in feet:


6in12=.5ft{\displaystyle {\frac {6in}{12}}=.5ft}



Multiply square footage by height:


100âˆ—.5=50{\displaystyle 100*.5=50}



Express answer in cubic feet


You must purchase at least 50ft3{\displaystyle 50ft^{3}} of soil to fill your garden.
 Since it is such a simple conversion to get to square footage, it is simple to undo. For example, you might have a heater capable of filling a 6800ft3{\displaystyle 6800ft^{3}}, but you want to know how much floor-space that covers in your room. To find out, simply divide 6800 by the height of the room, found by simply measuring floor to ceiling:

Example height of the room = 12ft{\displaystyle 12ft}


6800ft312fr=566.67ft2{\displaystyle {\frac {6800ft^{3}}{12fr}}=566.67ft^{2}}


The heater will heat a room with a square footage is 566.67ft2{\displaystyle 566.67ft^{2}} and a height of 12ft.

This strategy is purely for rectangular or cylindrical volumes. It is much more complex for pyramids and spheres. , If your shape curves, bends, twists, or is otherwise irregular, you cannot simply convert from square footage to cubic footage. If the object changes size or thickness as it gains height than the measurement of the base -- your square footage -- will no longer be accurate. These types of problems usually require the integral calculus to solve.Imagine buying a heater for a room with a pointed ceiling. Now imagine how much more of the room you'd have to heat if the room was perfectly square, instead of pointed at the top. While the square footage of the floor is important, it isn't the only thing determining the cubic footage.

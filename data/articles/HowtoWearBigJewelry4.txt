 This is particularly true if you haven't had the ring fitted properly, and it either keeps sliding off your finger or it cuts off your circulation; if that is the case, find a jeweler or a jewelry-loving friend who can recommend someone to fix it as soon as possible.
 You shouldn't have trouble supporting the weight with your hand, and if you do, consult someone to have that changed.
 If you're going to wear big bijoux rings, save them for evenings out or when you're in more casual surroundings where a splash of creativity is accepted.
 Another tactic to employ if you're self-conscious of your hands is to get a tan--just be careful not to turn yourself orange and you should be perfectly fine.

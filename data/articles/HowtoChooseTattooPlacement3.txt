 There's no way around it. The very premise of tattooing revolves around a mechanized needle (or set of needles....up to 16) being used to puncture the skin and thus open a channel in which an ink or dye is simultaneously deposited. There will be pain, swelling, heat, and blood, just like with any injury. But the level of pain can greatly vary from artist to artist, tattoo to tattoo, and person to person.
 Backs, shoulders, and upper arms are favored for this. They are not often touched on a daily basis, which will make your 5-10 day healing period easier, and they are easy to wash and apply ointment without too much torquing of the skin.
 The ribs are well known for being some of the most painful tattoos to endure, as the jarring of the tattoo needle invariably causes one to tense up (well developed or locked muscles are very painful to tattoo over). Also. because the skin over the ribs is very thin and the bones so close to the surface, people have reported a deep ache akin to cracked or bruised ribs being felt during the course of the tattoo. Any area with the bones close to the surface will have a similar type of pain: ankles, feet, knees, elbows, collarbones, hipbones, eyebrows, the spine. Other areas are sensitive due to collections of nerve endings: the hands, the insides of the arms, the breasts and nipples, anywhere near the face, the scalp, behind the knees, the arch of the foot, the palms and fingers, and the whole pelvic region, including the genital and anal areas. Think long and hard about whether you can sit through a session before choosing any of these areas! They can be very rewarding to have tattooed, but it's important you are able to be still and calm throughout the process of inking!

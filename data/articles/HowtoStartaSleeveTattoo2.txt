 The first place to look for a good tattoo artist is your social circle. Word of mouth is often the best way to get clear, honest information about a shop.If you have friends with tattoos you find beautiful, ask them, “Where did you get this piece done? What was your experience with the artist like? Would you recommend them?”

, You should only ask friends with quality tattoos for referrals. Ask if you can check out their piece, and take mental notes about its quality.Assess the level of detail in the work. Look for clear, crisp, and thin lines. Check for pigment that’s faded or bled out, as if someone held a marker to a piece of paper for too long.
 Once you have a few potential shops, check their websites and social media pages. Browse through their portfolios to get a better idea of their quality and style, and narrow your list to include the style or styles most consistent with your aesthetic.While you’re checking websites and social media pages, look for comments, complaints, and reviews from past clients.
 After checking shops out online, your next step is to visit in person. If it appears dingy, dirty, or unprofessional, find another shop.Look for evidence of sanitary practices, such as:Clean, well-organized work space and tools.
Tattoo needles still in sterile packaging and only opened in front of clients.
Sterilizing equipment, such as chemical, steam, or ultrasonic cleaners.
Artists sterilize all reusable items.
Artists wash their hands and wear gloves.

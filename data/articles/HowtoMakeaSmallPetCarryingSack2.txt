 For example, a 7 by 7 sack would require a measurement of 9 by 16.


Consider using a straight edge to obtain perfect lines and measurements. Follow the straight edge with your fabric pencil to create a “pattern.”
Iron the fabric if you see wrinkles or if you cannot get the fabric to lay flat on your workspace.
 Carefully follow the pre-drawn lines and place excess material in a scrap bag. You should have a piece of fabric that resembles a rectangle.
 Use your fabric pencil to trace the edges around the cotton rectangle. Smooth fleece out with your hand if you have wrinkling--don’t iron as ironing will only destroy this fabric.

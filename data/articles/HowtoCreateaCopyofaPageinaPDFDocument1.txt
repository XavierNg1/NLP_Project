 Windows 10 includes a new "Print to PDF" feature that allows you to create a new PDF file from the Print menu in any application. Open your PDF file, which will open in the Edge browser by default.


If you're using an older version of Windows, see the Windows 8 and Earlier section.;
, The process for this varies depending on the application, but generally you can do this from the File menu or by pressing Ctrl+P. In Edge, click the "..." button and select "Print."

, This function will create a new PDF file instead of physically printing the document.
 This will allow you to specify which page you want to copy.
 You can cycle through the preview to find the page you want.
 You'll see a notification that your file has been saved. It will be saved to the same folder that the original PDF is located in.
 Either click the notification or open the File Explorer and navigate to the correct folder. You'll see your new PDF file next to the original.

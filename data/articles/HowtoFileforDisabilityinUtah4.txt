 After the Utah DDS has determined that you are blind or disabled, they will send your information back to the SSA office so they can process your disability payments. The letter you receive from the SSA will provide details about your payments.


If the Utah DDS does not conclude that you are legitimately blind or disabled for the sake of receiving disability benefit payments, the letter you receive will provide you with instructions on how to appeal the determination. In the event that you decide to appeal the determination, your disability claim will be reviewed by different team members from the Utah DDS.

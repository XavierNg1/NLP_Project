 Bananas make a great breakfast with Greek yogurt and a drizzle of honey, or sliced on top of oatmeal. Chop them up with other fruit to make a fruit salad. Bananas are also a healthy energy booster on their own, and easy to carry with you as a snack.
 Freeze ripe or overripe bananas until hard, then peel them and toss them into a blender until it forms small chunks. While cold, this has a similar texture to ice cream, with much less fat and sugar.


Optionally, blend with other frozen fruit, honey, or a dash of vanilla extract.
 Bananas are often used as a thickener in smoothies. Blend with orange juice in any proportion to make the smoothie thinner and tangier. Add ice cubes if you'd like a less rich taste, or a colder drink.


Add protein powder to give yourself energy for a workout session.
Add mint for a refreshing flavor.
 Banana slices can be dried into chips using a food dehydrator, or on a baking sheet kept in an oven at minimum temperature settings. Using a dehydrator only, you can slice the banana in thirds or halves lengthwise and dry to form leathery chews instead.


Most store-bought banana chips are fried or coated in oil, making them much less healthy than this homemade version.
Add cinnamon or nutmeg to accentuate the sweet flavor, or add a pinch of salt for a more savory snack.

 White spelt flour is less refined than whole spelt. As a result, it’s a good idea to sift it before mixing it into your recipes as a substitution for all-purpose flour. That will help break up any lumps and remove any chunks of bran., Spelt flour often weighs differently than all-purpose flour, so using a cup of spelt may not necessarily weigh the same as all-purpose. To be sure that you get the proper amounts, weigh the spelt flour on a food scale before adding it to a recipe.1 cup of white spelt flour contains 102 grams, while 1 cup of all-purpose flour contains 125 grams.
 Spelt flour doesn’t allow baked goods to rise all that much. If you are replacing self-rising all purpose flour in recipe, mix in ¾ teaspoon (3 g) of baking powder for every cup (102 g) of spelt flour that you’re using to get a good rise.

 A smart thing to do is to find the closest or the easiest ways you can go to an anime festival.You could always ask a friend that would want to come if you desire( its twice as fun!) but it is optional.;
, If you already have paid for the tickets or waiting for the front door, skip to step 3, if not, continue reading this step.After you have found which anime con/festival, its the best you visit the site first if they have one, so you can always find out all the info you will need,( How much tickets are, if you can bring food, what they have, competitions, etc.) After that, Buy the tickets online or just wait for the front door ones. Remember to find our the times for the Con/Fest.
 remember, you don't have to be a anime character, you can always be a well known video game characters. (e.g Mario, Final Fantasy)You can always add stuff to your cosplay, but don't overdo it or put too much, it can sometimes have a bad result.
 Remember to bring money, cameras and so on. You could also be an Harajuku too. If the con/fest your going has karaoke, and you want to go, pick a song that is easy and that is good to sing.
, you would not want to be half asleep or tired when you go there, would you?

, Remember, do not spend too long on one thing.
 That is the most important thing to have.
 For all you know, they could be an obsessed anime fan who thinks you're the real deal.

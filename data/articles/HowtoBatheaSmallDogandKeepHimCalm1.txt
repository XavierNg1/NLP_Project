 To accommodate their size, bathe your small dog in a sink. Line the bottom of the sink with a rubber mat or thick towel so the dog doesn't slip. Run the water and test it on your wrist; the water should be lukewarm, not hot., Lay down extra towels on the ground and counter to absorb any water that might splash out of the sink while you bathe your dog. Make sure to have all your supplies by the sink; this way you won't have to interrupt your dog's bath or leave them unattended to go get something later. Your bath time supplies should include:Dog shampoo and conditioner
Towel to dry your dog after the bath
Treats
Brush or comb
Dog toy
Hair dryer (optional; kept away from the bathing area)

, To prevent water from entering your dog's ears, place small cotton wads in each ear. Do this gently and be careful not to hurt the dog if they wriggle around during this process. To make things easier, brace the dog's head and offer them something to bite (like a toy or bone) while you insert the cotton.Don't push the cotton in too far.
 If your small dog has long hair, run a brush or comb through it before the bath. Be sure to get out any mats or tangles, which will get worse in the water. Be gentle and avoid pulling too hard; praise and pet your dog after you're done.

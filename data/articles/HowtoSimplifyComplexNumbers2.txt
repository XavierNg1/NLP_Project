 Looking at a complex number (a+bi) should remind you of binomials from Algebra or Algebra 2. Remember that to multiply binomials, you need to multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second. A shorthand version for doing this, is the F-O-I-L rule, which stands for “First, Outer, Inner, Last.” For an example of (a+b)(c+d), apply this rule as follows:First. The F in FOIL means that you multiply the the first term of the first binomial by the first term of the second binomial. For the sample, this would be a*c.

Outer. The O in FOIL tells you to multiply the “outer” terms. These are the first term of the first binomial and the second term of the second binomial. For the sample, this would be a*d.

Inner. The I in FOIL means to multiply the “inner” terms. These would be the two terms that appear in the middle, which are the second term of the first binomial and the first term of the second binomial. In the given example, the inner terms are b*c.

Last. The L in FOIL represents the last terms of each binomial. For the sample expression, this would be b*d.

Finally, add all four products together. The result for the sample binomial multiplication of (a+b)(c+d) is ac+ad+bc+bd.
 To multiply two complex numbers, set them up as the product of two binomials and apply the FOIL rule. For example, the product of the two complex numbers (3+2i)*(5-3i) works as follows:First. The product of the first terms is 3*5=15.

Outer. The product of the outer terms is 3*(-3i). This product is -9i.

Inner. The product of the two inner terms is 2i*5. This product is 10i.

Last. The product of the last terms is (2i)*(-3i). This product is -6i2. Recognize that i2 equals -1, so the value of -6i2 is -6*-1, which is 6.
 After applying the FOIL rule and finding the four independent products, combine them together to find the result of the multiplication. For the sample (3+2i)*(5-3i), the parts combine to give 15-9i+10i+6., The result of the FOIL rule multiplication should yield two real number terms and two imaginary number terms. Simplify the result by combining like terms together.For the sample 15-9i+10i+6, you can add the 15 and 6 together and add the -9i and the 10i together. The result will be 21+i.
 Find the product of the two complex numbers (3+4i)(-2-5i). The steps for this multiplication are:(3)(-2)=-6     (First)

(3)(-5i)=-15i    (Outer)

(4i)(-2)=-8i    (Inner)

(4i)(-5i)=-20i2=(-20)(-1)=20    (Lasts)

-6-15i-8i+20 = 14-23i    (Combine terms and simplify)

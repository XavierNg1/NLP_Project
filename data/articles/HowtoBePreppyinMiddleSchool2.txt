 The best way to be preppy is to be happy with your life and yourself. You are under NO obligation to look a certain way, wear a certain brand or go out with certain people. Staying true to yourself will help you to make friends who like you for you, not for your clothes or popularity. You have the right to express your gender and sexuality in whichever way you wish, and you do not have to be in any way 'refined' or 'feminine', vice versa, don't let yourself form negative connotations with these words. If being 'refined' and 'feminine' make you happy, be happy., Be nice! Some middle schools' preps are mean, and that's not the real preppy attitude. Preps should be nice and not snobby.


Be bubbly, flirty, outgoing, sporty, feminine and energetic.






Don't be shy. Say hi to the new girl, flirt with a football player, etc. Be sure to do things in a nice way, though.
 Never leave the house without your makeup done, no matter what. Also, always keep your hair nice.
 But always be normal, not weird, gross or strange. Make sure you are one of the nicest gals around. Also, it helps if the other girls are jealous of your perfection, so stay perfect.
 Always have straight A's. For a true prep, a B is never acceptable. Use proper grammar and punctuation. Prepare for the SAT, even in middle school. Aim to get into an Ivy League college, home of the preps. Or Stanford.
 Do volunteer work, stay away from bad things, and be true to yourself. Try to embrace any religion. It will help your behavior. But, never preach onto other people. Never threaten anybody.
 Do a sport like horseback riding, croquet, cricket, swimming, lacrosse, dance, cheerleading, badminton, or tennis. If your school doesn't offer any of these, do volleyball, softball, or track and field.

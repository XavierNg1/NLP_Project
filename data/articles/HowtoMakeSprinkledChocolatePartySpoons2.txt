 Make sure they are level by either propping the spoon handle against a spatula or even a small book. You want the entire spoon area to be filled with chocolate. If you don't have enough spatulas or books for the entire batch at once, work in groups (for example, doing 10 at a time).
 Stir chocolate constantly to avoid having it burn or clump.


Stir and heat until chocolate is nearly 80% melted. Remove from heat and continue stirring until chocolate has completely melted and is smooth.
 Use a small spoon or pour using a spouted measuring cup to dispense chocolate. Work quickly as you don’t want the chocolate to harden during the process.
 If you plan to dip the spoon into a powdery substance (such as crystal sugar or ginger) be sure you carefully dip so that it doesn’t disturb the balance of the chocolate.
 Expedite the process by placing cookie sheet in the refrigerator. Be sure the cookie sheet remains level so the chocolate doesn’t shift or move.

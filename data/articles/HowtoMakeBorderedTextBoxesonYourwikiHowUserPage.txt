, You can customise the code by changing the width, color, padding and style of the text box.



Width is the thickness or thinness of the border. You can use 3px, 9px, any thickness you'd like for your page.

Color is (obviously) the color that you want the border to be. You can use the name of the color, such as green or light blue, or the code of the colour (#000).

Padding is the amount of space between the border and the text inside, often known as a margin. You can use 1px, 8px, any length you'd like.

Style is how you want the border to look. The options are solid, inset, dotted, ridge, groove, double, and dashed.
 An example is Border|Text|width=3px|style=solid|color=Red|padding=5px. Remember to add two curly brackets ({) at the start and two curly brackets (}) at the end. It will give you Text.
 You can write about yourself ("Hi, I'm Mrs.Example. I love playing Animal Jam and doing Tips Patrol on Wikihow."), say whether you're online or offline, write a notice to your guests, anything you'd like. Your user page is yours to customise, so have some fun with it.
 If you don't do this, the borders around your sentences will crash into each other. If your sentence goes into the next line, you'll need to add an extra space. It would look somewhat like this:

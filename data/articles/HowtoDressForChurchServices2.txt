 While standards on clothing for church have become more lax over time, it is still usually expected that you dress in your nicest garments when attending Sunday morning worship service.Having nice clothes does not mean you have to spend a lot of money on them. Just make sure that they are clean and presentable.
Avoid drawing attention to yourself or wearing things that would stand out., While many men prefer to wear a suit and tie, if you don’t have one, a button-down shirt will suffice. Make sure it is free of stains or wrinkles and remember to tuck it into your pants.
 Black dress pants are the best option for a person attending a church service. If you don’t have a pair, you can wear clean and wrinkle free casual slacks or khakis as an alternative.Avoid shorts. Even if it’s hot, you should refrain from wearing shorts. Jeans are too casual for Sunday morning service. And you do wear jeans, do not wear ones with patches or holes.Avoid things that have a drawstring or too many zippers or clips.
Remember to wear a black or brown belt with your pants, at least when not wearing a sport coat or blazer.
 Wear your best pair of dress shoes when attending service to show respect to the God and his church.Avoid sneakers or sandals in church. Black or brown colored shoes are preferred. But, again, if you can't afford dress shoes, wear the best that you have.


Avoid wearing white socks because they don’t match with many outfits and can be tacky., In times past, in Western culture, wearing a hat indoors was a sign of disrespect, but even today it applies to church services.In 1 Corinthians 11:7 the apostle Paul says, “man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God.”Members of the military are allowed to wear hats as part of their uniform in some religions like Christianity.

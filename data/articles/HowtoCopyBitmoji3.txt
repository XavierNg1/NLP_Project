 To use Bitmoji on your computer, you’ll need to install an app that only works with Google Chrome. If you don’t have Chrome, see How to Download and Install Google Chrome to learn how to get it., If you see the Bitmoji button (a green icon with a white winking chat bubble) at the top-right corner of Chrome, you already have the extension and can skip this step. Otherwise:

Go to https://www.bitmoji.com.
Scroll down and click Get it on Google Chrome. It’s a black button at the bottom of the page.
Click Add Extension.
When it’s installed, you’ll see the sign-in screen. Enter your Bitmoji account information and click Log In, or select Log in with Facebook if your account is linked with Facebook. You’ll have to sign into Facebook if you haven’t already.
 It’s the green icon with a white winking chat bubble at the top-right corner of Chrome., To find it, click one of the categories listed (e.g. “luv ya,” “birthdays,” “you rock”), or type a keyword into the “Search Bitmojis” box., If you’re using a computer without a right mouse button, press Control as you click with the left button., Make sure you don’t accidentally select “Copy image location,” as that won’t actually copy the image., Almost all social sites and apps, such as Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, and Hangouts allow you to paste an image directly into a chat or post. Right-click (or Control+click) the place you want to insert your Bitmoji, then select Paste.

You can also paste Bitmoji into other apps on your computer, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.

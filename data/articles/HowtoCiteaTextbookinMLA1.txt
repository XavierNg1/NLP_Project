 One way to cite a quotation, paraphrase, or other borrowed information in text is to introduce the author in the sentence. If the textbook was written by more than one author, list all the names. Only use the last name, unless there are two authors with the same last name. In that instance, include the first initial, as well.


According to Smith, that information is incorrect (12).
Johnson and Smith believe otherwise (74).
T. Doe and J. Doe explain things a different way (249).;
, If you do not introduce the author or authors in the sentence, you must include the last name or names in the parentheses.


Studies suggest otherwise (Smith 12).
Some scholars suggest other alternatives (Johnson and Smith 74).
Matters can also be explained in another way (T. Doe and J. Doe 249).
 Regardless of where you specify the author or authors, the page numbers from which the information came should be specified in parentheses after the information. If including the author's name in parentheses, do not separate the name and page number with any punctuation.


Erikson believes these rumors to be true (89-92).
Some scholars doubt these rumors (Keller and Orion 110).

 Resetting your Windows Phone will delete all of the data that is stored on it. Make sure you've transferred your photos to your computer or your OneDrive account, and that you've saved any other data that you want to keep to a safe location.


You can back up most of your Windows Phone data by opening the Settings menu, selecting "Update & security," and then tapping "Backup." Ensure both options are enabled and then connect your Windows Phone to a power source and a wireless network. This will not back up your photos.
 You can reset your Windows Phone directly from the Settings app. If you can't access your phone, see the next step.


Open the Settings menu. You can find this in the "All apps" list on your Start screen.
Select "About." You may have to open the "System" section first if you're using Windows 10.
Tap "Reset your phone." After confirming, your Windows Phone will begin the reset process, which may take a while to complete.
 If you don't have access to your phone or you are locked out, you can reset it using the Find My Phone website:


Visit account.microsoft.com/devices and log in with your Microsoft Account.
Select the Windows Phone that you want to erase.
Click the "Erase" button next to the phone's details. After confirming, the phone will begin the reset process.
 If you can't access your Windows Phone, you can reset it from the recovery mode.Turn the phone off, then press and hold Power and Volume Down until you feel the phone vibrate.
As soon as you feel the vibration, release both buttons then press and hold Volume Down.
When you see the exclamation mark (!), press and release the following buttons in order: Volume Up, Volume Down, Power, Volume Down. This will start the reset process.

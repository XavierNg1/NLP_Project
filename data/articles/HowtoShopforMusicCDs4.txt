 In stores like these, you're most likely to come across older and most likely used CD's too. You may want to shop for older music CD's at a small local music store. You may also find yourself staring straight at a bargain.
 This may be a bit more useful because when it comes to making a visit to the music store you may be in for a hard time. The CD's may not be in any sort of order and this will make it harder for you to find the CD that you're looking for. But some music stores are more dedicated than others and will make an effort to keep their displays tidy and in order. If you're in doubt or on the verge of frustration, ask someone who works there. They may be able to straight out tell if it's in stock or not. If it isn't, you may want to search elsewhere. If it is, they may also point it out for you. If you're just simply browsing with an open-mind, you may be surprised with the CD's that you come across.

 If you are using Blogspot (Blogger), you automatically have Adsense in your account. Note that the transactions will be deposited into your bank account, or sometimes you will need to use a credit card. They also pay you in dollars only, so if you live in another country, research more about changing the currency.


Ask permission from your parents first. You could get in trouble if you transact money without permission from an adult.
 If your parents or you have a Facebook account, for example, ask them to post a link to your blog and tell their friends about it.


Adults surely will like the idea of a kid blogging; they think it is cute and terrific for a kid to blog.
Tell your friends that you have a blog, and put attractive flyers in peoples' mailboxes around your neighborhood. Be happy that you made your first blog post! Remember to update your blog at least once a week, or else people will get bored of it and stop viewing it. Consider it as a chore, but still enjoy it!

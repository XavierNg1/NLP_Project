 Water-tight is airtight, and you need to prevent air from escaping your hands to make them whistle.;
, Your left thumb joint should be against your left index finger, just behind its middle joint and your hand cupped to the right, forming a “C” shape.
 Your fingers should be close together and slightly bent. Your thumb will rest on your index finger.
 You want to form an airtight chamber between your hands. To do so:


Your left index and middle finger will rest in the space between your right thumb and fingers.
Your palms will meet to seal off the back of your hands.
Your right fingers will rest on top of your left fingers.
 You want a small, rounded slit – roughly 2-3 centimeters tall and ½ a centimeter wide – like a small, squinting eye.
 You lips will be puckered out, but somewhat close together. Imagine you are "booing” someone on stage.
 This part often takes some practice. Your thumbs should be pointing away from your lips slightly, with a small bit of the opening exposed near your chin so the air can escape and whistle. Your upper lip will rest near your thumbnail.
 Imagine you are trying to blow out a lot of candles at once. You don’t want to spit, blow rapidly, or blow softly. If you’ve done everything correctly, you should hear a clear whistle coming from your hands.

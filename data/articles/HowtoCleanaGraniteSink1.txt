 Many sponges will have this scrubbing pad on one side, or they can be purchased on their own. Do not use anything harsh like steel wool, which will damage the finish on your granite sink.;
, Saturate the scrubber with hot water and then apply 2-3 drops of a mild liquid dish soap to it. You can also use a mild solution of water and vinegar if you'd prefer., Rub the scrubber over the hard water stains and any spots that look grimy or filmy. You can wipe the whole sink down with this scrubber for a more thorough cleaning.
 Use a spray hose, a cup, or just your cupped hands to pour a little water over the soapy areas and rinse all the soap residue away. You can also wipe it with a clean, dampened sponge.
 Microfiber is gentle enough to be used on granite without damaging it, but any soft towel or cloth will do. Be sure that you’ve gotten the sink completely dry before you attempt to add any oil, since excess water will prevent the oil from working properly.
 Find a clean, dry cloth or rag and pour a few teaspoons of olive oil or mineral oil onto a small section of it.Try not to ball up the cloth so much that it begins to absorb the oil and spread it through the cloth. The oil should sit in a relatively concentrated spot so that it can be transferred to the granite., Wipe the sink thoroughly with the cloth until you’ve distributed a thin, even layer of oil over the granite. Allow it to sit for about a minute before you attempt to wipe it away., Use the clean part of the cloth, or just get a new one, and buff any excess oil off the sink. The granite will be shiny but should not feel slick when you run a finger over it. Continue to wipe it with a clean cloth if your finger comes away with oil on it.

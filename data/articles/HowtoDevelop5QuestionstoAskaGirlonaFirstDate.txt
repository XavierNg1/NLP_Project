 Use these 5 questions to ask a girl on a first date to open the evening and you will find her ready and willing to respond.


Ask her about her family life. Does she have a brother? If so, what's he like? Is he into sports, cars? Most girls adore their brothers, especially younger ones. If you can identify with her sibling you will do well.
Ask her about her job or education. Be careful not to express a need for either. She may have had reasons for not continuing her education or for having a stable career. Let her express herself and you gauge the desire to continue with the conversation topic or move on.
Ask her about her hobbies. This is always a good way to find out what she is really into. Most people glow about their hobbies because it is what they LIKE to do. When you identify her likes, continue with that topic for awhile and ask continuation questions. IE: If she likes cars, ask her what kind, what size motor, what color?
Always the safe question and maybe the most important is "What's your favorite movie?" This will tell you where her heart is. If she likes action and adventure, she will take risks, and maybe with you. If she likes romantic movies, great. Become the romantic dinner date and humorously offer to kiss her hand.
Ask her if she likes to travel and if she does, ask what places would she like to see. Maybe you have traveled and can offer some tips to her about that place.;
, If you do not prepare yourself with a list of non evasive questions, chances are your date will take a turn for the worse. Being prepared with these 5 questions to ask a girl on a first date will get you headed in the right direction.

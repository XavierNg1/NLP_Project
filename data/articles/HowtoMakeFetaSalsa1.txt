 Take 2/3 cup (35 g) of sundried tomatoes packed in oil and remove them from the jar. You'll also need 1/2 cup (67 g) of pitted Kalamata olives. Use a sharp knife to carefully chop the tomatoes and olives into rough pieces. Place these in a serving bowl along with:2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
2 thinly sliced scallions;
, Take 1/2 pound (8 ounces or 226 g) of feta cheese and crumble it into large chunks. Add the chunks to the bowl with the tomato, olive, and herb mixture.You can use your favorite style of feta. Or to save time, you can purchase crumbled feta.
 Use a couple of large spoons to gently mix together the feta with the tomato, olive, and herb mixture. Avoid stirring too much or the feta may break up into very small pieces. Drizzle the salad with about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the olive oil right before you serve it.Consider serving the classic feta salsa with pita chips or scoop it onto salad for a filling topping.

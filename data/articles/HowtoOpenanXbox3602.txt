 These tabs are located next to where the power plug connects and will likely need to be opened at the same time. They can be popped one at a time, however, this is more challenging. At this point, you will want to use the second small screwdriver. Use both of these or the case opening tool to open the tabs. This will allow you to pry the shell open.
 At the other end of the same side, you will find five more poppable tabs. You can open them one at a time by keeping constant pressure while prying open the shell or simply use the case tool, which will open them all at once.
 Turn the Xbox 360 around to view the front end. Now, locate the clip at the end nearest to the DVD drive. Open this with your fingernail (it should be pretty easy) or a flathead screwdriver and a bit of prying. Open each of the four tabs, one at a time.
 You should be able to see the inner casing now that the shell is removed. This inner casing can be opened by unscrewing the cover panel. Turn the Xbox onto the other side and lift up the remaining shell to reveal the interior components. Donâ€™t forget to be careful while doing this.

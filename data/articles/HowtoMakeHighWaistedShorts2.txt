 You have to keep the pants on when you mark the shorts in the front so you have a more accurate sense of how long the shorts should be. You can use a black felt tip pen, tailor’s chalk, or even a piece of chalkboard chalk. Simply make a mark each leg of the pants so you can use it as a guideline when you’re ready to cut.


If you want to hem the shorts, be sure to allow enough material for hemming; otherwise, your new shorts might be too short for your liking.
Mark the shorts a bit longer than you want them to be, to leave some room for error.
You should try to mark the back of the pants as you're wearing them, but you can mark the back more accurately after you take them off.
You can also lay a pair of your favorite shorts on top of the slacks and mark your cutting line that way—you’ll know you’re getting just the length you want.
 Fold them together and draw your cutting line mark all the way around both legs of the slacks. If you want an even cut, you can pin the two halves together so that they don’t slip and slide while you are marking them.
 Make sure the scissors are sharp, especially if you are cutting through denim. Make slow short cuts to make sure that you're cutting along the line you marked evenly. If you make a drastic cut that makes the shorts too short, you won't be able to undo the damage.

 Under the "For Sale" heading on your local Craigslist page, you will see a subheading that says "free." That page should include ads from people who have just moved and are giving away their boxes.


Post a Craigslist ad if you do not see any ads for free boxes. Listing an ad is free, and all you have to do is say you are looking for boxes to use for your move.
 The Freecycle Network (www.freecycle.org) puts people who have things to give away in touch with people who need those things. Cardboard boxes are almost always featured.


Type your location into the search box and you will get to your local page, where you can search ads for cardboard boxes or place your own.
 While the company would prefer to sell its moving boxes, it has set up an online message board where customers can find free boxes.


Go to www.uhaul.com/exchange and type your location into the search box.

,,, eBay will automatically process the refund if you used PayPal to process the original transaction.Refund a buyer using their original payment method if the buyer paid with a method other than PayPal, or contact the buyer directly to work out an alternate refund method. For example, if the buyer paid using a personal check, offer to either send a refund check or add funds to the buyerâ€™s PayPal account.

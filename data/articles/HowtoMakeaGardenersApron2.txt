 The jeans should be 1 to 2 sizes larger than you. You want them to sit comfortably around your hips without sliding off or feeling too tight.Choose jeans with large, roomy back pockets. Men's jeans are great for this.
 Start by cutting one of the legs off, 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) below the back pocket. Fold the jeans over and use the cut leg as a guide for the second one.Use a ruler and marker to draw a guideline across the bottom of the jeans, if needed.
 Turn the jeans so that the zipper and front pockets are facing you. Cut up both of the side seams from the bottom cut edge all the way up to the bottom of the waistband. Leave the folded/topstitched part of the seam attacked to the back of the jeans. They will become part of the design., Begin cutting at the zipper and finish cutting at the side seam. Try to cut as close to the bottom edge of the waistband as you can; use the seam as a guide.Leave the button and button hole. You will need these to secure the apron.

The front pockets will fall away as they will have nothing to hold on to. Set them aside for another project or recycle them.
When you reach the belt loops, you can cut under them so that they are still attached to the waist band. You can also cut them off entirely.
 Sometimes, when you cut the legs off of a pair of jeans, the crotch part sticks out in a little triangle. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut this triangle off., You can leave your apron plain if you want to, or you can decorate it further. Choose garden themed motifs and designs, such as flowers, bees, or butterflies. Here are some simple design ideas that would work well on a denim apron:

Iron a patch onto a pocket or the corner of the apron.
Decorate the apron using puff paint or dimensional fabric paint.
Use stencils and fabric paint to add images, such as butterflies or flowers.
 Fill the pockets with seed packets, then wrap the apron around your waist. Use the button to secure the apron.

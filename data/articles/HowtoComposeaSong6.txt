 You will probably want to write down the music you are writing so that it can be played again, especially if you want it to be played by other people. One way will be for you to write the music down by hand. You can write as little or as much as you want to. Doing this will require a certain understanding of music theory, however.


Lead-sheets are a form of sheet music which include only the most basic notation, usually the melody and harmony. These are common for jazz and improvisational music, as well as with popular musicians who have little musical theory training.
 These are computer programs which are designed for music composers and audio workers. They allow you to mix and record music and will also have a certain level of music notation functionality. These can be expensive, however, and should only be considered by serious musicians.
 Another way would be to record yourself playing and singing the music. From this you can write down the notation or have someone else do so at a later date.

 A wok is large pan with sloped sides. Woks are ideal for this type of frying because you can cook in stages. While you can use a skillet for stir-frying, the results will not be as consistent or as tasty., Stir-frying is similar to saut√©ing in that it requires you to cut up your foods before you cook them. Make sure that all pieces are roughly the same size and weight. This will ensure uniform cooking. Have them all chopped and ready before you heat the pan. , Set the stove to high heat. Stir-frying requires higher heat than other types of pan frying. Peanut oil is best for stir-frying, although you can use canola or vegetable oil.
 Sear the meat first by adding it to the pan and flipping it after a minute until both sides are browned. Then add your vegetables. Some vegetables-- such as broccoli, baby corn, and carrots-- take longer than others and should be added first. Add in soft vegetables like bok choy or mushrooms at the end., Use a wooden spoon to mix, flip, and stir the ingredients. You want to make sure that everything cooks evenly. If something looks like it is over-cooking, push it up against the cooler sides of the wok so that it does not burn.
 Let the sauce steam and cook into the vegetables. Stir well to make sure that everything is coated. There are many types of popular sauce that you can either make or buy, such as:


Soy sauce
Soy ginger sauce
Orange sauce
Hoisin sauce
Black bean sauce

, You can serve it on rice, noodles, or on its own. Eat it while it is hot, or cool and save for later. Stir-fry keeps well if stored in the refrigerator. You can reheat it later in the microwave or eat it cold.

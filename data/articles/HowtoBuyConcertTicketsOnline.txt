 Make sure you know exactly who you want to see before hand. Then go to their official website to see where they will be performing. If you don't know the official website of the artist you want to see you can always Google their name and the official website should show up. From there you can find their tour schedule and decide on which date works for you. Try to pick a venue that is close to you and make sure that they are performing on a date that doesn't conflict with anything you have going on.;
, Once you have found out where the artist you want to see will be performing look at the venue website. The website should have tickets listed so you can purchase them directly from the source that is selling them. If the event you are looking for isn't listed don't worry. Just move on to the next step to find tickets. Usually an event isn't listed on the venue website because it is either sold out or too far ahead in the future.
 Ticketmaster.com is the official seller of most venues and sports teams. If you can't find tickets on the actual venue website you can easily find the tickets you are looking for on TicketMaster. If the event is sold out or doesn't have the seats you want then you can move on to the last step which will almost guarantee you to find the tickets you want.
 If you can't find the tickets you want by using the above methods the next step is to go to the secondary ticket market. These websites are created to help people buy tickets that have been sold out by posting tickets that people want to sell. Some reliable websites are http://www.stubhub.com, http://www.frontrowking.com, http://www.vividseats.com and much more.

 An inspiration will come. Something in the heavens has to say this is the time we'll give it to you. When MJ wrote Billie Jean he was in his car down Venture Boulevard and he said he wanted to write a song with a great baseline. And he just let it go and then several days later he had it. His first masterpiece.;
, Let the music write itself. Write the words and then the music. Same thing with the dance.
 Sing the baseline into a tape recorder and have it digitally mastered at a professional recording studio. Michael did this with Billie Jean, Who Is It, and Tabloid Junkie.
 Inspire people. Earth Song is an example of world hunger and other global issues, while Beat it is an example of peace and non violence. Billie Jean is a true story about a girl who claimed he was the father of her baby. Morphine is about Jackson's Drug addiction to Demerol, and Childhood is about his lost childhood. They Don't Care About Us is discusses Jackson's innocence in the allegations against him. Let love be your message in songs, and know that love is the true meaning of success.
 Jackson has a strong faith in God. It was an inspiration to millions.

 MacBooks have different video ports depending on the model and date of manufacture. The type of port you have will determine the types of connectors you can use. There are four main types of connector ports, listed from the most current to the most outdated:HDMI - This port is about the same size as a USB port, with indents on each side. It is indicated by the letters "HDMI". If you have this port, you don't need any special adapters; you can just plug an HDMI cable into the port and into your TV.
Thunderbolt - This is a port that is slightly smaller than a USB port and is indicated by a small lightning bolt icon.
Mini DisplayPort - This port is shaped the same as a Thunderbolt port and is indicated by a rectangle with a straight line on each side.
Micro-DVI - This port is slim like a USB port, with a small indent on each side. It is indicated with the same icon as the Mini DisplayPort.;
, If you have a Thunderbolt port, you can use either Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort adapters. If you have a Mini DisplayPort, you can only use Mini DisplayPort adapters. If you have a Micro-DVI port, you can only use Micro-DVI adapters., Before purchasing an adapter for your MacBook, you'll want to check what connections your TV supports.


Most modern TVs support HDMI. This connection will allow you to transfer both image and audio.
If you don't have HDMI, the next best option for high-quality image is DVI. DVI connections do not transfer audio, however, so you'll need a separate audio connection.
If you are connecting to a particularly old TV, the only option you may have is a composite adapter. These can be difficult to find these days.
 To make the connection, you will need an adapter that converts your MacBook's connector to your TV's connector. If your TV supports HDMI, you'll want a Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. If your TV only supports DVI, you'll need the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter.


If you have an HDMI port on your MacBook, you don't need an adapter (as long as your TV supports HDMI as well).
 Besides the adapter, you'll need a cable to connect the adapter to your TV. If you are using an HDMI adapter or have an HDMI port, use an HDMI cable. If you are using a DVI adapter, use a DVI cable.


If you are using DVI, you'll also want an analog audio cable to transfer the audio signal.
 Plug your adapter into the correct port on your MacBook.
 Use your video cable to attach the adapter to your TV.
 Make sure you choose the correct one, as some TVs have multiple HDMI or DVI ports. By default, you should see your desktop extended onto the TV automatically.
 You can find this by clicking the Apple menu.
 This menu will allow you to adjust your screen positioning and mirroring options.
 This will allow you to change several options regarding your display positions.
 If you're extending your desktop, moving the displays around in this menu will adjust how the mouse moves between them.
 This will make both your mac and TV display the same image.
 This will make your TV your main display, with the Mac menubar and all of your desktop icons.
 Click the "Output" tab and then select the "HDMI" from the list. This will set your TV to play back the sounds from your MacBook.

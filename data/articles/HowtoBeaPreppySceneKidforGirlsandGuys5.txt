 Remember, these are cliques, you dress the part; then act the part, you dress emo, you're emo, you dress scene, then you're chill as in no "oh my gawd!" or squealing, because that's just annoying. Now if you're into the preppy scene chick look, there are three things to remember:


Preppy scene chicks must NOT act like dummies, judgmental, or stupid. That's not cool and no one likes people who act that way. You can switch your hair and wear pink in your hair, but be laid back.
Don't disown others out of your group, even if they're not your clique/scene, because the style sticks out, so that others can fit in.
 Meaning, do not criticize other cliques or types of people when you are one. No clique is any better - or more original - than another. Most scene kids dress the same, as the same with preps, emos, hipsters; you get it.

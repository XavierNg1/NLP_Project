 Read the instructions that came with your loom and set it up like the directions say. Make sure the U-shaped pegs are facing up. The arrows should be facing away from your body.;
, Place your first rubber band diagonally on a peg. Starting with the first middle peg is recommended. It doesn't matter what side you go to when you move the band diagonally, but stick with it.
 Place the second band diagonally from the first band, with the last peg you placed a band on serving as the starting point.
 Repeat those steps, reversing the direction of the diagonal each time, until you have what looks like a zig-zag all the way down the loom.
 Flip the rainbow loom so now the pegs are facing downwards. The arrows should be pointing towards your body. This will help you grab the bands to weave them.
 Use the hook to grab the second band on the first middle peg from underneath the first band.
 Flip the band on your hook so that it bends in half (bent over the band above it) and place it over the second peg in the next row. Whether it is to the left or right depends on what you chose earlier.
 Continue the process across the whole Rainbow Loom. You should end up with something that looks like the image above (like a series of connected circles).
 Get a C-clip or an S-clip from your kit. Hook it onto the last rubber band.
 Remove the rubber bands from the loom, carefully. Stretch the bracelet out.
 Connect the end of the bracelet to the C-clip.
 Enjoy your new bracelet. Now that you're finished, keep making more!

 Make sure the oven is completely preheated before you put the asparagus inside - otherwise they'll steam instead of roasting.
 Arrange them in a single layer so that they'll cook evenly.
 The oil will help the asparagus stay crisp. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil evenly over the spears on the baking sheet.


If you'd like to ensure the spears get evenly coated, you can toss them with the olive oil in a bowl, then arrange them on the baking sheet.
 Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the asparagus spears. To take the dish up a notch, grate some Parmesan cheese over the asparagus, too.
 Place the asparagus in the oven and roast it for 12 minutes, until it turns bright green and appears charred in a few places. Take care not to overcook it, as it will quickly burn if left in the oven for too long.

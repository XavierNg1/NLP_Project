 A steady blast of water should knock the aphids off your plants. Continue spraying the plants each day until the aphids no longer return.
 Most horticultural oils are actually mineral oils, refined to remove impurities. Many vegetable oils also work well, especially cottonseed and soybean oils.
 Use the same types of oil you might use for dormant oil.
 Mix crushed garlic and water together, allowing the water to become infused with the scent of garlic. This smell acts as a deterrent against aphids, driving them away.
 Mix 1 cup of vegetable or white mineral oil with 2 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of bleach-free dish soap. Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spritz it on infected plants to suffocate the aphids. However, do keep the treated plants out of direct sunlight, since the spray could magnify the light and burn the leaves.
 These products cause the aphids' cell membranes to weaken and collapse, ultimately dehydrating them through fluid loss. Sprinkle insecticide powders or spray soaps onto both sides of each leaf on the infected plant.
 Pyrethrins are made from the chrysanthemum, while pyrethroids are their synthetic counter-part. Both products are organic, and both are capable of killing off aphids.

 Brush small, inch sized circles in a clockwise motion until the hair starts to form into balls. This should only take about a minute or two. Once a ball of hair forms, move onto another section of the hair to continue making dreadlocks throughout the hair.The brushing method works best for coarse hair that's 3/4" to 2.5" (1.905 cm - 6.35 cm) long.
You can also use a sponge brush, which is made specifically to create dreads and curls in someone's hair.;
, Once all the hair is spun into small balls, you should apply a dread wax or cream to moisturize them and hold them in place. Put a dab of cream into your hand and rub it into each of the dreads.Popular brands of dread wax include Jamaican Mango & Lime, Doo Gro, and Africaâ€™s Best., You can help hold down the dreads with elastic bands or small hair clips. Apply the elastic band under the ball, near the root of the hair. Make sure not to apply the bands too tightly or it can cause discomfort to the person getting the dreads., Use a hair dryer to dry your locks completely. Touch them and make sure that they are no longer wet, but remain moisturized by your wax. Once they've been allowed to dry and set, you can remove your hair clips or elastic bands.Don't sleep or play with your hair for three hours or the dreads may come loose.

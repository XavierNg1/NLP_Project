 Put your pipe the bottom of a Tupperware container and fill it up with enough hot water to cover the top. Drop in 2-3 denture tablets and let it sit and soak for a half hour. The fizzing will remove a lot of resin, and the formula is designed to remove stains and residue.Other alternate home cleaning solutions include:


Salt and vinegar.
Baking soda and vinegar.
Sand and water.
 Marketed specifically to smokers, products like Simple Green and Formula 420 are made to clean the resins in glass pipes. They are, however, a bit more expensive than the simple DIY solutions, and many people do not find them any more effective. That said, they eliminate the need for shaking or messes, as they often remove the resin through simple soaking., Freezing causes the resin to harden and dry up, making it easier to dislodge. Freeze the pipe for 30 minutes to an hour, then quickly use a needle or similarly sharp, thin object to knock off the resin. It will not take long for the resin to warm up and become gummy again, so you need to work quickly.
 A quick rinse and a soak in some isopropyl, done once a week, takes only 5 minutes. But it will keep you from having to resort to deep cleanings or overnight soakings, and keep your piece shiny and sparkling. Some stains will not come out if they soak into the glass, but this only happens if you neglect cleaning for several months or years in a row. Take the time now to clean it off and your task will be much easier in the future.

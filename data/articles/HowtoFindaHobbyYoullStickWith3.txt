 Many people find the buddy system works when starting a hobby. If you and a friend agree to get into a hobby together, you'll both be more likely to stick it out. You will be able to keep one another accountable.Choose a friend with compatible interests. If you have a friend who's into extreme sports, while you tend to like staying in with a book, the two of you will not be a good match hobby-wise.
Instead, choose an equally bookish friend. The two of you could try joining a local book club together.
 Many people find it's easier to stick to a hobby if there's community support. Try joining a class or club related to your hobby. If you like singing, for example, join a local choir.If you tend to be more solitary, you can look for support online. If you're a knitter, for example, you can post in forums asking for advice and inspiration involving new knitting projects.
 If you jump into a hobby too quickly, you may grow impatient and quit. Do not think you have to commit all your time and energy to a hobby right away. Start by doing your hobby for a set number of minutes each day. As you get more accustomed to the hobby, increase this number gradually.If you're trying to take up running, for example, try starting off with 5 to 10 minute runs and gradually increasing the length as you get more physically fit.
 If your hobby is something you've never done before, you're unlikely to be good at it right away. Have some patience as it takes time to build up a skill. Try to remind yourself why building this skill set is important to you so you'll have the motivation to keep going., You will never know whether you'll take to something if you don't try it. It's okay if you give a hobby a solid shot and decide it's not for you. A hobby is meant to help you de-stress and wind down. If it's doing the opposite, try something else. Remember, the hobby you're most likely to stick with long term is the one you like.

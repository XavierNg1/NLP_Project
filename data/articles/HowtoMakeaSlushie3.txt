 Pour the sugar and water into a bowl and stir the mixture until the sugar is no longer visible. This way your slushie won't taste grainy after it freezes.


In place of the sugar and water combination, you can use 4 cups of your favorite drink. Try making a slushie out of any type of soda, fruit juice, chocolate milk, and even coffee!, You need 1 1/2 teaspoons extract and 5 to 10 drops of food coloring. Taste the mixture and add more or less according to your preference.


If you want a creamy slushie, stir in a tablespoon or two of cream. This pairs especially well with orange or vanilla extract.
To make it a little fancier, try adding a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of lemon zest.
 The sides should be a few inches high so the liquid won't spill out.
 You could also use a lid if your dish comes with one.
 Each time you stir, you'll break up the frozen ice that has formed. Over time this creates the classic slushie texture. After doing this for about 3 hours, your slushie should be just right.
 You'll have enough for two large or four small slushies. Enjoy your delicious concoction.

 Babies can take different amounts of time to finally stop breastfeeding. If you withhold the breast from the baby and she is gesturing her desire for it (licking lips, placing hands on your breast) it might make it into an issue when it wasn’t before. Try distracting her before she can start getting interested in breastfeeding at times when she typically wants to nurse., Breastfeeding your baby at night and in the early morning are often the most difficult habits to break. Many babies find it very comforting to fall asleep right after breastfeeding, or eat immediately upon waking. Some children might take easily to a bottle instead of the breast, but many like the comfort and closeness of breastfeeding and will resist switching to a bottle.Try holding your baby in the same position as you do when breastfeeding when you try to give him a bottle.
 Rather than the feedings being what you and your baby do to snuggle down, think about other ways she could relax. Some of the ways you can try to get your baby to sleep include:


Singing to your baby
Reading books to your baby
Patting your baby’s back

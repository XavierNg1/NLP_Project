 Because the oil from the chiles can irritate your skin and eyes, wear plastic gloves when handling your chiles and wash your hands after handling chiles barehanded. Remove limp, spotted, and soft chiles. Crisp, firm, fresh peppers will yield the best pickled chiles., Use a knife to remove the tops of the chiles. Slice them in your preferred fashion. Transfer the sliced chiles to a colander and rinse them under warm water.


When most of the seeds have been removed or washed into the bottom of the colander, place the chiles and colander off to the side., Heat your water in a kettle or pot until it is lightly boiling. Add the water and all other ingredients to a suitable mixing bowl. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the sugar completely dissolves., Insert the chiles into a sterilized jar. Pour the pickling mixture into the jar with the chiles. Leave at least a half inch (1.3 cm) of space between the mixture and the top of the jar.


Jars can be sterilized by boiling them in water for 10 minutes. Submerge the jars completely. Use tongs to prevent getting burned by hot water or jars. In this fashion, sterilize lids in nearly boiling water., Jars filled with the heated pickling mixture may cause burns if touched. Place these in a safe, out of reach location where children, other adults, and pets won't have access to them.
 When the lid has been fastened to the cooled jar, store it in the refrigerator. Wait at least an hour before eating the chiles. Chiles may lose spiciness over time.


Eat your pickled chiles within a week for a more intense flavor. Wait at least a week for milder pickled chiles.

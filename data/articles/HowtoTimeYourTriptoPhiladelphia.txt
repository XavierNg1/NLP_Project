 During the peak season, which for Philadelphia is in the summer, hotel fares and other elements of travel may be more expensive. Some bargain-minded vacationers like to take trips on the off-season, for example, in late fall or mid-winter, to save money.;
, Other vacationers who plan their trips according to the elements and outdoor climate often choose summer for a trip to Philadelphia or any other similar urban destination. Summer can be a more comfortable and convenient time to visit the city and see all that it has to offer.
 Another big tip for scheduling a Philadelphia vacation or tour is to be mindful of which main attractions are open at the times and dates that you are considering.


Look at the schedule for the Philadelphia Art Museum. The art museum is a major draw to the city, and knowing about when exhibitions are scheduled can help to plan a trip.
Learn about schedules for historic Philadelphia downtown locations. Some of the attractions around historic Rittenhouse square and spots like the Liberty Bell offer schedules that readers can use to help plan a trip.
Look at schedules for seasonal sporting events. Those who want to take in a professional American football or baseball game at the modern Lincoln Field/Citizen's Bank Stadium sports center can check on dates and times for games. Alternately, those who are not interested in these sports can plan to visit Philadelphia when crowds are not flocking to the downtown location, in order to avoid some extreme traffic.
 One of the characteristics of the city of Philadelphia is its often congested highways. A single main freeway, the Schuykill Expressway, brings visitors in from the west, and it's a good idea to plan to drive during off-peak hours to avoid crawling lines of traffic. The same issue applies to the main artery, the 95 freeway, for an approach from the south.

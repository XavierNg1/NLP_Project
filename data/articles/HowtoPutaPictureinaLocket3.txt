 A water soluble, washable ink or paint is best, since you'll be stamping your locket directly into it. If using craft paint, to spread it very thinly on a paper plate.


Don't use this method if your locket is very valuable. Since you'll be getting ink or paint directly on the locket, there's a possibility that it could get damaged.
You may want to test the ink or paint in an inconspicuous spot, like the inside of the locket. Put a dab in the center of the locket and see if it easily wipes off with a damp cloth. If not, use another method.
 This is the side of the locket with a slightly raised border.
 Try not to get too much ink or paint on the locket; you only need enough to create a print of the photo recess.
 Place it carefully on the paper and lightly press down. When you lift the locket, an imprint of the inside edge should be on the paper. If this is not the case, repeat using more ink or paint.
 It is best to do this quickly, before the substance dries. Use a paper towel dipped in warm water to wipe it away, then dry it with a towel.
 Position it so that the face or image you want to store in your locket is contained within the borders of the template. Use a pencil to lightly trace around the template onto the photo.
 Use a scissors or a craft knife to neatly cut the photo to the exact size of your template.
 Place a dab of glue on the back of the photo. Gently insert it into the locket. Press it lightly to ensure it stays in place.
 Once dried, the locket is ready to wear.

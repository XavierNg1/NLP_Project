 Here's what you'll need to make tilapia ceviche:


8 tilapia fillets
15 juiced limes
1 finely diced large tomato
1/4 diced red onion
2 diced cucumbers
1/2 bunch chopped cilantro
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

, Cut it into strips that are at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and place them in a large bowl., Juice 15 limes and cover the fish with the juice until they are fully covered. You don’t need to use all of the lime juice as long as the amount in the bowl fully covers the tilapia pieces.
 Toss 1 finely diced large tomato, 1/4 diced red onion and 2 peeled, seeded, and diced cucumbers in with the tilapia pieces until you’ve combined the ingredients. Don’t over-toss them or the tilapia pieces can get a mushy look and texture – just do it enough to incorporate the ingredients.
 Stir in ½ of a bunch of finely-diced cilantro and salt and pepper to taste.
 This will be enough time for it to begin to marinate with the juice and spices. You can leave it in the refrigerator for even longer – a few more hours or even overnight.
 Taste the ceviche before serving and add more salt and pepper to taste if it’s necessary. Place this tilapia ceviche in a glass bowl or martini glass and enjoy it while it’s nice and cool.

 Before falling asleep, place a pen or pencil and a journal next to your bed. When you wake up in the morning, or periodically throughout the night, record your dreams in your journal. Write down every detail of your dreams you can recall. Jot down the minor details, no matter how mundane or insignificant they may appear. If you have been recording your dreams for a while, make note of any recurring concepts, characters, or objects.


Your subconscious mind is revealed in your dreams. Therefore, recording and studying your dreams provides you with access to your unconscious mind., An insignificant dream incorporates aspects of your physical surroundings—you may incorporate smells, sounds, and physical actions occurring around you into your dream; a significant dream is derived from your subconscious mind—it is not a common dream but an odd, puzzling, or illuminating dream. If your dream was significant, determine which category of subconscious dreams it falls under. Was it a precognitive dream that revealed details about future events? Was the dream a warning? Was it factual—did it confirm what you already knew? Did the dream inspire you or fulfill one of your desires? Did your dream fulfill your wish or need to reconcile with someone or something?Vivid dreams are often more significant.
 You do not have to be an expert to analyze your own dreams! All it requires is a little effort and research. There are handy resources online and at your local library! When analyzing your dream, assess it as a whole. Each detail you recall has significance and will enhance your interpretation of your dream, as well as your understanding of your subconscious mind. If the dream dictionary’s definition of a symbol is inadequate, try assessing the dream within the context of your own life. Try to determine for yourself if there is a reason this image, person, or thing is appearing in your dreams.

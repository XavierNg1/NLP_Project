 This is just like HBD (Here Be Demons), but instead, there are different kinds of heroes and a few waves to go through. However, in each level, you get a certain amount of shards.


Here Be Monsters is 5 waves in one level. In the first wave, there will be a few low level heroes attacking your base. When you kill that set of heroes, you move on to the next wave, where the heroes' levels are increased, and may be harder to kill. The 5th wave is the hardest. There are high level heroes that are difficult to kill, and there is also a boss. The boss can be a dragon, a dinosaur, or the Centaur King, which is usually the boss you kill in Boss Battles, Storm Mesa and Wretched Gorge.
 A, B, and C are the easiest levels, and as you go, they give more shards. For example, A gives 10 shards. B gives 15. C gives 20, and so on.
 The higher your skill talents are, the better. The boss always has a better skill talent, and even though the boss is level 10 in A, it can actually kill a level 60 hero. Save up all your extra heroes (from gem rolls and cards) and slimes (slime, crystal ooze, or gelatinous champion) for when you really need to level them up. Consider getting them up to 4/9, since that is when they get strong.


As you go, level your talents more to get stronger for the levels. When you win, you always get shards. When you lose however, you do not. You only get the rewards for the other waves you have won, such as gold, mana, or exp.

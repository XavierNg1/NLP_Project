 Be aware that not all flowers are edible. If you have a particular one in mind, always research that specific type first to make sure it’s safe to eat. Otherwise, stick to popular favorites. Edible varieties that go particularly well with salads include:Arugula
Chive
Hibiscus
Marigold.
Pansies.;
, Keep in mind that, even if a specific flower is safe to eat in general, not all flowers are grown with consumption in mind. Avoid consuming any that have been treated with chemicals, like pesticides. Always use organic flowers, which are grown without any added chemicals., If you have a farmer’s market nearby, purchase your flowers there. Inquire about growing methods with the sellers to ensure that they run an organic operation. If not, make sure you shop for flowers in your grocery store’s produce section, and not their florist section. If you’re still in doubt about whether they’re safe to eat, order online from companies that sell flowers specifically for cooking, like:Gourmet Sweet Botanicals
Marx Foods
Melissa’s

, Treat flowers just like any other produce. Always wash them before you start making any foods with them. Give them a shake to get rid of any dirt or insects. Place them in bowl of cold water and gently scrub them with your fingertips. Then place them on a paper towel so they can air-dry.If you don’t use them right way, dampen a fresh sheet of paper towel and use that to line an airtight container. Seal the flowers inside and refrigerate them. Use within a week of purchase.

 As aforementioned, it is important to start the growth of your peach tree in the right direction by pruning at planting. If you plant in the fall, wait a few months till the next spring to prune.
 You don’t want the branches to start much higher on the trunk, because as the tree matures it will grow too tall.


The tallest branch should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm) from the ground total. Trim branches that are too long to meet this number.
All branches should ideally grow at a 45 degree angle. If there are none near this measurement on your tree, prune all branches to a single bud and wait for more growth., Scaffold limbs are the largest branches on the tree, beginning at the trunk. To begin, choose 2-3 scaffold limbs, but this number may grow to 4-6 over time.


Scaffold limbs should form a radial pattern from the trunk, each facing away in a different direction.
Scaffold limbs will house the lateral (smaller outward growing) branches as the tree matures.
 You want to cut the branches near the trunk, offering only a small collar of growth to prevent decay in the branches.


Make thinning cuts, or cuts that start at the origin of the branch, on trees younger than one year old.
Heading cuts are used to remove parts of branches, rather than the entirety of the branch. Avoid doing this in a young tree though, to prevent unwanted suckers and water shoot growth near the top of the tree.

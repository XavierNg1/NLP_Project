 If you already have furniture for your bedroom, select a color scheme from that. Pick colors from your dominant pieces, such as floor rugs, chairs, and bedspreads, and choose paint colors that match these hues. If you introduce an entirely new color, you may pick something that clashes, or you may make your bedroom look too busy by having too many colors.;
, Complementary colors are found on the opposite ends of the color wheel and include red and green, yellow and violet, and blue and orange. Choose a subtle hue of one color and pair it with a dominant hue of its complement. You can accomplish this with paint alone, or you can rely on a combination of paint and other decorations.
 Related colors are found next to each other on the color wheel, and monochromatic colors are colors of the same hue but different tones. Both of these color schemes have stylish, uniform appeal.
 The right paint color can bring a theme together, but the wrong one can completely tear it apart.


Stick with white, black, or similar neutrals for a modern bedroom space.






Give your room an exotic twist with a cinnamon or apricot hue.






Opt for ivory or rich hues to create a more traditional style.
 Bright, bold colors can seem too energetic and overwhelming in a bedroom if used as the dominant paint color. Instead, opt for a more toned-down shade for your paint and introduce bright splashes of color by using other design details.
 Walls are traditionally painted a single color, but you can add drama and depth by painting one wall a different color. This "accent wall" tends to be a richer or more vibrant shade than the other walls.
 Buy a sample color and paint a corner of one wall with your selection to see how it looks in the room's lighting. If you like what you see, move forward with it. Otherwise, make a different selection and try again.

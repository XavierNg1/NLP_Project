 Like with most minerals, there are specific guidelines on how much you should get every day. The recommended daily amount of selenium will change based on your age, gender, and if you are pregnant. While pregnant, your recommended daily amount is 60 to 70 mcg.


The amount you should have after you deliver and stop breastfeeding is 55 mcg., Even though you need lots of selenium to keep you healthy during your pregnancy, you can actually take too much. This is especially common when you take selenium supplements because they have such concentrated amounts. Your upper limit of selenium should be no more than 400 mcg per day. If you do develop selenium toxicity, you may experience:Upset stomach
Nausea
Skin rashes
Garlic breath
Fatigue
Irritability
Neurological (nerve) disorders

, One additional way that you can get your daily amount of selenium is through a supplement or multivitamin. This is effective if you canâ€™t eat enough food per day that has plenty of selenium in it. Make sure your supplement is not more that 100 mcg a day. This will help you avoid getting too much when added with any natural sources you get. You can also get a prenatal vitamin that contains selenium as well.


Make sure you talk to your obstetrician before taking any selenium supplements.
Look for a supplement that uses selenomethionine or selenocysteine as its source of selenium.

 Often, only children end up growing very close to their parents. You can encourage this bond by spending quality time with your child on a regular basis. You may arrange weekly playdates with your child where you both spend time doing something fun and engaging together. You may allow your child to choose the activity you do together or suggest a possible activity you can do. Make these playdates part of your child’s routine so they do not feel lonely or without a playmate.For example, you may have weekly movie nights with your child where you prepare snacks and watch a movie of your child’s choice. Or perhaps you have once a week basketball sessions where you play one on one with your child.
 You can also make your time with your child feel meaningful by taking an active interest in your child’s interest. Ask thoughtful questions about your child’s hobbies and interests. Or ask your child about their day and listen intently to what they have to say. This can help them feel you care about them as a person and want to be there for them.For example, you may ask your child, “How was your day at school?” or “What was the most surprising moment at school today?”
To get meaningful conversation started, you may say to your child, “What is so cool about science, anyway?” or “Tell me more about your social justice club.”

, Though you may be worried that your child will be lonely or isolated as an only child, you should try to allow your child to have their alone time. Many only children enjoy some alone time where they can read, write, or play on their own. Carve out some alone time in your child’s schedule so they can be with themselves and be independant.You may try balancing your child’s alone time with time with others. Perhaps you set aside time after dinner for your child to play alone and make sure they have a few playdates a week with other children for balance.

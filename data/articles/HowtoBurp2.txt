 You don't need to take an enormous breath - simply breathe in normally. Instead of swallowing air with your food, in this method, you'll swallow air directly from your lungs.
 You want to make sure that you cannot inhale any additional air. Don't suffocate yourself - if at any point you're desperate to breathe, do it. Do you really want to be remembered as a person who passed out from trying to burp?

, This will probably require some practice. Try to swallow as if you're eating a piece of food. Feel for the mouthfuls of air traveling down your esophagus. In effect, you are transferring air from your lungs into your stomach, at which point it can escape your body through the throat as a burp.
 As you try to swallow, position the tip of tongue at the back of mouth, you will swallow greater quantity of air. Then, try to burp normally. This part can be difficult for beginners. When you're starting, it may be necessary to "force" your burps out. Practice your air-swallowing until you get a good feel for the technique. Soon, you'll be able to mortify your peers on command.
 This may take some practice. The goal is to squeeze your stomach like a bellows to force the burp out in one loud push. Use your diaphragm and abdominal muscles to firmly (but not violently) push. If done correctly, you'll get a loud "bark." Practice until you're comfortable with this step.

 There is no right or wrong clothing to mediate in. The right outfit varies from person to person. Some people meditate naked in the comfort of their own homes while others wear sweat pants, yoga pants, tank tops, or T-shirts. Wear whatever feels comfortable to you today.If you feel good in your clothing, you will have better meditation.;
, Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes that may prevent you from breathing comfortably and meditating. Pick something on the loose side, but not so loose that it bothers you or gets in the way. Flowing robes are ideal for meditation.If you feel any tingling, numbness, or like your legs have “gone to sleep” your clothing may be too tight.
Pants with elastic waistbands are ideal. They will be comfortable no matter what position you meditate in.
 It's difficult to meditate in a heavy coat or jacket, so take it off when possible. Jeans, tights, hoodies, and headbands can also be awkward, as they tend to pinch or need frequent adjustment. If you are not able to change your clothes, remove your belt and untuck your shirt.


Your clothes should never be a distraction or a hindrance. They should allow you to focus on your inner self.
Drawstrings and jewelry tend to get in the way as well.
 Once you've found something comfortable, you might want to make it your permanent meditation outfit. Think of your mediation outfit as a uniform. When you put it on, you know it is time to get down to business.A special mediation outfit may also help you get into deeper mediation more quickly.

 You can maintain your foundation throughout the day or night by keeping blotting papers with you. Check your foundation periodically and use the blotting papers to remove any oily areas on your skin. Removing excess oil can help to prevent oxidization and keep your foundation shade from changing color.Always dab at any oily areas with the blotting papers or a clean tissue. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing any oily areas, as this will only ruin your foundation and can lead to breakouts or irritation on your skin.
 You should make sure your skin is hydrated so it does not become dry or flaky. Use a water-based moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated, especially if you have oily skin. Try to get into the habit of applying moisturizer in the morning and at night so your skin stays hydrated.Skin that is dehydrated can end up producing too much oil, leading to oily skin. Oily skin can then cause a reaction with foundation that can lead to a change in the shade.
 If you notice that your foundation continues to appear orange despite adjusting your foundation shade or type, you may need to switch to a different brand. Try several different brands to find the one that is right for you.


Finding the right foundation for your skin can be tricky, so do not be afraid to ask a salesperson for help. You may also want to ask for samples of different foundations and test them all out to find the right brand and shade for your skin type.

 You'll only need to catch about 100 of them (15-20 minutes). You can drop them for faster experience, or if you need GP for more bait/feathers at higher fishing levels, bank them in Lumbridge.;
, It will require that you buy about 360 fish bait, which you can find at the Port Sarim or at Grand Exchange for bait and fishing rod.
 Head over to the barbarian village and lure fish. You can lure fish at most spots and lure fish, such as on the lumbridge river, which is the easiest spot since it is near logs for cooking and a bank chest for storing.
 Since there is no bank around, dropping the fish is the most efficient method, however loses you money. This will get boring quick, so if you want to, you can go onto the next method. You will obtain a 12.8m profit doing this if you bank them.
 That is one of the easiest strand, and it gives 120 XP per catch. Before fishing monkfish you must have completed Swan Song. After the quest start fishing them at around level 75 up until level 99. This is also one of the best ways to make money.
 You can fish them at level 90 for good money at about 38k XP per hour, and they fish at about the speed of sharks. World 84 is suggested to fish these as it is the unofficial world for rocktails. You can also fish cavefish at level 85 for about 25 - 30k XP per hour and decent money.
 Known to be the best fishing experience, this requires Barbarian training, which can be started at Otto's Grotto. At level 80 (which is the recommended level to fish this at), each full inventory takes about 2 minutes, each giving about 1500 XP. However, to fish all of these, you need at least level 45 Agility & level 45 Strength.

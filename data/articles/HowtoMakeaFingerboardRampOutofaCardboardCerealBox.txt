 There are no set measurements for the box. It depends on how big you want your ramp.;
,, Cut up the right creased side of the face of the box until the bottom scissor tip hits the top of the box.
 You should now have a flap that was once the face of the box.
 Now the flap should look longer than the box connected to it.
 The box should be able to stand on its own and you should have a basic box ramp.


To give it a more stable look, lay the ramp on a piece of spare cardboard that's bigger than the ramp itself.
 Remove the ramp from the cardboard.
, You should then have a more sturdy ramp.
 Nothing puts your new ramp through its paces like a test run. Use your fingerboard to jump off it, and if everything is ready to go, you can start using your ramp for tricks.

 When you get close enough to the dog make a slip lead with your leash and place it over the dog’s head. Use this new lead to direct the dog back to safety. If it is your dog don’t bother making collar adjustments at this point; wait until you are back in a secure location., If you are without a leash, the dog has long hair, and it is acting overly friendly you may be able to reach down and gently place your hand on its fur. Use your hand to exert slight pressure to direct the dog back to a safe direction.


With a small dog you may just be able to pick it up. However, if this is a new dog to you make sure that it is not acting aggressively before you try to lift it or you may get bitten.
 As you are securing the dog and making your way back, place a couple of treats on the ground in front of the dog. This will encourage them to keep moving and will associate their capture with positive memories instead of fearful or negative ones., If you must travel by car with the dog, gently load it into the backseat. Try to keep an eye out for any signs of agitation, such as growling. You should also note that if your dog likes riding in the car you can sometimes capture them by simply driving up and saying, “Get in!”, If you are walking home with the dog, just try to keep a moderate pace. If you go too slow, the dog may get restless and try to run again. If you go too fast, you may trigger the chase or hunting instinct as well. Aim for a brisk, determined walk.

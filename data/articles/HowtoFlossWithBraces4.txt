 If normal flossing hurts, a smooth and sometimes spongy dental tape might not. Dental tape is a special type of floss that's especially thin and wide — almost like a small ribbon. Dental tape is used in the same way as normal floss, but people who have painful teeth or gums often find it to be more comfortable., Proxy brushes are small, flexible, pointed brushes that have bristles that look similar to a pine tree. Their unique shape makes them perfect for cleaning behind braces — simply insert the brush under the wire and between the teeth, then scrub to clean. Proxy brushes aren't available everywhere, so talk to your dentist or orthodontist if you're interested in getting one.You can also use a bit of toothpaste on the proxy brush for a better cleaning.
Proxy brushes aren't intended to be used as a replacement for floss. They can't clean between the teeth as thoroughly as floss can. Instead, they're used along with floss to ensure that the area behind the braces receives enough cleaning.
 An orthodontic brush is a special type of toothbrush with V-shaped bristles. These special bristles help it clean behind braces and other orthodontic appliances, making them a big help when it comes to keeping your teeth clean.As with proxy brushes, orthodontic brushes are meant to be used with floss — not instead of it.

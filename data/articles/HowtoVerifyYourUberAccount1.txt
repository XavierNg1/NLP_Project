 While rare, you may be unexpectedly prompted to “verify” your payment method while making a reservation. This should only happen if there's an issue with the credit card or potential fraudulent activity on the account. No matter the cause, verifying your account by using the app’s built-in camera feature will have you up and running in no time.;
, You will want the app to have a clear, crisp photo of your payment card.
 Once the card is precisely within the boundaries of the green box, the photo will automatically snap.
 The app should automatically fill in the expiration date, but double-check the listed date to make sure it matches what’s on your card. Click “Done” when you are finished.
 Uber may request a photo of your state or country identification card. If so, lay it on a flat surface as you did your payment card, then line it up within the green rectangular boundary. As before, the photo will snap automatically. Click “Done” when you are finished.


Once the appropriate information is attached, Uber will review your account and take the attached information into consideration.
You will be notified via email about the status of your verification. If you need any additional help, email Uber support at support@uber.com.

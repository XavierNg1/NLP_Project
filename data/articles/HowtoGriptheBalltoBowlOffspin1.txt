 An off-spin, or off break, delivery turns from the offside to the leg side when bowled at a right-handed batter, or from left to right as you look down the pitch. That means, it moves into a right-handed batsman and away from a left handed batsman.;
, The grip for spin bowling is very different from seam bowling.

Notice that the seam turns from vertical to horizontal in the grip.
 The middle joints of the index, middle finger and third finger are well spread across the seam. The little finger and thumb are not involved.
 With off spin, you are looking to rotate or spin the ball from your forefinger to your third finger

, The fingers rotate as the ball exits the hand.


This is almost like turning a doorknob as you release it from the front of your hand.
 You should aim to bowl the ball outside the off stump. If you bowl too close to the stumps, the batsman may dispatch your ball to the boundary on the leg side.
 Following the steps above, you should now be able to bowl off-spin and hopefully take some wickets.

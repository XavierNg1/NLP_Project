 This can be in a journal, spiral notebook, or a blank document on your computer--whatever works best for you. List out what you need to get accomplished that day, including any appointments or meetings you may have. What are your goals for the day? Do you want to fit exercise or relaxation time in? What assignments do you absolutely have to finish?;
, At what time should you be done with your first assignment, project or activity today? List each activity, starting with the earliest one, and working your way through the hours of the day. Make sure that you work around any appointments or meetings you have.Of course, everyone’s days are different, so each person’s plan will be different. A basic plan could look something like this:


9:00 to 10:00am: Get to the office, check email, send out responses

11:30 to 12:30pm: Project #1
12:30 to 1:15pm: Lunch (eat healthy!)
1:15 to 2:30pm: Review project #1, meet with Sam and discuss Project #1

, It is important to take a moment after each allotted amount of time to review how productive you were during that time. Did you do everything you needed to get done? Then, give yourself a minute to reset--close your eyes and relax. This way you will be able to effectively transition into the next activity you have to do., When you have finished the majority of your day, take a moment to review how successful you were at sticking to your plan. Were you able to finish everything that you wanted to? Where did you slip up? What worked and what didn’t? What distracted you and how can you keep it from distracting you in the future?

 It's a grey app with gears that you'll likely find on the Home Screen.;
, This option is near the top of the "Settings" page.


On phones that use a U.K. English keyboard, tap Mobile Data.
 You'll see two options listed below this heading: "Current Period," which reflects all data usage since you last cleared your data usage statistics, and "Current Period Roaming," which shows data usage for areas in which your phone wasn't covered by the carrier (e.g., international travel).


"Current Period" data does not automatically reset for your billing cycle. You can reset your data usage statistics by tapping Reset Statistics at the bottom of the page.
 These will be listed beneath the "USE CELLULAR DATA FOR" heading; any app with a green switch to its right is able to use data.


The number below an app's name reflects how many kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), or gigabytes (GB) that app has used since the "Current Period" was last reset.

 This basic information about your company should appear in professional lettering at the top of the page. If you're using word processing software, create a new document and select "header" from the drop down menu to create a header; otherwise, simply type your company's name and center it at the top of the page.


If you don't have a business name, type your first and last name. You may also include your middle initial if desired.
Use Arial, Times New Roman or another professional font for the heading. The font size should be bigger than the size you'll use for the body of the invoice.
 Type the address where you want to receive payment, your business phone number, and your business email address just under your business name. Your contact information should be centered and written in a smaller font than your business name.


If you use your personal phone number and email address as your business phone number and email address, include those.
To make your contact information appear more readable, consider typing it on several lines. For example,

2005 Rodeo Drive



Los Angeles, CA 90010
555-666-1234
junedesign@email.com







, If you have a logo, include it in the header to the left or right of your business name. If your business name is part of your business logo, you can use the logo in place of your name.


It is not necessary to include a company logo, though it can help lend your invoice a professional air.
If you don't have a logo and wish to make one, see How to Make a Personal Logo.

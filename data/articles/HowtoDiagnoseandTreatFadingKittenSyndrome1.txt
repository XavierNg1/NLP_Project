By the fourth week it should reach standard adult levels of between 100.4 and 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (38 to 39 degrees Celsius).  ;
, By three days of age, a kitten should be able to roll over if it’s placed on its back. By two weeks of age, it should be able to support itself on all four limbs and begin to crawl. Failure to reach these milestones could indicate weakness associated with fading kitten syndrome., A healthy kitten’s weight should increase by seven to ten grams per day. You should weigh a newborn kitten twice per day using a precise gram scale.

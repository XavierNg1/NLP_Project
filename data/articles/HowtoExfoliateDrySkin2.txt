 By gently applying a pumice stone to the affected area, you can remove dead skin cells to reveal the soft, beautiful skin underneath. Although effective, keep in mind that this method may cause hair in the exfoliated area to lighten or even become removed completely with sustained use., Lather the area with soap using body wash, preferably with a product that is designed to aid in softening of the skin. Look for products that boast "Dermatologist-Recommended" or those that are specifically designed to treat dry skin.
 When using a pumice stone, use light pressure and quick, brisk strokes on wet skin. You should only use the stone for a minute or two in each affected area. Avoid pressing too hard, since this will lead to sore skin and reddened areas.
 Apply a moisturizing lotion to the affected area. Look for doctor-recommended lotions that are proven to soothe chronically dry skin.

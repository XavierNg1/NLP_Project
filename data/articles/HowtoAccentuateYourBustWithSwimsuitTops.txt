 If you usually wear halter tops, it’s time to switch it up, as halters can often flatten you out. Try switching to a triangle top or a twist bandeau. A triangle top is one of the skimpiest swimsuit tops there are, and they help create the illusion of beautiful cleavage. On the other hand, twist bandeau tops and bandeaus that dip in the middle create curvature up top, creating shape, volume and the illusion of a fuller bust.;
, Add volume to your bustline by choosing swimsuit tops with ruffles (either allover or with delicate tiered layers) or fringe. Add texture with swimsuit tops that have intricate beading, sequins, or beautiful embroidered detail. Finally, go for swimsuit tops with prints and patterns, such as horizontal stripes, paisleys, geometric prints and floral motifs; unlike solid swimsuit tops, tops with busy prints, especially when paired with a dark solid-colored bottom, help accentuate and draw attention toward your top half.
 Swimsuit tops with lightly padded cups will always help add a bit of volume to your bust, making them perfect for women with smaller cup sizes. Some padded swimsuit styles feature removable padding, while others feature specially designed booster padding to help lift you up. For even more shape, try swimsuit tops with molded cups. Molded cups are similar to padding in that they add volume; however, they’re a bit firmer so they help add some much-needed shape to your bustline.

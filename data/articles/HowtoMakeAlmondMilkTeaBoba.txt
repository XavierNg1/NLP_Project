Do not buy quick-cooking boba, for best results. This tapioca is usually used as a thickener for soups, casseroles and stews.;
, In most cases, the process will involve boiling the boba until soft. The following directions may be similar to those on the package:


Pour 2 cups (473ml) of water into a small saucepan. Add a stick of dried brown sugar to the water or approximately 1/4 cup (47g) of brown sugar. Stir until dissolved. Heat to a boil. The sugar will make the boba taste better. You can also add simple syrup to the boba while they are cooling.
Add 1/4 cup (38g) of dried tapioca pearls to the water. Stir until they float on the top of the water. This can take up to 2 minutes of sitting in the boiling water.
Turn the heat down to medium. Heat the boba for an additional 12 to 15 minutes. Then, remove the pan from heat, cover them and allow them to sit for another 12 minutes. You can now begin mixing your remaining ingredients for the tea.
 Place 2 bags of green or black tea in a cup. Pour 1 cup (237ml) of water over the top of them to make a strong tea.


Your tea will be diluted with ice and other ingredients, so making the tea stronger than usual will help to create a better flavor.
 Remove the tea bags and place in the refrigerator if you are making other preparations.
 Fill it half full with ice. If your tea and boba is very hot, fill it 3/4 full with ice.
 Strain the boba pearls and pour them into your glass.
 If you want to use regular milk, you can add up to 1 cup (237ml) of milk and 1 tsp. (4.9ml) of almond (orgeat) syrup.
 (4.9ml) of sweetener at a time, to taste. You can use simple syrup, agave nectar, honey or stevia. Mix well.


If you like fruity boba teas, you can also use 1 cup (237ml) of fruit juice instead of milk.
 Drink immediately.

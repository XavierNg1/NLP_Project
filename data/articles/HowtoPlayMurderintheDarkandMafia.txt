 Pass a card out to everyone who is participating in the game. Different cards mean different things.
 usually you want two. Kings are the mafias, Jacks are the doctor/nurse, and a 10 is the sheriff., Don't let players look at each other's cards., have the Mafias wake up and silently point at someone they want to kill. When they are in agreement and the narrator knows who is being killed, have them put their heads back down. Next have the Doctor/Nurse wake up and silently point at someone they want to save. When the narrator knows who is saved, have the Doctor put their head back down. Wake up the sheriff and have them silently pick someone to accuse of being mafia. When the narrator knows, have the sheriff put their head back down., Now is the time where the narrator has to come up with a story about how the person died and whether or not they were saved. If they were not saved they are out of the rest of the game, they cannot participate in any way. They can watch and they don't have to out their head down when the Mafia is choosing someone to kill., After the accusations have been made, have everyone vote (except the dead person(s)) and whoever has the most votes also gets killed. You can have them say what they were (i.e. Mafia, Doctor, Sheriff, Towns-person) but you don't have to if you don't want to.,, Except if you have a large group you can add a Ninja whose card is an Ace. The Ninja is part of the Mafia but they can kill the other members of the Mafia. The only place where the Ninja can be killed is at the trial., there is a 10-30 second grace period where everyone can spread out and the mafia are not allowed to kill anyone until the narrator yells "KILL PEOPLE!",, If they find one, they have to touch the dead body and yell "DEAD BODY!",, They can't talk to the ones who are still playing and can not participate in the trial.,

 Water-based markers are good if you want different parts of the stamp to come out in different colors. You should first make a design plan so you know for sure which colors need to go where on the stamp., Using the water-based markers, color the stamp. You can have some overlap between colors since water-based markers will blend into one another., Once you’re finished coloring the stamp, breathe directly on it to re-wet the ink. The ink should be shiny before you stamp it to ensure all of the color transfers to the cardstock or paper you’re using.

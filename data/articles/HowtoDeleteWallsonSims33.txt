 Sometimes the game won't let you delete a wall if the floor above it has a nearby door or window.If the wall you're trying to delete is actually a foundation, you have to remove everything above it, including light fixtures on the ceiling above it., If there's a glitchy upper story wall that can't be deleted, place a supporting structure underneath it, then try again., Apartments, dorms, and certain other lots may not let you delete walls. If you see a message about the home owners association, you can use cheats to bypass these restrictions:Press Ctrl + â‡§ Shift + C to open the cheat console.
Type TestingCheatsEnabled true and hit enter.
Type RestrictBuildBuyinBuildings off and hit enter.
After changing the walls, we recommend entering TestingCheatsEnabled false. Leaving these cheats enabled can cause bugs.

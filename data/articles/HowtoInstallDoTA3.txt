 The official DoTA website has many download mirrors to provide fast downloads to multiple users at once. Remember the location where you are saving the downloaded file.
 The directory is usually "C:\Program Files\Warcraft III\Maps\Download" unless you had changed it during the game's installation process. The DoTA map has now been successfully installed for your chosen World of Warcraft game but you should make some adjustments before playing it.

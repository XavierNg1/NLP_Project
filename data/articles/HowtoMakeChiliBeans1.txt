 Add the oil to a large skillet with high sides and warm it on medium heat for several minutes.


When ready, the oil should glide easily along the bottom of the pan, but it should not have reached its smoking point yet.;
, Add the chopped onion to the hot oil in your skillet and cook for roughly 2 minutes, or until the onion has softened and just begun to brown at the edges.


Stir the onions continually as they cook.
Do not allow the onions to burn.
 Stir the canned kidney beans and canned tomatoes into the skillet, mixing the new ingredients well so that the beans, onions, and tomatoes are all evenly distributed.


The kidney beans should be drained and rinsed before you add them, but you should add the full contents of the canned tomatoes, including the liquid.
 Add the tomato paste, golden syrup, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper, and chili powder to the contents of the skillet. Mix thoroughly so that all of the ingredients are evenly combined.


Note that golden syrup can be difficult to find. If you do not have it, you can substitute two parts light corn syrup plus one part molasses or equal parts honey and corn syrup., Turn the heat up to medium-high until the beans reach a steady boil.


Stir frequently to prevent the beans from burning.
 Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the beans sit at a mild simmer.


Leave the skillet uncovered.
Stir the beans occasionally as they simmer to prevent sticking or burning.
 These chili beans can be enjoyed alone, over rice, or used as the base of a quick chili recipe.

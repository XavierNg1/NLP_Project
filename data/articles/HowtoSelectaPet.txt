 Is it because you are lonely and want some company? Is it because you love animals? Or is it another reason? You want to make sure you don't want an animal for the wrong reasons.;
, What is your favorite animal? Do you like birdwatching? Then a parakeet or cockatiel may be the right pet for you. Do you enjoy cats? Do you want a low-maintenance pet?

, If you have never had a pet before, you might have allergies. It would be an awful disappointment if you discovered you were allergic after you bonded with your new pet. Talk with your doctor about getting tested for pet allergies.
 Once you have decided what pet you want, another difficult decision is where to obtain your pet. If you are getting a fish, reptile, or amphibian, the best choice is a well-maintained store or breeder. You can also obtain these kind of pets online, but that probably isn't the best idea, as you would not know where they came from. If you are getting a cat or dog, the best place to obtain one would be an animal shelter or a breeder. When you adopt a cat or dog from a shelter, you are saving that animal's life.
 Congratulations, you have just made an important decision! Enjoy your new pet.

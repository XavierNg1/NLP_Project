 To do this, make the whole number the numerator of a fraction. Make the denominator 1.For example, if you are calculating 7รท34{\displaystyle 7\div {\frac {3}{4}}}, you would first change 7{\displaystyle 7} to 71{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{1}}}.
;
, The reciprocal of a number is the inverse of the number. To find the reciprocal of a fraction, reverse the numerator and denominator.For example, the inverse of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} is 43{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{3}}}.
 To multiply fractions, first multiply the numerators together. Then, multiply the denominators together. The product of the two fractions equals the quotient of your original division problem.For example, 71ร43=283{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{1}}\times {\frac {4}{3}}={\frac {28}{3}}}


, If you have an improper fraction (a fraction with a larger numerator than denominator), your teacher may require you to  change it to a mixed number. Usually your teacher will require you to  reduce proper fractions to lowest terms.

For example, 283{\displaystyle {\frac {28}{3}}} simplified to a mixed number is 713{\displaystyle 7{\frac {1}{3}}}.

 You can use your standard SMS app to send yourself an email.;
, Enter your full email address in the "Recipient" field where you would normally enter the wireless number.
 Tap the "Attach" button in your messaging app to browse your phone for an attachment. You can attach a single image or video as long as it isn't too big for a standard text.
 Tap the send button in your messaging app to send it to your email. It should appear in your inbox in a few moments.


If the text does not appear in your inbox, and you're sure you entered the address correctly, then your mobile plan likely does not support MMS. Contact your carrier if you would like to add this feature.

 A carefree attitude is very desirable, because so many people feel stressed and worried. They desire relationships that are positive and worry-free.


Try a joke to break an uncomfortable silence. Laugh regularly without covering your mouth to prove you are someone who knows how to have a good time.;
, Go up to the other person or start a conversation. Don’t be self-deprecating when you are meeting new people.


Say “You caught my eye and I was hoping we’d have a chance to talk.”
If you have tried and the person doesn’t seem interested, have the confidence to walk away. Leave knowing that the person is losing out on a chance to get to know you.
 Pick up on physical and emotional cues, such as body language. Someone who has social smarts and empathy is a more desirable partner, because they will care about others’ feelings.
 Employers, family members, friends and partners appreciate someone who has life goals. Whether it’s work, a charity, a hobby or a culture, passion will set you apart from others., Instead of trying to project characteristics that you think another person would find desirable, try not to change how you act depending upon whom you are around.
 Needy and co-dependent people will turn people off quickly. A man who can cook or a woman with a successful career is very desirable for their independence.

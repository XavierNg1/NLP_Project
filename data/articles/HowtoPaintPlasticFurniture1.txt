 Fill a bucket with hot water. Add an ammonia-based cleaner to help remove mold or mildew on older furniture. Use a sponge to wash the entire surface of the piece you’ll be painting. Spray the furniture with a hose. Use a pressurized nozzle attachment if you have one. Make sure to spray every surface of the furniture from multiple angles to ensure a complete rinse.








To clean brand new plastic, wipe down with a cloth soaked in paint thinner.
An all-purpose cleaner, such as dish soap, will work if the furniture is not too dirty.
Dry the furniture with a cotton towel and allow it to air dry completely. Ensure the furniture is completely dry before proceeding.;
, Choose an area with good ventilation to paint your furniture. A garage with the door open or a flat surface outdoors are ideal. Cover the surface of the ground with a material you don’t mind dropping paint on, such as newspaper or a tarp. Use painter’s tape to cover any surfaces of the furniture you do not wish to paint.








For example, if you only want to paint the surface of a table, tape off the top portion of each leg.
 If the piece you’re working on has been painted before, it will need to be lightly sanded. It is often worth sanding a bare plastic surface, as this will help primer and paint better adhere to the furniture. Use sandpaper or a sanding sponge with fine -grit to gently brush the entire surface.








Test your sanding material in an inconspicuous spot on the furniture. Reduce pressure or use sanding equipment with a finer grit if any visible scratches appear.
After sanding, wipe down the surface of the piece with a tack cloth to remove dust.Skip to priming if the furniture is already smooth. Old furniture that has sat in the sun may be ready to paint after cleaning and drying. New plastic furniture will likely benefit from a light sanding.

 30 minutes or so before applying treatment, take 1-2 regular strength pain relief pills. Advil or Ibuprofen are perfectly acceptable anti-inflammatories that will decrease the pain of the procedure. While freezing off a wart is not an unbearable pain, you can make the procedure as pleasant as possible., You can purchase a home cryotherapy kit, usually sold for under $20, at most drug stores.Follow the instructions on your bottle if you are performing at home. Usually, there is a small, tipped prod or swab that must be chilled. You then touch this to the verruca for 2-3 seconds. While most home cryotherapy kits work the same way, be sure to read the specific instructions on your kit in order to get the best results.


You will feel a sharp, pinch-like pain for 3 seconds or so, but after that the pain should fade. After 10-15 minutes you will likely feel nothing but light numbness.
If you have a low pain tolerance, sit down to perform the procedure. While fainting is uncommon, you want to make sure you don't hit anything if you feel woozy.
 After freezing, a scab will form over the verruca. You may even have a small blister develop. Use sterile gauze to cover up the verruca, and make sure that it is not draining or bleeding.


If you get a blister, and it breaks, carefully wipe up and contain the fluid. It may contain the wart virus.While you can swim and continue normal activity after cryotherapy, avoid using a hot tub, as it contains specific bacteria that can cause infections in the wart.
 Only small warts can be removed with just one freezing. More often than not you'll need several treatments. Be sure to keep the scab and any blisters properly cleaned and covered in between treatments to avoid infection.


See a doctor if you have bleeding, discharge, numbness lasting more than 2-3 days, or swelling consistent with an infection.

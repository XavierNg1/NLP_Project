 If your relationship has you feeling stuck, then improving your autonomy can help. One simple way to do this is to spend more time with your friends away from your significant other. This will allow you to feel like you have more independence and that may improve things at home.

Try setting aside one nigh per week to have a girl’s or guy’s night. Go out with your friends and focus on having fun with them.
 Another way to feel more autonomous is to spend time on you hobbies or other interests. Make sure that you set aside at least a few hours every week to do something that you want to do.

For example, if you like to go biking, but your partner does not, then go for a bike ride on your own. Don’t let your interests fall off the radar just because your partner does not share them.
 Learn to tell your partner “no” if you do not want to do something. This will also help to prevent resentment from building in your relationship, which can cause an unpleasant dynamic between you and your partner.

You don’t have to provide an elaborate excuse for why you don’t want to do something either. Just be direct and keep it simple. For example, if your partner wants you to come out with him and you are not feeling up to it, then just say something like, “Not tonight. I am tired.”

, If you feel stuck in a relationship and you feel that the relationship is worth saving, then you might consider working with a therapist. A therapist can help you and your partner to develop better communication skills and improve the overall quality of your relationship.


If your partner is unwilling to see a therapist with you, then you could also go on your own. Working with a therapist can help you to determine what actions you can take to improve your relationship situation, as well as any other areas of your life that are causing you to feel stuck.

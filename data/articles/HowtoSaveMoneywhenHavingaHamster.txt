 A simple toilet roll inner cardboard tube is just as good as any commercial toy, maybe even better as the hamster can chew on them, which helps their teeth. If you want, cut a hole in one toilet paper tube, and stuff the other one in that hole to create a maze of tunnels.
 Use one of those cardboard flaps in a box. Just cut it out, and slide it through the bars if you have a wire cage. If not, use non-toxic glue to secure it. If you want the platform to be more secure, glue together two cardboard pieces., A simple stick from an apple tree will be just as good. Wash it, and if you want to, boil it. If there's any lichen on it, don't use it. Bake the stick. Place it on a cookie sheet or tinfoil, and bake it for an hour at 150-200 degrees. If you don't want to do that, just use one of those play blocks that are intended for babies., Paper cups, paper plates, or paper bowls will be just as good. Paper bowls are especially good as your hamster still has room to turn around and move a little while in its hideout., You can use any non-toxic suitably sized toys, or make your own toys out of cardboard, paper cups, wire, and non-toxic glue. If you want, make a small obstacle course by hanging hamster-safe materials from wire!

 To start, you want to get your nails into the right shape. Clip your nails down to your desired length. Then, take a nail file and smooth your nails into a nice rounded shape.For a reverse french manicure, slightly longer nails are usually better. Opt to keep your nails a little on the longer side when trimming them.;
, Fill a bowl with lukewarm water. Soak your nails in the bowl for until your cuticles soften. Then, use a cuticle pusher or the edge of your nail clipper to push back your cuticles.As the half-moon shapes will rest near your cuticles, it's important you push them back when doing a reverse French manicure.
 A base coat will make your chosen nail polish look brighter and more defined. Before you begin applying the colors for your French manicure, carefully paint a layer of clear base coat onto each nail.Allow the base coat to dry completely before proceeding.

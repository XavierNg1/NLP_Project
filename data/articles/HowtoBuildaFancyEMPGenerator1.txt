 This EMP generator will require: a 3V power supply, a 470 ohm resistor, a resistor of resistance R, an LED, a single pole double throw switch (look it up), a length of insulated wire, a big iron nail (the bigger the better), and a super capacitor (available from Maplin for less than a tenner) of capacitance C. Oh, and enough wires and solder/crocodile clips to connect everything together.
 The more turns the better. Strip the insulation from the ends of the wire to allow you to connect it to the circuit., The diagram pretty much says it all., This is what the LED is for: it indicates that the generator is charging. The charging time (in seconds) is about 5RC. This should influence your choice of resistor R. If you are using a 1F capacitor, a ten ohm resistor in place of R will give a charging time of about 50 seconds. If you use the same resistor with a 360F capacitor, it'll take 5 hours to charge. Choose the resistor with care., If you get a really big switch and a servant with a lisp, it's the perfect opportunity to yell, "Igor, pull the switch!"

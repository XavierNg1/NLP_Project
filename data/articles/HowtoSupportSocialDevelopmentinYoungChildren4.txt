 The first day of school is a big step towards becoming a part of society. Children are often anxious because they don’t know what it will be like to be away from home and family every day. The parent can be reassuring and supportive by listening to the child and discussing their fears, while pointing out some of the positive aspects of going to school.
 At the end of the first day of school, the child should be encouraged to talk openly about their day and the parent should listen attentively and comment appropriately. This means that if the child had a great day the parent should rejoice with them.


If the child’s day didn’t go so well, the parent should empathize with the child and help them develop a strategy for making the next day, and all of the following days, better.
 As the child grows, keeping an open line of communication regarding feelings is important for social development. When possible and appropriate, the parent should share their own feelings of sadness, fear, or other emotions that are often hidden, so that the child can more easily understand that everyone has all types of feelings and it is not shameful to express them at appropriate times.

 Do not use soap. Spray the garden ornament using a hose with a spray nozzle attached.;

Lay the garden ornament down, and brush on the concrete stain to the bottom and let it dry.






Spread concrete stain on the rest of the garden ornament when the bottom is dry and you are able to place it back upright. Let this dry.



Create a plan for the paint scheme of your garden ornament before you begin.






Brush all the parts of the garden ornament that you wish to be the same color while you have that paint color available and the paintbrush is full of that color paint.






Clean the paintbrush between colors using tap water or water with a few drops of dishwashing detergent mixed in to it. This is sufficient for cleaning latex paint from the paintbrush, so paint thinner will not be necessary.

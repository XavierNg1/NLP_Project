 Often, the challenge in market sizing problems is addressing various factors that could be called variables, because they may change over time or because they may not be transparent to the business involved in researching market sizing.


Collect your known elements. By understanding what you know, you can work on how to answer what you don't know.
Identify unknowns in a market sizing scenario. Try to isolate the questions that you will need to solve in a market sizing situation. Much like complex math, market sizing includes both static and variable components that work together to provide estimates of a market.;

Show your work. When you are answering market sizing questions, it often helps to let the questioner in on how you're going about solving a specific market problem. For instance, some employers have been known to ask such random questions as how many flights go over a specific city each day. Here, the savvy interviewer will start with basic elements like how many airports are in any given area, and start to estimate unknown variables like how many flights go out of each airport per day.
 It's important to keep in mind that many times there are no right answers for these types of questions, but only an approach that is critical to your value to an employer. In most cases, the interviewers are listening for how you would solve a general problem, evaluating your sense of logic and leadership. Don't be afraid to put your best foot forward as you approach a technical problem with creativity.

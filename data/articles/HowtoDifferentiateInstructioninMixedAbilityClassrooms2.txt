 In a mixed ability classroom, it is inevitable that more advanced students will sometimes complete their assignments earlier than their peers. As a classroom rule, establish acceptable activities for students to work on after completing their assigned tasks. These “anchor activities" could include:Reading
Practicing academic skills (e.g. vocabulary or timetables)
Journal writing

, Provide various options to your class for alternative ways to get help with assignments when you are indisposed or unable to assist. Encourage peer-to-peer consultations, whereby classmates can provide instruction, help to problem-solve, or proofread work for a fellow student who is struggling. In addition, suggest “thinking on paper”- a strategy whereby students brainstorm ideas and work through problems on paper to try to get their minds “unstuck”., Encourage “metacognition” in your classroom– i.e., get students to think about and discuss their learning process. Initiate classroom discussions with your students about how they think they learn best, what types of projects they feel most confident doing, and what they find most challenging in their school lives. Have students brainstorm solutions for different learning issues (e.g. making speeches or oral presentations more comfortable by sitting or standing in a circle and using visual aids).

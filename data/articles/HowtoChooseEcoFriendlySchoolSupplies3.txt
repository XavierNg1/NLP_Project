 Choose a backpack made from recycled or repurposed materials, such as bags made from recycled drink bottles.
 Plastic or PVC pencil cases aren't ideal for the environment. Instead, if you make your own, you can use scrap fabric or repurpose old fabric. Or check out stores that sell things made by Fair Trade communities. There will often be fabric pencil cases made by hand sold in such places. You will be supporting people in need, as well as helping the planet.

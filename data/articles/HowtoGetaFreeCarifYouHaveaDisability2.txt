 If you have a Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in the United Kingdom, part of your money can be used to pay the lease on a car from Motability, as well as providing you with money for gas and expenses. See this page for more information.


Be aware that Motability has been under increased scrutiny lately . Make sure you truly qualify for a car before you apply, in order to avoid a messy situation later.
 With the exception of Free Charity Cars, any of the suggestions are possibilities. You never know who might have a car they're willing to give you, or at least lend to you occasionally. Ask around and see what you can turn up.

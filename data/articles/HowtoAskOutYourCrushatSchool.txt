 Far too often people think that by just being themselves, everything will be all right. If you're around someone that you actually want to date, you won't be yourself when the time comes. You'll be a paranoid stutterer with no confidence.;
, It isn't the end of the world if your crush says no, nor is it if he/she says yes. Take a deep breath, and relax.
 If you think your crush will say yes in an instant and he/she says no, you will be crushed. It will take a lot longer to get over them. If you expect him/her to say no, it won't be a shock.
 If you do this, your crush might be caught off guard and not know how to react. Ease into it. Start off giving them a compliment of some sort.
 Don't make it seem like you're pouring your soul out to them, that just disconcerts them. Say something like "you know, I really like you" in an almost jovial manner. It has a double meaning that you can go back to later.
 If you start getting really serious, your crush might think that's all the relationship will be. If you're happy and make him/her smile, it's a much more promising start.
 You don't need to tell the exact truth, some things are best left for silence or if necessary, a later time. Starting out with a confession is worrying.
 If he/she says no, say "I just thought you ought to know that I like you" or something along those lines. Don't make a big deal out of it and you'll remain friends.
 If you keep on going on about how sorry you are for making things awkward, your crush will be. If you start apologizing, stop! Don't apologize for apologizing either.
 It also isn't just a shrug off. Don't lose hope or get delusional.
 Your crush will like the familiarity. In the evenings or sometime, go and do something as boyfriend and girlfriend.

 A recording device with an external microphone is better than an internal microphone because you may hear the inner workings of the machine, thus making pretty much any EVP impossible to hear.;
, A cemetery, haunted house, or any place that makes you feel uneasy will work. There have also been cases of toys or objects giving off EVP.
 Use your ears to find a quiet location. If there are noises in the background they may interfere with picking out any EVP. Make note of any existing noises in the background (cars, children playing, animals, airplanes, etc) so that you can easily pick them out later.
, If you feel a presence, ask a question (i.e. "Who are you?", "Is there anyone here?", "What is your name?"). These questions may generate a response.
,,,, Software like that can also let you snip the piece you want for easy listening.

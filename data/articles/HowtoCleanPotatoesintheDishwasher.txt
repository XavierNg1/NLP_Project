 If needed, peel your potatoes thoroughly with a potato peeler. This is optional and can be done after you've cleaned the potatoes, but you can also do it ahead of time if you prefer. , Get each potato and insert them in the top rack of the dishwasher. Consider placing the jumbo potatoes near each other, and the smaller ones next to each other to organize them neatly. , Place the dishwasher onto a rinse-only cycle using cold water with no soap or detergent. It's important to use cold water because hot water causes the potatoes to steam slightly, causing them to be soggy once they've been washed and get boiled or baked. If your dishwasher doesn’t have a way to control the temperature, use cold water by making sure there’s no hot water in the tank. Do it right after everybody takes their shower and you’ve done all the laundry that uses hot or warm water, making sure to not use the heat dry setting. If you do end up using hot water, be sure to place the potatoes in the freezer or fridge immediately after they've been cleaned so they can cool off and not steam. , Once the dishwasher has shut off, usually taking about an hour or less depending on your dishwasher, remove each potato out of the top rack. Place each one on your kitchen counter to set aside so you can dry them., Using a small towel or rag, wipe each potato thoroughly until each one is longer wet and is completely dry., Once your potatoes have been cleaned and dried, you can begin using them to make your meal. Enjoy!

 Aquarians think of the "us" and the "we" in all that they do. Keep your belief in others strong as you support charities, humanitarian efforts, group projects and civil movements. Aquarius love to move as a team and they are rather selfless. For this reason, they will jump to fulfill another person's desire if it is possible for them.;
, Aquarians' belief in causes runs deep and your heart and soul need a cause to keep you whole.
 A star sign that values friendship intensely, keep your friends close to you. Aquarians are strictly loyal, they hate betrayal and are not double-minded themselves. If you do leave a friend, keep a plausible purpose for it because inability of finding a good reason is not an Aquarian's trait.
 Aquarians can be flaky and can theorize about life and people without getting involved and truly making a difference. Instead of just talking about what you'd like to do, do it.
 Aquarians can be loners at times because they are ahead of the times. Have faith in what you believe in and accept that you are not so much an outsider as someone able to visualize a better world to come. Keep involved with people by pursuing your vision and try to get others to come along for the ride.

 The power supply you connect your chainsaw to must be of the same voltage. Check your chainsaw’s manual for information if you are not sure about your model’s specifications.Use an extension cord if necessary.
 You can start an electric chainsaw from a seated or standing position as necessary. As you would for a gas-powered chainsaw, check and make sure that the surrounding area is free from people and obstructions. Your body should feel balanced before you begin., The hand guard will be located just in front of the handlebar. Pull it toward you (and the back of the chainsaw) until it clicks. This is a safety feature designed to protect you as you operate the chainsaw, which will not start until the guard is engaged., This is located just above the trigger, on the side of the handle. Use your thumb to depress the switch, and make sure to keep holding it down fully., Use just your index finger to pull the trigger up, but grasp it firmly. Keep holding the lockout. Your chainsaw is now ready to use.

 The truth is that you shouldn't even have a centimeter of water on any floor. The most likely cause for this is a plumbing malfunction (as the weather usually stays outside) and, unfortunately, you’ll need to keep your wits about you., Most likely, these will be high off the ground, and you’ll be able to reach them. But if there are any plugs on the ground, or the water has risen over plug points, get out of there.
, Then call an emergency plumber unless you know exactly what you’re doing. You can’t begin cleaning or draining until the source of the problem is gone. Depending on the length of time your flooring was submerged, you may be able to salvage it.
  But, hire a steam carpet cleaner before it is fully dried or you’ll always have a smell.

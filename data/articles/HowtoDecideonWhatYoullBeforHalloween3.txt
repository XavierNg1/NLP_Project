 You won't be using a princess gown, but you'll be using the normal cheerleader costume (short sleeve short with a little skirt and sneakers). The princess thing will be the tiara.
 Paint your face, arms and legs with the paint.
 They have to be all white, but if you can, try to find a shirt that has the words "Team Zombies" with a zombie, or order it on CustomInk.


If you're afraid of being cold in the middle of the night, get a long sleeve short, and wear jeans underneath the skirt. You don't have to paint your arms and legs if you do this, also.
 You also need pom-poms!

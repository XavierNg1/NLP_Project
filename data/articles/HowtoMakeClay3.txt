 You will need 1 cup (280 grams) of salt and 1 cup (140 grams) of flour. If you wish to add glitter to your clay, you can do so now. Start with 1 teaspoon of glitter. You can use fine, scrapbooking glitter or chunky, craft glitter, but the fine glitter will be easier to blend. Pour everything into a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.
 You will need ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of warm water. If you wish make colored dough, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water at this point.
 Keep kneading until you have achieved a smooth, dough-like texture.


If the dough is too dry, add a little bit more water.
If the dough is too sticky, add some more flour.
 Your clay is now ready to use. You can sculpt little figurines out of it, or roll it out and make ornaments out of it.
 Start by rolling your clay out flat using a rolling pin. Cut your clay into shapes using a craft knife, a cookie cutter, or a drinking glass. If you wish to hang the ornament, poke a hole near the top of the shape using a drinking straw or a toothpick.


Salt dough can make great keepsakes. Press your child's foot or hand into the dough until there is an imprint.
 Transfer your creations onto a baking sheet and bake them in your oven at 212°F (100°C) for three hours. If the dough still hasn't hardened, flip the item over, and bake it for two more hours.

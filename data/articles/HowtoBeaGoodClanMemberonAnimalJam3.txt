 Medicine cat apprentices are important, so there will always be a need for more med cats. A clan couldn't survive without someone qualified and trained by the main medicine cat. Things like attacks from other clans, territorial battles, and illness require medicine cats.
 Medicine cats need special training. They need to know all herbs and what they do to help, collect cobwebs and berries, and their mentor also needs to tell them about poison berries and infected animals (such as rats).
 This is the medicine cat ceremony (ex: use hot sauna at Mt. Shivers or shallow lake at epic wonders as moonpool}. Here is an example of how this tradition goes down:


Medicine Cat: I, (name), medicine cat of ___Clan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice. (He/she) has trained hard to understand the ways of a medicine cat, and with your help (he/she) will serve (his/her) Clan for many moons.
Medicine Cat: ___paw, do you promise to uphold the ways of a medicine cat, to stand apart from rivalry between Clan and Clan and to protect all cats equally, even at the cost of your life?
Apprentice: I do.
Medicine Cat: Then by the powers of StarClan I give you your true name as a medicine cat. ___paw, from this moment you will be known as (new name). StarClan honors your (virtues), and we welcome you as a full medicine cat of (Clan).
The apprentice must drink from the moonpool after this.

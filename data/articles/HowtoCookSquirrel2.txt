 Dredge the squirrel pieces in the mixture, coating them on all sides. Set the pieces on a plate.
 Melt the butter in the pot.
 Let them cook on each side for two to three minutes, until they are completely brown.
 Be careful, since the water will bubble when it hits the hot pot.
 Bring the contents of the pot to a boil.
 Cook the stew until the squirrel meat is tender, about 2 hours. Serve with bread. Eat carefully, since the squirrel pieces have tiny bones.

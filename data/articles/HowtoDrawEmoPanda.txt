 Then draw two little circles spread far apart on the top. Use a compass for the circles for greater accuracy.;
, Make a large, U-shaped half circle directly under the head.
 Draw two rectangles coming off the body shape. Next, curve the edges so that to make the legs appear more circular rather than straight.
 Draw a straight line across the body horizontally just a little below the head.


Then, on either side of the panda, draw two long ovals extending from the bottom of the head to just above the beginning of the legs.
 Also color in the section between the base of the panda's face and the horizontal line.
 Draw a small, upside-down U-shape near the bottom of the head to create the mouth. Draw a small dot for the nose.
 The panda's eyes should be large, as this is what gives the drawing both its cute effect and the emo appearance.


Draw two big circles with a smaller one in between.
Make the smaller circle a bright color or simply leave it white.
For the pupils, draw two more smaller circles near the center. Leave the inside of this circle white.
 When finished, the eye should have a small white dot in the middle, a bright ring around it, and it will be black everywhere else. Play with the placement of the pupil until you get the exact expression you want.

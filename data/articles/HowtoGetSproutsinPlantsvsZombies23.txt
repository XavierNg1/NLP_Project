 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is PvZ 2 with the app icon of a zombie’s face. Tap on it.
 You will see the PvZ 2 Store with all the items for sale under the different tabs.
 There are five different sprout packages available, ranging from 3 sprouts at 20 gems to 50 sprouts at 150 gems.


You cannot buy sprouts with coins or real money.
 Tap on the price button for the sprout package you want to buy. You have to have enough gems to cover the purchase. The number of sprouts bought will be added to your total available sprouts.


If you don’t have enough gems, you can purchase more with real money.

 If you don't feel comfortable in what you're wearing, that will show. Pick something in a color and style you love, and your confidence will shine through. Maybe you love an awesome tankini and shorts, or maybe you like to rock a one piece. Maybe you like short shorts or maybe you prefer board-length shorts. Just pick whatever makes you happy.Try a bright color to really stand out, such as turquoise or hot pink.
Patterns can also add pizazz to your outfit. You could try polka dots, stripes, or even a funky plaid suit.
You could also go classic and simple with a one-piece black suit.;
, If you want to wear makeup to the pool, keep it simple. Most of it is probably going to wash off anyway, so you might as well go light. Skip the foundation altogether, if you use it, and just go with a primer. Any makeup you wear should obviously be waterproof so it doesn't run all over your face. Try a waterproof mascara and a waterproof lipstick in a light color., Once again, if you're getting in the pool, you don't want a super fancy hairdo. You can go for a messy, wavy look by spraying in a texturizer that adds waves. You can also twist your bangs up and then pin them back out of your face. Throw your hair up in a ponytail if that's more your style. If your hair is super short, just go for a wild, natural look, as it will soon be getting wet., When you arrive and leave, it's best to have something besides just your bathing suit on. Plus, there are likely to be games and food, and you'll want to have some clothes on for that. However, you can keep it simple. Throw on a t-shirt over your swim shorts or a coverup dress over your bathing suit, and you're good to go. Add a pair of cool sandals and shades to complete the look.

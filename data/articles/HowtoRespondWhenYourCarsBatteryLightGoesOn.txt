 When your battery light comes on, it sometimes results in a very simple solution.;
, Check the gauge that indicates the vehicle's state of charge, called the voltmeter (be aware that not all cars have this gauge). Often, this gauge has a picture of a battery on it. If it is extremely high or low, it's something to worry about. Normal operating range is 12 to 14 volts. If it is measuring about the same as it always does, you probably don't have a major problem.
 Examples are the radio, fan blower, defroster, dome light. Refrain from using power windows, if possible.
 You may not be able to restart the motor if you turn the car off. If there is an alternator failure you will be running on the car's battery which may last about a half hour. As your car's engine runs, the battery may continue to charge, depending on the failure. Additionally, one of the biggest battery drains is starting your car. By not having to start the engine after shutting it off, you're not using any additional power that might be running low.
 Ask someone to help you test your alternator. If your alternator is fine, ask them to check your battery. The light could be an indicator of a battery going bad or a faulty sensor.
 If they appear corroded or loose, that might be your problem. Clean the cables and the battery terminal with a wire brush. Tighten the cables on your battery terminals.
 If it is loose, tighten it or buy a new one. If it is cracked, buy one immediately. If your alternator belt breaks, your car will not charge.
 On newer cars, this will help your car reset its computer system. After it has reset, the battery light may go off. It may have just been a temporary trigger or sensor. If it returns you, will need to have it looked at by a mechanic.
 Your car's computer system has many sensors and warning indicators. It is likely a computer system issue.

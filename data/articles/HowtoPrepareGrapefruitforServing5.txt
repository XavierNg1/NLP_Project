 Half the grapefruit at its center through the “equator”. This should give you two equal grapefruit halves., Put the manual juicer on top of a glass with the pointed side up. Take a grapefruit half and start to rub it into the pointed end of the juicer. You should see juice being released. Keep turning the grapefruit around in circular motions as you gently press it against the juicer. You may need to use multiple grapefruits to get the amount of juice you want.
 After you have released all the juice from both grapefruit halves, take a strainer and pour the grapefruit juice into another glass. This should remove any seeds or large pieces of pulp from the juice. Drink the grapefruit juice straight from the glass.

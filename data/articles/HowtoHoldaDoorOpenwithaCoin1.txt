 Canadian/US Quarter or 20/50 Euro Cents work well. Avoid using small coins like pennies or dimes as they do not have enough surface area to hold the door open. You may need more than one coin if you're unable to jam the door open with a single coin.


If you're in another country like Australia or South Korea, use the largest and thickest coin possible.;
, To start, open the door slightly. Open it just enough that you can fit a coin between the edge of the door near the hinges and the door frame. You may want to have someone hold the door open for you. It can be difficult to hold the door open on your own, and you do not want to prop the door open with another object. If the door is propped open too wide, it may be difficult to properly insert the coin.
 To start, you'll want to insert one coin in the door's upper hinge. Take your coin and position it just below the top hinge of the door.Place the coin between the edge of the door and the door frame. About half the coin should be between the door and frame.
Move the coin upward slightly and push it into the door's hinge. Let the door close. With luck, the door should be propped open just slightly to the point you can push the door open without during the handle.
 If your door's hinge is wider, the coin may slip out. Therefore, you may need to secure coin in the door frame with a piece of tape. Go for masking tape or duct tape over scotch tape, as these types of tape tend to be stronger. Push the coin back between the door and door frame, and slide it into the hinge. Once the coin's in place, tape it down with a strip of tape.
 Depending on the build of your door, this method may not work. If you're unsuccessful, you can try securing a coin in the bottom hinge as well. Follow the same method as you did when placing a coin in the top hinge. If this still does not work, you should try another method. No method will work on every type of door.

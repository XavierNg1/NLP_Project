 Never charge overnight or over the course of a day. This will leave your battery with around 1/4 to 1/2 of battery depending how long you have until you go to work or such.;
, This way, you aren't tempted to use it. If you are on a bus or carpooling, keep it in a bag or purse. DO NOT take out your phone unless of an emergency.
 Limit yourself to 5 minutes on each hour. With this method, if you spend too much time on it, your battery will die and you won't have it for the rest of the day.

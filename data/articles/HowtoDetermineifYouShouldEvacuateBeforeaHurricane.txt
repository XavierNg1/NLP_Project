 Definitely leave if they make an order for evacuation; such an order should never be ignored.On some occasions, you may be ordered to stay at home, where officials consider that this is safer than leaving.;
,, If you live on a barrier island, and your portion of the island is known for storm surge damage, evacuate ahead of a hurricane.
 If your home lacks hurricane reinforcing, is a mobile, manufactured or modular home, and it's in a coastal or storm surge area, consider evacuating.


Realize that even if your house is considered safe and weathers the hurricane, the aftermath of a hurricane in your area may be devastating. Getting out and about may be very difficult and even dangerous. Loss of power and water, and an inability to get supplies, can make staying treacherous––survival is longer than the actual storm event.
 Where possible, evacuate the persons who are most vulnerable. This includes babies, children, teens, the frail elderly, pregnant women, persons with an illness and people with high levels of anxiety.

 This is the only version of Spotify that allows you to share music from your laptop account to your mobile phone or tablet for free and wirelessly.
 On an apple product, this will be the iTunes store. For a Droid product visit the play store. Here you can download the Spotify app by following the directions.
 You donâ€™t have to have the app downloaded on your phone or tablet to use spotify as long as you are connected to a wi-fi source. This will allow you to visit their website and stream live music from there.

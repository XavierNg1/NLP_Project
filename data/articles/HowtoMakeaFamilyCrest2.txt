 You'll need items such as construction paper, stickers, markers, glue, and scissors.
 This activity is meant to help bring your family together and brainstorm about what makes you unique., That is, talk about what makes you special. Do you like to laugh? Are you a nature-focused family? Maybe you have three dogs.
 That is, maybe if you like to laugh, you can include part of a favorite joke in your coat of arms, such as a banana peel. If you love nature, you could include a favorite flower or tree, and dogs could easily be part of a coat of arms.
 Most coat of arms use a shield, but you can use other shapes, such as triangles or squares., Each person can design a symbol to go on the coat of arms. You can also let someone design the mantling and the helm. The mantling is a decorative piece that drapes above the shape, such as leaves or ribbon, while the helm is the centerpiece of the mantling. The helm is often a knight's helmet, but you can use whatever you want.


Don't forget the crest for the helm. The crest can be another symbol that represents your family.
 If you want the shield or shape to have more than one color, divide it up and color it in. Because this activity is just meant to be for fun, you can use whatever colors your family likes best.


Traditional colors for a shield are exclusively red, blue, purple, green, and black, with silver and gold as metals.However, traditional shields also allow for "natural" colors to create certain symbols., Glue each piece on to create a complete crest. Often, the shield has a centerpiece, called a charge, but you can also put several symbols inside the shape, especially if you divided it into sections.


You can also create supporters, which go on either side of the shield. Generally, these are two animals that help create balance within the design.
 If your family has a motto, you can create a banner to go across the top of the crest. Write the motto on the banner.
 Place that banner across the top of the crest.

White acrylic paint
Patterned scrapbook or contact paper
Ribbon
A hot glue gun and glue sticks
Scissors.
 This is not required if you want to keep the natural terra cotta color.Use a sponge paintbrush for fast painting.
Paint only the outside of the terra cotta pot. This will be the base of your cake stand.
Paint the entire saucer. This will be the plate of your cake stand.
Let the paint dry completely before moving on to the next step.
 Make sure it is centered.Use a generous amount of hot glue.
Be careful when using hot glue. It is easy to burn yourself.
Wipe away any excess glue from the seam where the items are glued for a more polished look.
Let the glue harden and dry before moving the cake stand.
 You can use contact paper or scrapbook paper.Cut out the shape of the bottom of the saucer with paper.
You can use the rim of the saucer to trace the shape.
Glue or use the sticky side of contact paper to attach the paper to line the saucer.
 You will place this along the rim of the saucer.You can also attach ribbon along the bottom edge of the flower pot base.
Use a ribbon that complements the color of your paper lining.
Let the glue dry before using your cake stand.

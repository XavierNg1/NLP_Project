 While trying to send messages during a time of political turmoil, Mary, Queen of Scots, used symbols as a substitute code for English letters and common words.Some features of Mary's code you might find useful for your own crypto-education include:


The use of simple shapes for high frequency letters, like Mary's use of a circle for the letter /A/. This saves time while encoding.
Common symbols used as part of the new code language, like Mary's use of "8" as code for the letter "Y." These can confuse code breakers who might interpret this as a number and not a code symbol.
Unique symbols for common words. In Mary's day, "pray" and "bearer" received unique symbols, but these were more common then than they are today. Still, using symbols for frequent words and phrases saves time and adds complexity., Code phrases can collapse a lot of meaning into a single phrase. Even many kinds of military alert, like the DEFCON system, are simply well-known codes for a state of defense readiness.Come up with suitable code words/phrases in your everyday life.


For example, instead of saying "I've got to run to my locker" among your friends, you might use the code word "Sloppy."
To let your friends know that the person you want to date has entered the room, you might say the code phrase, "My cousin Bruce likes hockey, too."

, Books are relatively easy to come by. If a book has been decided upon as the key to a code, when you receive a message you can go to a bookstore or library to look up the key to decode it.


For example, you might decide on using Frank Herbert's Dune, with code numbers representing the page, line, and number word starting from the left.


Encoded Message: 224.10.1 ; 187.15.1 ; 163.1.7 ; 309.4.4

Decoded Message: I'm hiding my words.


Different editions of books might use different page numbers. To ensure the right book is used as a key, include publication information, like edition, year published, and so on with your book key.

 Sometimes we can’t help someone, or at least not in the way they need. If they push back aggressively, or are taking too much from you in time, effort, etc., it may be time to step back. Even if they do accept your help, there’s only so much you as a friend can do. Sometimes therapy and medication is needed, and a friend can’t offer that.

Keep in mind that you can say no if you feel that someone is taking advantage of your kindness.
If you are worried about a friend or family member’s well-being, then you might talk to someone who can help, such as a teacher or a counselor.
 This means neither overstepping in helping them nor allowing them to overstep in asking for help, assuming they do. This is especially important with a proud person, as helping them too much may make them feel like you pity them or that you feel sorry for them. Instead, when possible, ask how you can help, and don’t attempt to do more than is requested.For example, if the person has reassured you that he or she is okay, then you should not keep pressing the person to accept your help. You might simply say something like, “I am always here for you if you need my help. Just let me know.”

, As much as you want to help them, it is important to give them the space to make their own decisions. Ultimately, it is their life, and they have the choice to get help when they need it or to reject that help. It might hurt, but being a friend sometimes means stepping back and letting your friend choose their own path.

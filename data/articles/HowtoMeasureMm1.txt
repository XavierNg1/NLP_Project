If a metric ruler is too small, you could also use a meter stick. The small, unnumbered lines on a meter stick that fall in between the numbered lines should still be millimeters.
Note that each 1 cm also equals 10 mm.;
, Position the ruler so that its “0” edge is evenly lined up and parallel to the starting point of the edge or line you want to measure.


The ruler might not have a "0" marked on it. If this is the case, know that the "0" edge is simply the edge that comes directly before the marked "1" on the ruler.
 Find the point at which the edge or line you are measuring ends. Locate the numbered centimeter mark just before it, then multiply that centimeter number by 10 to determine how many millimeters it equals.


Make sure that the ruler is straight and flat against the line you are measuring.
If the edge ends on a marked number line, you can multiply that value by 10 and get your final answer.


Example: The length of a line measures from the 0 edge to the 2 mark, so that line is 20 (2 * 10) mm long.
, The sum of your converted centimeter value and your extra millimeter value will equal the total number of millimeters in length for your measured edge or line.



Example: A line extends from the 0 mark to the fifth line past the 7 mark, so its length is 75 mm.

7 * 10 = 70
70 + 5 = 75

 It can be scary, but you need to be able to gauge exactly how much you have to do.;
, Dedicate at least one hour a day to doing old homework, and you'll probably be caught up in at least a week.
 Make a pact with yourself not to get any farther behind while you work on catching up. Set aside time every day to gather all upcoming assignments and make a detailed plan for how you will complete them. This is showing responsibility and will get you motivated to get caught up. This is also helpful so you don't get behind anymore.
 Explain what may have lead you to fall behind and ask what you can do to get caught up. Your teacher may be able to connect you additional resources, like tutoring, check-ins, counseling, or other help.
 Is anyone else having trouble? Who might be able to help you? It's worth it to put yourself on the line to get this extra support. You might realize that the class is hard for everyone, which can make you feel less alone.
 Ask a teacher or a friend to tutor you after school or on weekends. This can get you caught up with everyone. This is really helpful if you're having difficulties in school or if you just need the extra help. Some schools even offer special tutors to help students.
 There are many people out there who can give you the support you need to make it through a tough class -- parents, teachers, counselors, or even friends. Don't be ashamed about falling behind. It happens to everyone, and the important thing is that you are dealing with it now.

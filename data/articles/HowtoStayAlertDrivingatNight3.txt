 Cruise control is a convenient feature offered on many automatic transmission vehicles, but you should only use it in the day time when you’re not sleepy in the slightest. This automated feature creates what is called a reduced driver workload—that is, it allows you to pay less attention to the mechanisms and process of driving.This reduced workload can mean that your mind wanders more easily and does a worse job driving than it would under normal, non-automated conditions.

The adverse effects of cruise control appear most frequently in male drivers under the age of 40, so be especially vigilant if you belong to this demographic., Bright dashboard lights can cause unnecessary eye strain when driving at night, which in turn can make you tired more quickly.You can soften this glare by turning the dimmer switch—usually located near the headlight knob—down until the dashboard shine less brightly than outside traffic markers reflecting your headlights.

You can also adjust your outside mirrors so that they face downward in order to keep the direct glare of following vehicles’ headlights out of your eyes. It might seem counterintuitive, but it actually allows you to monitor overtaking vehicles from the reflection of their headlights on the pavement.
Also be sure to eliminate other light sources from within the vehicle. If your passenger must read or navigate, a flashlight or book light will be less distracting than the vehicle's dome light. All video screens should be in the back seat., It might seem like gabbing with a friend or catching up with a relative can be a good way to engage your mind and resist drowsiness. In fact, though, studies have shown that speaking on the phone—even if it’s a hands-free device—can interfere with driving performance. This is because you’re asking your brain to complete two tasks concurrently, and no one can do two things well at the same time.

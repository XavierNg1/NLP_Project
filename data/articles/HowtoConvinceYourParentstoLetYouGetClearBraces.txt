 These aren't exactly facts, these are about how clear braces make you feel. You could write about:


Fear of being made fun of. IE being called "brace face".
How you would feel about the way you look with clear braces vs metal braces.;
, Your feelings only make up half the argument, and researching clear braces shows maturity and only proves how much you want them. Be sure to look up things like:


Maintenance of clear braces vs metal braces.
The costs compared to metal braces.
Durability.
Effectiveness.
 After research, some issues may come up, such as cost, that could turn you away from clear braces. Make sure it is what you really want.
 You've got the facts and you've made the decision. Now you must organize it so your parents know exactly what you're talking about.
 It is usually best to talk to them face to face. However, some parents aren't the listening type. If you know your parents won't listen to you, consider writing a well-written letter to show that you mean what you've decided.
 It is important that they are in a good mood, even if you are just giving them a letter. If they are in a bad mood, they will most likely not read it at all.
 You don't want to launch into saying, "I want clear braces." You could start off by saying, "I have something important I want to talk to you about," and then continue with, "it's about my teeth."


To those writing a letter: it's the same thing. Don't begin with "I want and here's why", gradually lean into your desire for clear braces and then transition into your feelings and the facts.
 You should already know what you're saying, so the conversation will go smoothly.
 They may not be ready to say yes or no right away, so leave the question open for them to think about. If you have done well, they will most likely say yes.

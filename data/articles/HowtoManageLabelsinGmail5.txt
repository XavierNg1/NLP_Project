 If the label you’re looking for isn’t displayed as a clickable link, you’ll find it underneath the “(#) more” heading, where (#) is the number of additional labels not being displayed.
 This supplies a menu that allows you to hide, rename or delete labels. You can also use this menu to add color to labels.

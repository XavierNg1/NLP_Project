 Chilis in adobo sauce are an ingredient commonly used in Mexican and Asian cooking. To find them look in the Mexican aisle of your grocery store, near the canned jalapenos. The chipotle chilis are prepared by the drying and smoking of jalapenos., After opening your can of chipotle chiles, fish out two. Using a glass cutting board to prevent any absorption of heat, finely dice and chop your chiles.

If youâ€™d prefer a very fine mix, grind your chiles with adobo sauce in a food processor. This will turn them into a paste.
 Mix your chiles, adobo sauce, and prepared mayo until an even, salmon-like color. Once completed, store in an airtight container.

To jazz up the look of your mayo, try garnishing it with a finely chopped chile, or a sprinkle of cayenne powder.

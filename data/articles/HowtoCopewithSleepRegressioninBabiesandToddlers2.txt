 Infants may experience sleep regression as a result of a growth spurt. This means they could wake up hungry in the night. In order to avoid this, try feeding your child more throughout the day. In some rare cases, you may need to return to giving a late night feeding.Keep in mind this additional feeding is just temporary.
Talk with your doctor and keep track of the amount you are feeding the baby.
 If your toddler begins to cry in the middle of the night and usually they sleep through the night, you should check on the child. It is important to make sure that the child is not ill. Alternatively, they may be having a bad dream and just need to know that you are close by.Once you have ruled out an illness say “It is sleepy time, close your eyes and go to sleep.” This will reassure them of your presence without providing them with too much additional attention.
 When you check on your toddler in the night, it is important that you keep the visit short and to the point. Do not try and comfort your child until they fall back to sleep or provide them with toys, milk, or a story. This can easily develop into a habit because your child will realize that if they cry in the night they get extra parental attention., For young infants, sleep regression can result from new developmental changes, such as teething. They are not able to self-soothe, and as a result, you may need to comfort your child to help them get back to sleep. Try rocking the baby or rubbing their back while saying soothing words., You can help your baby sleep by giving them time to practice new movements during the day. For example, young babies are eager to learn to roll, sit, and crawl. By giving your child time to practice new movements you will exhaust them mentally and physically allowing them to sleep better.These activities will depend upon your child’s development stage, but may be contributing to a sleep regression.

 Industrial fluid stains (like inks or some household chemicals) can be a major threat to the look of your carpet. Fortunately, like most other types of stains, they can be lessened considerably if you promptly place a paper towel over the affected area to blot up the fluid.
 Once you've gotten as much of the initial stain blotted as you can, apply a dab of rubbing alcohol or a non-oily hairspray to the affected area. The chemicals in these compounds will loosen the ink or fluid's hold on the carpet, making it much easier to extract the remaining stain.
 With the stain lifted, running a vacuum over the stained area will pick up particles and do away with anything that's been sufficiently affected by the chemicals you've applied.
 Add some light detergent onto the remaining stain and let sit for a minute. Following that, place a washcloth atop the area and let it soak up the stain. If you aren't seeing much progress with the blotting this time around, try adding some more rubbing alcohol and resetting the washcloth.
 Industrial fluid stains are varied in their severity and intensity; as such, it may take a few times before the issue is handled to your own satisfaction. Continue alternating between blotting and adding solution until the stain has been fixed.

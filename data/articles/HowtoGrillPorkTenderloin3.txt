 If you'd rather grill up individual portions to account for particular tastes, want to make grilled tenderloin sandwiches, or you just want to experiment with a few different seasonings, you can remove the tenderloin from the marinade and slice into portions before grilling. Slice 3/4 to an inch thick.


Consider pounding out the steaks to about a half-an-inch, using a meat tenderizer. Place each steak under a clean towel, then use a tenderizing hammer to bang out the steaks and flatten them. In the Midwest, pork tenderloins are pounded out to almost comically-large sizes, roughly the size of a plate. Put together on a bun, the resulting sandwich should resemble nothing so much as the planet Saturn. It's a state fair classic.
Cutting into steaks and pounding out the meat should be done after the meat has been marinaded, just before you're about to grill them. Don't try to marinade pounded-out tenderloin.
 Before grilling, sprinkle your desired seasoning on both sides of the steaks, or simply dress them with a brushing of olive oil, salt, and pepper for a simple and perfect start to a tenderloin sandwich.
 Lots of flavor comes from searing the meat and creating nice grill marks on the outside of the steaks, then moving the steaks away from direct heat and covering the grill to let them cook for a few more minutes to finish the inside of the meat.


Cook for approximately 4 to 6 minutes on each side. If you want to check the temperature, it should be about 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) when it's time to remove the steaks from the grill.
 After your tenderloins rest for 10-15 minutes, under tin foil, serve them sandwich-style on buns topped with dill pickle, brown mustard, and raw white onion. That's eating.

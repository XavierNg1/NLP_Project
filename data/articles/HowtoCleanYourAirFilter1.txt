The filter will be housed in a rectangular or round box.If you cannot locate the air filter under the hood, refer to the instructional manual that came with your car for this information.;

Use a screwdriver to remove the wingnuts or remove the clamps with your fingers. Then, pull the filter out of the housing.Pull the filter out carefully as it will likely be covered in dirt and dust.

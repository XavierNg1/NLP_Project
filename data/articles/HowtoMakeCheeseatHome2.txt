 You must use whole milk for this recipe. Non-homogenized milk gives the most flavor, but homogenized milk will work. Do not use milk labeled ultra-pasteurized or UHT.
 Stir in the acidic ingredient while you test the milk with a waterproof pH meter. Continue to the next step once the pH reaches 5.9–6.0.Lemon juice adds a tangy citrus flavor. Fresh lemon juice has better, cleaner flavor than bottled juice.
Distilled vinegar is more precisely controlled, giving you predictable results each time you follow the recipe.
Baker's citric acid adds less flavor than either of the other options, which some people prefer. Look for it at a grocery store or baking supply store.
 Slowly heat the acidified milk to 176–185ºF (80–85°C), while stirring constantly. It is very important to constantly stir the milk or it will burn. Keep it at this temperature for 15–30 minutes.Stop stirring once the milk separates into solid curds and liquid whey. Take care not to break the curds into smaller pieces.









An infrared thermometer is a reliable way to measure the milk temperature.
 Spoon the curds onto a thick, fine cheesecloth or muslin handkerchief. Squeeze the cloth around the curds to get most of the moisture out.









You can use a draining spoon if you don't have cheesecloth, but you'll lose some of the curds.
Optionally, you can rinse the curds in clean water for a more mild-flavored cheese.
 Let drain for five minutes for a "cream cheese" consistency, 15–20 minutes for a moist spread, and 2–8 hours in the refrigerator for a relatively firm cheese.Refrigerate all leftovers in a close container and eat before it goes sour, usually within 2–4 days.









To reduce the risk of harmful bacteria, do not leave the ricotta at room temperature for longer than 20 minutes.
Stir in salt for significantly more flavor and a slightly longer shelf life.

 This style of wear is perfect for cool weather. It's easy to throw on or take off if the sun comes out and warms up your early winter day. To "tie" this knot, simple lay it across the back of your neck so that each end of the scarf hangs evenly., The Once Around offers a little more warmth for your neck, making it more suitable for breezy or windy days. Lay your scarf across the back of your neck so that the right side is longer than the left, then take the long side across the front of your body, around your neck, and return it to hang on the right side., This knot is a little fancier, and may be perfect for business, a date, or a brisk night on the town. With your scarf around your neck and the right side longer than the left, take the long end across your chest and over the short end, loop the long end around and under the short end, and then pull it through so that it hangs atop the other fabric., This tie is very simple, but is perfect for when the temperature begins to get a little more toward the chilly side, especially if you're only wearing a light jacket. Keeping each side even around your neck, cross both ends at the front of your chest, around each of your sides, and tie the ends together behind your back with the knot of your choice.

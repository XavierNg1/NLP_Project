 Spray lightly with water, or wash and let dry until damp but not dripping.


Do not continue with soaking wet hair. Plaited hair takes longer to dry, and the curls will not happen if the plaits are still wet the next morning.
Optionally, apply hair oil to keep your hair shiny and healthy.;
, Brush or comb your hair, getting rid of any knots.
 Part your hair into two sections (for wavy hair) or 4â€“9 sections (for curly hair). Plait (braid) each section in French plait. Make this as tight as possible for a curlier effect.









Two thick plaits creates a wavy effect. Smaller, tighter braids creates more noticeable curls.
 Plait as close to the end as you can, then loop the ends up and tuck them in. This will ensure there is no straight ends dangling from your curls.
 This will keep them in position during the night.
 If you have long hair, bring each plait up to the top or side of your head. Pin them into place with bobby pins.
 Try not to roll over in the night. If you tend to toss and turn while you sleep, try putting a tennis ball in your side pajama pockets so you can't sleep on your side.
 When you wake up, spray your plaits with hairspray again. Then unravel them and let your hair down.









Do not brush your hair. This will just make your hair frizzy and ruin the effect.

 Much of the significance that white canes have earned is tied to their user’s ability to move on their own and desire to be treated as self-reliant. In fact, White Cane Day was first established to celebrate and recognize the success that blind people have had in traveling autonomously and in organizing for legal rights through the National Federation of the Blind.Accordingly, the white cane itself is considered a symbol of a blind person’s ability to move on their own.;
, While it’s important to recognize the cane’s symbolic significance to many users’ identities, the cane also serves a more literal purpose. A white cane in particular legally identifies someone as blind or visually impaired. This is most important as an indicator to motorists that a pedestrian may not be able to see them.The white cane also informs others of someone’s visual impairment, which can inform conversation between a blind person and other people.
Note that white canes are sometimes tipped or striped with red, yellow, or blue. The only important aspect of these cane's color is that they are mostly white - as this indicates to others that the user is blind or visually impaired.
 Since White Cane Day was established, blind and visually impaired people have continued to increase their mobility and independence. Blind people are not only increasingly traveling on their own, they also work in all sorts of professional positions. In the words of a prominent blind person’s advocacy group, “The blind are able to go, to move, to be, and to compete with all others in society.”The white cane continues to be instrumental in blind people’s ability to move on their own, but it is also increasingly used a symbol of blind people’s determination and success in continuing to be independent.
Indeed, even as new technologies emerge to assist those with visual impairments - including new types of white canes - the cane itself will likely persist as a symbol of increasing independence.

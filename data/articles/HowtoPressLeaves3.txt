 Use an old book that you don't mind getting a bit wrinkled or stained; the moisture from the leaves could damage the pages slightly. The book should be as large, or larger than your leaves. Thicker books are best, but any book will do as long as you add weight on top of it. Weight can be in the form of a pile of books; these will not get damaged so it’s okay to use books you want to keep.
 Measure your book and cut papers the same height of the book. Paper should be cut to double the width, of the book, and then folded.
 Open the book and add one piece of pressing paper. Arrange your leaves on one side of the paper, close the fold in the pressing paper, then close the book and set it aside with a couple of books or weight on top until the leaves are dry. If you’re layering more than one sheet of leaves in the book, leave about a quarter inch (0.6 cm) of pages between layers.
 Place it under several other heavy books, or another heavy object. Stack this in a dry place.
 They’re ready for your project.

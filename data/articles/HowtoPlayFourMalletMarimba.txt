 The end of the mallet should reach to the center of your palm. The mallet is kept in place by your palm, pointer finger and thumb.;
, The end of the mallet should reach to about the first line in your palm.
, Try not to move your hand at all while doing this; only the mallet and the two fingers should move.
 To make the movement, imagine that you’re opening a doorknob. In fact, a good way to practice this movement is by turning a doorknob a couple of times and paying particular attention to the rotation that occurs. You want to duplicate this rotation. Your wrist should twist slightly away from you, bringing the top of the mallet downward. With practice, this movement will become minimal – you won’t have to move your wrist very much at all to make the mallet move downward. As you play you'll teach yourself how to roll just imagine a doorknob you can't open and your twisting and turning it .

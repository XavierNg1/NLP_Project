 This exercise is geared toward working your forearm muscle endurance by maximizing the time under tension.Start by lifting the dumbbells or kettle bells of your preference. Since “heavy” is relative to your routine, try a weight heavier than you would try to curl but not so heavy that you have to strain. You can always add more or less as needed.


If you really want to maximize this workout, instead of barbells or kettle bells, lift two weight plates pinched together in each hand instead. You will have to work your grip—and therefore forearms—extra hard to keep the plates pinched together so they don’t fall.If you want to try loading even more weight into this exercise, try using a trap bar instead. With a trap bar, you can stand in the middle and lift the weight with both arms, which allows you to carry much more than your arms working individually., In order to put the brunt of the weight on the correct muscle groups, you want to brace your abs, keep your chest up, and keep your shoulders back.If you hunch, you’ll divert too much of the strain to your upper arms or back.
 The natural movement and inertia from walking will work your forearms much more than simply standing in place holding the weights, so start walking. Try this workout in sets of twenty yards to start with, or whatever you find comfortable. Increase the length of time gradually. Walking for a long time or using heavy weights before you are ready can cause a shoulder injury.

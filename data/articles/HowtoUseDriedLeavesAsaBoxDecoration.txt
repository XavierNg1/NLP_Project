 Be sure that they're dry. If they're damp, hang them somewhere to dry first. Alternatively, use a flower press to press and dry them flat.;
, Little boxes for sweets, soaps, biscuits, potpourri, jewels, etc., are ideal.
 Each set will cover the four sides of the box and its lid. Keep the very best leaves to add to the lid.
 The best place to put the glue is on the centre vein and nowhere else on the leaf.
 Try to make a pattern in which each leaf can be seen overlapping.
 For example, add a hazelnut in the shell, twin acorns, or a gumnut. Glue into place.

 Credit card processing provides for the secure transfer of funds from a card holder's bank account to a merchant account in payment for goods and services rendered.
 A payment gateway is a service that verifies and authorizes all payments to merchant accounts. This includes traditional brick-and-mortar operations as well as online sales transactions. Here are the steps involved:


The customer pays. Goods or services are bought with a credit card. This is the beginning of the process.
Authorization is checked. The payment gateway service sends the transactional data to the merchant bank's processor, who, in turn, routes the transaction data to the cardholder's bank.
The transaction is verified. The cardholder's bank will either approve or decline the transaction, and then passes that information back to the credit card processor, who, in turn, passes the information to the cardholder and the merchant.
Goods are delivered. Given a card that was accepted, the merchant delivers the goods to the cardholder.
The transaction is completed. The customer's bank sends the required funds to the credit card processing network, who forwards the funds to the merchant's bank, and the transaction is settled.

 If you need authorization, get this before commencing. Contact your local municipality to begin with; they can direct you elsewhere if need be.;
, Raffle books are often available in supermarkets, stationery stores and department stores. If more than one person is selling, you'll need enough for each seller and it's always a good idea to have spares, just in case you have a lot of raffle ticket buyers.
 A large Easter egg or lots of smaller Easter eggs in a basket will be the most appealing. It must be worth a reasonable amount, to encourage people to give the raffle a go.


Purchase it from a low-cost place if possible, that way you'll save money and gain more funds.
See whether someone is willing to donate the prize, such as a small business, group of parents or others. Don't pester people for it though, everyone has a budget to meet.
 Wrap it in clear cellophane, place it in a desirable basket or container and add pretty things such as ribbon and glitter. Making it look like something worth carrying home is an important part of attracting raffle ticket purchases.
 If you charge too much, people won't think it's worth the effort, while if you charge too little, you won't cover the costs involved. A couple of dollars is about right.
 Ensure that there is a safe place to keep the cash. Bank it regularly if it adds up to a decent amount.


If a group of people are selling tickets, have one person in charge of coordinating everyone and taking in all the monies by a set time.
 Give people plenty of time to get a ticket for a chance to win the prize.
 Award it to the person if they're present or telephone the winner to come and collect it. It's best to hod an event at which the prize is awarded, as that's much more fun for everyone.

 Do not take racism lying down. Act on your beliefs when you come across injustice, prejudice, and discriminatory words. Call out racism when you see it. Don't be afraid to stand up for someone who is being mistreated!


Use your words, your actions, and your influence. Be bold, but be smart. Think about how you can intervene most effectively.
 Keep a cell phone camera handy, and take video footage of any oppressive acts that you encounter. Do not be afraid to videotape law enforcement officers if you feel that they are physically or verbally oppressing a civilian. Broadcast the truth. Show your friends, tell your story, and post your footage to social media.


If you can't take video, take photos or record audio. At the very least, pay close attention. A solid eyewitness account is better than nothing.
 React with intention, and advocate nonviolently. Try to hold your cool and maintain perspective in the face of deep injustice. Do not submit, but be careful about acting with anger. Sometimes, it's best to slow down and consider the wisest way to react. Find your center and work from there.Take your cues from nonviolent activists like Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Harriet Tubman, and Martin Luther King, Jr.: men and women who used their frustration to help people rather than hurt people. Each day, be the change that you wish to see in the world.
Consider that anger often arises in response to anger. Ask yourself whether, by reacting angrily, you will actually solve the problem â€“ or only feed the cycle of anger.

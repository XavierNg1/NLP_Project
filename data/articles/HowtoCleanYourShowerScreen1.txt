 Squirt some high-quality dishwashing detergent over the grotty shower screen. Use a scrubbing brush (or an old cloth) and a bit of water to ensure the whole screen is clean. Use the brush or cloth in a circular motion until the whole screen has been covered. Wash off with fresh water.;
, First, get the shower screen wet by running the shower. Put baking soda in a cloth and scrub the screen. Finally, put white vinegar in a spray-bottle. Spray the screen down to get all the baking soda off. Rinse with warm water.
 Completely dry off your screens. Soak paper towels in vinegar and stick them onto the screen until the area is covered. Try putting more than one layer on if possible to keep the area soaked. Leave them on for at least 45 minutes. If there's a lot of lime, then you may want to leave them on for a few hours. Once that's over, the residue should wipe off easily.
 If you have metal frames, mix one tablespoon of lemon juice with two tablespoons of salt. Use a toothbrush to scrub the frame, especially in the corners. Let sit for a few minutes and then rinse with warm water.
 Saliva contains enzymes and bacteria that literally consume the dirt on the shower screens. This is useful if you want to clean a spot where dirt is concentrated.

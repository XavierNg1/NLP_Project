 When a boil continues to grow unchecked, its characteristics will change. The painful area will grow in size, but it will become softer to the touch. However, it will be painful even when you are not touching it. Some people describe the pain as a pulsing sensation.A boil in the late stages can range in size from that of a pea to the size of a golf ball.
 The boil may develop a white or yellow center directly in the middle of the infected area. This is actually pus that is collecting inside the boil. If the boil ruptures, the pus will leak out and it will be very painful.
 If the body finds that it cannot fight the boil because it has become to infected and large, the body may raise its overall temperature to fight the infection. When your body increases its temperature, you are at risk of running a fever.Fever can also cause fatigue.
 Your lymph nodes are part of your immune system. When an area of the body becomes infected, the lymph nodes will try to filter your blood of the bacteria and eliminate the detected pathogen. When the lymph nodes attempt this, they will become swollen.


There are lymph nodes located all over your body. The ones you will want to check are located in your neck.

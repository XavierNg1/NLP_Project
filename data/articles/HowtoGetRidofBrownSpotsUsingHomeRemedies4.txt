 Brown spots are harmless, but they can be mistaken for skin cancer. It’s always a good idea to have any spots on your skin checked by a dermatologist. Once your dermatologist has verified that the spots are merely cosmetic, you can take measures to reduce the appearance of the spots.
 Dermatologists often talk about the “ABCDEs” of skin cancer-- ways to distinguish between skin cancer and a benign (non-cancerous) growth. Skin cancer tends to be:Assymetric
With uneven Borders (edges)
With varied Colors (Different shades of brown, black and tan)
Larger in Diameter (>¼ inch or > 6mm)

Evolving (changing) in size, shape, color, how much above the skin surface they are raised etc)

, Most cancerous spots are marked by change, so keeping track of the way your skin looks can help you with early detection. Depending on factors such as time spent exposed to UV rays and family history, you may need to have your skin checked regularly by a professional dermatologist.

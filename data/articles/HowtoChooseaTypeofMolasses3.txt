 Most molasses that is sold commercially is made from sugarcane that was never treated with sulfur dioxide. This chemical improves the yield of sugarcane crops, but leads to slight chemical taste in the molasses derived from treated plants., Reducing pomegranate juice yields a thick, strongly flavored syrup that can be used similarly to molasses. This “pomegranate molasses,” however, is much less sweet. You’ll get a bit more depth, and even a bit of muskiness by using pomegranate molasses instead of molasses derived from sugarcane or sugar beets.The flavor of pomegranate molasses is somewhere between dry red wine and concentrated meat drippings.
Substitute pomegranate molasses in salad dressings and glazes, and in cocktails.
 Dates have been used to sweeten food for thousands of years. Date syrup is another fine alternative to molasses, and even looks and pours similarly. Note that it has a notably fruity flavor, and is sweeter than molasses. Use it in dressings, marinades, desserts, and homemade bread.Note that including date syrup in baking recipes usually requires other alterations to the recipe as well, such as a reduction in sugar.

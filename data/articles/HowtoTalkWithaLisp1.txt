 This is the simplest way to speak with a lisp. Practice consciously replacing the S syllables in your speech. Be aware that a lisp can run a spectrum from serious speech impediment to subtle tongue adjustment. Err on the side of subtlety â€“ don't overdo it., Pick a sentence with a lot of S syllables. Then, write out the same sentence with "th" in the place of each "s." Read the sentence aloud until the lisp becomes second nature.


"Sally sells seashells by the seashore," would become "Thally thellth theathellth by the theathore.
"I am speaking with a lisp," would become "I am thpeaking with a lithp."

, Remember that a lisp is a legitimate speech disorder. A person who speaks with a natural lisp does not have the option to switch it off. If you imitate a lisp with the intent of poking fun at the speech pattern, you might offend or otherwise disrespect people who speak with lisps.


Consider also that the lisp is sometimes associated with certain stereotypes and subcultures. This is perhaps most notable in a particular "lisp-y" stereotype of members from the LGBTQ community. Ask yourself whether it is discriminatory to imitate a lisp in this context.

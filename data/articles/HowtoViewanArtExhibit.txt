 Take note of works that particularly appeal to you, but keep moving on this initial tour.;
, Sometimes shows have an intended viewing sequence, which will help answer questions you might have about the show's meaning. Curators (people who pick the works, and help arrange them in a gallery) are always aware of the sequence with which you will view works, and definitely take in mind how the first works you see entering a space will inform your response to the whole show.
 These notes can help explain things, and often totally transform your response to the piece. Sometimes, just understanding what a work is made of can help form new understandings, for instance: it looks like thread, but it's really made of metal.
 View the art up close, and also from afar. Note how your distance from the work changes your perception of it.
, Take time to savor the work, but never feel like you have to stare at something you don't like.

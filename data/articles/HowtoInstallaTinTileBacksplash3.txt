 You can purchase mortar mix at most hardware or home improvement stores. In a large disposable bucket or mixer, combine the mortar mix with water and stir it with a trowel until it reaches a thick but viscous consistency. Let the mortar settle for around 5 minutes before moving onto the next step.An 80-pound bag of mix requires around 5 US quarts (5,000Â ml) of water on average.
 Dip your tool into the mortar mixture and apply a good layer of mortar over your wall. Use the trowel to even out the wall and make sure that it is a similar depth across your wall.
 Press your tin tile backdrop over the wet mortar. Hold it in place and make adjustments so that it is even. The tiles should line up with the lines you drew or the blue painter's tape that you laid down. Press down on the back of the tiles to make sure that they fit in place. Continue to do this across the wall while making adjustments to ensure that your tiles are even.
 Once all of your tin tile backdrop is laid you can ensure that it is all laying evenly by lightly tapping the back of the tile with a wooden block. If you are using an embossed piece of tin tile, skip this step because it can dent your tin tile backdrop.
 Allow your tin tile backdrop to dry and the mortar to set. Once it's dry, you can shine and clean the tiles with a damp sponge or rag.

 Since the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the shadows it casts will always move in the same direction, and you can observe their motion to determine directions. For this method, you will need:A straight stick that’s between two and five feet long
A straight stick that’s about one foot long
Two rocks, stones, or other objects (heavy enough that wind won’t blow them around).;
, Place one of the rocks on the ground to mark the tip of the stick’s shadow.
 The shadow will have moved. Take the second rock and mark the new location of the tip of the stick’s shadow.


If you can wait longer, do so, and place more rocks to mark the changing shadow.
 Either draw a straight line on the ground between the two marks or use the other stick to connect the dots and make a straight line. The shadow moves in the opposite direction of the sun, so this line denotes the east–west line: the first dot represents west and the second dot represents east.

If you don't remember the order of directions, start with North and go clockwise, using this mnemonic:Never Eat Soggy Waffles.
Alternatively, picture a clock with North at 12:00, East at 3:00, South at 6:00, and West at 9:00.

Note that this method is only approximate, and can be off by 23 degrees or so.

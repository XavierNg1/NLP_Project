 Watch it every day. If you can't watch it when it comes on, record it if you can. Know the rules to Contestants' Row, all of the pricing games, the Showcase Showdown, and the Showcase (Tip: Do not confuse the Showcase Showdown with the Showcase! The Showcase Showdown is the part of the show where you spin the Big Wheel, while the Showcase is the part where you bid on a package of prizes presented to you). As Bob Barker would have said, it's good to be a "loyal friend and true.";
, You can do this in three ways:


Order them online. You can order them at this website.
Order them through mail. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope with a letter detailing which show you want to see, how many people are attending, and the date you want to attend to: TICKETS - "The Price is Right", CBS Television City, Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90036.
Order them by phone. Call 1-800-852-8909 to request tickets by phone.
 The Price is Right tapes at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California. If you live far away, book a plane ride to California in advance, and choose an affordable hotel that's near the studio. Your trip may require an overnight stay, so pack clothing and other materials that you'll want a few days before the trip.
 You don't need to camp at the studio overnight like when Bob Barker was hosting, but you should arrive early to ensure that the line isn't long when you arrive and that you'll be able to get in. Use the bathroom and eat before getting into line.
 Once the doors open, you'll be allowed into the studio lot, and after a long period of waiting, you'll be interviewed by one of the producers. You'll have 5-10 seconds to state your name, where you're from, and your occupation. Don't try to come up with something "creative" here. Just be yourself, and show enthusiasm.
 Even if you don't get called down, just enjoy the show. It'll be a great experience for you no matter what.

 These brushes are used to remove mats and tangles from your pet’s thick fur. Most of these brushes look very similar. They are crafted with numerous wire bristles that are very close together. These bristles get between individual hairs, gently untangling mats. The brush head is positioned at an angle, so your pet’s skin is not nicked or irritated as you brush. Slicker brushes come in a variety of sizes and bristle lengths, so select a brush that matches your dog’s size and coat., This is your standard grooming tool. You’ll use these brushes to smooth the coat after you’ve removed tangles, while you’re blow drying, or just for daily or weekly brushing as necessary. They are available in numerous sizes and bristle lengths, so make sure the bristles reach all the way through your dog’s fur without scratching the skin., If your dog has sensitive skin or is prone to itching and rashes, select products specifically made for these issues. Dogs who have mange, fleas, or mites, will need special shampoo. Ask a vet for help finding the best product for your dog. You can also get advice from a professional groomer or workers at the local pet store.


Only use tear free, nontoxic shampoo when washing your dog’s face and ears., These may include toothbrushes specialized for dogs, clippers, or scissors. If you have everything you need before you get started, the process will go much more smoothly. The last thing you want is to have to stop in the middle of grooming your dog to find the shampoo. This is just asking for your pup to roll around in the mud and undo all your hard work.

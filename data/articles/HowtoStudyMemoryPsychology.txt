 These are:


Encoding – The information enters the memory system.
Storage – The retention of encoded information over time
Retrieval – The process of getting information out of memory.;

Neural language is sensory information.
Working Memory (STM): Activated memory that hold a few items briefly.
Long Term Memory: Relatively permanent and limitless storehouse of the system of memory.



Researchers have identified a visual "sensory memory", called iconic memory and identified an auditory sensory memory, called echoic memory.
LTM (Long Term Memory) actually refers to number of different memory systems.They are episodic, semantic memory (memories of factual kind), procedural memory (which is knowledge how to do things(wikiHow knowledge)).



Explicit processes are accompanied by conscious activity such as searching, or asking what had happened last night, we consciously search for the answer.
Implicit process are not accompanied by awareness.
 It can be effort or automatic.


There is a serial position effect. One can remember the first (primacy effect) and the last items best.
Chunking is a way to make easier to remember.
STM has limited capacity with 7+/-2
LTM relatively unlimited. K. Lashley concluded that memories are distributed across cortex and he was right.
Flashbulb Memory: Strong emotions make for stronger memories.

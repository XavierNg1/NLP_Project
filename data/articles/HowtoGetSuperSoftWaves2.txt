 Let your hair air dry a little, but not much.
 For tighter hold, use gel or mousse. For a looser, softer look, use a cream or serum.
 Use a comb to ensure your parts are clean and even, from your forehead to your neck. Secure each section with a non-rubber hair band.
 If you want waves from your hairline all the way down your hair, do French braids. If you want your hair to remain a bit straight on top, then just do regular braids. Secure at the bottom with elastics.
 Your hair will dry into crimped waves overnight.
 Don't comb the waves-run your fingers through them to loosen them up. Use a hand mirror mirror to see the back.
 Using your fingers, carefully relax the curls into waves. Toss your hair and spray it lightly with a flexible hold finishing/shining hair spray if needed.

 Rods are also known as sharpening steel. While rods will, in a sense, sharpen your knives, what are really doing with a rod is honing the blade--with the same result as sharpening your knife on a stone.There are several kinds of rods. The most common is the steel honing rod, which is also known as sharpening steel. It is a very effective and reliable way to sharpen your knife. Rods can also be made out of ceramic and diamond. Both of these materials are reliable because they are two of the hardest materials in existence. Diamond rods are known to create smoother blades, but both will sharpen knives very quickly., To be safe, place the tip on an old tea towel on top of your chopping block or cutting board (so that you don’t leave gashes in your counter tops.) The rod should be held straight up and down so that it is perfectly vertical.
 You must again determine the angle at which you should hold the blade against the rod. Pocket knives should generally be held at a 25 to 30 degree angle.


Go to your local knife shop or hardware store and ask them to determine the angle of your knife if you don’t feel confident that you have the right angle.
 You should swipe slowly and use a light touch--do not push the knife against the rod with a lot of pressure. Move the knife from heel to tip as you swipe it down along the rod., If your knife is relatively sharp, you should only have to swipe the knife along the rod a couple of times on each side. If your knife is very dull, you will have to swipe the knife several more times.

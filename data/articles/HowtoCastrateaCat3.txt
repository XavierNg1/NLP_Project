 Unneutered male cats have a natural drive to mate and perpetuate their genetic line. It has been estimated that about 50 million stray cats live in the United States.Stray cats live short, difficult lives. They often die young due to disease, parasitism, fighting, or accidental injury.
The best way to help stray cats is to reduce their number by humane methods such as spaying and neutering.
 Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is spread by bodily fluids such as blood and semen. An unneutered male cat is at increased risk of acquiring the virus, or spreading it to other cats. The rate of FIV infection in the US cat population varies from 1.5% to 15%., If your unneutered male cat lives indoors, you may have noticed some unpleasant smells as a result of his urine. The pungent smell of unneutered Tom cat urine can fill an entire house, even if your cat uses the litter box.


In addition, unneutered cats experience a strong natural drive to scent mark their territory by squirting urine against walls. Neutering can prevent this habit from forming in young cats. If your cat has already developed this habit, then neutering along with behavior modification training can eliminate spraying behavior.

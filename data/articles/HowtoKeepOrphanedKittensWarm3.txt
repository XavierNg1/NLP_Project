 If you don’t have a heating pad, you can use a bottle of hot water to keep the nest warm. Fill a bottle with water heated to around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (around 38 degrees Celsius). Wrap it securely in a towel, and place it in the nest’s bedding.You’ll have to check the temperature frequently and replace the water bottle at least every two hours.
 Placing a hot sock in the nest is an alternative way to warm the kittens. Fill an old sock with uncooked rice or white beans, then tie the open end into a knot. Microwave the sock for 60 seconds, then place it in the nest.Like the water bottle method, you’ll have to check the temperature frequently and reheat the sock at least every two hours.
 Some vets and kitten fosters prefer using a heat lamp instead of an electric heating pad. If you opt for a heat lamp, hang it over the nesting box and position it towards one side of the box.Make sure the heat lamp is out of the kittens’ reach, especially as they get older and become more mobile.

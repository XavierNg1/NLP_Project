 Articuno is the ice-type legendary bird. It is the most powerful of the three birds. Fly to Fuchsia City and surf down Route 19, then surf left down Route 20 to the Seafoam Islands. Enter the island. You will need to navigate through a maze of ice and rapids to get to Articuno.You will need Pokémon with Strength and Surf to reach Articuno. There is a complicated rock-moving puzzle along the way!;
, Bring a few repels to keep wild Pokémon away. Make sure that you have at least 30 Ultra Balls – Articuno may be the weakest of the three birds, but it is still a very strong Pokémon. If you run out of Ultra Balls in the midst of the battle, then you might not be able to catch Articuno!


Save before the battle. Once you find Articuno, make sure that you save before you try to catch it. This way, you can try again if you mess up.
 Seel and Dewgong take 1/8 damage from ice moves, and Ice Beam is Articuno's only attacking move. Try to catch a Seel in the cave on your way to Articuno.


Give the Seel or Dewgong the Leftovers item to make the battle even easier. When held by a Pokémon, Leftovers make that Pokémon gradually recover HP throughout a battle. Find Leftovers on Routes 12 and 16, hidden underneath where the Snorlaxes were sleeping., The most successful way to catch this bird is to get its health into the red, then give it a status condition. Freeze and Sleep are best. However, Paralyze may be the easiest since it doesn't wear off. Keep throwing Ultra Balls until you get it – and make sure not to injure the bird so much that it faints before you can catch it!


Avoid status conditions like Poison and Burn that gradually injure the afflicted Pokémon. These are risky: you'll run the chance of killing the Articuno before you can catch it.

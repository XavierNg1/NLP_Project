 Play the correct D note on a guitar, piano, or pitch pipe, then adjust the bass knob until the sound the plucked string produces matches the D note you played.On a guitar, the D below Middle C is the same note as the open fourth string.
If you do not have an instrument to tune the bass string to, hum a note with your voice that feels as natural and comfortable as possible. This may not be a D note, but it will come close enough for most purposes.
Note that the Ionian Mode is the most standard and can also be called the "natural major" mode. Most traditional American songs are considered "natural major" songs.;
, Press down on the bass string just left of the fourth fret on your dulcimer. Pluck on the string to produce an A note, then use the middle tuning knob to adjust the middle string until the sound it produces matches the same pitch when the middle string is open plucked.This step and the step prior to it are the essentially same no matter which tuning method you use.
 Pluck the melody string. Use its tuning knob to adjust it until the melody string produces the same sound as the open middle string.


This sound is the A note, and it is also the same sound produced when you pluck the bass string after pressing the bass string down to the left of the fourth fret.
The Ionian Mode scale begins on the third fret and runs through the tenth fret. You can play additional notes both below and above this scale on your dulcimer.

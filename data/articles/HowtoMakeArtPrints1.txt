 Take a sheet of plain white paper and draw the picture that you'd like to print.


Be sure to use a standard lead pencil so the lead can transfer off and provide an outline for your wood cutting.;
, This should be soft wood, like a thin birch or pine plywood. Use whatever size you'd like your print to end up being.


If it's your first time, you might want to use a smaller piece of wood, just to get used to the process.
 Set the lead side of your drawing directly onto the wood. Carefully rub across the image so that the lead transfers to the wood. Remove the paper drawing.
 Depending on the kind of wood you used, it may be difficult to see the penciled image. Go over the image with a pen, so you can easily cut around it.
 Make sure your wood is on a non-slip surface and gather several different sizes of wood gouges. Cut and carve away the wood surrounding your image, taking care not to cut into the image itself. Use gouges to make shallow cuts away from yourself.


A V-shaped gouge cuts against the grain, while a U-shaped gouge cuts along the grain, making it easier to remove large chunks. You can purchase several sizes of wood gouges, controlling the level of detail.
 You may want to do a few practice prints on scrap paper before using your chosen paper. Load your rubber roller with ink, by rolling it in the ink until evenly distributed.
 Make sure to completely cover your block so that the image is covered in ink. The only part of the woodblock without ink should be the part that you cut away.
 Be sure to carefully position the piece of paper over the block so that it lines up straight.
 Start from the center of the paper and gently, but firmly press the paper smoothly across the block. You can use a letter opener, wooden spoon, or bone folder to apply even pressure.
 Slowly pull up on the edges of the paper to remove it from your woodcut. You should see your image printed on the paper. Let your print dry completely before framing or hanging it.

 It’s not necessary to fully wet your hair. Using bobby pins will create a spiral curl look.
 Having smooth hair makes it easy to manipulate with your fingers.
 You’ll want to have a top half and a bottom half. You’ll work with the lower half first, so clip the upper half on top of your head.
 Keep wrapping your hair around your finger until you get to your scalp.The wider the section, the looser the curl.
 You’ll want to make sure that the section of hair is properly secured.
 You are done when all of your hair is pinned to your head.
 For best results, wait at least one hour.
 It’s easy to misplace bobby pins. Try to keep them together so you can re-use them.
 The more loose your spiral curls are, the more natural your hairstyle will look.

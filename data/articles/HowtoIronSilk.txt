 Add a few drops of mild detergent to a bucket or sink of water. Rub it very gently to release stains.;
, Then, rinse the garment in fresh lukewarm water until the bubbles disappear.
 Wrap it in a thick towel to absorb the rest of the water. Now you are ready to iron the silk.Never wring silk fabric out or it can stretch or tear.
If you don’t want to wash it before you iron it. Spray the whole surface of the silk with a spray bottle to dampen it.
 Clean it with a paste of one tbsp. (14.8 ml) of water and two tbsp. (13.8 g) of baking soda. Spread it on the iron, scrub lightly and wipe it off with a damp cloth., Heat it up on the silk setting or the lowest setting if your iron doesn’t have a delicate/silk setting. Wait at least five minutes while it heats up.
 Creating a cotton barrier will prevent colors from other fabrics from leaching onto your silk. Both the cotton barrier and your cotton press cloth should be pure cotton and white or natural color.
 You will always want to iron on the backside of the fabric. This is the side that has the matte finish., Lay a small cotton press cloth on top of the area you are going to start ironing. Some moisture from the damp silk may leak through the press cloth.
 Move the iron around the fabric. Never leave it in one place too long, or you risk burning the fabric.
 When you have completed ironing the whole surface, hang the silk on a hanger and allow it to dry for a few minutes before wearing it or storing it.

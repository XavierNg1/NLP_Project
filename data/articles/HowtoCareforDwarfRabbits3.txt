 Not the kind for teething, but hard ones they cannot chew apart like keys and rattles to hang on the top of their cage.
 You can fill a cardboard toilet paper tube with hay or simply just place the tube in the cage and let your dwarf rabbit have a go at it. You can also make a rabbit hideaway by cutting the bottom off of a cardboard box and cutting doors and windows.
 Here's an idea: take a plastic Easter egg, fill it with dry rice, and hot glue it shut. Simple, and your dwarf rabbit will love to rattle it around. Just make sure to take adorable out the toy at night- your dwarf rabbit will most likely wake you up!

 Use freshly brewed grounds for best results. Your pot should be large enough to boil two cups (500 milliliters) but not so large that the water you’ll use will evaporate away., Stir the pot so that the water and coffee mix together. This will allow for better color saturation and will prevent having clumps of coffee burn onto the bottom of the pot.To create more tanner, increase both the coffee grounds and water in equal parts.
 Bring your water to a boil and let it continue to boil for about two minutes. If it boils too long, the water will evaporate., Set the coffee-water aside until it cools back to room temperature.Do NOT rush to apply your product. If it’s too hot, then you may suffer burns.
 Massage both the water and the grounds onto your body. You should have coffee grounds spread across your skin when you’re finished.It’s best to wear gloves while applying the product to prevent stained hands.
 The coffee needs time to seep into your skin, so set a timer. Try to remain still so that the coffee grounds stay on your skin., Avoid cleansing your skin or shaving because you may accidentally remove your new tan. Gently towel off when you’re finished.

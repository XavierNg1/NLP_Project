 Feed your horses and take care of them a lot. You will find that in the store, you can sell things like your droppings, apples etc. Take care of your horses a lot. Then after you have logged on and fed your horses every day for about 5 weeks, go and sell all your droppings, thus receiving money for useless things your horses produce.;
, When you have spent 6 weeks collecting them, you will be able to sell your whole stash of apples at the shop and you will receive money.
 Then put it up for its correct price. You will be gaining money! Then go and buy more underpriced horses, and price them correctly. If you can't find any when you do it for three days, then maybe you're better off making money the fast way.
 Lots of donkeys. Then sell them for 500e and one pass. It sounds cheap, but a pass is always better than money.


Buy 2 donkeys, one of each gender and babies.
Age them until 2 years and 6 months.
Breed them together and sell the first baby.



Keep the last 2 babies (if opposite gender) and breed them together once old enough.
Enjoy the easy money.

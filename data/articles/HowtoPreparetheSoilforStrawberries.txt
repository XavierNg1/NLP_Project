You can check the pH level yourself by purchasing a kit at any garden supply center. Put soil into the provided container, add a measured amount of the provided testing chemical and compare the resultant color to the kit's color chart to determine your soil's pH level.
Alternatively, you can take or mail a sample of your soil to a local county extension office. They will test the soil and provide recommendations on how to adjust your soil for the best results when growing strawberries. They can also recommend the best strawberries for your area saving you some real disappointment in the future.

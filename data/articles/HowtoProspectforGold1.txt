 There are a number of rules about prospecting, so make sure you familiarize yourself with the regulations before starting.


Obtain permission from the landowner to prospect on privately owned land.
Avoid national parks, which are all closed to prospecting.
Consult the Forest Service and the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to see if certain parcels of land are open for prospecting. You will find public land records in the appropriate state BLM office.;
, Most gold will be found in areas that have already been prospected and within samples of 3 to 5 pounds of mineralized rock.
 You’ll need funds to travel to the area in which you want to prospect as well as money to support yourself during your prospecting adventure.
 Prospecting isn't for everyone, as you'll need to be fit enough to spend long hours traipsing through the backcountry. Things you might have to contend with:


Carrying a large backpack into the wilderness.
Walking or climbing for long distances.
Traveling at high altitudes on mountainous terrain.
, You’ll need a variety of tools:


A small prospector’s pick
Extra clothing and boots
A bucket or wheelbarrow to transport materials to the washing site
A compass for establishing claim lines
Adequate maps
A magnifying lens for identifying minerals
Plastic bags to identify samples
Camping supplies including an axe, a flashlight, a knife and matches
A 2-quart or larger canteen and water purification tablets
A miner’s lamp or gasoline or propane lamps

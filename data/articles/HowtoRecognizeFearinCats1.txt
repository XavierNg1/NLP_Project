 A fearful cat is in a state of physiological arousal. She has adrenaline, the fight-or-flight hormone, racing through her bloodstream. This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to supply extra blood to her heart and muscles so that she is prepared for action. To spot signs of adrenaline, read the following steps.;
, Cats have slit-like pupils, which become large and round either in the dark (to gather more light) or when a cat is fearful, or aroused. Her pupils become dilated to maximize her vision.


Look at your cat’s eyes; if they look predominantly black, her pupils are dilated.
 The only place cats have sweat glands is on the pads of their feet. Just as we sweat in a tense situation, so do cats. Look for wet paw prints on the floor or table top.If your cat will let you, you can also touch the pads of your cat’s feet to see if they feel wet.
 To supply blood to the muscles in preparation for action (flight or attack) your cat’s heart rate will increase. A normal heart rate is 120 to 140 beats per minute.


A frightened cat's heart rate accelerates to 180 beats per minute or above.
 A fearful cat lowers her ears against her head. As she becomes progressively more alarmed, her ears will flatten right back against her head to keep them out of the way of slashing claws.
 When your cat is afraid, she will flatten her whiskers against her face. If your cat’s whiskers are pressed against your cat’s muzzle, it is very likely that she is frightened.
 While the inner conflict remains mild, the cat's mouth and lips will remain in a neutral position. As the cat’s fear intensifies to the point where action (fleeing or fighting) is increasingly likely, the cat's mouth draws back at the corners to reveal her teeth in a snarl.


As the cat's fear arousal grows she will wrinkle her nose as part of the movement to draw her lips back in a snarl.

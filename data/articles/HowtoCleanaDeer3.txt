 The digestive tract, is the continuous tube through which food travels, and consists of the esophagus, the stomach, the intestines and the rectum. The digestive tract is best removed in one piece. To remove the digestive tract in one piece, you will need to free both ends. To free the top end or esophagus (swallowing tube leading to the stomach), reach up into the chest cavity as far as you can and sever the esophagus . Then pull this end down, through the chest and out.
 Next you need to free the lower end of the digestive tract or rectum/anus. To do this cut a deep ring around a buck's anus, or a deep ring around a doe's anus and vagina. Stuff the now freed rectum back into the body cavity, and out through the stomach incision.


The cut around the anus should circumscribe the anus but not cut the anus. The goal is to free the anus from the surrounding tissue, while leaving the digestive tract, including rectum, intact. Your cut around the anus should be about 4 inches (10.2Â cm) deep.
 Now that both ends of the digestive tract are free you can roll the intact digestive tract out of the body cavity.


As you handle the digestive tract, be careful not to cut the intestines, or squeeze fecal matter out. Spilled fecal matter will taint the meat. You may choose to tie off the rectum to minimize spillage.

 This is how you reinforce the action. However, when your rat gets used to the trick in question, stop giving treats out too much, as they can fatten your rat. You can try giving a healthier rat snack, or just use affection instead.;
, All rodents need some time outside the cage. But if you have more than one rat, don't keep all your attention on one certain rat. If you want only one rat to learn a certain command, only take out that rat and teach it to him, and then put it back. If you have a friend, and two rats, one person can teach one rat, but you or your friend might have to go to another room, so the rats won't be distracted.
 It's easier to train your rat in a really quiet place with no disruptions. Choose a safe location where you are unlikely to be interrupted.

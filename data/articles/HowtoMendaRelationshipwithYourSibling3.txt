 Accept your share of the responsibility and don't blame them for the problems you are having. Ask them to explain how they feel, and listen to them without becoming defensive. Be open to what they have to say â€“ don't assume you already understand how they feel.
Give them time to talk, without interrupting. There might be something you don't know about the situation.
 Begin by acknowledging that a problem exists. Investigate the cause of the conflict, and try to figure out where it began. Tell your sibling that you realize their feelings are valid, and assure them that you will do your part to work toward a loving sibling relationship. When you let down your guard and begin to communicate openly and honestly, it will be easier to forgive each other.
 Understand that you created part of the problem, and figure out where you went wrong. Then apologize sincerely, without being defensive or flippant. You can mend a broken relationship over time, but the process must start with a real apology.


If trust was breached, be honest and tell them why you did what you did, and what you were thinking at the time. You may need to do some soul-searching to determine your motives, so you can give them a genuine explanation.
Avoid making excuses. Don't try to rationalize your behavior, because your sibling won't be fooled by this and they won't believe that you genuinely want to change.
 In order to move forward, at least one of you must apologize. If the situation involved bad behavior on both sides, your sibling will want to apologize as well. Be sure you are open to their explanations, and accept their apology. Don't harbor resentments, or you will never be able to move on.
 Some issues can't be resolved, and sometimes you won't be able to truly understand why your sibling behaved as they did. You may not always agree on every point. If you both want a relationship, you can agree to accept each other's differences and leave room for disagreement.

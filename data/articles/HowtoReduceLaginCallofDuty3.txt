 Most standard-grade HDTVs operate at a frequency of 120-240 Hz, which can impact the latency severely. In order to enjoy the best online gaming experience, make sure that your TV has the option to change the standard refresh rates to 60 Hz


If your TV does not support low refresh rates, you can reduce lag by turning off reduction settings such as noise reduction, MPEG reduction, NR reduction, and others.
 Most of the latest high-definition TVs are powered by a feature such as “Game Mode,” which reconfigures the display and sound settings for optimal experience.The Game Mode configures the display and additional options, such as motion smoothing, which reduces the lag significantly.
Selecting the Game Mode is usually present in the video options of the HDTV, which can be accessed through the “Menu” or “Setting” button on the remote.
 Input lag may occur if you are using a cheap-quality HDMI cable or if the HDMI cable is loosely connected. Make sure that the connection from your PC or your console is properly secured and that the HDMI or any other video cable that you use is of premium quality.

 Select CutePDF Writer. This will take you to the downloads page. CutePDF Writer is a free program.
 You will need to download the CutePDF installation file as well as the GPL Ghostscript converter. Both are linked on the site.
 Install the converter, and then install the CutePDF software. It will not install a program that you open. Instead, it installs itself as a printer that you can select from any program's Print menu.
 You can open it in any program that reads PDFs. Open the Print menu, and select the pages that you want to extract instead of printing the whole thing. You can use the Range section to select multiple pages.
 Every Print menu should have some sort of dropdown menu or list of available printers. Select CutePDF, and then click Print.
 A few seconds after you click Print, a window will appear asking where you want to save the PDF and what you want to name it. CutePDF does not actually print anything, but instead creates a new PDF file from the pages that you selected.

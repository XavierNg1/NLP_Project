 Typically in the 4x400m relay, the incoming runner is on the inside lane while the outgoing runner is in the outside lane. Once you receive the baton, switch it to your other hand so that you can pass it off to the next runner when you complete your lap.The incoming runner is on the inside of the track because it's less distance that they have to run.
 Shouting verbal commands like "up," "stick," or "hand" is a common tactic implemented by most track and relay teams. Practice drilling the handoff process, so your team is all on the same page for the verbal command. While the 4x400m relay consists of a visual handoff, using verbal commands will improve your timing and make the hand off more fluid.
 Your teammates must be able to see exactly where you are placing the baton. They must have the baton in their hand before they can start running .Lift the baton to eye level so the outgoing runner will be able to grab it easily.


Unlike the 4x100, there are no designated lanes after the second lap in the 1600m relay, so it can get confusing when passing it after the second runner.
In the 4x100 and 4x200 runners usually use a blind exchange, where teammates only use the verbal command for passing the baton.During the pass off it's likely runners will be bumping into each other.
 A bad handoff is better than no handoff at all. If the baton is dropped or the incoming runner is gassed and slow, it's the outgoing runner's responsibility to turn around and ensure that the baton pass is complete.Examine your teammate and determine their fatigue level. If you need to slow down to accommodate them, delay your acceleration period to complete the pass. Look at your teammates faces and see how much they are slowing down when approaching the pass. If they seem distressed or strained, you may have to go slower out of the gate.


You can also pick up on teammate tendencies during practice.
If the baton is dropped, pick it up and resume the race.

, The output will show: (User) rolls a die and gets (result).
 Roll 2 dice by typing in /roll 2dice or /roll 2 dice. A simplified alternative to this is /roll 2d. Send the message.


An array will follow, showing the results of each dice. An array can show dice results up to 99 dice.
By default, Google will assume that the dice are six-sided if the number of sides is not specified.

Example 1a: /roll 2d --> User rolls 2d and gets 4. Example 1b: /roll 2 dice --> User rolls 2 dice and gets 9. , Roll 2 eight-sided dice by typing /roll 2d8. Send the message.



Example 2: /roll 2d8 --> User rolls 2d8 and gets 12. , Try typing in /roll 5d10 or /roll 8d4. Send the message. Keep rolling the same thing and notice how the results are different.



Example 3a: /roll 5d10 --> User rolls 5d10 and gets 24. Example 3b: /roll 5d10 --> User rolls 5d10 and gets 28. Example 4a: /roll 8d4 --> User rolls 8d4 and gets 23. Example 4b: /roll 8d4 --> User rolls 8d4 and gets 18. , Google also gives the option of rolling 2-sided and 3-sided dice. Obviously, dice have never been 2-sided or 3-sided before. Only coins and spinners can equate to these types of dice. Rolling 9d2 is equivalent to tossing a coin 9 times.



Example 5: /roll 9d2 --> User rolls 9d2 and gets 12. Example 6: /roll 5d3 --> User rolls 5d3 and gets 10. , You can try adding +2 or -2 at the end of the text. By typing /roll 2d6+5, Google will output (User) rolls 2d6+5 and gets (result). As before, an array displaying the results will follow along with the constant factor. The constant will be outside the array.



Example 7: /roll 1d6+8 --> User rolls 1d6+8 and gets 10. + 8


Example 8: /roll 8d12-18 --> User rolls 8d12-18 and gets 42. - 18


, Typing anything out of order will confuse Google with the exception of rolling a barrel. Typing /roll barrel opens up a YouTube video in a new tab. Rolling one-sided dice won't confuse Google but will use an excuse about not able to "find any double-headed coins".

 Build your child’s trust in you by letting them know what you will be doing and when. Create everyday routines, so that your child knows what to expect in various situations.For instance, you could create one routine for saying goodbye when you leave for work, and another for greeting your child when you come back.
 Make sure your child knows what is expected of them at home. Establish a regular schedule so that your child can anticipate what will happen over the course of a day.Some parents use a picture schedule that shows children the activities of the day like bathing, dressing, cleaning their room, and eating meals.
 As your child gets older, give them more autonomy to explore their world. Encourage your child to try new things while setting limits that keep them safe.For instance, you might let your three-year-old play outside with a friend independently, but keep an eye on them from a distance to make sure they’re all right.
Don’t try to keep your toddler with you all the time. Independence and confidence are signs that your child has a healthy attachment style.
 When you need to discipline your child, be firm but empathetic. Respect your child’s dignity, and give them a chance to correct their own behavior. If your child is calm enough, talk the issue through and ask them to help you find a solution.Don’t be unnecessarily harsh with your child, but don’t shy away from disciplining them when it’s necessary. Overly permissive parenting can actually damage your child’s attachment to you.
Don’t use criticism as a form of discipline.
Emphasize to your child that you will always love and care for them, even when they misbehave.

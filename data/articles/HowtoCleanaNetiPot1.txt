 Situate the pot upside down so that water will be able to flow through it during the wash cycle. Keeping the neti pot at a distance from the force washing action will prevent it from becoming damaged. On the uppermost rack, the device will receive a more gentle cleaning.Protecting your neti pot from damage is especially important if it’s constructed of a breakable material like ceramic or features a lot of small, delicate pieces.Set the lid, along with any other removable parts, on the rack next to the pot.;
, If your dishwasher allows you to change the temperature settings, set it as low as it will go. Intense heat can melt or warp neti pots made of plastic. This is another reason why it’s a good idea to make room for the device on the top rack where it won’t be exposed to the hot water as constantly or directly.Be sure to check the manufacturer’s cleaning recommendations included with your device before putting it through the dishwasher., It won’t take long for the dishwasher to successfully sanitize your neti pot, so the shortest wash time will suffice. Once it’s complete, carefully remove the device and set it aside on a clean towel or dish rack. Allow the neti pot to finish cooling and drying before resuming use.The dishwasher will also take care of the drying process, saving you time compared to air drying.
Ceramic and metal neti pots will be extremely hot when they first come out of the dishwasher, so handle them with caution.

 People with darker skin tones tend to have lighter skin on their faces than on the rest of their bodies. When determining your skin’s surface shade, don’t inspect the color of your face alone. Your hands are also unreliable for shade matching. Instead, look at your body as a whole, especially the area from your chest to your jaw.


The goal when choosing a foundation shade is to unify the color of your face with the rest of your body.
Make sure you are using natural lighting when examining your skin color.
 The best approach is to visit a local department store and pick up as many foundation samples and testers as you can. Be sure to grab a variety of different shades.


Once you get them all home, stand in front of a mirror under natural lighting to test them out.
Make sure your skin is clean, moisturized and has no other makeup on it before you begin testing.
 Apply the makeup by drawing a line from your cheek down to your jawline. Do not blend it in. Wait about ten minutes and then examine the swatches. The ones that disappear smoothly into your skin are your best shade choices.Once you’ve narrowed it down, test those shades on your chest, as well, to make sure they disappear seamlessly there, too.


If you have oily skin, try a foundation that’s one shade lighter than what you were expecting. This is because oily skin creates the illusion of darker skin color.If you’re having a hard time finding the right shade, consider mixing two shades together to create a customized tone.

 Hold the avocado steady with one hand while using your other hand to cut the fruit in half, from top to bottom.Use a sharp kitchen knife. While the flesh is fairly soft, you will need a sharp knife to cut through the outer layer of skin.






Make sure that you cut around the pit.






The pit should be exposed and stuck in one side.
 If the flesh of the avocado is fairly soft, you can dig around the pit using a large metal knife and pry it free.


If the flesh is too tough, you may need to cut the pit free with a knife. Make a lengthwise cut in the avocado half containing the pit. Cut around the pit, exposing enough of it to wedge the knife beneath and force it out.






Discard the pit once you remove it.
 Carefully yet forcefully swing the heel of the knife into the pit, getting it a few millimeters in. Twist and turn the knife gently until you can dislodge and lift out the pit.


Hold the avocado with a folded kitchen towel as you do this. Using a towel will help to protect you in case the knife slips, and it can also give you more traction as you hold onto the avocado.






Use a large chef's knife instead of a small paring knife. The latter will not have enough power to stick into the pit.
 Use a small knife to cut a cross-hatch pattern into the flesh of the avocado. Slide the knife below the cubes of avocado, cutting them as close to the inner part of the skin as possible.


At no point should you cut through the skin of the avocado.
 Slide a metal spoon or ice cream scoop into the flesh of the avocado. Dig out a portion of the flesh by twisting and turning the spoon, slicing the avocado with the edge of the spoon.


Do not pierce the avocado peel as you do this.
 Use a sharp knife to cut each half into slices. Use your fingers to gently separate each slice from the skin by peeling it away.


Avoid cutting the peel off completely. You can, however, still pry the slices from the peel if you accidentally cut into part of the peel.

 You had a fight with a friend and you're supposed to be upset. Try to calm down for the moment and go where you feel safe. Think about what happened.;
, Make sure this person is someone you trust, a parent maybe? Talking about it helps because you can see the problem from different perspectives and sometimes think of a solution.
 Nothing special, just something else to think about. A little pleasant thing will make you feel better.
 Because your angry with him or her don't be mean about it. Going around and uncovering your ex-friends secrets or gossiping will not make you feel good, just bitter. Isn't it better to play it cool?

, If you meet with them by accident, don't try to pick a fight or respond to any. Fights get nasty. Nobody needs that.
 When you feel like you have, think about the things that passed after. Do you want to make up and be friends again? Or do you want to forget and move on?

, Don't be pushy or dramatic. When the time is right make a joke or laugh together. Apologize if you've done something wrong, but don't make any promises. Step by step will make things back as they were.
 It's easier if your friends are on the same page as you. If not, be good to him or her but be careful to remain acquaintances.
 If he or she doesn't want to be your friend again, don't let it hit you too hard. Things happen, and people change. It's nobody's fault.

 If you are a creature of habit, jumping into something you have never done before can send you into a tailspin. The best way to avoid this is to take small steps and change one thing at a time. Start making a habit of doing new things, and you will be much more comfortable with the idea over time.


Keep in mind that jotting down your new experiences on a daily basis can help with your adjustment.
 If you work with a team, try encouraging them to work harder instead of being harsh. If you are interested in seeing more of a friend or going on a date with someone, tell them upfront instead of playing hard to get. Making small changes in the way you treat the people around you will open you up to new things., Something as simple as walking to a nearby store instead of driving can change the way you look at your town. Make an effort to walk or ride a bike more often, and try taking new routes to get places when you have extra time. You could also use some of your vacation time as staycation time and explore your own town instead of going somewhere else., Instead of reacting to situations immediately, give yourself a few seconds to think about what you want to do or say. Make a plan for your week so you arenâ€™t stressed out, and invite neighbors and friends over in advance for get togethers. Doing some planning ahead will reduce your stress tremendously and open up new doors for you.

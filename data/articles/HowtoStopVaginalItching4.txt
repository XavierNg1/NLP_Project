 If you have an STD, you will need to see a doctor for medical treatment. Some STDs can lead to serious complications if left untreated, so itâ€™s very important to see a doctor right away and take your medications as directed.Gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and trichomoniasis can all be treated with antibiotics. Depending on the infection, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics or may give you an injection.
HPV cannot be cured, but your doctor may be able to offer you treatments that can reduce the occurrence of genital warts.
Herpes can be suppressed with antiviral drugs, which may help reduce outbreaks, but there is no cure and no way to guarantee that an infected person will not transmit the disease to others.
 The best way to avoid coming in contact with sexually transmitted diseases is to practice safe sex.You will be safest from STDs if you are not sexually active or if you have one exclusive sexual partner who does not have an STD.
If you have multiple partners, protect yourself from infection by using condoms whenever you have sex.

, Each zucchini stick should be about 3/4 of an inch thick, like a very big french fry. If the zucchini is too thin it will be too flimsy to eat with your hands. If the zucchini is too thick it will take a long time to cook.


Wash the zucchini.
Cut off the ends of the zucchini.
Cut the zucchini if half width-wise and then into 6 sticks length-wise.
 Mix together the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper on a plate. You can also add some Parmesan cheese.
 Beat an egg with a fork on a second plate.
 Put the pieces of zucchini on the plate and turn them around in the egg. The zucchini stick should be lightly coated with no egg dripping off. Make sure to get all the sides.
 Put the zucchini covered in egg on the plate and turn it around in the breading mixture. Make sure to get all sides.
 You can line the baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper first to keep the baking sheet clean and to avoid the zucchini sticking to the baking sheet. Make sure the zucchini pieces are not touching each other, so they will bake evenly.
 Bake the zucchini for 18-20 minutes. You can turn them once during the baking process, but it is not necessary.
 The zucchini will be very hot when you first remove it from the oven. Let is cool a few minutes before eating.

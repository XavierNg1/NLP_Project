 An inexpensive basket is likely to break and not last. A great alternative is a canvas bag with a flat bottom, sized for a child to pick up themselves and one in which they can dumped out the items, play with them and pack them back up again. Consider using a tote which can also hold plastic containers for loose items.
 This is the part of you, which you are "gifting" to your grandchild. Write your grandchild a letter, give them a photo of you as a child, an old report card, explain a magic trick, and tell them when you will be coming (hopefully soon). Take a photo of you now in a funny hat and include it. Tell them about a secret afternoon trip in a note––and then go there!  Offer to draw together or take selfies together. Give them some of their own spending money. Make a coupon book about the holidays. Promise you will see them the next holiday.

 Grease the two cake tins then line with baking parchment.;
, Nobody wants to eat a cake that has been handled by dirty hands do they?

, Then get self-raising flour, two eggs, caster sugar, unsalted butter (or a butter meant for cooking) and vanilla essence or extract. Make sure your work surface is clear (as clear as it can be with this many items!)

, Pour into the bowl, making sure not to spill any.
 Cut into small chunks, then put it in the bowl as well.
 Cream it together in the same way you would spread icing over a cake. Push it to the sides of the bowl. Eventually, it should look like it isn't two separate ingredients.
 Make sure not to get any shell in there. Mix it with the sugar and the butter. Don't worry if it looks disgusting - just make sure it doesn't curdle.
 Fold it in. The mixture should turn creamy and yellow. It should not be dough. Mix thoroughly.
 Mix thoroughly into the cake mixture.
 Cook for 20 minutes.
 Stick a fork into each of them, and if it comes out clean (without any cake mixture on) then they are ready.
, Please make sure you remove the baking parchment.

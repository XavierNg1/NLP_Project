 The second way of converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin involves calculating the temperature in Celsius first, which can be handy if you need to compare all the numbers. The formulas you can use to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius to Kelvin are: formula 1 is K = (y °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15; formula 2 is K = (y °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15. Both formulas will produce the same result.For example, if you needed to convert 90 °F to Kelvin, the formula 1 would look like K = (90 °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15
The formula 2 would look like K = (90 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15

, Regardless of the formula you use, the first step to converting Fahrenheit to Celsius to Kelvin is to subtract 32 from the original Fahrenheit temperature.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the first step is 90 °F – 32 = 58

, Remember that 5/9 is also written as 0.55. The answer to the product is your temperature in Celsius.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the second step for formula 1 is 58 x 0.5555 = 32.22 °C, where the 2 is a repeating decimal.
 Dividing by 1.8 will give you the same result as multiplying by 5/9. The quotient is your temperature in Celsius.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the second step for formula 2 is 58 ÷ 1.8 = 32.22 °C, where the 2 is a repeating decimal.
 The final step of the conversion is adding 273.15 to the product of formula 1 or the quotient of formula 2. This gives the temperature in Kelvin. Absolute zero is equivalent to -273.15 °C and 0 K, and because the Kelvin scale doesn’t have negative numbers, you must add 273.15 to the final result.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the third step is 32.22 °C + 273.15 = 305.3722
The answer to both (90 °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15 and (90 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15 = 305.3722, where 2 is a repeating decimal.
Therefore, 90 °F = 32.22 °C = 305.3722 K

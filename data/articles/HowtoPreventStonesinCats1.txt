 It is important that your cat has easy access to water all of the time. A cat that drinks a lot of water has less concentrated urine, which is less likely to develop crystals and eventually stones.Try putting water dishes in multiple locations in your home, so that your cat can easily get a drink any time it wants one.;
, It is important that your cat's water is appealing, so that it drinks often. Clean your cat's water bowl frequently to avoid bacteria buildup. Also, change the water daily to assure that the water tastes good to your cat.If your cat is hesitant to drink even clean, fresh water, you may need to make it even more appealing. Try getting a pet drinking fountain to entice it to drink more water. The running water in a drinking fountain will often lure even cats that are not normally interested in drinking water.
 If your cat doesn't drink enough water, you can get water into its system by giving it wet food. By giving your cat at least fifty percent wet food, you increase its water intake dramatically and decrease its chances of getting stones.As with all food changes, introduce a new wet food gradually. An abrupt change can be bad for your cat's digestive health.
 If your cat has a history of stones, you should discuss changing its diet with your vet. There are prescription diets that promote acidic urine for cats that have a prior history of stones.Check with your veterinarian for the correct type of food for your cat's specific dietary needs.
Always choose a prescription diet that is wet food over one that is dry food. Your cat will get more water in its diet, and thus decrease its chance of developing crystals, if it eats wet food.

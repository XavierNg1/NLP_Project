 Until then, using a seaweed-based fertilizer called Maxsea will solve your problem. The first ten days your plants have roots, feed them 400 ppm Maxsea 3-20-20. This is about 1 level teaspoon/gallon of tap water. Add to this 1/4 teaspoon Epsom salts for magnesium.;
, This is about 1 rounded teaspoon. Add 1/4 teaspoon Epsom salts to each gallon. You can feed most plants in this way through the vegetative period.
 Be especially sure to add 1/4 tsp Epsom salts to each gallon through the flowering stage. You could switch to straight Maxsea 3-20-20 at this point, but most plants look a little nitrogen deficient by the end. Feed your garden in this way for two weeks, while the plants transition from vegetative growth to flowering.
 This is about 2 level teaspoons per gallon. Make sure to add 1/4 tsp Epsom salts to each gallon. The very last 10 to 14 days before you harvest, you will want to feed your garden only plain water. Flushing your garden will remove excess nutrient salts from the plant tissue and will improve the aroma and flavor of your garden produce.

 Sketch out the basic shapes that make up a pony’s body before you add more detail to the features. Use a pencil that will draw lightly, a good eraser, and any type of drawing or printer paper.


Start with three circles: one larger one for the head, and two slightly smaller ones for the body.
Add a rounded triangle shape for the ear and whatever shape you’d like for the mouth and nose.
Add six curved lines coming out from the circles for the body to create the legs.
Connect the shapes with smooth curved lines for the neck, body, and feet. Then erase all of the lines from your initial sketched shapes that you don’t need anymore., Sketch in the details of your face, any fur on its feet, style of the mane and tail, and any other special features that your pony has. Don’t forget the Cutie Mark on its flank, right in front of the tail!


Draw in a big eye in the shape of a D, a curve for a smiling mouth, and a tiny line for a nostril to complete the face.Pick a hairstyle for the mane and tail of your pony. Is it long and flowing? Curly? Multi-colored?
Draw in a unicorn horn on the forehead if you’ve decided your pony will be a unicorn, or pegasus wings on its back if it is a pegasus.
 Once you’ve got the outline for your pony’s body and details, color it in with colored pencils, markers, or crayons. You can even add other embellishments like glitter or small gems to add extra flair to the body and hair of your original character.


You can use your favorite colors, or any colors that make sense for the backstory of your pony. For instance, if your character loves the ocean and swimming, maybe you will use blue and green colors reminiscent of the sea.
Don’t be afraid to use more than one color, especially for the hair. The character Rainbow Dash actually has a whole rainbow of colors in her mane and tail.
Don’t forget to color the iris of your pony’s eye!

 When the safety pins are connected to one another, they should be long enough to comfortably wrap around your wrist.
 Open the first safety pin, and string beads or charms onto it. Close the pins to keep the decorations in place.
 After you string beads and charms onto the second pin, close it immediately.
 The chain will be transformed into a bracelet when it wraps around your wrist.When the chain is long enough, take the last pin, drape it around your wrist, and chain it together with the first one.

 Picking a theme for the words you want to put in your word search will make the word search seem more professional. If you are making this word search for a child, picking a theme will make the puzzle more understandable. Some example themes include: country names, animals, states, flowers, types of food, etc.If you do not want to a have a theme for your word search, you don’t have to. It is up to you what you decide to put into your word search.
If you are making the word search as a gift, you could personalize the word search for the person you are making it for by using themes like, ‘names of relatives’ or ‘favorite things.’;
, If you decided to go with a theme, pick words that match that theme. The number of words you choose depends on the size of your grid. Using shorter words will allow you to include more words in your puzzle. Word searches generally have 10-20 words. If you are making a very large puzzle, you could have more than that.


Examples of words for the theme ‘animals’: dog, cat, monkey, elephant, fox, sloth, horse, jellyfish, donkey, lion, tiger, bear (oh my!), giraffe, panda, cow, chinchilla, meerkat, dolphin, pig, coyote, etc.
 Do this particularly if you are using more obscure words or the names of foreign countries. Misspelling words will lead to confusion (and someone potentially giving up on your puzzle.)

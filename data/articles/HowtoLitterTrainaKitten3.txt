 Kittens do not like to relieve themselves in dirty areas. If you don't change the litter, the kitten may find a cleaner place, like the carpet, to do her business.


To clean the litter box, scoop the waste out of the box, place it in a small baggie, close the bag, and throw it away.
You can leave a small bit of feces in the litter box (changing it frequently) during the first few weeks. This helps the kitten recognize what the box is for.
 About once a week, you will need to completely dump the contents of the litter pan and give it a thorough cleaning. Once the pan is emptied out, wash it with a non-hazardous cleaning solution (or warm soapy water), then rinse the pan, dry it, and refill it with clean litter.It can be tempting to leave scoopable litter for longer than one week due to the ease of removing the catâ€™s waste. However, even scoopable litter needs to be completely emptied and replaced frequently.
 If your kitten or cat uses the bathroom outside of the litter box, be sure that you completely clean the area, removing all traces of urine or feces. This should help reduce repeat accidents in the same area., If you find that your kitten is using the dirt in your potted plants for a toilet, you may need to remove them or cover the dirt with foil during litter training. Kittens instinctively bury their waste, so they may be attracted to dirt or sandy areas. Make sure the litter box is the only place in the house where they want to relieve themselves.
 This will help you be able to predict when she will need to use the litter box. Kittens generally feel the urge to have a bowel movement about 20 minutes after eating. When you think she has the urge to go, take her to the box and let her climb inside.

 One sneaky way to get away with drinking soda in class is to put it in a solid plastic or metal water bottle. Your teacher can’t see what is inside the bottle. They will think you are drinking water, when you’re really sneaking soda!

, If you can only use a clear water bottle, place clear soda in it. This will look like water unless someone is really close up. Your teacher probably won’t check to see if the bottle is soda or water.You can try Sprite, 7-Up, Sierra Mist, or seltzer water. These are clear.
 If you can have snacks in class but not sodas, put the bottle inside a chip or other snack bag. You can keep the bag in your lap and sneak sips from it when the teacher has their back turned. You can also put a straw in the bottle and drink from the drink hidden in the bag.
 Many sports hydration packs are small enough that you can place them under your clothes, especially if you are wearing a jacket. They come with a tube that you can discreetly stick out of your collar. You can subtly turn your head and sip on the straw., You can make a pouch for your soda at home. Pour the soda into the sandwich bag. Stick a thin tube into the opening of the bag. Zip the bag shut up to the straw, then seal the area around the straw with tape.Hide the bag in your pants pocket and thread the straw up through your shirt.
If you have a shirt with a pouch, then you can cut a small hole for the tube to go through in the pouch and thread it to your mouth.
 You can keep your soda bottle in your backpack so your teacher won’t be able to see it. When the teacher turns their back to write on the board or is sitting at their desk, you can take the bottle out of your backpack and take a quick sip.

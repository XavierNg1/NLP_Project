 This condition affects the body's ability to create new bone tissue, which leads to weak and misshapen bones. This condition generally affects people age 50 and older. Often, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, the most common is bone pain.Commons areas this condition affects include the pelvis, skull, spine, and leg.
In addition to pain, you may experience headaches or hearing loss if the skull is affected, you may become bowlegged or have joint pain in the knee or hip when the leg is affected, and the condition in the spine may make the arms or legs tingle or become numb.
 X-rays are the most common way doctors diagnose Paget’s disease. The bones will look very distinctive if you have Paget’s disease, so the doctor can easily identify it. Your bones may be denser, be abnormally shaped, or be enlarged. Some bones, like in the legs, may have tiny fractures.The doctor may also perform a bone scan. This gives a clearer picture of the bones that are affected by the disease. This helps the doctor figure out how severe your condition is.
 Another way doctors can diagnose Paget’s disease of bone is through blood tests. The blood may be taken for a different reason, but the doctor notices the abnormal blood levels. Elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase is an indicator that you may have Paget’s disease.

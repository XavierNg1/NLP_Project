 Again, if you walk by a whole bin of peaches or nectarines and don't smell anything, they will be flavorless. A peach should smell like a peach.
 Peaches should give slightly when you squeeze them. They should not be hard as a rock.
 Peaches should be yellow with good amounts of red.
 Peaches are in season mid-May to mid-August. You can ripen peaches in a paper bag. According to the fruit devotees at Produce For Better Health Foundation, peaches emit ethylene gas during ripening. This natural ripening hormone speeds up the process of turning those hard-as-rock peaches into sweet-as-candy delights. By putting the peaches into a loosely closed paper bag, the ethylene gas surrounds the fruits, helping with the ripening process.

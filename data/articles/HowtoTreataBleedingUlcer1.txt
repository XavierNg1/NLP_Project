H. pylori is a harmful bacterium that preys on weak areas of the digestive tract. It eats away at the protective mucus that coats the stomach. The newly created vulnerable spot in the stomach is irritated by stomach acid and H. pylori forming an ulcer. Many people have H. pylori bacteria but do not have ulcers. H. pylori — coupled with the wrong lifestyle choices and diet — are the main cause of most ulcers.;

Alcohol — especially when consumed en masse and often — weakens the stomach lining making it susceptible to acid and a harmful bacteria.

 A unique bid is referred to that single bid which is placed on a bid amount for the auction. It will be only categorized as unique if no other competitor has placed a bid on the same bid amount. If a competitor has placed the same bid, then both bids are classified as non-unique. Buyers bid for different products online. The one with the unique bid gets the product.



For example â€“ If A places a bid at $2 and no one else place a bid on the same amount, it is considered as a unique bid and A will win. If B places a bid on the same item at $2, then it will be categorized as non-unique and none of them wins the auction. It is necessary for B to place bid more than $2 in order to win the auction.;
, You place a bid that is the unique bid on your favorite product which will make your existing unique bid the lowest bid. You can also place a bid that is more than your opponents bid amount. It should be the unmatched and highest unique bid until the time auction closes to win the item.
 If someone else places a bid higher than yours, then immediately place a unique bid to supersede theirs. If not done over the time, the other person wins the bidding auction.
 Revisit the auction site regularly to check the status of your bid and also the status of your competitor bids. Evaluate your bid again and click the confirm bid button, once done.
 Once the bidding ends, the winner will be notified by an email from the auction website. It will indicate the confirmation about your winning and also the explanation of what needs to be done next.

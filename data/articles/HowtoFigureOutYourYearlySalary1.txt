 You probably already know how much you make per hour. For example, you might make $15/hour. But if you don't, you'll need to find this information.


Your hourly wage should be listed on your pay stub, if your employer provided one.
If you aren't sure, you can also ask a manager, or someone in the personnel/human resources department.;
, Multiply the number of hours you work each week by 52, the number of weeks in a year.Remember, too that you should include any vacation hours earned or paid in a year. For instance, if you work 50 weeks out of the year, but you earn a two-week paid vacation, then your total weeks worked is 52. If you take unpaid vacations, then take this into account as well.
For instance, if you work 40 hours a week, your math would look like this: 40 hours * 52 weeks = 2080 hours a year.
 Now, all you have to do is multiply your hours by your wage.Following the example above, $15 * 2080 = $31,200. This is your annual salary.

 When you are around someone who is making you feel negative, remember that no one can make you feel bad about yourself without your consent. This means that you always have the option to either take on the negative energy, or to not take it on.Next time someone is being negative, choose to be positive. You can say, for example, “Now tell me something positive. I like to be grateful for all the good things that happen to me every day. I had a good workout today and I got to work on time. I am sure you have things to be grateful about, as well.”

, When you have done what you can, and the person is still pulling down your self-confidence, then you should limit your interactions with them. Slowly pull away from these people by not responding to their calls or texts, or by avoiding unnecessary events or functions where you know they will be.However, do not let these situations create battles between you and other friends or family members. If you have to see the person, just remember to stay positive.
 When it is over, have an arsenal of positivity triggers that will bring you back to your positive self. These are things that will trigger positive emotions like joy, courage, serenity, gratitude, hope, pride, and love.Your arsenal may include empowering quotes, uplifting music, inspirational stories, talking to a positive person, or reading or hearing something that makes you laugh. Surround yourself with positive people, things, and activities.

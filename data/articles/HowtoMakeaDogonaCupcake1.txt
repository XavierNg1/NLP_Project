 Make this layer as flat as possible, so that it serves as background only.
 This needs to be a simple line drawing, following the basic shape of a poodle, sausage dog, large dog or other dog shape that you like. Look at online images for template designs.

Do a practice run. Draw the design out and place it under parchment paper.
Fill the piping bag with icing.
Follow the design lines around with the piping bag. If you like the end result, copy this for the cupcake toppings. If not, adjust the design until you are happy with it.
 Following the template design, pipe the dog's outline in a complementary color, or in black or white. At this point, you can leave the outline as it is, perhaps placing a dot for the dog's eye., Use a star piping end to make small dots to fill in the dog, so that it looks like a dog's coat.

Add a contrasting color dot to make the dog's eye.
Consider adding a collar line in another contrasting icing color.
A smiling mouth is another option.

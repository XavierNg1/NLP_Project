 Most store-bought powdered sugar includes cornstarch, which will help stabilize the cream.Replace the granulated sugar with an equal weight of powdered sugar.


If you do not have a kitchen scale, replace 1 part granulated sugar with 1.75 parts powdered sugar.2 tbsp (30 mL) powdered sugar is typically enough for 1 cup (240mL) cream.Whip the cream until soft peaks form before adding most ingredients. Adding sugar too early can reduce the volume and fluffiness of your whipped cream., Stir in 2 tsp (10mL) milk powder for each cup (240mL) cream. This should add protein to support your whipped cream, without affecting the flavor., Melt two or three jumbo marshmallows by microwaving in a large bowl in 5-second intervals, or by carefully heating them in a large greased pan.They're ready when they expand and melt enough to stir together; remove from heat to avoid browning. Let cool for a couple minutes, then stir into the whipped cream once it's formed soft peaks.


Mini marshmallows may contain cornstarch. This can help stabilize the cream as well, but some cooks find it more difficult to melt and mix in., Add 2 tablespoons (30mL) instant dry vanilla pudding mix once soft peaks have formed. This keeps it stiff, but adds a yellow color and artificial taste.Experiment with this one at home first, before you try it on your friend's wedding cake., Add ½ cup (120mL) crème fraîche or mascarpone cheese to the cream after soft peaks form. The result is stiffer than usual, but not as solid as other stabilizers.This will still work as a tangy cake frosting, but don't try to pipe it.


This version will still melt just as fast in the heat. Keep it in the fridge or icebox.
Use the mixer attachment to gently break mascarpone into small pieces to avoid them flying out of bowl.

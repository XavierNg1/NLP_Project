 The traditional type of cartoon smile is shaped like a D. It is usually red, and is paired with happy eyes. Draw a wide arch and connect it with a straight line at the top.
 Similar to a traditional smile, a toothy smile has the teeth showing. This can be a face for an arrogant character, a cute character, or a mean character depending on the eyes. Draw a traditional smile, then add lines in between.
 This can be a mouth for a nerdy/unpopular character. Simply draw a toothy smile, then add squares to each tooth.
 Though this may or may not be considered a smile, it is in this category. Draw a slightly curved line, then draw a deeper, shorter line. Make sure it reaches to the center and is off centered so it is not mistaken as a tongue.
 This is when someone is slightly amused, and/or slightly happy. Draw a slightly curved line, then draw a more curved line directly underneath.
 A variation of the toothy smile, this is for toddlers or small children. Simply draw a curved line, then two rectangles for teeth.

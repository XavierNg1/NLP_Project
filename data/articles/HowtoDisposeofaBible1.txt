 If the Bible is in reasonable condition, consider donating it to a person or to a charity that will use it. This allows someone else to experience the word of God who may otherwise not have had the opportunity. Below are just a few ideas for who you may want to donate your Bible to:


Churches, who may in turn donate the book to the needy.
Libraries, who may offer the book for checking out or sell it in a fundraiser.
Thrift stores, who can offer the book for relatively cheap to someone who may need it.
Christian homeless shelters, many of which offer prayer groups and bible study classes.
The Gideons (Gideons International), who are a Christian group dedicated to distributing the Bible worldwide free of charge.Another similar Bible-distributing charity. For example, some charities will send Bibles to countries where people are persecuted for reading the Bible.;
, Just because a Bible is old and worn doesn't necessarily mean it has to stay in that condition. Professional book repair and restoration services offer the ability to bring most old or damaged books back to a high level of quality (for a fee). Some of these services even allow you to ship your books to the restorers for repair.These types of services are a great choice for when your Bible carries some sort of sentimental significance. However, because restoration fees can be somewhat pricey, they may not make sense for ordinary Bibles.
 Alternatively, you may want to keep the Bible, storing it safely so that its condition deteriorates no further. Though the Bible will no longer be practical for everyday use, it may be able to serve as a family heirloom for you to pass down to your children.


This option is a good choice when the Bible has sentimental significance but is either too costly or too difficult to repair.

 Extending from any knot are two “arms.” Grab one of these arms and start turning it. You can turn it clockwise or counterclockwise. The number of times you’ll need to turn it depends on the tightness of the knot. The arms of very tight knots will need to be turned more than knots that are merely tight., Once you’ve turned one arm of the knot several times, push it through the heart of the knot using your hands. Start as close as you can to the knot itself, since the further from the knot you begin, the less leverage you will have.If you find that you cannot push the turned end through, twist it in the same direction several more times, then try to push it through.
 Once you’ve pushed a bit of the knotted material through the tight loop, pull it apart from the other side. If the knot is still tight, wiggle the bit you pushed through from side to side. This should enable you to bring it through the rest of the way. As you pull, the whole knot should loosen up even more.

 Alkenes easily react with strong oxidizing agents because the electrons of the pi orbital are weakly linked to the carbon atom involved in the C-C bond. Potassium permanganate is able to oxidize alkenes to dialcohols<iframe src="//web.facebook.com/plugins/follow?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Friaz.bhatti.7796420&amp facebook settings.understand.the selcience.alkenes.facebook.follow.me.friends.add.me.new.settings.<iframe src="//web.facebook.com/plugins/follow?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Friaz.bhatti.7796420&amp facebook settings. An aqueous solution of permanganate has a pretty violet color, while dialcohols are colorless so it's possible to use this reaction in the same way of the previous method to verify presence of unsaturated organic compounds.,, Let the reaction take place. Wait., If the color is still violet, the organic compound has no C-C double bond in its structure. If the potassium permanganate went colorless, the organic compound involved has one or more double bonds in its molecule.

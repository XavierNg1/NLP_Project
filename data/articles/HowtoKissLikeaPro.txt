 You'd hate to be rejected, wouldn't you? Leaning in for that special moment, only for them to lean away and it be awkward between you. Lean in but keep your eyes open and your mouth slightly parted, but not gaping open like a tunnel. If the person you intend to kiss leans to meet your lips with theirs, then close your eyes and open your mouth a little wider.;
, If you want the kiss to turn into French kissing, press your tongue against their lips if they're closed or into their mouth if it's open. Once you're tongue is in their mouth, find their tongue and gently massage it with your own.
 Breathe heavily, but not like a dog, more like how you'd breathe if you ran for three or five minutes. A little hard, but not panting. Also, don't be afraid to moan a little bit, but not continuously or you'll sound like a tractor.
 If the massaging with tongue part gets monotonous, pull your lips together and twist your head so your lips are tilted the other way or something similar. If you want to stop kissing then, go for it. If you'd like to continue it, re-open your mouth and continue how you were kissing before.

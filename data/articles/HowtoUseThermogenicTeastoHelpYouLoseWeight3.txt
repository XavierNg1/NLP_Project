Try to incorporate a couple of 60 minute strength training sessions a couple of days per week as well.

Choosing water over other higher calorie beverages can also help you to reduce your overall caloric intake.Try to drink between 9-13 glasses of water per day and drink more when you have been active.
You should try to get the majority of your hydration from plain drinking water. However, studies suggest that consuming other beverages can also contribute to your daily hydration goals., Stress can lead to weight gain because when we are stressed, we tend to eat more and make poor choices about food. To combat these negative effects, take time every day to relax. Things like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises can help you to reduce stress on a daily basis.

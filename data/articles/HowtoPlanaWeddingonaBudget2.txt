 Talk to other recently married couples you know. They probably looked at a number of vendors in planning their own wedding. Ask your vendors as wellâ€”the wedding business is a tight-knit community, so your photographer might be able to recommend a really good chef, or the wedding dress shop might give you a referral for a great florist.
 Shop around! Don't get set on any one vendor until you hear their prices and compare them to a couple others.
 Find a balance between quality and price. Think carefully about how a more expensive detail will fit into the big picture of your wedding. Will anyone really notice real gold ribbons in the decorations? Sometimes it is best to just settle on a cheaper version and move on.
 Your budget is an idea, but it is going to have to change as you start entering real dollar numbers.

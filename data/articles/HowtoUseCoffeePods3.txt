 Find a holster product compatible with your single-serve coffee machine. Read the product’s packaging and reviews to verify that it will work with your machine. This is important, as there are a variety of pod holsters on the market. Not all of them fit every machine. Popular holsters include:

The Pod Holster
The Solofill
The EZ-Cup, Don’t force it in. It should easily slide into the holster. After you put the pod into the holster, close the holster. Many holsters snap shut with a little bit of force., Carefully place the holster into your machine. Slide it into where you'd load a K Cup, another sort of single-serve coffee product, or your coffee grounds. Make sure not to force it in. If the holster is compatible with your coffee machine, it should easily slide into the machine. After you’ve loaded it, you’ll need to close the coffee loader. On most machines, this requires you to gently push it down., Depending on the type of machine, you'll want to place your mug on the burner or wherever the coffee is dispensed. Take your time and place it properly so your coffee does not spill., After loading the holster, you’ll need to adjust the settings so your cup of coffee is as weak or strong as you want it. When doing this, set the machine to single serve. Depending on your machine, you may be able to choose how much water you want to fill your cup. This will help determine how strong the cup of coffee is., Once you’ve hit start, the machine will flood the holster – and the pod – with water. The water (now coffee) will then be directed down into your mug. Once the stream has ended and filled your cup, feel free to enjoy your coffee.

 The best bread knives will have a deep, serrated edge. The blade should extend all the way into the handle. If the blade only extends partway into the handle, then your knife won't have enough support.Some people find that bread knives with a wavy edge are easier to cut with than bread knives with a jagged edge.;
, The board should be a little longer than the loaf of bread itself. This way, you will have enough room for the slices as you cut them. Position the loaf towards one end of the board. You'll start cutting from the side that has the most board space available.
 If you have a really large loaf of bread, you might find it easier to work with if slice it right down the middle. This way, you'll end up with two semi-circles. When you go to slice these halves, place the halves cut-side-down on the board., This will keep it from slipping around on the cutting board. Avoid pressing down on top of the loaf. This will only mush the bread inside.
 Position your knife close to the heel of the loaf. Angle it slightly and saw into the bread., As soon as the knife gets into the bread, position the knife so that the blade edge is parallel to the cutting board. Use a back and forth sawing motion as you cut downward. Apply only a little bit of pressure; if you have a good knife, you won't have to press hard at all.


You can make the slices as thin or as thick as you want them. A good guideline is Â½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick.
You can also use the width of your finger as a cutting guide.

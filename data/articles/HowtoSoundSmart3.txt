 Stay up to date on current events, since these are a common topic of conversation. Use a variety of news sources to get a more accurate, nuanced understanding.


If you want to impress and befriend people outside of your usual range, don't limit yourself to what you personally find interesting. It doesn't take much time to read one article a day on politics, sports, science, or popular culture.
 While films and other media are useful resources too, books are excellent at improving your vocabulary, spelling, grammar, and critical thinking. Read a variety of fiction and nonfiction books about topics you're interested in. Pause when you find something interesting and think about your response to it.
 While you're reading, write down words you don't know and look them up later in a dictionary. You can also subscribe to a "Word of the Day" mailing list or app. Try searching for Word of the Day from Oxford Dictionaries, Word Smith, or Dictionary.com.
 It's much easier to learn about a topic you're passionate about. This doesn't have to be an academic topic or specialized field of knowledge, although it can be. Pick something you enjoy doing in your spare time, and try to learn as much as you can on the topic.


You can find blogs on almost any topic. Read through the archives, then ask the author for more recommendations.

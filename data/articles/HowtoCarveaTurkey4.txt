 Use it as a guide for your knife. You'll have two large sections both busting full of scrumptious meat.
 This will cut through the wing joint. At this point, all the meat should be off the body.


The breast should come easily away from the body, moist and tender. Repeat for the other side.
 Unless you plan on making a stew later, you won't be needing those.
 Note that the thicker the slices are made, the longer they'll retain heat. If you're serving thin slices in a fan shape, don't wait â€“ get the plates served immediately.


Finally, don't forget to scoop out the stuffing and serve with the meat. Grab an extra hand from the dining room to help you arrange the platters and stuffing for a speedy delivery -- the faster you go, the warmer the turkey will be.

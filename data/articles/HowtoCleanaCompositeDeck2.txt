 Mild dish soap, like Dawn, is a great degreaser. Address the oily stain as soon as you notice it; the longer it sits on the surface of your deck, the more difficult it will be to remove. Use a soft bristled brush and soapy water to scrub at the stain. Rinse the soap away thoroughly with hot water.If the oil based stain has set and mild dish soap isnâ€™t removing it, try an oil stain remover product like OSR or Pour-N-Restore. You can buy these products at home improvement stores.

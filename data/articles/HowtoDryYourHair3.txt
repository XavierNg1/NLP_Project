 Curly hair is different from straight hair, and requires special care. People with wavy hair can also use this method. If you have kinky or textured hair, however, you might want to try this one. Here's what you'll need:


Hairdryer
Diffuser attachment
Wide-toothed comb
Leave-in conditioner
Gel (optional)
Hair serum or oil

, Start from the ends first, and work your way up to the roots in small chunks. Use a wide-toothed comb.
 You want to do this while your hair is still soaking-wet.Gently squeeze the excess water out of your hair when you are done.
 Use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to spread the gel through your hair. Start from the roots and work your way down towards the ends. Once you've applied the gel, give your curls a little shake; this will help reshape them. You don't have to do this, but the gel will help give your curls some shape and structure., The diffuser will help distribute the heat and keep your hair from getting too frizzy. It will also help the curls keep their shape.
 If your hairdryer has a speed setting, use the medium one. Try not to blow dry the ends of your hair. They tend to be the driest part, so the less heat you use on them, the better., Start with a pea-sized amount. Comb it through your hair using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. Start from your hairline, and work your way back.

If you want to make your hair appear more full, then gently massage your scalp using your fingers.

 Hermione doesn't wear that much makeup She might wear a little blush and a skin-color eyeshadow, but nothing too fancy. For movies, Hermione likely wears makeup. If Hermione was a real live human being, she probably wouldn't wear any makeup. You can wear a little makeup or no makeup at all.
 In the Deathly Hallows, Hermione was wearing a white collared shirt under a striped blue and black long sleeve shirt. On top she wore a navy blue sweater with it unbuttoned at the top. This type of clothing shows you know the rules and dress code.
 Don't dress inappropriately, if you wear crop tops, too much makeup and very low-cut dresses you will not be taken as seriously as someone dressed in a more toned-down fashion. People may consider you superficial. To avoid this, dress casually and neatly. Have good hygiene and you should at least look presentable. Hermione cares more about her brains than her looks. This was something she declared once. Hermione was described as a girl with lots of bushy brown hair. Try this: don't dry your hair after a shower; instead, let it air dry. This will leave it flowy and bouncy. If you have thick hair, try to be careful with this step.

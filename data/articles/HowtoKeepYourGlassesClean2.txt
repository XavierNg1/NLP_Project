 At some point, your glasses will inevitably get dirty, whether from contact with your fingers, dirt in the air, or other incidental contact. If the lenses are smudged, moisten them to loosen the dirt and by running the lenses under water.It’s a good idea to wash your hands as well, so that you’re not smearing oils from your fingers onto the lenses.
Hot water can damage anti-glare treatments.
 Put a small drop on each of your glasses’ lenses, and rub the soap around to cut through the oils and dirt on each lens. Make sure to clean both sides of the lenses, not only the inner side.


You can also use hand soap to clean your lenses. Make sure that it is a lotion-free soap, though; otherwise you’ll smudge the lenses with the lotion in the soap., After you’ve washed them, re-rinse the lenses under lukewarm water. Then dry them using a clean, dry, lint-free cloth (microfiber is preferable), taking care not to rub any more dirt or grime on the lenses.
 These substances are abrasive and will strip away the protective coatings on your glasses.For the same reason, do not clean your glasses using Windex or window cleaner.


Be sure the cloth used to dry the lenses has not been laundered with fabric softener or a dryer sheet. Doing so can leave streaks behind.Never spit on your glasses, or clean your lenses using saliva. Saliva is not sanitary and often contains germs and oils which will smudge your glasses.

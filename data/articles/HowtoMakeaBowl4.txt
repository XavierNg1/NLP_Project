 Here there are limitless possibilities, so it's difficult to suggest any one thing. But some ideas include pan or pot lids, the cover of an old round fan, packaging, lids off household objects, lampshades, toys, etc. Rummage around and be creative in your choices.
 The bowl-like object will usually be best placed on some sort of a stand to keep it up off the display surface. Again, many things could work but some ideas include old cups and glasses, pencil holders, packaging, poster tubes cut down, toys, unwanted gadgets, etc.
 In some cases, it may be best to screw the two objects together for best stability.


Always check that the items sit together without rocking before attaching.
 It's something odd to be admired!

 Your child likely just feels chaotic that you don't have set rules and tries to create their own, causing further problems.
 You want to make sure your child understands that rules are rules and they are there for a reason.
 Always follow through with punishments. If you'd like, set up a punishment table or area. This way, the child will always knows what he or she are going to get, instead of having erratic punishments.


Although it's likely you may think erratic punishments may be easier to control, pre-planned punishments will give your child a sense of what is going to happen, rather than feeling out-of control.
 For example, let your child "Honey, I understand you don't want to take a bath right now, but it makes me feel bad. Besides, it's time. Let's go play in the bubbles!"

, For example, you could say "Honey, despite the fact that you didn't clean your room thoroughly, I did notice that you picked up your toys and put them in the closet. I appreciate that." After all, making mistakes is just a part of them growing up!

 This is a fun game that you might have played before. You pretend the floor is lava and you cannot touch it otherwise you will burn. Hop around on chairs and sofas and tables! Use a blanket as a raft. Climb the stairs with two towels under your feet! "Ahh! I got burned!" Depending on how old your sister is, you can create rules.
 This might seem really old. But a fun game of Go Fish or War may just be the cure to your boredom.
 This is a pretty popular game. You can choose to be the mom or the big sister, or maybe you can even fill in as the baby and have your sis take care of you! You can include the supernatural or maybe some school romance.
 This might sound too hard, but it's not. Take some scarves, hats, little skirts, and get ready to go crazy! Put two hats on your shoulders and a scarf wrapped around your waist, and be Prince Charming! Put on a twirly skirt and a hat with a scarf as a highlight, and be a dancer! Or you can just put on random things on random places. Show off your creations to your sis!

, This is a harder game, so younger sisters may not be able to play. Starting from A, you try to think of the longest word. For example, you might put "alphabetically" for A, and your sis might put "applesauce" and you would win that round because you have more letters. Continue the game until Z, or just keep playing if you want a rematch!

, Pat-a-cake, Pebbles, and Miss Sue may seem old, but doing them will be fun. Especially going on the internet and memorising new ones together.
 Something most kids enjoy. Dance to a new song or pretend you are a singer on television. Maybe you can even make an interview for your sis later if she's really good!

, Video games, tablets, and handheld game systems can be tons of fun, especially on multi-player.

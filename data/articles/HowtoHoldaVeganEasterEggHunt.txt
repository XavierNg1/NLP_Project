 There are lots of possibilities depending on where you look and some stores will be more willing to meet your needs than others. Things to check include:



Chocolate eggs: check for lack of milk or animal-derived additives. With cream centers, check for gelatin and egg products.

Candies: check for a "vegan" label.
Sugar is an issue for some vegans, so if you are concerned about the origin of the sugar, ensure that the label on any chocolate or sugar product says "vegan".
Make your own. That way, you have complete control over the contents.;
, This will enable vegan participants to enjoy the Easter egg hunt without missing out on the fun or having to have a separate one for them alone. Let all participants in the Easter egg hunt know that only the vegan participants can have the "V" eggs or treats and must put those back down if they find them.
 Easter egg hunts don't have to be just about chocolate eggs. Think of other fun treats such as stuffed toys, small trinkets, gift cards, etc. Even inspirational sayings inside a plastic egg can be a fun find for participants.
 If having alcohol, ensure it is vegan - there are vegan wines and beers that can be purchased, just ask the retailer for details.

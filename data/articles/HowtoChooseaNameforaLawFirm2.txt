 Under the Rules of Professional Responsibility,lawyers are not permitted to form a law firm with any non-lawyers acting as partners.


A law firm can employ lawyers and professional staff (such as paralegals and secretaries), as long as the professional staff does not own any interest in the firm.
 The Rules of Professional Responsibility states that false or misleading names for law firms are prohibited.Your firm’s name should not imply that you have a connection with a government agency. Likewise, don’t imply a connection with a public or charitable legal services organization.


For example, a law firm located in Denver could not be named “Denver Legal Clinic” because that name implies that the firm is actually a public legal aid agency.
 The name of a lawyer who holds a public office may not be used in a law firm name during any time that the lawyer is not actively practicing with the firm.


For example, the law firm name “Obama & Associates” would be considered false and misleading during the years of 2008-2016 because President Obama did not practice at the firm during his presidential terms.
 Lawyers cannot state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization when they do not.


For example, two lawyers, Clarence Smith and Stephanie Jones, may share office space, but they may not in fact have formed a law firm together. Therefore, they cannot use the name “Smith and Jones,” because that name suggests that they are practicing law together in a firm when they really are not.
 It is not considered false or misleading to use the names of retired or deceased partners. Just make sure that these individuals did in fact practice in the law firm.
 When registering the name of your law firm, check if your state has any further restrictions on business names.


For example, in Texas, no business may register a name that is the same as another business’s registered name.

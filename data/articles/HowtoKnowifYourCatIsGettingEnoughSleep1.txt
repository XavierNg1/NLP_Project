 Your typical adult cat will sleep around 13 to 16 hours out of a 24-hour day (about 50 to 70 percent of the day). While it is common for a cat to wake up during the night for a couple of hours to play or eat, staying up all night is not normal. If your cat is staying up for an extended amount of time during the night, then it may not be getting enough sleep.Since it is difficult to monitor your cat’s sleeping habits during the day, try to monitor its sleeping habits during the night instead.
Senior cats generally sleep more than your average adult cat, around 80 percent of the day.;
, Restlessness, irritability and confusion are common signs that your cat may not be getting enough sleep. Additionally, if you notice any mood changes in your cat, then this may be an indication that your cat is not getting enough sleep.For example, if your playful, energetic cat suddenly turns into a distant, lethargic cat, then it may be suffering from a lack of sleep.
 While some cats are known to snore while they sleep, excessive or loud snoring may disrupt your cat’s sleep and cause it to lose out on its sleep. Additionally, overweight cats and cats with shortened muzzles (Persian cats) are more susceptible to excessive or loud snoring than other types of cats.If this is your cat, make sure its snoring is not preventing it from getting its sleep.
Be aware that excessive or loud snoring is also a symptom of sleep apnea.

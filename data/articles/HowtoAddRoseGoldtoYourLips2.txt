 If you can’t find or create the rose gold lipstick or lip gloss shade you want with lip products, eye makeup may be the answer. Rose gold eye makeup palettes are very popular right now, and the range of available shades is wide. Mix a bit of the loose eye shadow powder with petroleum jelly, then paint the mixture on with a lipstick brush.








You can create a dramatic shade or something more shimmery and light by adding more or less petroleum jelly.
The petroleum jelly will provide high shine to this metallic look.
 Apply your favorite pink or nude colored lip gloss, then dip a small makeup brush into a warm shimmery eyeshadow and paint it on top. The slickness of the gloss will help you evenly spread the eyeshadow powder on your lips. This look emphasizes gold tones rather than pink tones, although you can control how gilded you get with it.








For a more subtle result, choose a shimmery warm nude eyeshadow. Look for color names like “champagne” and “warm glow.”
For more of an impact, layer glittery gold eyeshadow over a pink gloss.
 There are tons of metallic makeup products on the market right now – you can experiment with almost all of them on your lips, even if they aren’t created for that purpose. Try lining your lips with a gold metallic eye liner pencil, then adding a rosy lip gloss over it. Run your finger along your lip line to blend the gold pencil down into the pink gloss.









You can use a thick line for a dramatic look, or use a light touch for more subtle rose gold effect.Avoid using liquid eyeliners and stick to pencils only. The liquid liners won’t blend as easily and many of the waterproof formulas are hard to remove.

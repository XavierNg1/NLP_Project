 For example, if you cooked six eggs, you'll have 12 prepared deviled eggs.
, Working from the bottom of the platter upwards, lay sprouts of any sort (alfalfa, clover, broccoli, onion, etc) across the bottom of the platter as pictured. The sprouts serve as the grass. Fresh sprigs of dill will also work just as well.
 This will act as the flower stem.


Consider adding “leaves” by adding smaller leek stems to the sides of your main stem.
 Place the deviled eggs in a circular pattern, beginning at the top of the leek stem. Leave a center hole.
 This will form the middle part of the flower.


Top with a small edible flower. Or, you could top with a special garnish like chopped chives, pimento or relish. It's your choice.
 Serve in the middle of a table or as a party platter.

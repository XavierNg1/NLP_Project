 Facetime is a Mac/OSX/iOS application only. This is only necessary for Mac users on OSX 10.6.6 (older versions are not supported). OSX 10.7+ ship with Facetime installed. Facetime can only be acquired from the App Store and requires an Apple ID.


Both caller and receiver need to be using OSX or iOS in order to use Facetime.
 Your camera will start automatically and you can preview how you look at the startup screen.


Facetime often uses the internal camera by default. You can select another camera by going to the Video menu and selecting the desired camera from the list.
 All of your contacts associated with that Apple ID will be automatically imported as potential Facetime contacts.
 Search for a contact or select one from the list. Press the video camera button to initiate a video call.


Contacts can be added using the “+” button or added to the Contacts application and automatically imported.

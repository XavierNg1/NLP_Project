 When a family member is diagnosed with a chronic illness such as arthritis, diabetes, or multiple sclerosis they may begin to suffer from depression. It is very important you are present and supportive. Chronic illnesses are not curable, and although there are treatments to help manage the symptoms, individuals diagnosed with a chronic illness can often feel hopeless. Depression is one of the leading complications associated with chronic illness. You may also want to look into providing your relative with a social network or support group to help them stay connected with others and avoid the feeling of isolation.
 It is very important that you learn as much as possible about their condition because this will help you provide treatment, manage pain, and understand what they are experiencing. For example, if your loved one has been diagnosed with diabetes you will want to have a thorough understanding of what foods they can eat and how to administer any medications, such as insulin.
 People suffering from chronic illness often have a team of medical health care professionals including doctors, nurses, and counsellors. The best way that you can be supportive is by working with the health care professionals to administer medications and provide emotional support. Try and allow your relative to maintain a normal life as much as possible. If there were activities they enjoyed prior to their illness try and allow them to continue to engage in these activities. You will not be able to cure their illness, but you can greatly improve their quality of life. , As their illness progresses or changes they may need different forms of treatment. For example, they may require medical aids and new equipment, nursing care, or other forms of assistance. Monitor their symptoms and comfort level to ensure that they are being cared for in the best possible way. Speak with their doctors and health care professionals whenever you notice a change in their symptoms and behaviour.

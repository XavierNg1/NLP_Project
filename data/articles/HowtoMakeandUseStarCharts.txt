 You will need:


A large piece of paper.
A set of giant compasses.
A 30 cm (or larger) ruler.
A protractor.
A pencil and an eraser.
The co-ordinates of the stars that you want on your chart - available online.;
, If your paper is large enough (and I'm assuming it is) draw a circle with a radius of one foot.
 The circles should have radii of 1 inch , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 inches, and the centres should be in the same place as the centre of the big circle.
 From the centre of the circle, draw six radii, at 0 degrees, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 degrees.
,, Where the 0 degree radius meets the one foot circle, write 0h. Going clockwise (anticlockwise if you are mapping the southern hemisphere), the other radius-circle meeting points are 1h, 2h, 3h, and so on, up to 23h. These are now the names of the radii, e.g. the 15h radius. At the point where the radii meet, in the middle, write 90. If you're mapping the northern hemisphere, write +90, southern hemisphere: -90. Moving outwards, label the circles as +80, +70, +60, +50, +40, +30, +20, +10, 0, -10, -20, and the outer circle should be -30. If you're mapping the southern hemisphere, change + to - and - to +.
 You can find the co-ordinates on the internet. To plot a star, start at the middle. Move outwards, along the 0h radius, until you are at the correct declination. Then, move clockwise until you are at the correct right ascension. Draw a dot to mark the star. You may wish to connect the stars in each constellation so that you can see the patterns.
 If you can, write the star's magnitude (how bright it is), name and designation.
 Firstly, you need to find some stars that you know, so you can find them on your chart. For northerners, I'd recommend the big dipper or Cassiopeia. For southerners, I'd recommend Carina or Centaurus. Once you've found where you are on the chart, it will show you where other stars are, in relation to the ones you've found.

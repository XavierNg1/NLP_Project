 Foods that may set off indigestion include:Fatty, heavy foods, such as fast food.
Spicy foods. This is particularly true if you usually eat bland foods.
Chocolate.
Carbonated drinks like sodas.
Caffeine. This includes drinking too much coffee or tea.
 Alcohol causes your body to increase the amount of stomach acid it produces. This increases the likelihood of the acid irritating your digestive tract.Mixing alcohol with painkillers, like aspirin, can increase the damage to your stomach.
 This will prevent you from overburdening your stomach with more food than it can handle. It will also avoid stretching your stomach, which can also be uncomfortable.Try eating five or six meals instead of three. You can do this by adding small meals between breakfast and lunch and then again between lunch and dinner.
Eat slowly and chew your food well. This will make your food easier to digest.
 Eat your last meal at least three hours before you lie down. This will reduce the likelihood that excess stomach acid will go up into your esophagus.When you do sleep, put extra pillows under your head and shoulders. This will make it harder for acid to flow up into your esophagus.

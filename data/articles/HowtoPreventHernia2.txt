 Beginning an intense exercise routine before your body has had a chance to warm up can also increase your risk of developing a hernia. Make sure that you take at least five minutes to do some low-impact exercise before you begin your exercise routine.


Start each workout with a low-impact version of the exercise that you are about to do. For example, if you are planning to go for a run, then start off with five minutes of brisk walking., Using poor form or fast, jerky movements can also increase your risk of hernia during a workout. Avoid fast, jerky movements when you exercise. Make sure that you use slow, steady movements instead., Pushing yourself too hard can increase your risk of injury, which may include a hernia.If you start to feel pain or discomfort, then decrease your intensity for a while.


Make sure that you give yourself a rest day each week as well. A rest day doesn't mean you remain completely inactive, however. Try some gentle yoga or something low-intensity, such as a short, leisurely walk.
 Certain areas of your body are more susceptible to hernias and it is possible to strengthen these areas, but you should seek the help of a professional to do this. A personal trainer may be able to help you strengthen hernia-prone areas (such as your core) if you are concerned about developing a hernia.

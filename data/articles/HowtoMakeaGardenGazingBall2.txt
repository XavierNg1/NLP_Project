 Look for a bowling ball at a thrift shop, Goodwill, or bowling alley. If you’re looking to save money, you may be able to find a ball for as low as $5. Look for bowling balls that have the holes closer together so that they are easier to hide., Use soapy warm water, glass cleaner, or rubbing alcohol to clean the surface of your ball. If you don’t wash your ball, dust and debris will get caught under the paint and ruin its smooth finish. Dry your ball with a rag or cloth once you get all of the dust off of it.
 Prime your bowling ball in paint primer to help the spray paint to adhere to the ball. A latex primer may be the best type of primer you can get for a bowling ball because it will prevent cracking and peeling of your paint.If you’re keeping your garden gazing ball outside, do not skip the step.
 Go to a craft store or look online for chrome colored metallic spray paint. Before you begin spraying, make sure to lay down a tarp, shower curtain, or large trash bag so that spray paint doesn't get on the floor.


Spray paint your ball outside.
Wear protective face gear so that you do not inhale spray paint., Putting your gazing ball outside in the elements too early can damage it or cause the paint to prematurely peel. Test the surface of the gazing ball with your hand to see if it transfers paint onto your hand. If the surface feels moist, wait until it feels totally dry.

 Your partner will be either scared or too irritated to listen to you because chances are that, they could have also faced many other issues or problems during the day, just as you have.;
,, Just jot down what all you love to indulge in when you are upset or in leisure. It may be anything like a pen drive having the movies and songs that you like, a chocolate, a book, comic series, a photo album etc. Put all these things into a bag and dig into it when you feel like.
 A thread of logic might strike like a lightening or you may still be feeling confused and frustrated. But, you would soon find the reason.
 You could actually go for long drives or walks. Never try talking to a person at home especially when they are too addicted to gadgets like T.V and Computers, so much so, that they do not even care about your existence.
 Any sort of mood is contagious. If they are happy, better for you. It would uplift your spirits. But if they are sad or worried about something, you would obviously suggest to them something that would make them feel better. Try not pouring out all your emotions at this juncture, as that would further deepen the crisis and land you in peril.
 But if you get a "I don't care what happens to you‚Äù reaction from them, do not open up a big debate and start a fight. Either the person is not well equipped with the mental faculties to reason out your problem or they are too bothered about their own problems and your own concerns might appear too trivial to be bothered about.
 You might actually find a good help.
, Try to sort out your own feelings. His/her lack of interest in your problem might only add to your already injured feelings.

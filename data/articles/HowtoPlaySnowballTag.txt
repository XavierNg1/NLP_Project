 Set the amount of snowballs per round that each team gets, whether it's 2, 8, or infinite. You can also have the option of having teams create snowballs while playing.;
, It can be a mix-match of kids and adults, adults and adults, or kids and kids.
 They must be together at all times of the rounds - holding hands, running around in a piggyback style way, hugging each other, etc.
 At the same, teams must avoid being hit themselves.
 The teams that were untouched (didn't get hit) advance on. The last untouched team wins the game. If the rules include infinite snowballs, "rounds" don't apply for this.

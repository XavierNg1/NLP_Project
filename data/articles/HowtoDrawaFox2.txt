This will be your fox’s head and spine.



Draw 2 tall pointed arcs for the ears.
Add a line in the middle of the head. This would be your guide in placing the eyes.
Below the head, add a letter U which would serve as the snout.
This is optional but you might want to add a line from the center of the U to the center of the line. This would guide you in drawing the face.



At the tail of the balloon, add an oval, this would be the thigh joint.
Draw a wide, curvy vertical line for the fox underside. It should connect the head to the circle.



Draw an irregular oval on the end of the balloon string. This would be the fox tail.
Add another smaller balloon on the body, this would be the fox’s right side joint and leg. Just beside it, add a shorter line, similar to the smaller balloon string. This will be the fox’s left side leg.



For the paws, draw triangles at the end of each leg.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The lineart might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose and fur.
You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.



Foxes can go in different shades from orange to red.

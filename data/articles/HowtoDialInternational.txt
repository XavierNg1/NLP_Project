 An exit code, also called an "international access code" or "international direct dialing code," is used to dial out of your own country. This is the first set of digits you must dial when dialing internationally.Each country has its own exit code, but some do share the same code. Since these exit codes are not used when placing domestic calls, you will likely need to do an Internet search, consult a phone book, or ask your phone company in order to find out what your specific country's exit code is.
Dialing the exit code indicates to the service provider that the number following the exit code should be directed out of the country.;

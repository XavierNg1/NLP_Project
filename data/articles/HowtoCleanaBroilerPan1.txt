 If your broiler pan has sides that allow it to hold water, set it on your counter and fill it with water. If the broiler pan has slats or is flat with no edges, put it to soak in the sink or a plastic tub or a basin that’s large enough to hold it. Make sure the whole surface with cooked-on food is covered with water.Warm or cool water may work, but hot is more effective.;
, Use a basic dishwashing detergent and squirt a zigzag across the surface of the pan. A dish soap that is specially formulated to fight grease is most helpful. If you happen to be out of dish soap, this method may still work without it.
 Lay a dryer sheet flat in the water, making sure that it goes under the water and is covered. For pans with especially caked or burnt on food residue, put two dryer sheets in the pan.








If you use biodegradable dryer sheets, this can be an especially green cleaning solution.
 Leave the pan to soak with the water, soap, and dryer sheet for about one hour. If the pan has badly stuck on food, leave it for a few hours, or even overnight. The dryer sheet will loosen the food residue while it soaks., After the pan has soaked for a while, dump the water out of it. Depending on how bad it was, wipe the pan with a sponge or scrubber to remove any residue that is still stuck on. It also wouldn’t hurt to give the pan a quick, regular cleaning with dish soap and water.

 It is not possible to create a RAR archive with any other product but WinRar, due to the proprietary nature of the .rar format. However some third party programs can unpack and execute RAR files.


Perform an Internet search for "open RAR file" to produce a small list of freeware applications capable of handling RAR files.
 To set the file association, select "Settings," then "File Associations," and check the box labeled ".rar." Double click the file, or right click the file and select "Open." The downloaded application will automatically unpack, reassemble and play the file.

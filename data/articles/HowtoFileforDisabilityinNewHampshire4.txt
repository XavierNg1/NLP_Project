 After the SSA has received your paperwork, they will forward your information to New Hampshire's DDS office. When they have approved your application to receive disability benefits, you will receive a letter from the SSA with detailed information regarding your payment schedule.


If the New Hampshire DDS did not approve you for disability benefits, the letter from SSA will contain details regarding why you were not approved, as well as instructions on how to file an appeal.

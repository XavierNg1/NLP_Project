 There are a range of non-alcoholic cocktails that are just as fun, but don’t come with guilt or headaches the following morning. Try non-alcoholic beer, cider, eggnog, or have a serve mix up just about any cocktail without liquor.You can even research some fancy mocktails that will make you feel like you are a part of the party. Bring the ingredients with you so that you can mix them up yourself.
 Bottles of faux champagne are easy to find during this time of year for people who don’t drink alcohol. Pick up a bottle on the way to your gathering. That way, you won’t feel so left out during the champagne toast when the clock strikes twelve.
 If you’re not sure if the host will have any alcohol-free drinks handy, bring your own choice of beverage with you. Fancy fountain sodas or regular diet Coke both give you something to sip on while swaying anyone from asking, “Can I get you a drink?”, Most types of alcohol contain sugar, so you could reduce any cravings by eating something sweet. If the NYE party you’re attending doesn’t have any cakes or cookies, provide them to ensure they’re available. Satisfying your sweet tooth could help you ease any thoughts of reaching for a glass.Just be sure not to overdo it. It’s easy to trade one addiction for another. Enjoy sweets in moderation to minimize your risk of picking up a new habit.

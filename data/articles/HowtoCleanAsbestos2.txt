 Wet cleaning asbestos involves mopping the floors and using damp rags to wipe down floors and other surfaces that have been contaminated with asbestos. When cleaning is complete, discard mop heads and rags used to clean asbestos along with the rest of your asbestos-contaminated materials.If working on roof, do not attempt to use wet cleaning methods if it creates a slipping hazard (for instance, if you’re cleaning asbestos from a roof that is angled steeply).
 Specialized devices known as HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) vacuums can substitute or accompany wet cleaning methods. HEPA vacuums work the same as regular vacuums. In other words, you can use the HEPA vacuum to clean asbestos by turning it on and running it across the surfaces affected by asbestos.Consult manufacturer directions before using the HEPA vacuum.
Take care when changing the filters and emptying HEPA vacuums. Doing so incorrectly could risk releasing asbestos materials. Before emptying the vacuum or changing the filter, move it to an isolated area and dress in the same protective gear you would when cleaning asbestos.
 If asbestos-contaminated material was released over a carpet, you might need to utilize a steam cleaner in conjunction with HEPA vacuums to take clean the asbestos. All steam cleaners are slightly different, but generally, they work the same way a vacuum does. In other words, plug the device in, then run it across the area of carpet you wish to clean.After you’re done steam cleaning, use the HEPA vacuum on the area you cleaned with the steam cleaner.

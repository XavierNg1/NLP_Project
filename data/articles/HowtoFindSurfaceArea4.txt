 A sphere has a curved surface and therefore the surface area must use the mathematical constant, pi. The surface area of a sphere is given by the equation SA = 4π*r2.For this formula, r equals the radius of the sphere. Pi, or π, should be approximated to 3.14.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.
 The radius of the sphere is half the diameter, or half the distance from one side of the center of the sphere to the other.Example: r = 3 cm


, To square a number, simply multiply it by itself. Multiply the measurement for r by itself. Remember, this formula can be rewritten as SA = 4π*r*r.Example: r2 = r x r = 3 x 3 = 9 cm2


, Pi is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.It is an irrational number that has many decimal digits. It is frequently approximated as 3.14. Multiply the squared radius by π, or 3.14, to find the area of one circular section of the sphere.Example: π*r2 = 3.14 x 9 = 28.26 cm2


, To complete the calculation, multiply by 4. Find the surface area of the sphere by multiplying the flat circular area by four.Example: 4π*r2 = 4 x 28.26 = 113.04 cm2

 Some of the faults of a sailboat can look awful but are easy to repair while other faults are hidden and expensive. For a beginner, it's really hard to spot the difference. Hire a professional surveyor. You'll need a survey done for insurance purposes anyway. It will be money well-spent, especially if the boat is an expensive one.;
, If you go looking at boats without a clear idea of what kind of boat you want to sail, you may fall in love with a boat that won't meet your needs. Think: Do you want to race? Then, buy the kind of boat people in your area are racing. Do you want to trailer it to distant cruising grounds? Then, restrict your search to smaller boats with trailers. Do you want performance or a big fat cabin? If you don't know the answers, you risk wasting your money.
 Learning to sail involves lots and lots of sailing. Fixing up a junker boat can take months or years and won't teach you a thing about sailing.
 There is all sorts of obscure knowledge about racing boats that you will be helpless without.

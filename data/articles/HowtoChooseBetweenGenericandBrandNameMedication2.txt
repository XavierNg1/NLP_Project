 Understand that generic and brand name drugs often differ considerably in cost. Generic drugs tend to be less expensive than brand name medication. Sometimes this price difference can equal hundreds or even thousands of dollars each month., The Food and Drug Administration does not require that generic drug contain the same inactive ingredients as their brand name counterparts. These ingredients don’t affect the drug’s therapeutic action. Common inactive ingredients include dyes, preservatives, flavoring agents, and binding materials.This is an important consideration for patients with allergies or chemical sensitivities.
 Individuals have, and do, report that generic drugs work better for them than brand name, or vice versa. More studies, however, are needed to determine what, if any, differences exist.

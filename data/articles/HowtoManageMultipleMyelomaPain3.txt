 This option is one available to many cancer patients. Basically, your doctor will give you an injection of anesthetic at the site of the pain, which helps keep the pain signal from reaching your brain.You may need more than one injection before you feel the effects of this intervention.


If you have a fear of needles, this therapy may not be for you. However, most people find that their fear of the injection is worse than the actuality, as the doctor will usually numb the area first. The procedure generally lasts five to 15 minutes. You may be a bit sore for a few days.This procedure is generally safe, though you may have low blood pressure for a couple of days.
Your doctor may use analgesics, alcohol, or steroid injections to help reduce the pain., One option to decrease pain is to use radiation on your tumors. The radiation helps to decrease the size of the tumor. In turn, the tumor is less likely to push on the nerves that cause you pain.Radiation can also help with pain caused by bone lesions, where your bones are weak.
Usually, external radiation is used for multiple myeloma. The radiation comes from a machine outside your body, and it is aimed at your tumors to help reduce them. It's much like having an x-ray done.
This treatment does come with side effects, such as diarrhea, fatigue, skin problems, and low blood counts., Surgery can also reduce your pain. One way it can help is to reduce the tumor size or remove it altogether, making it less likely that it will push on nerves. In addition, surgery can be used to support fragile or fractured bones, decreasing pain at these sites.Also, your doctor can use a more minor surgery to snip the ends of nerves, reducing pain., Because myeloma can make your bones fragile, braces can help provide support, which in turn can decrease your pain. Try wearing a neck or back brace if you're having pain in those areas.You can buy braces at drug stores and medical supply stores.

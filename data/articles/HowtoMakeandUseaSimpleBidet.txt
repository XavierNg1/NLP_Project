 Look in garden supply shops for compression or pump sprayers. Usually these are for applying liquid fertilizers or pesticides to plants. This is why you must get a brand new compression sprayer that's never been used. Compression sprayers come in many different sizes. A 1.5 gallon (5.7Â L) tank is not too big to fit next to most toilets but still holds plenty of water. They also come in plastic and metal varieties. Consider that while some plastics can leach harmful phthalates into water, some metals (such as brass) can contain lead. Other benefits of plastic include its light weight and often translucency (so you can see the water level), while metal tanks are often more durable. Other features to look for include an adjustable spray head, flexible hose of sufficient length to reach your toilet seat, and an angled spray head or bent spray arm.;
, You should be able to reach it easily, and it should be close enough for the length of the hose that you can reach past the toilet seat with the sprayer.
 At first, you may want to dry off with a few squares of toilet paper until you feel proficient with the sprayer. The towel isn't for cleaning you, it's for drying you, so it shouldn't get very dirty. But if you feel more comfortable drying off with toilet paper, you will still reduce the amount of toilet paper you use because of how much more effective the sprayer is than toilet paper alone.
 Put the lid and pump assembly back on and tighten it well before pumping.
 You'll discover how much pressure is right for you with practice, but remember: Don't use too much pressure.
 If this is hard for you to visualize, imagine you are sitting on a stool and want to tilt the stool forward--tuck your tailbone and round your lower back. This will help you reach more easily and also keep the spray from ending up on the toilet lid behind you.
 No part of the sprayer should ever be directly below you, so that it stays clean.

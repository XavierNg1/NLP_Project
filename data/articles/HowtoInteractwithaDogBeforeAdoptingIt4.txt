 If you live in a small apartment, or you live in a housing situation which is already overflowing with people and other pets, it’s best to avoid introducing another animal into the mix. Dogs need space to play and move about, play, and feel safe. Like humans, dogs can get stressed and upset if they are cramped and feel they don’t have a space of their own.If you live in an apartment, you should ensure that your lease enables you to own a pet. The adoption agency will want to see proof that you can adopt in the form of a lease or a letter from your landlord.You might also be forced to pay an additional fee to your landlord before adopting.
 Dogs need to be fed, played with, let outside, and provided with opportunities to move about. If you and/or your family won’t be able to make time to provide for your dog’s needs, you should not adopt a dog., Pet food, toys, and vet visits can be expensive, and are an ongoing expense. If you’re not ready for these commitments – which will last 10-15 years over the course of the dog’s natural life – you should think twice before adopting a dog.

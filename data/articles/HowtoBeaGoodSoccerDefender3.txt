, Always be active for at least 30 minutes a day or more.
 Read books that famous defenders have written.
 Play aggressively. Always go for the ball, not for the player. This could get you a yellow or even a red card. Never be afraid to be aggressive!

, If a player falls, help them get up; if a referee makes a bad call (unless any strategic place, like the penalty box, or if you risk a yellow or red) don't argue, he's a person too and can make mistakes; if the other team scores a particularly good goal, congratulate them; if the referee mistakes a foul you made for fair play, correct them. It will earn you more respect and a good reputation. Shake hands with the other team at the end of each game. .

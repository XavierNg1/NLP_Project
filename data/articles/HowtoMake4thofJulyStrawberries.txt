 Place the bowl near the area where you plan to let the strawberries dry, preferably on a sheet of waxed paper laid out on the counter.;
, You can melt chocolate a few different ways--either in the microwave or using a double boiler.


Microwave chocolate in a glass bowl in 20 second increments. Stir chocolate and then return to the microwave until the chocolate is almost completely melted. Stirring chocolate will encourage the melting process.
Alternatively, melt on a double boiler by simmering chocolate on low, stirring constantly. Remove from heat just before chocolate is completely melted. Continue stirring until chocolate is completely melted.
 Hold the strawberry by the green stem to dip. Donâ€™t dip all the way up--you want the top portion to remain red.
 Spoon sugar over the bottom to completely cover it.

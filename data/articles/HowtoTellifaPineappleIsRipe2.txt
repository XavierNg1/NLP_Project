 You are looking for a fresh pineapple, not a rotting one. The stem is the area of the pineapple that feeds sugar to the fruit. It is from here that the pineapple changes color.
 It will often reflect a golden-yellow color, but a green-tinted pineapple is not necessarily unripe.Be aware that some pineapples are considered to be ripe when still partially green, but the pineapple should not be all green or all brown. You should also place more emphasis on the pineapple's healthy appearance.
As a general rule, the yellow coloration should be visible on the eyes at the base of the fruit. Color that rises further up the pineapple usually indicates a sweeter fruit., Because the color of the fruit itself can be either golden-yellow or green, looking at the leaf color might be a better option. Choose pineapples with healthy, green leaves.
 Pineapples should be well developed with rounded edges and developed eyes. The eyes are the spiked centers of the rough circles created by the geometric pattern on the pineapple. Make sure that the eyes have filled out and are relatively flat.Avoid pineapples with wrinkled skin, reddish-brown skin, cracks or leaks, mold, or brown withering leaves, as these are all signs of a rotten fruit.
 For instance, if you live in California, Hawaiian or Mexican pineapples will probably be the freshest because they traveled the shortest distance from the plantation to your supermarket.

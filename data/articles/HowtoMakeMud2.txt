 You'll need fuller's earth clay, plain yogurt with live cultures, honey and optionally aloe vera and tea tree oil. The clay may need to be bought online, although you should be able to purchase it from a hardware store. The rest should be available at large grocery stores.
 Mix two tablespoons of the clay with 1 tablespoon of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of honey, and either 2-3 drops of tea tree oil or 1 tablespoon aloe vera (depending on if you want these).


The tea tree oil is good for fighting acne, the aloe vera for repairing damaged skin.
 Wash your face first. Then, with the ingredients completely mixed, use a clean brush (like a paint brush or a cheap makeup brush) to apply it to your face. Be careful not to get it in your eyes.
 After allowing the mask to sit on your face for at least half an hour (1-2 hours is best), rinse it off completely.

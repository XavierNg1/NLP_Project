 Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.


The jar can be either clear (untouched) or painted for this project; it's up to you.
 There are various options, including:


Wrapping burlap around the entire jar, either in one large piece or in rows
Placing a large piece of burlap all the way around the middle of the jar, then layering on lace and ribbon and a decorative item
Creating a design using burlap pieces.
 By way of example:


Cut a wide piece of burlap for the center of the jar. Glue in place, making sure the end pieces meet at the end of the jar. Match up neatly, and trim off any excess.
Attach a piece of lace around the center of the burlap piece. Again, make the ends meet neatly at the back of the jar and trim off any excess.
Place a piece of thin satin ribbon around the center of the lace piece. Again, make the ends meet neatly at the back of the jar and trim off any excess.
If wished, attach a small decoration in the center, such as small dried flowers, a bead, a bow, a key, a love heart, etc. using glue or string.


If wrapping the entire jar in burlap, add the glue in sections and take care to smooth out any wrinkles as you go. If using rows of burlap, add glue for each row as you go.
 Once dry, the burlap wrapped Mason jar is ready to use.

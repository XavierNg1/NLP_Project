 Begin your crochet project as you normally would with one color. Stitch as many rows as you want. Then, when you know where you want to start your next color, stop crocheting. You can start your new color in the very middle of the row, towards the end, or towards the beginning. It's up to you really.
 As you normally would, take your crochet hook and stick it through the next stitch with your color one yarn still on your hook. Then, wrap the yarn you are currently working with around the hook and pull it through the stitch (the first loop on your hook) just as usual. Let go of your yarn.
 On your final yarn over, you will add your new colored yarn. Leaving the loops from your previous yarn on your hook, wrap your second colored yarn around your hook. Then, pull it through the loops already on your hook. After you have pulled it through, tug the new yarn from the back to tighten and adjust it.
 At this point you should be working with your color two yarn. Simply crochet that yarn into your project as your normally would until you reach the point in your project that you want to change colors again. Then, change colors again in the same way.









If you plan to switch back to the first color of yarn you were working with, then "carry" your yarn. Do this simply by changing colors in the way described, but keep the strand of your old yarn against the loops you are working with. Then, as you crochet with your new yarn, your old yarn will be carried in your work, because it is up against the loops you are crocheting. When you decide to change back to your previous color, it will already be in your work so the process will be easier.

 An AVO is available to anyone who can reasonably justify the fear of a specific person. You may fear for your safety, the safety of your property, or the safety of your dependents.The definition of reasonable is open to interpretation, but it means just what it says. You can't get an AVO against someone for looking at you funny, seeming suspicious, or bringing about a vague sense of unease. You must be able to point to specific and concrete instances in which the defendant put you in fear for the safety of yourself, a dependent, or your property. Generally, this would include threats, unwanted physical contact, stalking, or vandalism.
 While it's theoretically possible to get an AVO against a large group of people, it's very difficult in practice. Since you have to be able to point to a specific instance to justify reasonable fear, a complaint against a group of people usually won't cut it.For example, if your neighbor threatened you and five of his friends were standing a few feet away, you're probably not justified in having a reasonable fear of the neighbor's friends â€” unless they joined in on the threats. It's very unusual to imagine a situation in which you can prove a large group of people all made specific threats against a person, stalked someone, or damaged a person's property.
 You can get an AVO against anyone at all. While AVOs are usually taken out against a domestic partner, a family member, or a neighbor (all people who would have the opportunity to pose a threat to someone else), the defendant doesn't have to fall into one of these categories for you to successfully take out an AVO.All you have to do is give evidence showing that the defendant put you in reasonable fear. Even if it's a mail carrier, garbageman, or a person who frequents a place you frequent, they will qualify.

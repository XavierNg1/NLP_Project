 This is located directly beneath the toolbar, and has fields for the Host, Username, Password, and Port. You will need all of this information in order to connect to a server.


Port can most often be left blank unless the server is operating on a nonstandard port that needs to be specified. Otherwise, FileZilla will enter the port automatically.
 You will see messages displayed in the top pane as your computer attempts to connect to the server.


Once you are successfully connected, you will see the file system of the server appear in the right pane.
 Quickconnect settings are removed each time the program restarts, so to easily access the server again, you need to save it to the Site Manager. Once connected, click File, then select “Copy current connection to Site Manager…” This will open the Site Manager with the server details filled in to the appropriate fields. Give the entry a name and close the window to save the site.

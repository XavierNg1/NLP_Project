 For this design, you'll use two separate masks to create an Iron Man mask. You'll need a red ski mask, hockey mask, a marker, and gold spay paint. A standard balaclava styled mask with a single opening will work. Be sure that the masks are your size.;
, Research the Iron Man mask online and print off a clear image. Take a marker and outline the gold design onto the hockey mask. Do your best to match the design of the image to your mask., Use a pair of scissors and cut along the lines of the outline you made. After cutting out the hockey mask, you’re ready to paint. Use gold spray paint to color the cut hockey mask to look like Iron Man.


Allow the mask to dry for at least two hours before trying to assemble anything.
 Once the hockey mask is fully dried, you’re ready to assemble everything together. Put your red ski mask on first and make sure the eye hole is properly aligned. Put on the gold hockey mask.You don’t need to glue the two masks together, but you can if you want.

 With a long or oval face, go for an angular bob. You should have short, chin-hugging layers to emphasize your face shape. Use graphic angles in your bob with choppy layers to add fun to your style.If you have very curly hair, you can still pull off this look very well. Simply make sure you cut it a bit longer so that the curls have some weight to keep the shape of your cut.
 If you aren’t comfortable with the bob, go for a sleek look. Use subtle layers and end your haircut at your shoulders. If you have thin hair, cut some uneven shorter layers around your face so that your hair looks as full as possible.


Create body on the sides of your face with curls and waves. Avoid excess volume on the top., If you want long hair and have a long or oval shaped face, keep it as long as you’d like but add some side-swept bangs. Long strains paired with this retro texture will shorten your long face. When you get this haircut, be prepared to blow dry your bangs to keep the right shape.

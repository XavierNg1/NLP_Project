 Dry everything before rolling your pastry, and be careful to keep your hands, implements, and surfaces cool at all times. Consider chilling pastry for at least an hour prior to working with it; this helps it to dry out and makes it easier to handle quickly.;
, Hot and even warm fillings will create steam and moisture that will have nowhere to go but into the pastry. The pastry will reward you with sogginess. Only add cold fillings when making filled pastries.
 There is nowhere for filling to go inside pastry except into the pastry. Excess moisture in a filling will create soggy pastry. Drain moist fillings, or prefer fillings that do not present a moisture challenge.
 Pies and pastries with dense fruit or moist veggie fillings will benefit from slits to let out the steam escape during cooking.
 The idea behind this is to provide adequate time for base cooking without over-browning the top.Alternately, add aluminum foil to the top to prevent fast browning while the base cooks thoroughly.
 However, this will not allow you to add a hot filling! There remains a need to always use cold filling, blind baked or not.
 If you allow your pastry to cool in its bake ware with nowhere for the heat to escape but into the pastry, it is possible that you will end up with soggy pastry post-cooking but be guided by the recipe and remove the pastry from the pastry pan/dish if and when the recipe asks you to do so. Allow the pastry to cool on a wire cooling rack.

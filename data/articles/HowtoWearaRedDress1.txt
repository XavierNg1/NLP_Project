 The most complimentary shade of red depends on your skin tone. Before wearing a red dress, figure out if you have a warm, cool, or neutral skin tone. Your veins can give a clue as to your skin tone. Blueish or purple veins indicate a cool skin tone. Greener veins indicate a warm skin tone. Veins that do not show one strong color indicate a neutral skin tone. Think about how you look in silver or gold. Silver tends to look best on warm skin tones and gold looks best on cooler skin tones. Neutral skin tones tend to look good in either shade.
Warmer skin tones tend to tan easily and do not burn. Cooler skin tones are more difficult to tan and burn easily.;
, If you have a warmer skin tone, pick a color of red that will compliment that.

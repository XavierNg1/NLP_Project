 Put 3/4 cup (127 g) of uncooked quinoa into a small mixing bowl. Pour enough water to cover the quinoa completely. Leave the quinoa to soak in the water for at least 8 hours or overnight., Once the quinoa has soaked and softened, pour it through a fine mesh strainer. You can discard the soaking water. Rinse the quinoa with fresh water and drain the quinoa. Put the drained quinoa into a food processor or blender.If you don't have a food processor, you can use a blender.
 Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the food processor with the quinoa. Add 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Put the lid on the processor and blend the ingredients for about 2 minutes. The quinoa dough should become smooth.You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the food processor so the crust blends easily.
 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 C). Get out an 8 or 9-inch (20 to 23 cm) cake pan. Spray the pan with cooking spray. Cut a piece of parchment paper into a circle that fits into the bottom of the pan. Set the paper in the pan and spray it with cooking spray., Scoop the quinoa dough into the prepared cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly in the pan. Put the crust in the preheated oven and bake it for 15 minutes.The quinoa crust should look golden brown on top.
 Carefully remove the pan from the oven and flip the crust over in the pan so the parchment is on top. Peel away and discard the parchment paper. Return the crust to the oven and bake it for 5 to 10 more minutes. The edges should become crisp and the crust will look golden brown., Remove the crust from the oven and cover it with your choice of toppings. Put the pizza in the oven and bake it for 10 more minutes. If you're using cheese on top, it should melt before you remove the pizza from the oven.Store leftover pizza in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

 To prevent visitors from bringing in dirt, mud, or other filth from outside, make sure there are rugs near the entranceway. Have people remove their shoes, or wipe their feet off before going too far onto the flooring.You can also use area rugs throughout the room for areas where people will walk. Make sure you clean these rugs regularly to prevent the accumulation of dirt.
 Use felt to cover the feet and bases of large moveable furniture like chairs, tables, and TV stands. A small piece of felt to put something between the base or leg of your furniture and the floor will prevent inadvertent scratching.Rugs can be helpful here as well. Place an area rug underneath large furniture that might shift around, like couches. Remember that rugs collect dirt, so be sure to clean them regularly.
If you have chairs that might move often, consider replacing their feet with wheels for more ease of motion. You’ll still have to keep an eye out for scratching, but this will create easier movement.
 If you do need to move items around in the room, lift them off the ground instead of dragging them. For particularly large objects, get friends and family to help so nothing drags along and scratches the floor.Always remember to lift correctly by using your knees and keeping your back straight. Never lift more than you can comfortably handle, and don’t be afraid to wait for help with especially large objects.
 If you notice a small crack or dent in the floor, Pergo makes a finishing putty that can seal the crack. Anything about 1/4 of an inch (6.35 mm) in size or smaller should be easily fixable on your own.If the damaged area is greater than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), replace the plank. A professional installer can be found by calling the Pergo consumer helpline or visiting the Pergo website. It may also be helpful to keep some of the flooring planks after the installation to ensure you always have replacements on hand.

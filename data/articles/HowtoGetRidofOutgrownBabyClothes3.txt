 Often when a couple is just beginning their family, they will put away the outgrown baby clothes that are still nice and save them for the other children that they plan to have. This is a great way to cut back on the cost of baby clothes for the future siblings.


In order to be sure that the baby clothes are in the best condition when they are needed for the future siblings, they should be laundered and dried before storing.
They should be folded neatly and stored in dresser drawers or clothes storage containers. It is important that they are not stored where sunlight reaches them because it can cause fading.
 This is usually only done with favorite articles of baby clothing. The parents can display the clothes inside picture frames or shadow boxes and hang them in the child’s room as decoration.


As with storing the clothes for later use, framed baby clothes need to be clean and dry before being framed. There are many different ways to frame baby clothes. The clothing can be folded and inserted in a picture frame with only a certain portion visible. For example, a shirt can be folded the same way that men’s dress shirts are packaged at stores in order to show the front of the shirt in the picture frame.
Another way to frame the outgrown baby clothing is to use a shadow box. These boxes are deeper so the clothing does not get flattened. Shadow boxes can be purchased in large enough sizes to accommodate an entire outfit or several different clothing pieces together, such as 2-3 favorite tops.
Since a shadow box can be heavier than a picture frame, it is important to be sure the nail or hook is very secure in the wall in order to support it.
 Pieces of outgrown baby clothes can also be used as part of a patchwork quilt for the child’s bed when they are older. The parents should be sure the clothing is clean and that the swatches do not include worn out spots that may cause the blanket to tear more easily when used.

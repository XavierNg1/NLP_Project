 Of course you shouldn’t wander into yards patrolled by strangers’ dogs, but dogs may also be territorial about other spaces as well.Keep this in mind if you’re walking in the woods or in an unfamiliar part of town, including neighborhood streets and public parks.


If you’re worried that a dog seems excessively defensive or territorial, find a different way to walk so you’re farther away from the dog.
 If you’re concerned about an unfamiliar or hostile dog, and think it may become aggressive and attack you, don’t look it in the eye.Eye contact will signify confrontation to the dog, and it will take that as a hostile gesture.


Avert your eyes by looking above or below the dog, or to its side.
 When an aggressive dog is sizing you up and deciding whether or not to attack, he will be looking for parts of your body that are easy to grab on to. Hands are an easy target, since they’re exposed and relatively small. Keep your hands in your pockets to avoid giving dogs an easy target, and the dog may decide not to attack you.If the dog does decide to attack, you’ll need to quickly pull your hands from your pockets to defend yourself.
 A dog will take it as a sign of weakness and think you’re retreating if you turn your back and run. If you turn your back, the dog will likely attack. Stand sideways to the dog, with your side facing it, and avoid sudden movements.If you stand in this non-threatening pose, the dog may lose interest and wander off.


If the dog does not lose interest, walk slowly backward away from the dog until you reach safety.

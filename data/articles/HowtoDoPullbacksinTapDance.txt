 A pullback is two simultaneous backward flaps, so you'll need to know how to flap backwards.;
, This can be a ballet barre, a table, or any other surface that can support your weight.
 You'll want to do only one at a time to start with. Stand with your heels on the ground. Then, lean back and balance on your heels. Finally, flap backward with both feet at once. This will seem nearly impossible at first, but keep trying, and be sure to use your leaning surface as needed to help out.
 Try going through the process more quickly once you catch the concept. Instead of balancing on your heels, just shift your weight onto them before you pull back.
 Once you feel that you can do pullbacks well, try doing one, then putting your heels back down and doing another. Repeat this process for as long as you can slowly.
 Try doing several with nothing to rely on. Start slowly and increase your speed as needed.
 You'll have to be quite comfortable with pullbacks to be ready for this, but once you reach that point, just do the pullback without putting down your heels between each one. This is often easier at a higher tempo than lower, so try doing it quickly first.
 The more you practice, the more quickly you'll pick everything up. You may spend only a few days learning pullbacks, and you may spend several years mastering the technique, but keep at it.
 These are pullbacks with more separated flaps.
 It's the same concept as a simple pullback, but it involves keeping one foot entirely off the ground and doing pullbacks with the other.

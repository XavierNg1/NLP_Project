 If you have an outline of your paper, you should have the key ideas for each section. If you wrote your paper without an outline, go through your paper and pick out the main ideas. What is each section of your paper mainly about?


When dividing up your paper, put like ideas together. The sections should be mostly evenly divided. In a long paper, a main section could be chapter-sized. In a shorter paper, a main section could be two to three pages long; it all depends on how you want to structure your paper.
Keep in mind that you can also create subheadings if you need to do so, to help create more structure.;
, Pick the most important idea from a particular section and turn it into a heading. The best headings are descriptive and help the reader to understand what they are about to ready about.


To illustrate this using an example, imagine the section you need to compose a heading for is on Joan of Arc, her visions, and her early life. You could compose a title that is something along the lines of “Joan of Arc’s Early Life and Theological Visions.”
If you want, you can make it more interesting: “What She Saw: Joan of Arc’s Early Life and Theological Visions.”

, Funny titles are appropriate in some papers, such as ones with more lighthearted topics. For instance, if you’re writing on the nutritional value of beets, you can make puns on the word ‘Beet’:


“The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body.”

, When writing your headings, save the jargon for the paper where you can explain it. In the heading, try to keep the words you use easier for the reader to understand.


Don’t worry if your headings don’t tell every detail. That is what the section is for—to elaborate upon the idea you present in your heading.
However, don’t be misleading. Make sure your heading represents what you are going to say.
 For instance, in scientific studies, the main headings are generally “Literature Review,” “Methodology,” “Experiment,” and “Results,” or something to that effect.

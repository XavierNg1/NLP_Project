 Foam mats not only roll into less space than firmer or thicker mats, but they are often also very affordable and weigh substantially less than traditional yoga mats.


If you enjoy yoga when traveling, hemp bands and lightweight foam blocks are also easy to fit in a suitcase without adding much weight.
 Light hand weights or ankle weights are compact and can fit into most suitcases with ease.


To spare yourself the strain of an overly heavy bag, refrain from packing more than one set or packing any weights over 5 pounds each.
 Rubber or cloth resistance bands offer a very wide range of exercise options with virtually no added bulk or weight to your suitcase.
 If you are traveling with friends, family, or coworkers, having a team sport item along may enable you all to get a workout while having fun.


Lightweight items such as deflated sports balls, tennis or racquetball racquets, and even a baseball and glove can provide hours of exercise options with little added weight to the suitcase.
 Many brands sell inflatable fitness balls. Pack a deflated ball to re-inflate upon arrival at your destination (be sure to check whether the ball requires a hand pump or if you can inflate it with your own air).


Yoga, aerobics, strength training, and resistance workouts can easily incorporate an exercise ball to make a workout easy while traveling.

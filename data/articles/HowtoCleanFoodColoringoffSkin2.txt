 If you do not have any, use acetone or nail polish remover instead. Keep in mind that acetone and nail polish remover are harsh and drying. They are not suitable for young children or for those with sensitive skin. If you want to get food coloring off of a child, use rubbing alcohol, non-acetone nail polish remover, or hand sanitizer.


If you got food coloring on your face, do not use toothpaste instead.
 For larger areas, use a folded paper towel or a washcloth. If you are using hand sanitizer, you can skip this step and apply it directly to your skin.
 The rubbing alcohol will help dissolve the pigments in the dye. Most of the dye should come off with just a few strokes.
 Do not reuse old cotton balls, or you'll transfer the stain back onto your skin. Toss the stained cotton ball, and soak a new one with more rubbing alcohol. Keep doing this until the stain is all gone.
 If you still see traces of the stain, you can try rubbing it away with more rubbing alcohol. Be sure to wash and dry your skin afterwards.
 Because rubbing alcohol can be drying, it might be a good idea to put on some hand lotion when you are done. This is especially recommended if you used acetone or nail polish remover.

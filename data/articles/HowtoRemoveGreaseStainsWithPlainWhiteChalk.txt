 The best way to attack a grease stain is to get to it the minute it occurs––that way the grease doesn't have time to set.


Make sure the chalk is the old fashioned kind––the type used for writing on a blackboard. Some of the newer models contain wax, or other ingredients, that allow you to color on a variety of surfaces. Use old fashioned white chalk for best and safest results.

, Tend to get grease stains on your clothing at lunch? A small piece of chalk might help when your greasy lunch ends up on your suit.
 If you're being proactive and have the chalk on hand, you'll be more likely to remove the stain, leaving no evidence behind.


Blot the stain with a paper towel or napkin to remove any excess grease before applying the chalk. If you spill grease down the front of your shirt, you’ll need to first wipe up the food before tending to the grease stain. Use a clean white napkin or towel to remove the excess food, then blot the stain carefully to remove excess grease.






Cover the entire stain with chalk and even some of the surrounding areas to be on the safe side. Allow the chalk to do its magic. The powder will start absorbing and removing the stain on contact.
 If you're near the washing machine, give the chalk a few minutes to do its business, then toss the stained clothing in the washing machine.


Remove any excess chalk remaining on the item, then rub stain with a little laundry detergent. The chalk makes the stain easier to remove when you apply laundry detergent. Simply putting chalk on the stain won’t completely remove it––you have to wash the item for the best results.
 Add more laundry soap to your wash and then wash the stained clothing. You may need to repeat this step if the stain does not come out completely.

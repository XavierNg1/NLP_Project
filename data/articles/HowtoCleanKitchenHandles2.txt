 If you're trying to get grease and grime off your handles, dishwashing soap and water may do the trick. Dilute the soap with warm water. A couple of drops in a cup of warm water should be enough.You can also use half white vinegar and half water, particularly for stainless steel., Dip a rag or washcloth in the solution, and wring it out. Scrub the handles down with the solution, being sure to get into the nooks and crannies. Wring and repeat as needed until the handles are clean., If you can't get into areas very well with your rag, try scrubbing them with a toothbrush. Dip it into the solution, and shake it off a little. Use it to scrub the area until you wash away the grime., Once you've removed the grime, wipe any cleaner you used off with a cloth moistened with only water. After the cleaner is off, dry the handles with a kitchen towel or another clean rag.

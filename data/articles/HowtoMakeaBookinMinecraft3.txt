 Combine six planks (top and bottom rows) with three books (center row) to make a bookshelf. Many players craft these blocks just for style, but they can also improve your enchantment results.
 You'll need four blocks of obsidian (full bottom row and center square), two diamonds (left and right of center), and one book (top center). Using an enchantment table allows you to spend experience on special abilities for your tools, weapon, and armor.


To make obsidian, divert flowing water onto lava. You will need a diamond pickaxe to mine the obsidian.
 Place a book, ink sac, and feather anywhere in the crafting area to make a book and quill. Using this item opens an interface where you can type in a long message.


This recipe is not available in pocket edition, or in some older console versions.
To get feathers, kill chickens. To get ink sacs, kill squid.

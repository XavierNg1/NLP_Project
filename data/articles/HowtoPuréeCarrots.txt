 However, be aware that peeling removes a lot of nutritional content, as most of the vitamins are concentrated under the skin.
If possible, use organic carrots and simply brush the carrots under running water before using.;
, The pieces can be in small logs or slices.
 Fill the pot with about 1 or 2 inches (2.5cm-5cm) of water (or enough so that the water touches the bottom of the colander).
 Wait until the carrots are tender (test them by poking them with a tong; they should bend easily).
The steaming time should be about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of carrots, water, and heat set.
, Blend it until you get a smooth mixture.
 Pur√©ed carrots can be used in a variety of ways. If you intend using them for soup, dilute with the relevant liquid. If they need to be thicker, such as for use in a pie filling, thicken with a binding agent such as cornflour or potato puree or flour.

If you are making baby food, fill up an ice cube tray with the food. Wrap it with Saran wrap and place in the freezer until hard. Transfer the pieces into a container that can be placed in the freezer (Ziploc brand is a good suggestion).
When you want to use carrot blocks, take out the amount you want & put the rest back in the freezer for later use. Thaw out and heat up the pieces you want to use.

,, When you catch a Pokémon, "marry" it to a Pokémon of a different gender. If you have 1, 3, or 5 Pokémon in your party, and the Pokémon you encounter is the same gender as a Pokémon that needs a partner, it means you won't be able to use it.
 If the Pokémon dies, you must use its partner Pokémon - no switching to another Pokémon allowed. You can switch Pokémon, but only to the partner of the Pokémon you're using.
 Pokémon can only go to the PC through catching one when you have 6 Pokémon in your party. If you want to withdraw a Pokémon from your PC, you can only do it if one of your Pokémon dies and its partner Pokémon needs a new partner.
 For example, only heal through items or through Pokémon Centers; put the "Battle Style" setting on "Set" so that the opposing trainer sends out their next Pokémon before you're able to switch your Pokémon; or use a level limit, where your Pokémon can't have a level higher than the next Gym Leader/Champion's highest level Pokémon.

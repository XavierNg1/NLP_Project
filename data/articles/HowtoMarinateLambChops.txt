 They should not be defrosted in the microwave. If you are short on time, you can marinate them lightly for one hour.;
,, There are several great options for different marinade flavors. Try one of the following:


Create a middle-eastern marinade with one-half (118ml) cup of yogurt, several tbsp. (30ml) of olive oil, 1 tbsp. fresh chopped mint, a clove of chopped garlic and 1 tsp. (3g) of ginger. Add ¼ to ½ tsp. (0.5 to 1g) of cayenne pepper, cumin and coriander.
Mix a tbsp. (15ml) of hoisin sauce, one tbsp. (15ml) of soy sauce, one tbsp. (15ml) of rice wine, a tsp. (5ml) of honey and ¼ tsp. of Chinese five-spice powder.
Try a French marinade with one tsp. (5ml) of Dijon mustard, several tbsp. (30 to 45ml) of olive oil and two tbsp. (30ml) of dry vermouth with chopped rosemary, crushed garlic and black pepper.
Make a Vietnamese-inspired mixture of crushed garlic with several tbsp. (30ml) of lime juice and (30ml) soy sauce.Try red wine, olive oil and crushed garlic for a simple Italian marinade.
 The exact amounts that you use should cover at least half the chops. Try to use equal amounts of oil and acid (vinegar, juice or wine).
 Massage the chops to coat them thoroughly with the marinade.
 Seal it.
 The longer the chops marinate, the stronger the flavors will be.
 You can also simply turn it halfway through your marinating time.
 This will help them come to room temperature and cook evenly.
, Coat the pan with oil when it is fully heated if you are using a skillet.
 Don’t allow the chops to touch while you are cooking. Turn after three or four minutes.
, Set them aside to rest for five to 10 minutes.

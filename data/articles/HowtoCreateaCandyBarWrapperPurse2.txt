 Keep the rest tucked away for now., Hold the first link vertically, with the open edges facing down. Hold the second link horizontally, with the open edges facing the first one. The flat side of both links should be facing you (not the folded parts)., Hold the first link steady, with your forefinger on top, and your thumb on bottom. This keeps the link open. Slide the "prongs" of the second link into the "slots" of the first link.

Both links have two prongs. These prongs also have slots in them.
 You will end up with a bulky V or L shape., Take a third folded strip out, and hold it horizontally. Insert the prongs into the slots of the second link. Keep doing this until you have a long strip composed of 28 links.

If you are making a smaller bag with smaller strips, stop when you have 24 links., You will end up with a total of 5 strips, each made up of 28 or 24 links.

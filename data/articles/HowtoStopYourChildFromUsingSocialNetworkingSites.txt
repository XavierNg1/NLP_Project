 Tell them about some of the children who have been abused by predators on the site.;
, Tell them that you will not get angry if they admit it, but that you would get angry if you found out they were covering it up.
 If they say they have never used the site, then give them a few kind words and move on. If they admit to being on the site, continue to step 4.
 Listen to them very carefully, they often have very honest reasons to be on the site (such as peer pressure).
 Talk to them about other ways they could chat with their close friends, but in a safer environment.
 Maybe allow them to stay on the site, as long as they let you read their personal profile to see if your approve.
 As an absolute last resort, offer them a new form of socialization, such as buying them a new cell phone, or letting them take a friend to a movie. Remember that bribing is only for absolute last resorts.

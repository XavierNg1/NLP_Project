 When you buy things on credit, you pay much more for them than if you bought them with cash. Many consumers get into a vicious cycle when they buy on credit, because the monthly payments to the creditor make it impossible to pay cash for future purchases, and they end up buying on credit again and again until they can't afford to make the monthly payments.
 You may do without cable TV, stop eating at restaurants or even move in with relatives so you can devote more of your income to paying your creditors. The larger your payments are, the less you will pay in finance charges.
, If you don't have sufficient room on your account, you can call the creditor, explain that you want to consolidate, and ask for more credit. Most creditors won't mind if you pay them interest instead of their competitors.
 Your creditors may be willing to accept far less than your statements show you owe on your account. If you have been paying on the debt for a while, the finance charges may make up for the apparent loss by the creditor.

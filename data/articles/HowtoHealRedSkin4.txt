 Like acne, eczema outbreaks are routinely affected by stress.Lower your overall stress levels and find healthy outlets for your stress.
 Used mostly for mild eczema, OTC hydrocortisone creams may be helpful in relieving redness and itching for some people. For more severe cases, steroidal creams may be necessary.
 The oral medications that are currently used by doctors to treat more severe kinds of eczema include:


Oral antihistamines. Many antihistamines, such as Benadryl, can be found OTC.
Corticosteroids. Taken primarily if other treatments fail, corticosteroids must be taken under strict supervision of your doctor. Always follow instructions exactly with medicines such as these.
 Light therapy does help people suffering from more severe kinds of eczema. Doctors use ultraviolet light to slow the production of skin cells, resulting in less redness.

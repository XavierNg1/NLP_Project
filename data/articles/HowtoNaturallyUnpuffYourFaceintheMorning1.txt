 If you tend to wake up dehydrated, your puffy face could be caused by water retention. Get hydrated again so your body gets back to normal function., Lightly massage your face with moisturizer or lotion, starting from forehead down to the neck. Avoid vigorous rubbing., Chill two spoons in the fridge for 15 to 30 minutes, then lie down and place the bowls of the spoons over your eyes.

 You've probably heard of the cucumber trick for puffy eyes. This works for the same reason the spoons do: cold. Some believe that cucumber contains additional nutrients good for skin, but there is a small risk of eye infection from bacteria on the vegetable's surface.

You can also soak the cucumber pieces into lemon juice and gently rub them on your face and neck.
 A moisturizing facial mask may be just what your skin needs. You can find many recipes online, or use these:

 To do crunches on an exercise ball, you will need to place it on the floor and sit down on it. Then, allow the ball to roll forward as you lean back onto the ball. Lean back until your back and shoulders are resting on the ball.
 Walk your feet out so that your knees are bending at a 90 degree angle and your feet are planted flat on the floor. This will help to keep you stable as you lean back on the ball.
 Next, take your hands and place your fingers loosely under your head. This will provide a bit of support for your head and neck, but you will not be pushing against your head with your hands.
 When you feel ready, contract your abs and use them to crunch forward slightly.A crunch is a small movement, so do not feel as though you need to sit all the way up. You should feel your ab muscles working as you do this.


Do not use your hands to force your head upwards. All of the movement should come from your abdominal muscles.

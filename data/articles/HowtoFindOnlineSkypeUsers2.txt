 Skype offers the ability to search for users to connect with in a variety of ways. After opening the Skype application, navigate to the "Add Contact" page.If using Skype for Mac you will first click "Contacts" to bring up the "Add Contact" option.
For Windows either click the "Add Contact" button directly from your Skype home screen or else access the "Contact" file menu and from there select "Add Contact".
 If you have information in hand (e.g. name, email address, or Skype user ID) access the search box in the upper right corner of the application and type it in. Skype will initially search your existing contacts to return your results. To search for Skype users you are not currently connected to, look for an option in the dropdown which reads "Skype directory".Skype also offers the option to search through the text of your chats in order to return search results. This is a separate option in the search bar dropdown.
 An alternative to the search bar is to specify search parameters for the users you are interested in locating. You can search by country, state, city and can narrow your results by language, age, or gender.


If you are searching for a friend it is helpful to know their geographical location since many similar results are sometimes returned.
You must request a connection and be approved before you can see if your new contact is online or not.
 Click the green icon image of a person and a plus sign to request a user be added to your contacts. You will asked to type a personal message to go with the request or else can leave the default message “Please add me as a contact”.
 Once your request has been received and accepted you will get a notification that the contact has been added to your official Skype contacts list. Look for your new friend to be online (indicated by the green checkmark icon) and then try initiating a chat!

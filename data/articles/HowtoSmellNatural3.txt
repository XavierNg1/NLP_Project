 Body lotion is scented with perfumes and contains other chemical ingredients, as well. Body oil is naturally moisturizing and usually unscented or scented with natural essential oils like sandalwood and patchouli.Coconut and jojoba oil are both popular with natural product enthusiasts.
 Hair tends to hold on to the scents of products throughout most of the day. Avoid the faux “fresh” scents used in many shampoos and conditioners and opt for hair products that are lightly scented with natural fragrances and essential oils., Most department store perfumes are alcohol-based and feature unnatural fragrances that cling to your skin and clothing for hours. Natural perfumes, on the other hand, are gentle formulas made of botanicals. While the scents do last a few hours, they fade away naturally as your skin absorbs the hydrating oil.


Perfume oils that include patchouli and sandalwood smell earthy.
If you want something a little brighter, try a citrus or floral scent.

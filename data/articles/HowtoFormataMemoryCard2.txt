 Formatting your memory card will erase all of the data on it. Make sure that any pictures or other files that are currently stored on the card have been properly backed up to another location if you wish to save them.
 Many laptops have card readers built-in, while most desktops do not. You can purchase USB card readers that simply need to be plugged into an available USB port. Make sure that you are inserting the card into the right slot, as most card readers have different slots for the various types of memory cards.

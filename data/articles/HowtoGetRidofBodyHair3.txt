 An epilator is made of many many tweezers that pluck out the hair, and can remove your hair for up to two weeks on average. Epilators are painful and more time consuming than shaving, but because it removes the entire hair follicle the results will last much longer. Instead of cutting the hair, an epilator has grooves and small indents where, as you run it up your body it grips the hair and pulls it out at the root.


Epilators, however can cause a lot of problems with ingrown hairs - be sure to use a hair reduction cream like Depil or Vanish PFB after use.
 Epilators cannot reach into creases or wrinkles, but they may grab exposed skin painfully. Use one hand to pull your skin tight as you use it.


Wet epilation requires submerging the machine and skin underwater during use.
Dry epilation requires clean, dry skin.
 Multiple passes and directions may be used to achieve best results by removing the most hair (not all hair grows in the same direction).


If irritation occurs, apply an astringent/analgesics (such as Tend Skin) and follow up with lotion to soften and soothe skin. Redness may appear for the first 24 hours following epilation. Plan to perform hair removal at least a day before scheduled events.
 Tweezing the hair can be very time consuming, especially if on a larger body part, however it is very effective in reducing and stopping hair growth on your face. Pulling hair out individually ensures that you are pulling the hair out from the root. While it can be painful, it is also the cheapest form of hair removal.
 You can't shave or 'wax' your eyebrows. Most people use a pair of tweezers to pull all the hairs out individually.

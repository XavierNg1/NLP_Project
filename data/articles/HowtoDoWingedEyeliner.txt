 Use a light pencil eyeliner to draw a thin line as close to your upper lash line as possible. The line should be as thin as possible. This acts as a base for your winged eyeliner./images/thumb/7/76/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-1-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-1-Version-4.jpg

Start from the inner corner of your eye and work toward the outer corner.
The line does not need to be especially neat at this point, even though it should be thin. You will end up going over the line again, so a little roughness will not make much difference at this point.
Keep your eyelid as flat as possible while doing this. If necessary, tilt your head back and just barely keep your eye cracked open as you apply the liner.;
, Hold your eyeliner pencil at the end point of your bottom lash line. Point it upward diagonally so that it looks like a continuation of your lower lash line.

The line will extend diagonally up and out.
If you have a hooded eyelid, you may need to angle the wing more outward than upward to avoid the hooded part of your lid.
 This line should roughly match the guideline you visualized when holding the liner pencil against your eyelid. In other words, it should almost look like an extension of your lower lash line.

/images/thumb/2/26/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-3-Version-5.jpg









Before you start, make sure you have a mirror around, also make sure your elbow or arm is on a stable surface. This allows for more control over creating your wing!
Begin at the very tip of the eyeliner line drawn above your upper lash line.
Draw a diagonal line roughly 45 degrees out and up. The line should be heading in the general direction of the end of your eyebrow.
The length of the wing is up to you. A more subtle winged eyeliner look should have a short line at this point, but a more dramatic one can extend up to just below your brow bone. Never extend it all the way up to the eyebrow itself.
 With your eyelid as flat and taut as possible, draw a straight diagonal line from the very tip of the wing down to the middle of your upper lash line.

/images/thumb/f/f0/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-4-Version-5.jpg









Keep the eye closed as you do this. Watch with the eye you are not currently working on.
Put the pointer finger of your non-dominant hand on your brow bone. Pull the upper lid slightly upward to keep it taut.
Draw the wing lines using your dominant hand.
 Use your pencil eyeliner to fill in the winged outline you just created until all the skin between the line is covered.

This does not have to be especially thorough if you plan on tracing over the pencil eyeliner with liquid liner later on.
Fill in the eyeliner as close to the eyelashes as possible to avoid gaps of skin peeking through. The idea is to blend your eyelashes into the eyeliner.
 To make it appear as though the wing is getting thinner naturally as it goes into the eye, you should use short strokes of your eyeliner pencil to smooth out the corner between the end of your wing and the liner on the upper lash line.

/images/thumb/9/98/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-6-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-6-Version-5.jpg









The eyeliner should be its thinnest at the innermost corner, but it should appear as though it is gradually getting thinner in this direction.
 The piece of tape should extend from the corner of your eye toward the end of your eyebrow./images/thumb/e/ef/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-7-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/e/ef/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-7-Version-5.jpg









For further guidance, the tape should line up from the nose to the outside corner of your eye, finally ending toward the tip of your brow. You should only have the tape extend from the corner of your eye to the brow, though, if possible.
If you want a more subtle, less angled wing, apply the tape at a slightly more outward angle instead a more upward angle.
Make sure that the tape is pressed against your skin well so that no liner bleeds through as you apply it.
If your skin is too sensitive to use tape on, hold a credit card or other small, straight edged object against your skin at the same angle.
 Using a light eyeliner pencil, draw a thin line above your upper lash line. This line should be as thin as possible and as close to your upper lash line as possible. Extend the line all the way to the edge of the tape.

Start from the inner corner of your eye and work toward the outer corner.
The line does not need to be especially neat at this point since you will go over the line again. While a little roughness will not make much difference at this point, though, you should avoid making the line too thick since doing so will only make the end result look chunkier and unpleasantly thick.
Keep your eyelid as flat as possible while doing this. If you have trouble doing this with your face forward, tilt your head back and just barely keep your eye cracked open as you apply the liner.

/images/thumb/8/8c/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-9-Version-5.jpg









Do not be afraid to get a little eyeliner on the tape. If you stuck it on securely enough, the liner should not bleed through. This is especially true if you are using a light pencil liner.
Carefully remove the tape when done.
 Go back over the line of the wing and upper lash line with your eyeliner pencil. The outer edge should look thicker than the inner corner.
/images/thumb/f/f7/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-10-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-10-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f7/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-10-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-10-Version-5.jpg









Do not start at the top tip of the wing. For aesthetic purposes, this part should be left as a fine point.
The outer part of the wing should come in at a curve. Most of the eyeliner should follow the natural shape of your eye, but the liner should be a little thicker toward the outer corner of the upper lash line and as thin as possible toward the inner corner.
 Take a step back. Blink, walk around for a couple of minutes, and chase the look of your face from the freshest place in your mind before examining how your eyeliner looks again. Sometimes, staring at something for too long can distort our image of it. Make a judgment on your success or failure only after stepping away to give yourself a fresh perspective.

As you examine the way your eyes look, you should also compare the way that both eyes look in relation to one another. The wings should be fairly even.
 Fill in the entire outline with this liquid liner.

By double-layering the eyeliner like this, you allow yourself more control over the shape. This creates a darker, more convincing wing shape.
Rest the elbow of your working hand on the table or counter. Doing this will help steady your hands as you apply the liner.
Make sure that you press the eyeliner wand or pen as close to the lash line as absolutely possible to prevent gaps between the eyelashes and eyeliner.
 If the pencil liner appears jagged or uneven at certain places, you can carefully clean it up by dipping an angled eyeliner or eye shadow brush into a bit of makeup remover and tracing over those edges./images/thumb/3/37/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/3/37/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg









In a pinch, you could also use a cotton swab to erase mistakes. A pointed cotton swab can be more effective in cleaning up mistakes than a round swab.
You can also use concealer to mask over any mistakes. Use your fingers, a brush, or a cotton swab and gently apply the concealer over any mistakes or unclean edges.
 After applying the liquid liner, let it dry briefly before you blink. If you blink immediately after applying it, the eyeliner could smear.

/images/thumb/8/82/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-14-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-14-Version-5.jpg









If you do accidentally smudge a little of the liner, however, you can simply clean up the smear with a cotton swap soaked in makeup remover.

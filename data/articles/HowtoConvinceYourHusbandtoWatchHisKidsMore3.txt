 Make a list of childcare duties with your husband and go over it together. See which ones appeal to both of you most. It’s always easier to get someone to pitch in more when they’re doing a job they like., Compare your schedule to your husband’s. If one of you has a particularly busy day or two every week, see if you can split up childcare duties to prevent those days from being even more hectic.For instance, if your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons consist of taking your oldest son to various extracurricular activities, you might ask your husband to watch the younger children on those afternoons.
Try to be flexible if things come up and work as a team.
 As your husband becomes a pro at taking care of the kids, he’ll probably start doing a few things differently from you. As long as his parenting methods don’t threaten the kids’ well-being or directly conflict with your own parenting philosophy, avoid trying to make him parent exactly like you do.Letting your husband come up with his own childcare methods sends the message that you trust him and respect his parenting abilities.
Safety should always take precedence over feelings, though. For instance, if your husband lets the kids go out to play without coats on a cold day, you should step in and ask him to dress them more warmly.
 If you are having a hard time getting your husband to help out with childcare, or if you are just having a hard time communicating your needs to him, then you might want to see a counselor. A counselor can help you and your husband to communicate more effectively. Don’t wait until the situation escalates. See a counselor for help before it becomes too heated.

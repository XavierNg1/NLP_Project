 If you're not keen on using twigs from the outdoors, use a chopstick instead.
 You can use this template if you'd like.
 Keep the edges neat.
 Use glitter, artificial pearls, and rhinestones, etc., to prettify the star. You can draw designs on it too.
 This will help the star to last longer.
 Use a strong glue to attach the cardboard star to the top of the twig or chopstick. The thicker the wand stem, the more glue you'll need to use to keep the star in place.
 Add some ribbons or tulle bows for embellishment, if desired.
 You can now dress up as a witch or warlock and head out to cast spells on your fellow party goers. Keep those spells civil, mind!

 For example, if your name is John Smith, say “Me llamo John Smith.” The correct pronunciation of “Me llamo” is “Meh yah-moh,” and its literal translation is “I’m called.”Use “Me llamo” to introduce yourself when meeting someone in person. This is the most common, acceptable way to introduce yourself to people in the Spanish language.;
, For example, if your name is Jane Doe, say “Soy Jane Doe.” The literal translation of “Soy” is “I am,” and is considered even more casual than “Me llamo.”

 Decide whether you want to share a flat or rent your own, depending on your budget. Contact relevant agencies or private landlords and agree on a place to live. After this, you will have to send a deposit in order to secure the place. Alternatively, book some temporary, cheap accommodation, such as a hostel, and look for a place to live when you come to the UK. Finding a place usually takes only a few days.
 You may want to open a bank account before you come to the UK; this will reduce stress levels significantly. If there is an HSBC bank in your country, or any other bank that has branches in the UK, opening a bank account with them is easy and you will be able to use the same account, card etc when you are in the UK. You may be able to open an account through a travel agency, too. If, however, you decide to open a bank account after you arrive here, this is also fine. Opening an account in a bank in the UK is much easier than it used to be, especially if you have already found a job and accommodation. It's a good idea to bring some proof that you have sufficient funds and good credit history from your current bank.
 You may need to let them know you are moving.

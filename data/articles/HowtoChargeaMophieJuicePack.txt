 There should be a USB cable included with the product when you unbox it. Take it and inspect for damage, as this might cause the device not to charge.;
, You will need a power brick or wall plug–style power source that is compatible with your USB cable. Any power source that says “works with iPhone” is suitable.
 Insert the smaller end of the USB cable into the Juice Pack’s charging port.


You do not need to charge the devices separately, as the iPhone will charge first, then the Juice Pack.
 Grab the wall charger and insert it into a vacant wall outlet.


Your iPhone should charge. When finished, your Juice Pack will charge.

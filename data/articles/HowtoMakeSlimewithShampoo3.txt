 For some reason, the 2-in-1 combo shampoos seem to work the best. Choose a fragrance that goes well with mint.








You can try plain shampoo as well, but make sure that it is thick.
 You can use white toothpaste or gel toothpaste, it does not matter. You will need to use the same amount of toothpaste as you did shampoo.
 Keep stirring until the color is consistent and no streaks remain. As you stir, the shampoo and toothpaste will come together and form a putty-like slime.
 If the slime is too thick for you, you can add in some more shampoo. If it is too thin, try some more toothpaste. Make your addition, then stir it in well.
 This slime is not quite as gooey as the store-bought kind, but it is fun to poke and prod. When you are done playing with it, scoop it into an airtight container.

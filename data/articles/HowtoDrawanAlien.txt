 For this example, I chose and sketched a humanoid type upper body so I can add a face to the alien.


Insect-like (from the movie "Alien")
Humanoid ("Star Trek" and "Close encounters of the third kind")
Armored or mechanical-looking (Transformers)
Liquid or Gel-type (The "Blob")
Plant-like ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers");
, To visualize the wireframe needed to sketch the alien's body structure, you should already have an idea what your alien should look like. Consider:


I want an alien that can walk on two legs that look like chicken legs.
I want the alien's face to be mysterious almost "faceless" with blank eyes like the well-known "grey" aliens we read about.
I want the alien to look tougher than humans with an armored type of look.
I want three fingers for each hand, and the arms should have 2 joints or elbows.
 I used rounded forms to sketch the main parts such arms, legs, and head, large rounded joints to connect the limbs, and a "W" shaped chest part that extends to the shoulders to symbolize that this alien is drawn for a wikihow article!

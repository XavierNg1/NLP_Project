 Joint pain occurs because of the deposition of urate crystals on the joints.


The deposits can press on the nerves that supply that particular joint and cause pain.
The urate crystals may also interfere with blood flow to the joint, resulting in tenderness and pain.;
, Redness and swelling occur due to inflammation of the joint that causes an increased blood supply to that area.


This is a sign of your body fighting invaders, when antibodies that protect the body are transported to the inflamed areas.
Swelling on the joints is caused by increased blood supply to the joints.
This occurs because blood supply is increased as a way of fighting the disease.
 You might develop nodules on your elbows, ears and hands.


This occurs because of increased deposition of urate crystals in different parts of your body.
The nodules are also called tophi and appear as white or yellow firm papules.
They can appear in multiples or as a single nodule.
They can appear in varied parts of the body like the hands, feet, and fingers.
Tophi can also erupt on the skin and discharge chalky masses that contain crystals of urate.
 If you notice yourself itching and scratching your skin, it can indicate an increase in uric acid content in your blood and skin.


This causes you to feel itchy and scratch, because the urate is accumulating.
You may notice red marks left on your skin the morning after a night of scratching while asleep.
 Difficulty sleeping occurs because of increased tenderness and pain in your joints.


The tenderness may be so intense that it is hard for you to fall asleep when your body feels the light pressure of your sheets.
 Increased uric acid can cause kidney stone formation and lead to problems with urination.


The kidney stones may block urine passage.
Kidney stones can also cause extreme pain during passage.

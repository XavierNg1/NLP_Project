 Ask your insurance agent how you can best protect your assets against any unexpected occurrences.


Liability insurance protects you from someone who might sue you. If there is a judgment against you, the court won't take your home and your hard-earned savings to pay the other person.
Health insurance, homeowner's insurance and supplemental insurance help pay for unexpected expenses such as home repairs after a natural disaster or long-term medical care so you don't have to use your savings. A lifetime of savings can be depleted in just a few months.
Life insurance is strictly only necessary if you have people who depend on your income to meet their living expenses. However, it's easier and cheaper to buy insurance while you're young.

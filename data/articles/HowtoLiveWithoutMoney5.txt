 Owning a car is all but impossible to do without the use of cash unless you have access to a mechanic who accepts trades or bartering, and a gas station which will let you work in exchange for fuel.


Check in your area for carpool incentives and communities. If you absolutely must keep a car, some cities offer financial incentives if you carpool with others. You may also be able to ride to work with other people who will help pay for your gas and car upkeep.
 Many people commute daily to work, school, and other places. Exchange food and services for rides to places you need to go.


Websites such as Liftshare, Ridester, and Carpool World can also help you find carpooling and ride share options in your community.
Hitchhiking can be an option if you need to travel long distances, but exercise caution! Hitchhiking can be dangerous, particularly if you travel alone., If you will be traveling further distances regularly, or walking is not a viable option for you, cycling is a fast, eco-friendly way to travel. It will also help you stay fit!


Attach a basket to the front and back of the bicycle to help carry food and other items.
 Walking is the easiest, most accessible and cash-free means of getting around. A healthy, hydrated body can cover at least 20 miles in a day without strain, but you'll need proper shoes, water, and food to cover this distance.


Prepare emergency backup plans for walks in colder weather. A light snowstorm can quickly turn into a blizzard, and if you are walking several miles from your home, this can become an emergency situation. Consider going with a friend, or making sure someone knows where you will be and what time to expect you back.

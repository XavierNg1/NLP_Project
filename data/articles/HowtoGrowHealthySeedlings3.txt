 Keep the soil evenly moist. Avoid over watering and under watering, as both are fatal to seedlings. When watering, use a gentle sprayer or watering can rose to avoid disturbing the delicate soil and seedlings.
 Don't let them get cold or too hot; an ideal temperature range is 18ºc–25ºC. Place them in a warm but not completely sunny spot. Shift them in at night if there is any risk of a cold snap and/or frosts. As seedlings get stronger and older, a porch or veranda can be an ideal place to grow them prior to planting in the garden, as these structures are covered but still allow for the gradual familiarization with outdoor temperatures.
 Overcrowding is unhealthy for seedlings. Remove the seedlings by their first leaf growth (not the stem) and put into a tray that allows for wider spacing. Seedlings subjected to thinning out must be hardened if you are placing them in new growing conditions.
 Avoid planting seedlings in the garden too early or too late, as both will stunt good growth. Follow the instructions provided for the plant species being planted.

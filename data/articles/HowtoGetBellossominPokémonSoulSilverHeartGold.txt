 Bellossom can't be caught and in order to get one you will need to evolve your Gloom into one with the help of a Sun Stone.

The easiest way to obtain a Gloom would be finding it on Route 48 directly below the Safari Zone gate in the grass below. Another way of getting your hands on one would be getting an Oddish in Ilex Forrest and evolving it into Gloom at Level 21.;
, You can do this by participating in the Bug Catching Contest at the National Park on Tuesdays.

When at the National Park try to catch a Scyther because they usually offer the prize you are looking for which is the Sun Stone.

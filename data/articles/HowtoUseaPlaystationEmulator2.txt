 These are files that are typically used to play games on a PSX (the PlayStation console and digital video recorder) and you need to put them on your computer so it knows how to emulate the PSX. Here is what you need to do.


Go to the Sony PlayStation emulator page on the EmuAsylum website and use the "Playstation Bios Files" link to download the zipped BIOS files.
Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file and select "Extract files." This will open the WinRAR application used to unzip files.
Browse to and select the "bios" folder (it had been created when you extracted files and folders from the zipped ePSXe emulator file earlier on).
Press the "OK" button to extract and install the BIOS files in the "bios" folder of the PlayStation emulator.

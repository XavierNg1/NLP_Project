 Crouch. Follow the soldiers to the waterfall.;
, Jump onto the log and wait in the bushes. Once the brute is done talking, snipe him. May take 3 clips.
 They are easier, but on Legendary, can still kill you. The Phantom will drop off more, just frag them.
 Continue to snipe until you run out of ammo. Save your Assault Rifle. Pick up a Needler. Spray and pray.
 If you do, crouch, and walk over under the log. Go over to the other side and shoot the Brute. Leave the Grunts to be dealt with.
 Skirt around and pick them off. Once you come to the crashed Pelican (after you see Johnson's crew retreating) get the sniper rifle. No buts.
 Use Portable Covers if you come across some. Once you come to the ridge, snipe the Brute carrying a Gravity Hammer. Stay if you like, and continue sniping.
 Bring out your Assault Rifle. Throw grenades. Be sure to hide whenever your shields reach 50% or below. Once cleared, rescue Johnson. (Note, whenever you play on Easy, only Johnson will survive.) Hold out.
 Eventually, a Pelican will come and save you. Congrats. You just beat Sierra-117 on Legendary.

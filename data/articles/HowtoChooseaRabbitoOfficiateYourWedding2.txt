 This could be the rabbi who led services at the synagogue you attended as a child, a friend of the family, the rabbi who led your college group or the rabbi who leads the synagogue you and your intended currently attend.
 If the rabbi who officiated those ceremonies moved you, perhaps that rabbi could officiate your wedding, too. While he or she may not live in your area, that rabbi could still officiate if he or she has no congregational responsibilities.
 They may know a rabbi who has moved them in the past, either at temple or at a wedding they've been to perhaps even their own.
 Rabbinical students are eager to practice their skills, and they're supervised by faculty members with more experience that they and you can draw on if problems arise while planning the wedding.
 Many rabbis without congregational responsibilities advertise their availability to conduct weddings online. These sites also frequently include information on what traditions are associated with a Jewish wedding and have links to vendors that can supply such things as the chuppah and the glass to be broken.
 If you don't have Internet access, or want to keep your search local, you can find a list of rabbis and synagogues in the Yellow Pages of your telephone book.
 Shabbat services are open to all, but if you don't feel comfortable attending a synagogue you're not used to, look for a panel discussion or lecture led by a rabbi. If you and the rabbi hit it off, contact the rabbi to see if he or she does weddings.

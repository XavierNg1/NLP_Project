 Fill a saucepan with about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a glass, heat-safe measuring cup into it. Bring the water to a simmer., You will need 4 tablespoons (60 grams) of shea butter, 2 tablespoons (30 grams) coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 grams) cocoa butter, and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of avocado oil., Stir the ingredients together as they melt. This will help them melt more evenly. Once everything turns liquid and no streaks remain, use a potholder to lift the measuring cup out of the pot and sit it down onto a heat-safe surface., This will take several hours. Once it turns solid again, you are ready for the next step. You can speed the process up by placing the cup into the fridge., You will need 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil (about 12 capsules), ¼ teaspoon of tea tree essential oil, and ¼ teaspoon of peppermint essential oil. If you can't find vitamin E oil in a bottle, use vitamin E oil capsules instead. Prick them with a pin first, then squeeze the oil out. You will need about 12 capsules.For more fragrance, and 1 to 2 teaspoons of peppermint extract.
 The lotion will turn light and fluffy, sort of like buttercream frosting. If you don't have a hand mixer, you can use a stand mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks instead., Use a rubber spatula to scoop the whipped cream into a glass jar. You can leave the top fluffy and whipped, or you can smooth it down. Store the jar in the fridge so that the cream does not melt.

Use a glass jar that can hold about 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 milliliters). If the jar is too big, it will become inconvenient to use.

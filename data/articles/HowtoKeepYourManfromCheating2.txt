 Hold your guy’s hand in public. Give him a hug or a little kiss when no one is looking. Let him know you’re thinking about him even if the two of you are out with friends. Small gestures of flirtiness and affection can go a long way in a relationship.
 Make time for just the two of you. Date nights and quality time may improve your current relationship.Try taking some time away from your cell phone and focus only on your time with your boyfriend or husband.


Try going to a new location, such as a beach a couple hours away from your house or a restaurant you’ve never been to before. Sharing new experiences together will strengthen your bond further.
 Don’t be afraid to try something new or spontaneous. Take advantage of spontaneity when you have the chance.Express your desires to your man, and encourage him to express his to you.


Keep in mind that good sex with you will not prevent your man from cheating. Most men cheat because of emotional reasons rather than sexual ones.However, having a good sex life can increase your connection and communication with one another.
 Clinginess demonstrates insecurity and can be irritating to some people. If you tend to seek your man's approval, text him constantly throughout the day, or drop your other plans to spend time with him, then this might be considered clingy behavior.Try to work on enjoying your alone time and become more independent.


For example, you might take yourself on a date once per week, or use your alone time to work on something you are passionate about, such as writing poetry, painting, or playing video games.
You might also try imagining what a confident woman would do in your shoes.For example, would she text her boyfriend all day because she is lonely, or would she get out and do something fun?

 The best way to solidify your desire to improve is to join a community of speed-cubers.


You can go to http://www.speedsolving.com or http://www.reddit.com/r/cubers or even Facebook and Google plus.
 Better yet why not teach a friend how to solve and do it together. Remember motivation is the key to practice, which is the key to success.
 It doesn't matter how fast your times are, feel free to look up some local (near-by states, regions, provinces) competitions on worldcubeassociation.org and compete! You will meet other speedcubers and can work to improve on your techniques .

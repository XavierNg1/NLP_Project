 One of the benefits of adopting a senior dog instead of a puppy, is that most senior dogs are already trained. When adopting a senior dog, you will not need to worry about the dog going to the bathroom in the house. They have likely already developed this skill. Similarly, senior dogs will already be able to follow a number of basic commands such as sit, stay, and come. Essentially adopting a young dog is a lot of work and they will require constant attention and lots of training.Senior dogs can also easily learn new commands and tricks, contrary to popular belief.;
, Senior dogs will require some form of daily exercise. Typically this can be achieved in the form of a short walk or game of fetch in the backyard. Puppies, however, have a lot of energy and will require ample amounts of daily exercise. Explain that before adopting a dog, you should consider the amount of time you can devote to providing your dog with exercise. A senior dog is likely the better choice if you are looking for a calmer and less energetic companion.Senior dogs are also less likely to cause destruction in the home. For instance, a puppy is more apt to chew on your rug or couch as a way to burn off energy.
 Many people believe that rescue dogs, especially senior rescue dogs, have behavioural issues as a result of their previous living conditions. Although this is true in some instances, it is not a general rule for senior dog adoption. Senior dogs are put up for adoption for a variety of reasons. As a result, many senior dogs that are available for adoption have no real behaviour issues and make great companions and family pets.For example, sometimes people are forced to give up their pet because they are moving, the dogâ€™s owner died, the novelty of owning a dog wore off, loss of a job, or the family circumstances changed.

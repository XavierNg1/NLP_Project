, Many people have problems editing the settings for their routers due to programs such as Zone Alarm and Norton.
 For the address, type in "192.168.1.1" (without the quotes). This is the default address for most routers. Other routers use 192.168.0.1. Many have the IP address written on the router itself. If they don't work try a Google search for default password + your router name. To revert a router to its default settings, stick a pin in the hole at the back.
 The default username should be "admin" and the default password should be "password" (or "admin"). You should change your username and password as soon as possible, or else someone else might be able to mess up the configuration of your router (you do this in the settings, where there should be a section on security). If your browser takes you straight to the configuration without asking for a username and password, that is a security issue that you should fix.

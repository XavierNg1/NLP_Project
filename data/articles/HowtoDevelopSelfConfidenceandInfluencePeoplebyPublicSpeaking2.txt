 Good preparation should increase your confidence, even before your give your talk. Capitalize on it by thinking positively about our ability to talk in public; envision you giving the talk successfully. Don’t second guess yourself. Here are three things you can do to maintain the confident level when you give your talk:

, Breathe deeply for about 30 seconds before you face the audience. It will increase the oxygen level in your brain and helps you to focus, think clearly and remember your main points well. It will also calm your nerve and give you courage.
 Pep talk is a short speech that is given to encourage someone to work harder, to feel more confident and enthusiastic. Is you telling yourself “you can do this” or “you will give the best talk” or maybe just a simple cheer like “go, go, go; success, success, success.” You can talk to yourself internally or you can find a secluded space and whisper it to yourself. Athletes use pep talk before their games; public speaker use pep talk before their speeches; why can’t you use it too?

, Draw yourself up and look your audience straight in the eyes. Don’t walk feeling defeated, it will certainly show up in your talk.

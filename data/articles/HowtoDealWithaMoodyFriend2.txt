 Sometimes, your friend's emotions can overwhelm you. If you feel yourself being drawn into their drama, give yourself permission to ignore their texts and calls, or to join another group at lunch. Engage your friend on your terms to keep your life in control.


Some moody people use their moods to control their friends and gain attention. If you feel you are always tip toeing around a friend, and always the one who is making compromises to avoid a scene, your friend might be manipulating you. Be kind, but don’t feel you always need to do things their way just to make them happy or avoid drama.
 When stating what you'd like to do, don't sound timid or, on the other hand, aggressive. Simply say something like — "I'd rather go to the movies than the mall. Want to come along?" or "I'm not going to be able to hang out today. See you tomorrow."

, Don’t feel you need to be with your moody friend 24/7. No one has that much energy to give. Go have fun with someone else. Go for a walk. Getting away for a while will boost your energy and make it easier for you to help your friend., You can’t change how another person feels, but you can change how you react to them. Treat your moody friends the same way you treat your non-moody friends., If nothing you do seems to help, and your friend’s moods are interfering with your ability to enjoy life, it might be time to step back from the friendship. It might seem drastic, but sometimes the best thing you can do for someone is let them experience the natural consequences of their behavior.

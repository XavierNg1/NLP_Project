 Make sure you don't put any nail polish on the curved side. Allow the base coat layer to dry completely and don't touch it before then., If you want your stone magnet to be sparkly/glitter, try putting on glitter nail polish. If you do not have glitter nail polish, applying regular glitter to the wet clear coat will work just as well.

If you have added your sparkles, make sure that the glitter layer is dry before you start adding the solid colored nail polish.
 You can marble it by adding a single blob to the middle, and another blob of nail polish to the side of it, then slowly swirling them together with a toothpick. If you do it too much mixing, they will turn into a mess!,, Let the clear layer dry as well., Make sure you add the glue to the flat side, over the nail polish., If it's hot glue, be sure to push it down a lot.,

Hot glue will take a matter of seconds for it to dry. Wait a minute before touching to allow the glue to be completely set.
Tacky glue may take a day, so do not mess around with your rock at all unless you know it is completely dried.
 You are now finished with your glass stone magnet. Flip it over and you will see the curved side and pretty nail polish designs. Stick it to your fridge, calendar, etc--anything magnetic.

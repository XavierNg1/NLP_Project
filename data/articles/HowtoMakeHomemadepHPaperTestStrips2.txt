 Litmus is a compound that is derived from lichens, fungi that form symbiotic relationships with alga and/or cyanobacteria capable of photosynthesis. You can purchase litmus online or at a chemical supply store.

It is possible to make your own litmus powder if you are a competent chemist. However, the process is quite involved and includes adding several compounds such as lime and potash to ground lichens and allowing weeks for fermentation., Make sure to stir the solution and heat if the powder is not dissolving well. The litmus powder needs to dissolve completely into the water. The resulting solution should be a violet-blue color., Get all sides and corners of the paper wet with the solution. This will give you the most surface area on the test strip and provide the most accurate results. You do not need to leave the paper to “soak” as long as you ensure that it is coated thoroughly., You should dry the paper in the open air, but be sure that you are not exposing it to acidic or basic vapors. These vapors could contaminate the strips and make the inaccurate. You should also be sure to store them in a dry, dark place to prevent contamination and bleaching., Blue litmus papers turn red in the presence of an acid. Keep in mind that they will not indicate how strong the acid is, or whether a solution is basic. No change means that the solution is either basic or neutral, but not acidic.You can make red litmus paper (that turns blue when exposed to a base) by adding acid to the indicator solution before soaking your paper.

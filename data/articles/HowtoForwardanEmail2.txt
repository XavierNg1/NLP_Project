 Make sure that everything is in order. Be aware of how far back the email thread goes.
 If you want to forward the most recent email (and all of its predecessors) in a thread of messages, simply click "Forward" in the text box below the message. If you can't find this option: click the down arrow at the top-right of the message, next to the Reply button, to open a drop-down menu. Choose the second option, "Forward.", Choose whether each recipient falls into the To, Cc, or Bcc category. Make sure that you get the names right, and that you don't forward to the wrong person!

, Gmail will automatically forward any text, photo, or other files that are attached to the message thread. If you don't want to forward an attached file, scroll down to the bottom of the message and click the x next to each unwanted attachment. You can use ‚Üê Backspace (or select-and-delete) to remove an embedded image.
 Forward the email, when you are ready. Remember: once it's sent, you can't take it back!

 This simple approach gives plenty of room for discovery, research, creativity, analysis and conclusions.
 Make the question an exciting one that sparks the imagination and interest of the child or children. The best questions tend to be those that are large, open-ended, difficult and interesting:


Encourage children to consider theories rather than concrete answers. If the question seems unanswerable, children will be encouraged to posit many possibilities, pushing their thinking boundaries. Nothing is too fantastical or difficult for a child to tackle if you have faith in their ability to get on with discovery.
Broader, harder questions promote deeper and longer discussions.
Consider using a mix of familiar things and less well known things. For example, you may have pets, a garden or noisy neighbors. Questions you could ask about these include things like: "Why did cats decide to live with humans?", "Can a garden be a source of health?" or "Why do some noises annoy us more than others?" Then you can ask bigger picture questions, such as "Can we use weeds to fuel our cars?" or "What was Ancient Greece really like?".
For many ideas of good questions, check How to formulate questions for SOLE activities.
 There are many possibilities here, such as reading a brief information sheet, showing a video, playing music or audio, showing images, etc., all things related to the question. Basically, look for something that sparks curiosity and causes the child to want to dig deeper and look for the solutions.

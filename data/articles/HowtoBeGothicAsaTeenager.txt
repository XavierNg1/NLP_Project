 Are you trying to BECOME goth? Or do you feel this is naturally you? Goth is something you are naturally. You either are goth or you aren't. You can't be something you're not. If you feel you are being yourself, by all means carry on reading.;
, Research helps a lot because then you know what you're talking about when someone asks you what goth is, you're not just stood in awe looking like a poseur. Do your homework first.
 Goth isn't about finding and buying the most expensive clothes. Look in charity/thrift shops, there's loads of things you could buy. Remember to never look too hard, you could find a great jacket by simply looking in a charity shop

, Considering you're all warped up in getting your music taste, research and fashion sorted, you still need to study and do the required work to get a good grade. Many people believe stereotypes like goths are high school drop-outs, druggies, alcoholics or smokers etc. Prove them wrong.
 There's a lot of different genres, like gothic rock, death rock, EBM, Darkwave, new wave, and remember listen to what you like. Don't stop listening to a band just because it's not goth and don't listen to a band just because it's goth. If you don't like something, you don't, and you can't force yourself to like it.
 If you want to ask your parents first.
 Wait until you can or your parents let you.
 You don't have to stick to black, there loads of other colours to choose. Experiment and watch tutorials. You don't have to wear make-up.
 Keep doing the things you love. Goth isn't about being depressed. It's just about seeing the darker side of life, embracing it and seeing beauty in things that would appear ugly, weird, strange, abnormal, disturbing or disgusting to "normal" people.

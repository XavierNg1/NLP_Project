 Rely on the ultimate expert of what your girlfriend likes: your girlfriend. Make shopping together an adventurous prelude to breaking out your purchase at home.
 If your budget is an issue, stick to it when it comes time to select what you are actually going to bring home with you that day. In the meantime, though, let your girlfriend try on the whole store if she likes. Make a mental note of what she immediately gravitates toward, as well as any unexpected items that excite her. Know exactly what to buy the next time around when you go shopping on your own.
 If you feel excited by an item that she tries on but feels uncertain about, express it!Be sure to compliment her, though, rather than the item alone, as in, “You look great in that,” instead of, “That looks great.” Build her self-confidence so she feels perfectly comfortable wearing the styles you like most.
 Should your girlfriend absolutely love a piece that totally turns you off, don’t be dismissive. Give the reason why you don’t like it some thought, even if (or especially if) your knee-jerk reaction is instantly negative. Before you share the reason why, compliment the way she looks in it so her self-esteem isn’t threatened. Then let her know why you don’t find that particular item attractive, and finish with a complimentary suggestion of how another, similar piece might satisfy the both of you.

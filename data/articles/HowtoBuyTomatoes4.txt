 Canned varieties will save you the step of chopping and seeding fresh tomatoes and will hold up better than fresh tomatoes in meals cooked for long periods of time.,


Canned tomatoes can be purchased whole, stewed, diced and crushed. Choose what type of tomato you need according to the meal you're preparing. Crushed and stewed tomatoes work well for pasta sauces, while diced or whole tomatoes can be used in chili and stew. When choosing your type of tomato, remember that canned tomatoes that have been diced or chopped will have preservatives added to them to keep them from breaking down in the can. Whole or stewed tomatoes will have fewer additives and can be diced at home if you have time.
Look for canned tomatoes that are labeled "no salt added" or "no sugar added." This label means that no additional preservatives have been added to the tomatoes, letting you better control the sodium and sugar levels in your finished meal.
Check expiration dates on canned tomatoes before purchasing. Be sure you will be able to use the can before it reaches the expiration date.

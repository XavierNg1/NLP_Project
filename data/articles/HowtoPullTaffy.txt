 Here is a simple recipe you can follow:

In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine 1 cup (191.6 g) of sugar, 1/4 cup (59 ml) of light corn syrup, 2/3 cup (157.7 ml) of water, 2 tbsp. (28.7 g) of butter, 1 tbsp. (9.46 g) of cornstarch and 1 tsp. (5 g) of salt. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Heat without stirring until the mixture achieves 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius). Measure this using a candy thermometer for best results.
Remove the saucepan from heat. Stir in 1 tsp. (9g) of vanilla extract, 2 tsp. (18g) of almond extract and 10 drops of a food coloring of your choice. You can split your batch between 2 saucepans and use 5 drops of different colors of food coloring in each, if you want to have more than 1 color. After the color is well mixed, pour onto buttered baking sheets, 1 for each color.;
,, Pick up the taffy with 2 hands. Form the taffy into a ball., (You will be pulling taffy for quite a while, so find a comfortable position or friends to help).,

If you plan on making a lot of taffy, invest in a taffy hook. They are available through online kitchen stores. Install this large metal hook on your wall, clean it, and then hook the taffy around the middle, and pull. Double the taffy on the hook. Pull and repeat. This allows you to pull back and use momentum to help you, making it less exhausting.
Grease your hands with butter again as needed throughout the process of pulling.
 This will indicate there are enough air bubbles inside to make it fluffy. Pulling taffy can take 15 to 60 minutes, depending upon the number of people you have pulling and the amount of taffy you are working with., You may need to take it between your 2 palms and rotate your hands back and forth to keep the round rope shape. Cut the taffy with clean, greased scissors and wrap the taffy in wax paper., Cut with greased scissors and wrap in wax paper squares.

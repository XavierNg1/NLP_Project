 It's rude to talk, e-mail, or text when dining out with others.;
, Don't yell across the table or across the room.If you see someone you know, walk up to their table to say hello.
 No one wants to see your food inside your mouth. Also, if you get food around or on your mouth, don't use your tongue to lick it away. Use a napkin.
, If you rest your wrists on the table with your hands crossed, this shows to others that you want to talk and have a conversation.
 Dining out with other people is not the time and place to get drunk.
 If something goes wrong with the dish you ordered, politely tell the waiter or waitress, and ask for the dish to be fixed or order another dish.

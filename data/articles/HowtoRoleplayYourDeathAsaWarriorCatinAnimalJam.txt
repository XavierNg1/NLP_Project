 There are numerous kinds to choose from, but it has to be realistic and probably would be better if it wasn't too much of a violent cause. The ways that should be stayed away from are deathberries (because the symptoms can be very violent), killed by another cat (because if you purposely want this death, it may be hard to find a willing murderer), and any death violently in water because this can be very intense.

Less-violent death methods like greencough and old age are recommended, especially the latter because it is painless and your clan-mates do not have to be as regretful of your death.;
, If you want your leader to know you are going to act out your death, then tell him/her so that he/she will know in advance., If you get taken by a hawk, it's not like you can just crawl back to camp and say so., Ideal description for a fox death: "Vv Suddenly a fox jumps out in front of Waspleaf and claws her side Vv" and then "Vv Waspleaf falls to the ground and the fox runs away Vv". Not-so-ideal description: " Vv A fox jumps in front of Waspleaf and claws her side making guts fall out Vv". You don't want to disgust your clan-mates. Besides, if a fox clawed a cat's side, it is very unlikely that the guts will fall out. Keep being realistic in mind., If you do, people might think you're trying to be dramatic and get attention. Say some last words if you want, and be done. After you say last words, have a narrative like this: "Vv As her last words escaped her mouth, Waspleaf took a final breath and went still Vv"., After you die, you can be reborn in one of your clan-mate's litters or be an abandoned rouge kit the clan found.

 Your bones continue to develop up to your mid-twenties.However, young people are especially capable of doing the high-intensity exercises that encourage bone growth.Accordingly, encourage children and teens to do any sort of exercise they are interested in, especially weight-bearing exercises like most team sports.
 Your mid-twenties are the most important years for building bone mass that will last into adulthood. Accordingly, be sure to consistently do weight-bearing exercises at this age, both to strengthen your bones, and to increase the amount of time they are likely to stay strong.Gradual, natural bone loss begins to occur at around age 35.
 Keep exercising at least twice a week during middle age to slow down natural decreases in bone density. Great options for people in their thirties, forties, and beyond include brisk walking, stair climbing, or using cross-training machines or exercise bands.You can also include resistance training using your body weight, free weights, machines, or resistance bands.
 If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis or any other skeletal condition, know that some types of exercise may put you at risk for skeletal injuries. Further, if you have health problems—such as heart trouble, high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity— check with your doctor before you begin a moderate or intense exercise program of any type.For instance, ask questions like "What type of exercises will help me safely maintain my bones' strength?" or "I've been thinking about getting back into golf. Is this safe, considering my condition?"

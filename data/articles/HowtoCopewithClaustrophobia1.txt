 Anytime you find yourself becoming anxious, the first step is to breathe. Deep breathing activates your body’s relaxation response, which makes it a powerful anti-anxiety tool. Whenever you experience a claustrophobic response, use deep breaths to slow your thoughts and reduce feelings of panic.Inhale to a count of 4.
Hold your breath to a count of 4.
Exhale to a count of 4.
Repeat this cycle at least 10 times.
Closing your eyes may help you focus on your breathing. If this makes you more anxious, focus your gaze on something neutral.;
, Another way to say this is to go to your “happy place.” Imagine a place where you feel calm and relaxed. Imagine this place in as much detail as you can. If you are in midst of a claustrophobic reaction, or any time you feel anxiety creeping up, close your eyes and use this calming visualization.This can be a place you have been or sometime completely imagined.
What does this place look like? Sound like? Smell like?
Try practicing this meditation regularly so that is it easy to access when you need it.
 If you feel panicked, try a quick "body scan" to find and release unnecessary tension. Better yet, practice "progressive muscle relaxation" so you can draw on it when you need it:Sit down somewhere comfortable, preferably in a quiet place.
Select a part of your body to begin with (such as your left hand).
Tense this location for 5 seconds. Make sure to keep breathing evenly.
Take a deep breath, and release all the tension from that location.
Repeat with various parts of your body (such as the other hand, each bicep, each leg, your buttocks, or your face). The order does not matter.
Do this for around 15 minutes, or until you feel you have tensed and released your entire body.
Repeat this exercise once daily, and whenever you feel anxious.

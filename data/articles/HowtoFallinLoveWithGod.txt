 Pray about anything you have on your mind that is bothering you. God is always listening. You may pray in your own way. Talk to God as you would with your best friend.;
, Do not only read the Bible, go through it and read the explanations.
 Science, unlike many people say and believe, does not separate us from God. Instead, when you go through scientific books and read scientific facts, you will know how Glorious God is because of all that he has created. This will help you with being emotionally in love With God, knowing everything He has made for us.
 He might have better plans for your future than what you were praying for.
 Any Christian Church is good, whether Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant. Jesus is with everyone that seeks Him. He will listen to you and be your friend even if you don't belong to a specific Church. You only have to believe in Him.

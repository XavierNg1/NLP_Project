 A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. This helps screen out hackers, viruses, and worms that are trying to reach your computer over the Internet.Windows has built firewall protection into the program since 2001.It was built to specifically protect your system from outside attacks.
 Because your built-in firewall only protects from outside attacks, you’ll want to download a third-party firewall. This will help protect your computer from local programs that are abusing your network connection. There are many no-cost firewalls that will work on multiple PCs: Kerio Personal Firewall 2, Outpost Firewall Free, Sygate Personal Firewall 5.1, and Zone Labs’ ZoneAlarm 3.7 are four solid free firewalls.These can be found online simply by searching their names. The free download option is on the homepage for each of the programs.
 Firewalls have a default setting. This setting allows other PCs on the same network to browse. However, they won’t be able to access your files and printers. You can enable this by right-clicking the firewall’s system tray icon.Choose options, and then Network Neighborhood.
Select the interface you use to connect in the drop-down list that appears.
Uncheck the box next to “Allow others to share my files and printer(s)” and then click OK.
Now your computer is safe from local and outside attacks.

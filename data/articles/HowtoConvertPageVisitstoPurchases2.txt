 If you are attracting plenty of visitors but not scoring many purchases, it may be due to your design.


Enlist marketing and sales professionals to help. A talented graphic designer or webmaster might be able to make your site look great, but to convert visits to sales, functionality is more important than looks.
 There should be nothing confusing about your website's landing page.


Include a visible and unmistakable call to action. For example, a large "Shop Sale" button will help get visitors to the page where they will make purchases.
 Visitors might get frustrated if they add something to their shopping bag or cart, and then have a hard time finding their way back to the page they were shopping on.


Allow visitors to take a closer look at pictures or evaluate sizes without losing their place. Use pop up boxes or images that enlarge immediately when the cursor hovers instead of sending people to a separate page.
 When your site can securely remember credit card information, shipping and billing addresses, customers will have an easier and quicker time shopping and buying when they return.
 Your visitors will have a better shopping experience if they can get feedback on what other customers think. A positive review on a product might make them more likely to buy it.
 Online shoppers enjoy engaging with retailers and brands through surveys, polls, quizzes and sharing.
 Some sites allow shoppers to live chat with a customer service representative. This can be a great way to sell additional items on your site.
 When a customer is ready to make a purchase, close the deal immediately.


Allow diverse methods of payment. Accept all credit cards, gift cards and coupons, and offer PayPal as an option.

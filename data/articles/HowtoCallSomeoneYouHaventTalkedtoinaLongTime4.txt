 It’s possible that this person did not pick up your call at all, and now you are left with the message machine. When you are leaving your message, start in the same way as if they had picked up the phone, by saying hi and telling them who is calling.


Say something like, “Hi Marco, it’s Deborah from law school!”

, After saying your name, tell them something like, “I hope you’re doing well” or “I hope that you and Claire are well.” This is a nice way of showing them you care about their well-being and acts as a stand in for asking them about themselves, which you can’t do when you’re leaving a message.
 If you have a specific purpose for calling, for instance if you need a favor or have a question, mention it in the message. If you are just calling to get back in touch, say something like, “I was just thinking about you the other day and thought I should give you a call.” It doesn’t have to be an elaborate reason or story; just saying that they were on your mind is enough., Say a few sentences about how you are and how you’ve been. Say a few basic things that relate to how you’ve been spending your time. Keep it short and don’t go on and on, or else it will seem like you’re more interested in yourself than you are in them.


For instance say: “I’ve been doing well. I just got a new job as a social media coordinator and I’ve taken up tennis again.”

, Say that you are sorry you missed them, and say that they should give you a call back. Make sure to give them a call back number as well as the best time to reach you.


Say something like, “Give me a call back when you’re free and we can catch up! I’m usually free in the evenings if that’s a good time for you.”

, Say a quick goodbye after you are done giving your contact information. Something like, “Alright, I hope to talk to you soon, bye,” is a perfectly good way of saying goodbye.

 Microsoft introduced a new display driver in Windows Vista, which enables the Aero effects. Because of this new driver, Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1 do not support full-screen command prompt. If you absolutely need the Command Prompt to be full-screen, you can disable this new driver. This will limit your image options and restrict your display to 800 x 600, but it will allow you to use the Command Prompt in full-screen. If you need to return to your normal display, you just need to re-enable the drivers., You can find the Control Panel in the Start menu. In Windows 8.1, right-click the Start button and select "Control Panel" from the list.
 If you're in Category view, select "Hardware and Sound" and then select "Device Manager".
 This will list all of the display adapters (video cards) that you have installed. Most users will have one or two adapters listed here.
 You'll be asked to confirm that you want to turn it off. Your screen will likely shut off for a moment and restart in a lower resolution.


If you have multiple adapters, you'll need to disable your primary adapter. If you don't know which one this is, just disable all of them.
 Open the Command Prompt and press Alt+â†µ Enter to make it full-screen. Press the keys again to switch it back. You can continue to do this for as long as the drivers are disabled.
 If you need to use your display drivers again, you can quickly re-enable them from the Device Manager. Right-click on the disabled driver and select "Enable" to turn it back on. You may have to restart your computer.

Combine the peppercorns, smashed cardamom pods, cloves, ginger, vanilla bean and seeds and cinnamon stick together in a bowl.;
, Combine the spices and water in a small saucepan. Bring the saucepan to the boil, then cover and simmer for five minutes.
 Add the loose leaf black tea to the saucepan, and continue to simmer for another five minutes. If you do not have loose leaf black tea, it is possible to use a tea bag instead.
 While the tea is simmering, heat the milk using a stand-alone milk steamer or the steam wand of an espresso machine.






Steaming milk is a delicate process. If you're using a steam wand, hold the nozzle just a fraction below the surface of the milk for about five seconds in order to stretch the milk. Then you should submerge the nozzle a fraction further in order to spin the milk in a whirlpool motion.
Continue steaming until the temperature of the milk reaches 140 degrees fahrenheit (60 celsius), or the jug becomes too hot to hold. Consider investing in a steaming thermometer in order to get the temperature just right.
If you do not have a milk steamer, you can warm the milk using a microwave or by heating it on the stove.
Be careful not to burn the milk, as it will affect the taste of the tea.
 Strain the tea mixture into a mug using a fine mesh strainer. Fill the cup half or two thirds of the way to the top.






Add the heated or foamed milk to the tea, filling the cup to the top.
Add sugar or honey, to taste.

If you're obtaining a green card through your employer, your employer must file Form I-140, Petition for an Alien Worker.
If you're an entrepreneur investing money, you need to file Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur.
If you're in a special category such as a widow or widower, file Form I-360.If you're a refugee or asylee, you most likely don't need an underlying petition if you meet the requirements to adjust status., Once your relative, employer or you yourself file your initial petition, you need to check to see whether a visa is available before filing the remaining application forms.

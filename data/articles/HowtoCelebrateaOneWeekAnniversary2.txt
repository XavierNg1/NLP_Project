 Communication and words can go a long way, especially when building a new relationship. Be honest about your feelings, and let him/her know that you like being with them.


Tell her how she makes you feel.
Tell her that you’re thankful that you’re together.
Tell him that you look forward to the weeks to come.
 A lot of couples have been together for a year or even ten. Don’t talk about things that’ll dampen what you’ve got so far. Take it at a slow pace, and make sure you’re both on the same page.


Don’t talk about meeting his/her parents to take the relationship to the next level.
Don’t talk about marriage or moving in together as you can appear desperate and needy.
 Be simple and honest in your compliments. Keep it light and friendly.


Look them in the eye when you give a compliment. This shows that you're paying attention and truly mean what you say.Tell him that you like his clothing style or how he did his hair that day.
Tell her that her perfume smells really nice or that you like her hair tie.
 Whenever the topic of your significant other comes up, make sure you keep the conversation positive and uplifting, especially if they’re around.People talk, and the compliments you say about your boyfriend/girlfriend will get around to them.Don't say negative things or gossip about your significant other. If you're having a problem, speak honestly and openly about it. Resolve the conflict by communicating.

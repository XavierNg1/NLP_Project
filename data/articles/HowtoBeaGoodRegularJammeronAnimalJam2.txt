 One thing you can do is to organize a job at your den. Another way would be to go to someone else's den. You are growing up, and you are probably 19 years old. Be realistic. Don't get a job likeÂ bluegrass player/plate spinner/hot celeb/unicorn tamer. Also, you could work at an existing place, like the SOL arcade.
 Here are some ideas for great jobs:


Singer(you can become a hot celeb if you pick this job!)
Doctor
Entertainer (you might personally hire some entertainment, but be realistic and don't hire Justin Beiber or 1D because they are way too busy!)
Teacher
Flight attendant/Captain
Dancer

, Before you do step 7, get a family to come to your birthday party, wedding, child's birthday, Bar/Bat mitzvah, and more!

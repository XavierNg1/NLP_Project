 Before cleaning the green beans, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap for at least twenty seconds. This is especially important if you have been touching raw meat or eggs. Always wash your hands between handling meat and working with produce., If you are cutting the green beans with a knife, make sure that you are using a different cutting board than you are for raw meats. This will help prevent cross-contamination and food-borne illness caused by bacteria, such as E. Coli and Salmonella., If you see mold on the green bean, toss the bean out, as well as any other beans that the mold might have spread to. Do not try cutting away the mold and eating the rest of the bean, as this might be risky with green beans., Many commercial produce washes are unnecessary when washing green beans. They are not any more effective at cleaning green beans than water is.

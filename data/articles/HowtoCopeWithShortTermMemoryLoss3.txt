 No matter the method, you need to record every single nugget of information you can. There needs to be a database of clues that can be pieced together to tell the entire story of what you’ve forgotten. Jot down dates, medicine you have to take, dates of significance, details about everything.


Try organization via timeline. If you have an lunch appointment at 11:00am, try writing into your calendar or planner the wake up time, preparation time, driving time, the actual meeting time, and then the drive back. Use a diary. Sometimes the quick notes we jot down aren’t enough to fill in all the information. A more detail-oriented diary could help with the missing pieces.Write items as you’re doing or trying to remember them. Don’t wait until you’re finished and try to recollect everything. Make it part of your every-day life to write while you do things. If it helps, use a tape recorder. , A routine serves as a starting point for all memories. It helps you remember everything from the mundane to the complex by anchoring to something that doesn’t require memory. It accelerates other memories. To remember to take your pills every morning, leave a reminder by putting them on top of your deodorant bottle. Deodorant is an every-day routine, and the pills will stick out like a sore thumb. Put your keys, wallet, and change in your hat every day when you get home. That way the items are there without worrying about losing them. , For every date and obligation you have, set alarms to remind you. Ideally, this works best on a phone or a computer. Just set up the reminder in the calendar or app you like best, and let the program do the hard work. If you don’t have a phone or computer nearby, try using an egg-timer. Write a note beside the egg-timer and then set it for the amount of time you need.
Quick items work well on a watch as well. Just set a phone alarm for the desired time and you can rely on it for a single reminder.

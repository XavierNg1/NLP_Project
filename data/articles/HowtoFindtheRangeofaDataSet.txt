 Let's say your data set contains the following numbers: {7, 8, 65, 8, 4, 7}. All you have to do is rewrite them from smallest to largest, to get a better sense of the data you are working with. Here's how it would look: {4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 65}.;
, In the set you are working with, the smallest number is 4 and the largest is 65. These numbers can be conveniently located on either end of the set of data, since you rearranged the numbers from smallest to largest.
 Now, all you have to do is subtract the smallest number, 4, from the largest number, 65. 65-4 = 61.
 "61" represents the range of this particular set of data. You're all done. If you want to find the range of a function, then you'll have to follow a slightly more complicated process, but this is all you have to do to calculate the range of a set of data.

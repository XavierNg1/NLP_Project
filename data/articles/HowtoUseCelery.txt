 Celery should be firm, crisp, and not wilted when purchased. Avoid any blemished stalks or cracked stalks. Store in the fridge in a plastic bag or with the tail end sitting in a little water.;
, Both the stalks and the leaves are edible. Add chopped celery to salads or as sticks with dips. For the kids, spread nut butter into the centre of the stalk and place sultanas at even intervals, to make "ants on a log".


Remove the stringy parts if you find that the stalks are too tough.
 Add celery to your stir-fry for a crunchy, tasty improvement. Slice it on an angle, about finger length for inclusion.
 Celery soup is creamy and nutritious, and is very warming on cold days. It goes perfectly with crunchy bread or toast.
 It's a delicious addition that helps to make the vegetables go further.
 Celery leaves can be used for various dishes, to add flavour. Use in stock, broth, soup, or in salads. Celery leaves also make great garnishes.


Use them to flavor and garnish a fish.

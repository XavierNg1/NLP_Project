, If you've saved other custom dictionaries in different folders, copy them too. They are generally located in the following folder: Boot_Drive\Documents and Settings\user_name\Application Data\Microsoft\Proof

,, Select each dictionary file in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, and read the "Full path".
 To add your custom dictionary, first move the custom dictionary files to the folder you copied it from (i.e., somewhere inside the Proof folder). Then, on that same computer, click the Microsoft Office Button, and then click Word Options. Go to Proofing, then click the Custom Dictionaries button, and then click the Add button.

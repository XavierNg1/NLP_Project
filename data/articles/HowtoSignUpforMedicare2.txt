 Before you agree to any medical procedures (such as scans or lab work), check to see if your treatment will be covered by your Medicare plan. Each Part offers different coverage, so it is important that you read about what your particular plan offers.You should also check to make sure that your doctor's office accepts Medicare--most do.You can find out whether a specific treatment is covered by reading the provided material. You can get this at the Social Security Office or online when you enroll.
There should be someone at the doctor's office or hospital who is familiar with Medicare. Ask to speak to that person, and they should be able to tell you whether or not what you need done will be covered.
 Since Medicare is a program of the federal government, it is subjective to changes. Sometimes legislation can affect things like coverage and premiums. Make sure to stay current on the news relating to health care.If you think there has been legislation that may affect you, you can ask your insurance provider or the Social Security Office for more information.
 Your doctor (and his support staff) are one of the most important health care resources that you have. Talk to him about any concerns you may have. For example, if he recommends a procedure that is not covered by Medicare, find out if this is an essential medical necessity. Medicare does not dictate that you only see one doctor. You should feel free to get a second opinion if you are not comfortable with the options being provided.

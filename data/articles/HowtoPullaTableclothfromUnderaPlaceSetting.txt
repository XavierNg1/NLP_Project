Make sure the tablecloth is flat on the table and free of wrinkles.






The tablecloth should be flush with the end opposite that from which you will be pulling (the cloth should not overhang the table along that edge).






Let the tablecloth hang well over the edge from which you will be pulling.

, Begin with just one plate or bowl right in the middle of the table. Once you master this, add more dishes and arrange some of them closer to the table's edges until you are prepared to do the trick with a real table setting.
 If the dishes are too light, the trick will be hard to perform. This is especially a problem with plastic dishes. Usually, however, dishes have something in or on them at the table, so this isn't a problem. If you're practicing, put some fruit in the dishes, as this minimizes any spillage problem.
 Position yourself so that you are at about the midpoint of the edge of the tablecloth you'll be pulling.
 If you've laid the tablecloth correctly, you'll have plenty of cloth draped over the edge of the table from which you'll be pulling. Use your hands to bunch this excess cloth up until you reach the edge of the table.
 Very quickly pull the tablecloth straight toward the floor. As you are doing so, smoothly step back from the table, but do not pull the tablecloth outward.

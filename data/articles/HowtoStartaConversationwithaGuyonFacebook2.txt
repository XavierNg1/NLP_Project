 Like starting a conversation for dating, you should always check out his profile for common ground, even if you're trying to become friends. If it doesn't have public information, ask him about it., If you just want a friend, you don't want to send a signal that you want something more.In other words, don't flirt. You don't want to comment it on his cute eyes if you just want to be friends.
 Say why you're contacting the person and what you want: "Hi, my name is Jake, and I'm looking for new friends in the area.", People like to talk about themselves, so ask him about what he likes and who he is.As an example, you could say, "Hi, I noticed your profile today, and I found it interesting. Can you tell me more about yourself?"

, When beginning a conversation, open-ended questions (questions that require more than a "yes" or "no" to answer) encourage the conversation to continue.For example, instead of asking "Do you like books?" ask him "What kind of books do you like to read?"

, For instance, if you both like basketball, focus on that.For instance, you could say, "Hi, I'm Ashley. I see you love playing basketball. I love to shoot hoops, too. Did you play for your high school or college team?"

, That is, use "howdy" or "what's up?" as opposed to "hi" or "hello." Studies done by OkCupid show a person is more likely to respond to an unusual word.

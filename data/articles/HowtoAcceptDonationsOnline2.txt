 If you don’t want to deal with setting up a merchant account, a third-party processor will use their merchant account to accept credit card donations on your behalf. You will be charged a processing fee by the third-party processor. Also, expect delays in transferring the money to your account.The fees charged by a third-party processor are typically a percentage of each transaction.
 Popular companies who work with nonprofits include Network for Good and Democracy in Action. These companies have centralized websites to which donors are referred. They not only provide credit card processing, but they also send acknowledgement notices to donors. Their acknowledgement communications include information about your nonprofit organization and your cause., PayPal also offers opportunities for nonprofits to accept donations online. They have a donate button that nonprofits can easily integrate into their websites. They also offer widgets that organizations can put on their social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. They offer low transaction fees for nonprofits, and they don’t charge any set up or recurring monthly fees.To be eligible for this option with PayPal, an organization must have a documented 501(c)(3) status.
 Third-party processors are easy to set up and manage and inexpensive to maintain. If you go with a well-known company, you can have confidence that your transactions will be processed quickly and accurately. However, your name does not appear on financial transactions on the donor’s credit card statement. Also, you should expect a delay of a few days before funds are transferred into your account.

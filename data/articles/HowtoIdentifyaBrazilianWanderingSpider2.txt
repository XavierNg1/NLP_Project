 Several species of this spider live in southern Central America and northern South America. In particular, Brazilian wandering spiders live in the rainforest of northern Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Its habitat extends all the way down to northern Chile and Argentina., This nocturnal spider naturally likes to scuttle around on the forest floor. This “wandering” habit sometimes leads it to towns and cities, where it hides from sunlight in dark spots, including:Small, unlit closets or nooks in homes
Outdoor sheds and garages
Cars
Unused clothes, shoes, or gloves
Boxes of food in pantries
Boxes in attics or garages
Woodpiles

, This spider has made a name for itself by slipping into banana shipments and taking a ride along with the fruit. While this doesn’t happen very often, be careful when opening up and processing shipments from the Brazilian wandering spider’s habitat.

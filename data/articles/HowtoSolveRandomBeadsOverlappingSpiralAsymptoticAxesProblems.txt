Otherwise, Columns M and N have been omitted from this article for the sake of brevity; they calculated Total Spirallic Distance and Actual Radius. Columns O-Q are part of the Spheres_Lookup table and will be covered next.  Columns R-U are part of a fancy Goal Seeking scheme. Columns Vand W have to do with a Curve Components Chart I'm not including within this article for the sake of brevity. Columns X and Y have to do with Random Beads and will be covered later. Lastly, Column Z is a former Lookup3 for variable c = Q table series, unnecessary to the current work.

 Leave this chart on your worksheet for now. Here is an image of the Preliminary Chart with axes, grid lines and the legend removed. You may have to set the Scale to ±1.5 or so to get good roundness.
Random Beads Chart: Change the definition of Chgr from D3 to Insert Name Define Name Chgr for $X$10:$X$1450. Set Circle or Radius to = 4. You'll have to reopen the scale to defaults and perhaps reset the vertical to ± 5 or so. Your chart won't look like mine due to randomness. Hold down the Command key and tap the = key until you get an arrangement you like. Using Chart Layout, get rid of the default axes, legend and grid lines, unless you want to add shadow to the axis w/o numbers. That requires removing the linked to source checkmark and any pre-set number of decimal places and formatting them like this: ;;; Also get rid of the Plot Area and Chart Area default Line. You can set gradient to whatever you like, radial or path, centered, with as many colors as you like -- I used black at the tips and formatted the plot area to have a radial glowspot in blue and purple at the center. My line gradient went Black Red, Pink, Blue, Black. I set the Shadow to Perspective, Size 70%, Blur 0, Distance 0, Transparency 71% for Series 1. For the Plot Area, I also had A medium solid Blue at size 45 pt, 25% transparent, soft edges, 29 pt. And Plot Area Fill was left blue, then Pink in a tight band captured on the left by another blue and o the right by black. with 61% transparency, radially centered. 3D Format was Depth and Surface, Surface Material Powder. For Chart Area, I had Fill White with 0% transparency. I did a Copy Picture with the Shift Key and Paste Picture with the Shift Key and double-clicked on it and chose Picture Style as you see, once I had copied and pasted it atop my data worksheet and copied and pasted that picture. I had also added a Title about the file and the critical variable settings. Here is another view of that chart.
Overlapping Spiral Chart: Reset Chgr to Insert Name Define Name Chgr to $D$3. I had to rescale the chart to -.75 to .50 on the Vertical and -1, 1 on the Horizontal. Variable Factor was set to .50 and Radius was set to .50 -- Here are some pictures of that chart.
Asymptotic Axes Chart: Set Power to 3. Reset the axes to defaults if Radius = 1 and Factor = .5 while Power = 3.. Here is a picture of that chart. Of course the Title info is wrong, but those are the breaks .

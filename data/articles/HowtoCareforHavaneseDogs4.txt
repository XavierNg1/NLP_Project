 Unless you plan to responsibly breed your Havanese, you should plan to have your dog spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering prevents unwanted litters of puppies and also protects your dog’s health.Female dogs that have been spayed tend to have fewer problems with cancer and infections.
Male and female dogs that have been neutered or spayed are less likely to roam or engage in hormonal behaviors such as aggression., Havanese should not spend a lot of time outdoors due to their high-maintenance fur and their need to be around people all of the time. Your Havanese’s coat will get dirty and tangled if she spends too much time outdoors, so it is best to limit this time.


Take your Havanese out to go potty regularly throughout the day and after she goes potty, bring her right back in unless you can be outside with her.
 Just in case your Havanese ever gets out of the yard, it is important to make sure that those who find her will have a way to bring her home. Make sure that your Havanese is always wearing a tag that includes your phone number and address.


You may also want to have your Havanese implanted with a microchip to help people get her back to you if she ever gets lost., As soon as you take your Havanese home, you will need to make an appointment for her first veterinary checkup. Dogs need regular veterinary visits as well as vaccines, medicine, and other types of care to stay healthy. Some of the things that your Havanese will need include:


Lyme disease vaccination
Rabies vaccination
Heartworm prevention medicine
Spay or neuter operation
Annual exams and vaccination boosters

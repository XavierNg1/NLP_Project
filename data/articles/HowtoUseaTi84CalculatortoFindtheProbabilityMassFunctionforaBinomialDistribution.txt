 Make sure that you the binomial probability density function is what you are trying to find. We will use an example in which binomial pdf is what we need to use to find the solution.

Find the probability that an event will or will not occur in a given amount of “X” trials, given the “p” probability that it occurs in “n” trials. For example, if the probability that you will get heads in 10 coin flips is 55%, what is the probability that you will get heads every time in 6 coin flips?;
, You will have 3 values to enter:

X=the number of S's (successes) in n trials.
n=the number of trials
p=probability of the outcome

,,,,, You will be prompted for 'trials:', 'p:', and 'x value:'. Start with typing the value for 'trials:'. Press Enter.
,,, Press Enter.
 You have your answer.

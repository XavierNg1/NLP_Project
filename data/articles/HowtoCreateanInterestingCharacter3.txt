 With what gender you think is the best as your main character, choose it.
 For some personalities, they can be from 13-18, others are 22-30. Try to narrow it down by choosing if they are in high school, college, or have already graduated.
 If it is in an office building, you don't want your character to be 10. Just like you don't want your 22 year old character playing with children's toys.
 If later down the road as you are writing your story you decide that you want to change the age, that is okay. Just make sure you are not going from 18 to 28 because you might have to redo the story. It is best if it were in a 1-2 year difference range.

 This blend contains castile soap, so the shaving cream has a nice foamy lather when you apply it to wet skin. If you like a sudsier cream to use on your face, legs or underarms, this homemade recipe is for you. Here's what you'll need:


1/4 cup coconut oil
2 tablespoons shea or cocoa butter
1/4 cup aloe vera gel
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 cup liquid castile soap
10 drops essential oil of your choice
Empty liquid soap dispenser (preferably a foaming dispenser)

, Both shea butter and coconut oil are solid at room temperature, so it's necessary to melt them in order to blend them properly. Measure out 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) shea butter (or cocoa butter) and 1/4 cup coconut oil. Place the ingredients in a small saucepan. Melt them over low heat, stirring occasionally until they liquify, then remove the pan from heat.
 Pour all the ingredients together into a blender. Blend on high for several minutes to fully mix the ingredients together; this will prevent the oil and soap from separating later. The resulting liquid should have the texture of thick liquid soap., Some castile soap comes with a scent, so you can skip this step if your shaving cream already has an aroma. If you want to add your own essential oils, stir in 10 drops of your favorite oil or blend.


You can add up to 20 drops of essential oil if you like a stronger scent.
Try one of these mixtures: rose and vetiver; sandalwood and orange; fir and mint.
 Your shaving cream is now ready to use; just pump some out as you need it. It will foam as you apply it to your face. If the mixture separates in the container, shake well to recombine the oils and soap.

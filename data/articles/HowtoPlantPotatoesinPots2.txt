 A cupboard or closet in the basement works nicely. Keep them in an egg carton or other container to support them and check back each day to look for eyes.
 Keep the potatoes in this location, with the majority of the eyes facing upward, until short, dark green shoots form.
 The more eyes you have, the more spuds you can grow; however, the more potatoes you grow off one tuber, the smaller the potatoes will be. Select the three strongest eyes and rub the rest off with your finger or dig them out with a sharp knife.
 If you do not want to trim the eyes off the potato, cut the potato in half and treat the halves as two separate seeds. Each half should weigh between 1.5 and 2 ounces, and each should also have two or three eyes on it.


Allow the cut halves to callous over. The exposed portions should dry out and callous over if you set them out for a few days to dry.

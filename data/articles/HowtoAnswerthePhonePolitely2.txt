 Your home is your castle, as they say, and while phone etiquette is still the best practice, the formality of the office is not usually necessary.
 It's a universal greeting known around the world: "Hello?" Say it with a smile, and people will usually respond accordingly.


If, based on caller ID and experience, you know who's calling, feel free saying "Hi, Tom! How are you today?"
If you have caller ID and do not recognize the caller, or the call is either listed as "unknown," or "blocked," answering the phone is discretionary.
If you do choose to answer, be aware that the person on the other end of the line is probably in a business frame of mind, and answer accordingly. Be wary of giving out your name to strangers, however. A simple "Hello?" will suffice.
If they ask for you or another member of your household, ask them for their name and organization before you tell them anything—the last thing you want to do is give telemarketers too much information! If they're cagey or won't say who they are, remember—you're under no obligation to continue speaking to them.

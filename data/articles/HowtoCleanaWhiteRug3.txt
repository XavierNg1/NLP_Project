 A sheepskin rug can be brought back to life with a non-alkaline, pH balanced cleanser, like baby shampoo or sheepskin wash. Fill a bathtub with warm water and 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) mild cleanser. Lightly agitate the sheepskin in the water for five minutes and roll it up to squeeze out the water. Put it in your washing machine on the spin cycle to further remove excess water and lay it out to dry for the day.


Lay the sheepskin out to dry away from direct sunlight.
Use a metal brush to comb out the wool after it dries., To eliminate odors and freshen up fur and sheepskin rugs sans water, sprinkle unscented talcum powder or baking soda on your rug. Leave the powder on for a few hours, shake and brush out, and repeat as needed., If your rug is small enough to put in the washing machine and the care instructions do not advise against it, throw it in there. Adjust the washing machine cycle to gentle first, place the rug in a pillowcase or mesh bag and tumble dry on low.
 If you have a true, high-pile shag carpet, using a vacuum cleaner may be risky business. The rug fibers may get caught in the vacuum and become frayed. Turn your vacuum setting to high-pile or shake out dirt from a shag rug.

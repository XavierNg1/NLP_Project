 Some suede and leather ankle boots have a pretty ruffle trim along the top. Match these boots with simple pencil or A-line skirt, since pants may hide the ruffle from sight.
 This trim may come as a single row of ruffles at the opening of the shoe, or there may be multiple rows of ruffles. Match these flats with jeans and a simple blouse to give your style a subtle twist of feminine charm.
 Fashion scarves are highly trendy and add a nice splash of color and pattern to an otherwise plain dress or ensemble. A ruffled scarf uses elastic to create the appearance of draping ruffles throughout the length of the scarf.
 Some styles may have ruffles along the front opening, while others may have a little along the wrists or collar. Match these pieces with simple garments like fitted tank tops, skinny jeans, and pencil skirts.
 A shoulder bag with a ruffled design on it is an effective way to add ruffles to your style without worrying about drawing attention to any particular part of your body. Leave this purse behind when you decide to wear a busy outfit, however, since the ruffles on your bag could still clash with other patterns and embellishments on your clothing.

 There are several different types of softbox that you can make with foamcore.
 You can make this easily using simply a box; or, follow the same concept as the box but use foamcore to make it instead, assembling the box walls together with tape.
 You could use reflective duct tape on the side of the foamcore or you could use something shiny, like aluminum foil and use double sided tape to attack it to the board.

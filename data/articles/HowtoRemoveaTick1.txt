 If you look closely you'll see its mouth attached to the skin, with the body resting behind it.
 Use tweezers with fine tips, rather than blunt ones, to make sure you are able to grasp the tick tightly.









Don't try this with your fingers. You won't be able to get a good, tight grip on the tick.
Make sure you're gripping the tick's head. Get the tweezers as close to the mouth of the tick as possible.
Do not grasp the tick's body. This will cause it to inject saliva or blood into your skin and increase the chances of transmitting a disease.
 The tick's mouth will release the skin. Do not twist, jerk or wiggle the tweezers as you pull, or the tick's mouth parts will remain attached to the skin. It's not uncommon for the skin to also pull up as the tick detaches, much like it does when you pluck a stray hair.









If the mouth parts remain attached, attempt to remove them with the tweezers. If they're buried in the skin, you can simply let the skin heal, checking it from time to time to make sure it doesn't become infected., You can also use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine. Clean both the bite and your hands thoroughly., Some ticks are so small that they're difficult to remove using this common method. A doctor will be able to remove the tick for you.

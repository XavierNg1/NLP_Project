 Make sure the tape holds well as you will be using it as your anchor as you wind the thread around the spool.
 You do not want to see any part of the wooden spool except for the top and bottom.
 Run your thumb over the glue to make it translucent and allow it to dry.
 Carefully center the spool on top of the cork (wider side up) before adhering it with wood glue. Hold together for a few minutes until dry.

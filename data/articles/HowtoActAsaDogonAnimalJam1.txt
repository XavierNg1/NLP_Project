 If you want to be a dog, you have to actually be one! As in, get the proper animal. If you're a non-member, then be a bunny if you're a puppy, but if you're a grown dog, then be a wolf. If you're a member, however, then be a bunny if you want to be a puppy, or be a fox, wolf, or arctic wolf if you're a grown dog.;
, Get neck accessories, and if you're a girl then maybe even put a headflower in your hair. Pick eyes you like. Also, get the proper color. Put realistic colors, like brown, grey, white, or black, but don't be unrealistic colors, like pink, purple, orange or yellow or green or blue. Same with eye colors, but if you want to be a blind dog get pale blue eyes or white eyes.
 Splotches, spots, swirls, fire, or even lightning bolts are great. Skip this step if you don't want a pattern.
 Go to the pillow room, sleep on a pillow and say, "Please adopt me, is a kind loving dog and is great with children," or if you want to be a guard dog, say, "Is a kind, loving guard dog who is extremely loyal, and will welcome friends and chase away strangers,". Or, you could get a friend to be your owner. If you choose the pillow room method, however, keep on saying the same things and sooner or later a kind owner will come to adopt you.
 Don't do things like pooping on the floor or furniture, and don't eat all the food and if you're a guard dog, don't chase away friends and let in strangers! Act kind to children, and don't be too rough with them, especially if they are young and if you are a breed of dog that has sharp teeth or claws. If you act bad and mischievous then your owner will take you back to the pillow room.

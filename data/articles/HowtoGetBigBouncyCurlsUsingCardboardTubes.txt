 Thrifty sorts know to keep these tubes back somewhere in the house for the myriad uses they have! You'll need about the same amount of toilet paper tubes as you'd normally use curlers. You can also divide your hair into sections to see how many sections you can realistically create, count those sections, and you'll know how many tubes are needed.;
, You're not likely to want toilet paper to unfurl and stick to your hair.
 If it needs a wash, do that first but don't use soaking hair, it should be mostly dry and just a little bit damp.
 Keep the sections fairly large for big curls, and so that each has plenty of hair to wrap about the toilet paper tube.
 Wind the hair around and around until it won't wind any further.
,, This is not a sleep on activity, as you'll crush the tubes, so sit up and read/watch TV, do the housework or walk the dog.


If you wish, you can speed things up by using a hair dryer.
 When you can no longer feel dampness, it's ready. When your hair and the paper tubes have dried, take out the tubes. Carefully unfurl your curls as you unroll the hair and release the tubes.


Place the tubes in the recycling bin, or use them for some other toilet tube use.
 You're now ready to wear your big, bouncy curls to your special event.

 While you usually can eat bugs raw without consequence, there is always the risk of parasites or diseases when eating raw insects. Furthermore, cooking insects and arachnids before eating almost always improves the flavor and texture, making them much easier to get down if you're squeamish. Depending on your equipment and scenario, you can:


Boil them for 1-3 minutes.
Fry them in oil for 2-3 minutes, or until crunchy.
Heat them over an open flame for 3-5 minutes.
Roast them on hot coals for 3-5 minutes.
 The simplest and safest way to serve insects in the wild, boiling for a few minutes will kill any possible parasites and toxins. Simply drop the bugs in boiling water for a few minutes, depending on size, and then remove and eat. Smaller bugs, like ants, only need a minute or less, while larger bugs like tarantulas and grasshoppers could use 2-3 minutes.


Drop in a "test bug" to see how long you should cook the insects if you are unsure.
 If you've got some cooking oil, they'll be even better, but it isn't necessary. Simply cook them for 2-3 minutes until they are crispy and easier to eat.
 Make sure that the leaves are still fresh and green so that they don't catch fire quickly. Simply roll up the insects into a homemade pouch and leave them over the heat for several minutes until crunchy. If possible, turn them after 1-2 minutes to cook evenly. In total, they shouldn't need more than 4-5 minutes to cook.If you don't have any cooking gear, this can be an effective way to cook smaller insects, like ants or termites. Create a small pouch with your leaves and dump the little bugs in, alive or dead. They will cook quickly in the extreme heat of the fire., This is likely the quickest and easiest way to cook up bigger bugs like moths, grasshoppers, and beetles. Simply use a long, thin stick to skewer the bugs, like marshmallows, and toast them over the fire for 3-4 minutes.

 Baking soda shampoo is a dry alternative to regular wet shampoos. You can use it in between washing to absorb the oils in your hair and keep it looking and smelling fresh.Aside from baking soda, gather these supplies:


Cornmeal
Ground oatmeal
Dried lavender

, Mix 1/2 cup baking soda, 1/2 cup cornmeal, 1/4 cup dried oatmeal and 1/8 cup dried lavender. Place the mixture in the bowl of a food processor and grind to a fine powder.

If you'd rather not grind the ingredients, you can skip the dried oatmeal and lavender. The shampoo will work will without these ingredients.






A blender or coffee grinder will work in place of a food processor.
 Pour it into an empty, clean salt or pepper shaker, which you can use to shake the mixture over your head when you want to use it. Store the remainder of the shampoo in an airtight container so that you can use it when it's time to refill the spice shaker.

Use the dry shampoo when your hair is completely dry. Otherwise, it will stick to your hair.






Apply the shampoo to your roots, use a brush to distribute it throughout your hair, let it sit for 10 minutes, then brush it vigorously to remove the excess powder from your hair.

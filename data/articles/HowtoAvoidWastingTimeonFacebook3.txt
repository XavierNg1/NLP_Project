 It is easy to lose track of time when you’re surfing Facebook. Help keep time present for you by setting a timer. You can use a timer on your phone, a kitchen timer, or any number of online timers or apps. Simply decide how long you’d like to spend on Facebook, set the timer, and when it rings, swiftly log out., Many apps exist that allow you to block social media or even internet use altogether. Some of these apps are available for purchase (such as Freedom or Anti-Social), and others can be downloaded for free (Self-control, which is Mac only, and LeechBlock). The basic premise is that these apps block you from visiting sites like Facebook according to a schedule you design., Instead of habitually going on Facebook whenever you sit down at your computer, use Facebook as a treat or incentive. This is a good idea if you find yourself ending up on Facebook when you're supposed to be working.For example, you can decide, "I'll allow myself to go on for 15 minutes after I finish this assignment."
Alternatively: "I'll look at those new pictures after I finish this chore."

, Decide how many times per day you will allow yourself to visit Facebook. Then, set a schedule for yourself, and stick to it. For instance, you may decide to visit Facebook once in the morning, and then once again after dinner. It will require a great deal of self-discipline, but if you make this your habit, eventually it will stick.
 If all else fails and you feel that you need a break, you can always deactivate your Facebook account. It is only temporary; you can make your Facebook page live again whenever you are ready.

 Because suede is so difficult to clean, it's better to prevent ink stains from happening in the first place. Suede-protecting sprays can be found in most drugstores, leather shops, and shoe stores. Even if the sealant cannot protect your suede completely, it may result in a stain that is lighter and easier to remove compared to an unsealed item.


Be sure to do a spot test with the sealant before coating your entire item. Even products specifically made for suede may still cause discoloration due to variations in manufacturing.Re-seal items every few months.
Brush your item with a suede brush before and after spraying., A universal rule of stain control is to soak up extra liquid before it can spread. Blot the ink with a clean cloth. Do not rub with the cloth by moving it from side-to-side. Instead, pat the spot with up-and-down motions. Be careful not to press down too hard. Rubbing and too much force can push the pigment into your suede, making the stain harder to remove., You should begin stain removal immediately after the ink has dried. The longer you leave the stain, the more difficult it will be to remove. Sometimes stains allowed to set for too long may become permanent.


Unlike many other types of stains, it's more prudent to allow ink stains on suede to dry out before cleaning. The sandpaper and eraser methods will not work on wet ink. Additionally, attempting to clean wet ink using only a solvent may cause the ink to run, spreading the stain.

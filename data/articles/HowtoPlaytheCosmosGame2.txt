 Again, it can be helpful to restrict them to a number between one and ten, but it can also be more fun to let them choose any number.
 If they chose six, which has three letters in them, the new number will be three. Tell them, "Six is three."

, If the new number above was three (because "six" has three letters), this becomes the old number, and the new number will become the number of letters in the old number. Since "three" has five letters, the new number is five. Tell them, "Three is five."

, Since five, the new number from above, has four letters, the new number is four. Say, "Five is four." Then, since you've reached four, you can stop.
 The word "four" has four letters in it, so if you didn't stop here, you'd be saying "four is four" forever. Instead, simply say "four is cosmos," and have you friends try to figure out why four is cosmos - it's the only number that works this way.


The whole round for this example would work like this: the other person chooses six, so you say, "Six is three, and three is five, and five is four, and four is cosmos." The starting number doesn't matter; this will work with any number they give you, even numbers above ten.
 Make them figure out why four is cosmos and how the whole trick works. Make them do it for you before you tell them if they're right.

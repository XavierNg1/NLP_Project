 If you are struggling to get a job in your desired field because you don’t have enough work experience, you should volunteer in your field. This will help you get some real-life work experience and you will begin to develop some of the skills that will be important to future employers.For instance, if you would like to be a social worker, you could volunteer at a homeless shelter or become a Big Brother or Big Sister.;
, Unpaid or even paid internships are an excellent way for entry-level job seekers to gain concrete experience working in the field. Search through online job boards and company websites for internship opportunities.


For example, some companies will hire a summer intern to take on general office duties such as filing, data entry, and answering phones. This can give you experience working in an office and will allow you to meet people in your field.
 If you are trying to break into fields like writing, film editing, or interior design, create sample products to show to potential employers. For example, if you want to be a writer, you could start a blog. This will demonstrate that you have experience creating written material on a regular basis.This will also help you build your personal portfolio.
 Even if you can’t land a job in your desired field, take on a part time job. Employers will often put some weight onto any form of work experience, even your first part-time job. This early work experience could be leveraged to demonstrate that you have developed communication, customer service, and problem solving skills.For example, apply to part time jobs in retail, fast food, or even serving and bartending. This experience can be invaluable.

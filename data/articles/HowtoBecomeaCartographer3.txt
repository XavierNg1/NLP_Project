 Some organizations require a portfolio of completed maps from job applicants. Save any work you do for coursework or internships. After graduating, spend your own time to improve old maps using what you've learned since you made them.
 Build your experience by getting hired as a cartographic technician, or a project cartographer hired on a temporary basis. Entry-level cartographer positions are definitely worth applying to, but depending on your education and portfolio you may need this surveyor or freelance work on your resume.
 Federal, state, and provincial governments are often major producers of maps, and hire many cartographers. Look online for your government's job postings board, or visit a local government office. At the local level, cartographers often work closely with city planners, county assessors and public works departments.
 Surveying firms, civil engineering businesses, and environmental consulting firms all use cartographers at their core, but you may not realize how many other companies use cartographers as well. Software companies often use mapping technology, and need cartographers or GIS specialists to help them develop it.Insurance companies have been keeping and analyzing map records for centuries. Publishers sometimes have a cartographer on staff to update their atlases.
 Government organizations and professional cartographer organizations often have certification programs for different specialties of cartographers. Certification often requires significant job experience, but can help you find further jobs or advance to become a cartographic supervisor. Here are a few examples:

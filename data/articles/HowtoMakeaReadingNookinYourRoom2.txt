 The perfect size for an embroidery hoop is about 23 inches (58 cm) and the hoops can be found at any local store that sells crafts. Take the hoop apart and place its hardware pieces in a baggie to keep them from getting lost while you put the canopy together., Be sure that the casing seam at the top of your curtains are facing the hoop on its inside. Slide all six of the curtain panels around the circumference of the hoop., Clamp the two ends of the embroidery hoop together by inserting the hardware pieces you previously placed in the baggie. Slide curtains over the hoop’s closure and make sure that the curtains are distributed evenly around the circumference of the hoop., Cut three pieces of ribbon at about 4” long so that the hoop can hang a good distance away from the ceiling. If you want the canopy to hang down even lower from the ceiling, cut the ribbon pieces a little longer.Spread the curtains and loop the ribbons around the sides of the hoop.
The ribbons should be looped onto the hoop every couple of panels so that the curtains are even on each side and the access points are more plainly seen.Tie the ribbons together at the top into a knot.
 Hooks are available at most home improvement stores. Hang the knotted ribbon and your canopy curtains over the hook in the ceiling. Spread two of the panels to create a door.Add pillows to your finished canopy or stuffed animals to give the reading nook some personality.
These reading nooks can also act as a tent around small arm chairs in children rooms and nurseries and can be the perfect place to read to your child while they’re in your lap.

 For both adding and subtracting fractions, you'll start with the same process. Figure out the lowest common fraction that both denominators can go into.


For example, if you have 1/4 and 1/6, the lowest common denominator is 12. (4x3=12, 6x2=12)

, Remember that when you're doing this, you're not actually changing the number, just the terms in which it's expressed. Think of it like a pizza - 1/2 of a pizza and 2/4 of a pizza are the same amount.



Figure out how many times your current denominator goes into the lowest common denominator. For 1/4, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. For 1/6, 6 multiplied by 2 is 12.

Multiply the fraction's numerator and denominator by that number. For 1/4, you would multiply both 1 and 4 by 3, coming up with 3/12. 1/6 multiplied by 2 becomes 2/12. Now your problem looks like 3/12 + 2/12 or 3/12 - 2/12.
 The reason is because you are trying to say how many of that type of fraction you have, total. If you added the denominators as well, you would be changing what type of fractions they are.


For 3/12 + 2/12, your final answer is 5/12. For 3/12 - 2/12, it's 1/12

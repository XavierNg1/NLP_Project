 Leave it running until it's very hot and you see and feel steam. This method will steam more than your face - you'll get a full-body steam treatment.
 Just like you would for a full-fledged facial steam, it's a good idea to cleanse your face of dirt and makeup before you begin steaming it.
 There's no need to use a towel to direct the steam to your face, since you'll be standing a column of steam trapped in by the sides of your shower. Let your face steam for about five minutes, then turn the heat down to a milder temperature to finish your shower.
 To enhance the results, you can use a drugstore face mask or a scoop of raw honey to cleanse your pores while you're finishing up your shower. Put it on after you finish steaming your face, then rinse it off at the end of your shower.
 When you finish your shower, pat your skin dry and apply toner, then moisturizer to your face. You might want to apply moisturizer to the rest of your body, too, since the hot steam can cause your skin to dry out.

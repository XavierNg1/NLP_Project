 You can buy “sofa savers” for sofas online or at home goods stores like Bed, Bath & Beyond. Put these supports underneath your couch cushions to give them more support and firmness., Measure the space underneath the sofa cushions and cut a piece of plywood to those dimensions. Place it underneath the cushions. You will feel more support underneath the cushions, and the couch should sag less., Flip the couch over and expose the springs underneath the couch. To repair the springs of your sofa, you will need to wear glasses and use a pair of pliers. If you see any springs that are bent out of place (i.e., they look different from the rest of the springs), bend them back with the pliers gently.

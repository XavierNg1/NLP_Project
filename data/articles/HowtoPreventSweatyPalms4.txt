 This disorder is characterized by excessive sweating. It may be time to meet with a doctor if you have a sudden increase in sweatiness, if sweatiness disrupts your daily life, or if you experience night sweats without any apparent reason. Your doctor may ask general questions about lifestyle, or may request a history of your symptoms.Your care provider may first advise non-prescription antiperspirants, or may prescribe a stronger topical medicine such as Drysol.
Only a doctor can diagnose you with a treatable disorder such as hyperhidrosis.
 Iontophoresis is a process that involves applying low-level electrical currents to affected areas, such as palms. It has been shown in many cases to reduce sweating. This treatment is not permanent; it is administered twice a day for several days, after which you will have reduced sweatiness for several weeks. Then the procedure must be repeated again.Your doctor may suggest a device that you can use to treat yourself at home. Iontophoresis may not be right for you if you are pregnant or use a pacemaker.
 Botox, usually known as a treatment for facial wrinkles, can reduce sweating by paralyzing the nerves in your palms. This treatment can also work on other body parts, such as the soles of feet. This procedure may be more expensive than other options and is temporary, keeping sweat away for six to twelve months., Some surgical procedures can alter nerves that stimulate excess sweat production. Others can remove problematic glands in your palm. Surgical corrections become permanent about one month after the procedure, so there is room to reverse the changes.This doesn't mean surgery should be considered lightly; surgery can be expensive and may put you at risk for negative side effects.

 Swipe down from the top of the screen to access the notification panel. In the upper right corner of the panel, you will see the Settings icon (gear icon). Tap it to open the Settings menu.;
, In the Settings menu, you will have a list of customization options for your device. Scroll down the list until you see a fingerprint icon labeled “Finger Scanner.”


The icon will have a blue-colored circular background if you are on the galaxy S5 and an orange one if you use a Note 4.
 Tap on the “Fingerprint Manager” option in the Finger Scanner menu. Inside will be a list of registered fingerprints. Tap on the plus icon in the upper right corner of the screen, and a tutorial screen should show up, illustrating how you should swipe your finger down over the home button.


Swipe your finger 8 times for S5 and 10 times for Note 4, and each successful reading will turn the number in the row of indicators, which will change color with each successful detection.
You must complete 8–10 successful swipes to register the desired fingerprint properly. Once successfully registered, the device will say “Fingerprint Registered” below the row of numbers.
The fingerprint scanner on both the S5 and Note 4 will allow for up to 3 registered fingerprints.
 Now you can unlock your device using the fingerprint scanner. Lock your device by pressing the Power button in the upper right side of your device then press it again to access the lock screen.


Using your recently registered finger, swipe down over the home button like you did earlier. The device should then enter the home screen if the fingerprint was successfully detected.

 Your veterinarian may recommend iron supplements and B vitamins to help treat your cat. Many cats with kidney failure have poor appetites and may be deficient in these vitamins. However, the benefits of supplements are limited, so supplements would be used along with other treatments for anemia., In cases of severe blood loss, a blood transfusion may be necessary. Transfusion in cats is complex because of numerous major and minor cross-reactions.Because of the complexities and the risk of serious problems if an adverse reaction occurs, your veterinarian may suggest referral to a specialist center for a transfusion.
 Anemia is often the result of another health condition that will require treatment before your cat’s anemia will improve. The treatment may include medications, surgery, or other veterinary interventions.


Make sure that you follow your vet’s instructions and contact your vet if your cat’s condition worsens or does not improve.

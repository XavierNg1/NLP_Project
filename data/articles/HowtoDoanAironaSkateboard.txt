 Put your front foot on the front bolts and put your back foot on the back bolts.;
,, It depends on how big the ramp is and how far you want to go and of course, how confident you are with airs.



Roll up the ramp normally and when you get to the top just keep going as if you are still going up the ramp normally.






When you get up into the air a little, lift your legs up towards your chest to get higher up in the air. When you are in the air there is just one easy thing you have to do......FOCUS!!!! Many people look around and don't focus! That is the WRONG thing to do!






Keep your eyes half on your feet and half in front of you.



Hit the ground and bend your knees.






Relax and bend your legs to absorb the impact.






Roll away and brag to your friends about how you can do the biggest and best air!

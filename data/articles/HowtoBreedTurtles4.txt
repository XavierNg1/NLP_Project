 Once your turtles have hatched, remove the empty pieces of shell so that they don't contaminate the container for those turtles who have yet to hatch.
 A turtle may lie in its eggshell for several days after breaking it open. During this time, it's absorbing the last of the egg yolk sack attached to its belly. Place your hatched turtles on a moist paper towel in a new container outside the incubator. Keep them here for several days until they've fully absorbed the yolk sack. Once they have, move them to a vivarium or give them a home in a pan of shallow water.
 Feed young turtles at least once a day. Hatchlings are mostly carnivorous but be sure to offer them some fruits and vegetables. People have successfully raised baby turtles on and almost exclusive diet of the commercially available food Reptomin.


An excess of protein in a baby turtle's diet will cause its shell to deform. If you make this mistake, catch and correct it as soon as possible, and your young turtle will be fine. Unfortunately, once your turtle gets bigger, the deformity will be permanent and cause the turtle a lot of discomfort.
 Even with the very best of care, a significant number of captive-bred hatchlings also will not survive their first year. In nature, many young turtles don't survive, and the same is true for turtles bred in captivity. Enjoy the process, and, if you've done your best, don't blame yourself if eggs don't hatch or babies die.

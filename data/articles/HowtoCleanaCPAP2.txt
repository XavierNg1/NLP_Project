 Disassemble the mask, frame, fabric backstrap, and tubing. Fill a clean sink or wash basin with warm water and a few drops of mild soap. Submerge your equipment in the sink or basin, gently swish them around with your hand, and let them soak for five minutes.When you have a cold or flu, you should wash all of your equipment daily until your symptoms are gone.
 You can use a soft bristle brush to remove or prevent mold and bacterial growth inside the tube. Use a soft baby bottle brush or look online or at your sleep center for a specially designed CPAP tube cleaning brush.Gently rub the tube’s interior with the brush and be careful not to cut through the delicate material between the coils.  

, You can just air dry your mask and headgear on a towel, but you must hang your tubing to dry it. Shake off excess water and manually dry the exterior with a towel. Hang the tube on the shower rod, hook, hanger, or a laundry rack to make sure all the water drips out., Many CPAP machines come with two filters: a non-disposable, grey or black foam filter and white, fine replaceable filter. Remove the grey or black foam filter and hand wash it with warm water and mild soap. Squeeze excess water out of it, blot it with a dry towel, then let it air dry.Don’t wash the white fine filter. Replace it monthly or when it appears discolored. Replace the grey or black filter at least yearly.
 Put your mask, headgear, and tubing back together when they're dry. Fix the headgear frame and backstrap to the mask, reattach the mask to the tube, and connect the tube to the humidifier or CPAP machine. Turn the machine on and listen for any leaks that weren't there before cleaning.Check your user manual for more specific information about reassembling your machine.
Have your equipment provider check your machine if you hear any leaks or if you use it and don't think it's working correctly.

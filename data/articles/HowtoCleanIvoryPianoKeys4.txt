 To keep the piano keys clean, always wash your hands well before playing the piano. If others are playing the piano, get them to wash their hands before they touch the keys.








You can also get in the habit of wiping the keys with a dry clean cloth after you done playing the piano. This can keep dust and dirt off the keys.
 Place the piano a shady spot in your home in room temperature and low humidity. Putting the piano in a sunny spot can end up causing the keys to swell up and lead to yellowing of the keys over time.If the piano is not used often and you want to protect the keys from damage, you can get a long key cover to go over the keys or put down the key cover on the piano. Keep the keys covered until the piano is to be played.
 Air fresheners, furniture polish, and other aerosol products can damage the ivory keys and cause them to yellow over time. Keep these products away from the piano and do not spray the keys with these products.

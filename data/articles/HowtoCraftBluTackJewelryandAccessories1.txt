Mash about half a packet of Blu-Tack between your hands for about three minutes to mold it into a usable and bendable form.



 


Submerge the Blu-Tack lump in a bowl of 3 cups vinegar, 1 cup canola oil and strangely, a few pumps of conditioner. These ingredients will soften the Blu-Tack and give it clay-like qualities, allowing it to harden later. Leave the blu-Tack for about 30 minutes.






Dry the blue tack off and roll it out with a rolling pin into a thick but flat rectangle.

Slice the rectangle into 20 even strips using a plastic knife. (Blu-Tack will stick to and rust any metal utensils.) set aside 8 strips, and then another 2 separately.

 Once you've chosen File, Multi-Rename, a box comes up.
,, Suppose these are some desert images you just took, and/or maybe you want to indicate when you took them. For the moment let's suppose you've taken 25 stereo pairs, and that the left images are in a folder called OL and the right images in a folder called OR.


In the box that says "Stereo" you could replace "Stereo" with Desert2007February or with any meaningful notation you wish.
In the numbering box that shows "0001", you could replace the "0001" with "01", since you really only need two digits for 25 images.
In the box that contains "_B.JPG", leave the "_" and the ".JPG", but replace the "B" with "L" or "OL" when renaming the LEFT files, and with "R" or "OR" when renaming the RIGHT files. Do this for both the left and right image folders, and now it will be much easier to identify your files.

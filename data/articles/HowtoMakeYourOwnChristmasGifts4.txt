 It will be a lasting memory and really useful if your gift recipient(s) live somewhere cold. If you don't know how to knit, there are many websites, books, and magazines that can teach you. Or you could go to your local yarn store. Many offer lessons for free or at a nominal cost. If you already know how to knit or crochet, consider the many other possible gifts you could make such as sweaters, blankets, shawls and socks.
 This is a gift that most fathers enjoy. Write things such as "#1 Dad" on a T-shirt or sweatshirt with squeezable fabric paint. Use his favorite colors and designs or use T-shirt transfers.
 If your recipient owns pets like a dog or cat or even livestock, you might be able to help out with such a gift.

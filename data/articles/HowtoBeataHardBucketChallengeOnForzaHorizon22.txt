 When you go through a speed trap, speed zone, or total speed challenge, the key to beating a hard one is to not brake a lot. The braking will cause you to lose your speed and you can lose the challenge especially in a speed zone challenge where your speed would drop dramatically.


One speed zone challenge that is tough is the one in horizon with the Lotus Exige S and you have to try to make it to 68 MPH through the speed zone. One thing that they did to try to make it hard is by adding a sharp turn at the end just by the speed zone which causes you to lose it. That's why it's bad to brake a lot.
If you're forced to brake, brake lightly. In other words, Tap LT only in tiny bits so you won't completely lose your speed.

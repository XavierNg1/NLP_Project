 Draw two straight lines that share a corner. A perpendicular L shape will result in a rectangle, which is one type of parallelogram. Change the angle between the two lines to get different parallelograms.


For each of the methods below, we'll call the horizontal part of the L the bottom of the parallelogram and the vertical or angled part of the L the left side of the parallelogram.
 We're talking about the drawing tool, not the magnetic navigation compass. The drawing compass has one end with a spike, and one end with a pencil, connected by a hinge.
 The top and bottom sides of a parallelogram are always equal, and the left and right sides of a parallelogram are always equal. We can use this information to finish the parallelogram.
 Set your compass to the exact length of the bottom side, by placing the spike end on the bottom left corner and the pencil end on the bottom right.
 Move the compass without moving the hinge, so the spike rests at the top left corner. With the spike fixed in place, draw an arc along the paper by moving the pencil back and forth. You could draw a straight line from the spike to any point on this arc, and it would be the same length as the bottom side â€“ but don't try that yet.
 Remember, the left and right sides are also the same length, so we can repeat this step again. Set the compass to the length of the left side, then move it so the spike rests at the bottom right corner. Draw another arc with the pencil, overlapping the first arc.
 The point where the two arcs cross is the top right corner of the parallelogram. This is the only place where you can connect a right side that's the correct length starting from the bottom right corner, and you can connect a top side that's the correct length starting from the top left corner.
 Connect the top right corner to the lower right and the top left corners with a straightedge.

 Depression affects millions of people every year, and everyone is touched by depression themselves or through family or friends at some point in their life.


Be open with your friends and relation so that they are aware of what you are experiencing and can work extra hard to help bring you through your prenatal depression unscathed. It is hard for loved ones to help you cope if they do not know what you are feeling.
 Many localities offer support groups where people can share their experiences with depression or other mental health conditions. Verbally working through your emotions and identifying with others who have experienced similar challenges can help widen your network of supportive contacts and show you the light at the end of the tunnel. In some cases, mildly depressed individuals can work through their depression and eliminate depressive symptoms with talk therapy alone.
 Prenatal depression is not unusual. Many websites, chat rooms, and Internet support groups exist to help women through the challenge of depression during and after pregnancy. Consider joining a group or utilizing the online resources provided by these sites to help cope with your prenatal depression.

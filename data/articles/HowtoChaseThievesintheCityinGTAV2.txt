 If this event is occurring, you will see a dot on your radar flashing blue and red (shortly after your radar itself flashes). This dot will show you where the thieves are as they escape on two LCC Hexer motorcycles after stealing someone’s wallet.
 Since they are on motorcycles, they will be easier to shoot. You can also kill them by running over them in your vehicle, as long as you’re not also riding a motorcycle.


It is possible to complete the event by killing the thieves near the wallet’s owner. However, doing so will not result in a monetary reward.
You can use Franklin’s special ability for an advantage, since he can slow down time while he drives.
 Travel away from the wallet’s owner to complete the event and keep the $500. If you’d prefer to return the wallet, travel back to the location where the random event started. The owner of the wallet will give you a $50 reward.For completing this event, your special ability bar will be replenished.

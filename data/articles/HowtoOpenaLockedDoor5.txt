 Although “slim jims” (specialized metal tools for gaining entry to a locked car) are generally illegal, you can approximate the tool with a stiff metal coat hanger. If you've locked your keys in the car and a store or friend with coat hangers is close at hand, this can save you the hassle and waiting of calling a locksmith or roadside assistance service.
 You can leave the hooked top section alone, but unwind it from itself at the “neck” and straighten the rest of the hanger out, giving you a long metal tool with a hooked tip.
 Push the end of the hanger in through the soft rubber weather stripping and the bottom of the window. The hanger is now inside the wall of the door.
 The latch should be no more than a few inches below the window, near where the interior lock is.
 Hook the hanger around the latch and pull it towards the rear of the car. This should unlock any manually locked car door.









If your door has a push-button electric unlocking mechanism, you can also slide the straight end of the hanger down from the top of the window instead, and use it like a finger to poke the button inside.

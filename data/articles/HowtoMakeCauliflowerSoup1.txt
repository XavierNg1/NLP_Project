 Rinse the cauliflower first, then chop off the leaves and thick stem. Cut the cauliflower into florets, then set it aside.;
, Fill a medium-sized saucepan with 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water, then add 2 teaspoons of salt. Give the water a stir, then bring it to a boil over medium to medium-high heat.
 If you have not yet done so, rinse the cauliflower, cut off the stem, then chop it up into florets. Add it to the water, then continue to cook it until it turns soft, about 4 minutes.
 Use a slotted spoon to scoop the cauliflower out of the saucepan. Save the salted water, and keep the rest of the florets in the saucepan. You will be puréeing them in batches., Again, leave the rest of the water and cauliflower in the saucepan. If you'd like, you can keep the saucepan covered to keep the liquid nice and hot., The longer you purée it, the smoother your soup will become. If it is too thick, you can add more cooking water. You may not end up using all of the cooking water.
 How many batches you make will depend on the size of your blender or food processor; most will require only two batches. Pour each batch you complete into the other saucepan.


Use caution when opening the blender. The built up heat and pressure may cause splattering. It would be a good idea to open the lid a crack first.
 You will need about ½ to 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of butter. Once you have added in the salt and butter, give the mixture another quick pulse to combine.


Alternatively, you can season the soup with some bouillon instead of salt. Chicken or vegetable is recommended.
 Stir it until it thickens and the butter melts. If you added in some bouillon, it might be a good idea to use a whisk in stead to help the bouillon mix in better.
 There is enough soup to serve 8 people. You can serve it as is, or garnish it with some olive oil and chopped chives.If you have any leftovers, cover them, and store them in the fridge.

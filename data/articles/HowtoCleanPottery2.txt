 Soak your pottery in white vinegar for at least a day or two. Rub the mineral buildup daily using a butter knife to gently break up buildup. Wash the pottery with soap and warm water once you’ve achieved clean pottery. Soak the pottery in tap water to get rid of the vinegar odor.

 Wet clean rags with 40% hydrogen peroxide. Wrap your pottery with the rags. Place the wrapped pottery in a sealed bag. Re-soak the rags every few days.








The process is complete when the crazing has lightened to your satisfaction.

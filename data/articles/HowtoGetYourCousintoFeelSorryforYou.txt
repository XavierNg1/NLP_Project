 Like for example, start making conversations shorter and shorter each time you talk to them.If they try talking to you for a long time, say, "Oh, I need to go to the restroom. Bye!" or something like that then leave. Or you can let them see you with other family or cousins and whenever they talk to you, make the conversation really short.;
, Like if they say they hate you or you are ugly, just simply ignore them. They are obviously just doing it for attention.
 Or,if they text you, you can trick them by replying saying "Who is this?" and they will be all like "What? They forgot about me?" Or,they will just think you changed your number. (If they do, they will more than likely ask you. If they do ask you, make the conversation short.) If they call, do not call back. If they are talking to you or are trying to talk to you, pretend you didn't hear them. If you want them to be annoyed, just keep saying "What? What? What?" each time they repeat what they are saying.
 Like for example, when they stare at you, don't notice. Or if they call your name, do not notice. Pretend you didn't hear them if they try talking to you. Just as if they weren't there.
 This will show you are better off without them.

 If you're worried about hair loss and looking for medical treatments, the first step is to talk to your physician to assess the possible cause.


Your doctor will likely take your medical history at the office. Baldness is highly hereditary, so if you have a family history of baldness talk to your doctor will want to know.There are several medical tests used to measure hair loss. Your doctor will likely start with non-invasive procedures like making you collect and count stray hairs, fill out a questionnaire, or collect stray hairs in the drain when washing your hair. If she thinks further tests are needed, more invasive procedures like a scalp biopsy may be necessary. You will be put under local anesthesia and a 4 millimeter second of your scalp will be taken for medical testing.As hair loss is related to a number of underlying medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, your doctor may order a blood test., Depending on the results of your medical exam, your doctor may prescribe or recommend a number of different medications.


Minoxidil (Rogaine) is an over-the-counter foam you rub into your hair. Minoxidil is designed to be used by both men and women and may promote hair growth or stop further hair loss. Side effects might include hair growth in unwanted places, scalp irritation, and rapid heart rate.Finasteride (Propecia) is a prescription only used by men. It is designed to increase hair growth or stop further hair loss. In rare cases, it has been known to cause sexual dysfunction and a lowered sex drive., If your hair loss is severe or does not respond to other treatments, your doctor may recommend hair loss surgery.


Usually, only the top of the head is affected by hair loss surgery. Plugs of skin containing hairs are removed from the back or sides of your scalp and implanted into the bald sections.The downside of surgery is that it's expensive, usually not covered by insurance, and can be painful. It also carries the risk of permanent scarring.

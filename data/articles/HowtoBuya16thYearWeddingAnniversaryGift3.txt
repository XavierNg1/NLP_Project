 Work hard not to fall into a romantic rut. The 16th is not really a milestone anniversary, like the 1st or the 10th or even the 15th, so it can be easy to forget.


However, 16 years is a big accomplishment. Don’t coast. Don’t forget it. Treat it like a big deal because it is. Make sure your loved one knows you care.
The 16th often gets overlooked because the 15th anniversary is so important. Many people believe that once you get past 15, you’re truly in a long-term marriage. So celebrate!

, Forget the themes maybe. And forget the generic bunch of wilting roses you pick up at the local grocery store.


Instead, go for a gift with meaning. What matters to your significant other emotionally? Is it a moment from your past? Recreate it. Take your loved one to a place where you had an early date or first met.
Give your loved one something that’s not tangible but more from the heart. Write a poem. Write a letter. Take him or her on a surprise trip. Treat him or her to a trip to the spa. Show your significant other that, after 16 years, you truly know what he or she wants (and needs).
 The gift can be quite simple or an elaborate planned event.


Fill a jar with chocolates or other candies and attach a card that reads, "Sweet 16." Bake 16 muffins or cookies to give to the anniversary couple or significant other.
Create a scavenger hunt in which the couple visits 16 places that are significant in their relationship. Send the couple on a 16-night trip, or make reservations for the couple for a weekend in Tennessee, the 16th state in the United States.

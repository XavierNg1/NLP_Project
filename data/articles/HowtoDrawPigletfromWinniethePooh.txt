, However, note that the whole face is slightly tilted.
, It should be just wide as from eye to eye.
, Make this curves quite thick, and quite far above the rest of the face (so the eyes are nearly mid-way between the smile and the brows).
 However, it may be easier for you to judge the curve of the head first then re-draw the eyebrows. The head curves a similar amount to the mouth but the other way round.
 Extend it down as far as the bottom of the smile, note how it flicks out at each end.
 The smile should be roughly in the middle of the face now.
 Use the eyebrows to guide where the ear should go. It is hard to describe the shape of the ear, except it is similar to the shape of a "liver". Use the image as a guide. Note that the ear points up towards the sky.
 It is the same shape as the left ear rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise.
 The neck is the same width as the distance between his eyes (pink line) and the widest of his right hip is directly vertical to his right cheek. His body is teardrop shaped but slightly curving so his left hip is less protruding.
 His leg becomes slightly wider at the bottom.
 His heel joins seamlessly to his leg but the top of his foot slightly extends past where it joins the line of his leg.
 A similar shape to his right leg but more vertical (although the lines you need to draw are still slightly curved).
, Start at his neck (on the left side of your page) and draw an "r" shape until it joins his hip.
 His hand should be just under his mouth and the bottom of this shape should be a little higher than the bottom of the "r" in the previous step.
,, Each stripe curves to make his body appear rounded. Also note that the stripes become gradually wider, until the last one which becomes slightly thinner again. About 8-10 stripes is the right amount.
 You need 3 shades of pink. The lightest for his face, arms and legs. The middle shade for his ears and the darkest for his body.

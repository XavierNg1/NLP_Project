 Scarlet fever is most likely to affect children between the ages of 5 and 15. When someone within that age range develops symptoms of scarlet fever, you should be particularly cautious and take him or her to the doctor as soon as possible.
 If your child already suffers from an infection or any other disease that will weaken his or her immune system, he or she will be prone to bacterial infections like scarlet fever.
 The bacteria that causes scarlet fever lives in the nose and throat and is communicated by contact with liquids spread through coughing and sneezing. If you or your child touch something that someone has coughed or sneezed on, you are susceptible to contracting the disease that causes scarlet fever. This will is most likely to occur in crowded areas.Because young children are most susceptible to the disease, schools are a particularly common place to contract the disease.
 Your child should wash his or her hands frequently and refrain from sharing utensils, linens, towels, or other personal items with people. Individuals can be contagious even after they have ceased to be symptomatic.


Anyone diagnosed with scarlet fever should stay home for at least 24 hours after beginning treatment with antibiotics.

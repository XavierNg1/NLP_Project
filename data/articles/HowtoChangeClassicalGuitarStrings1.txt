 There are a few ways to do this. Some people argue that the neck still needs tension and to only change one string at a time, while others say removing all of the strings is good to clean the neck––take your pick.


Cut them. Grab a pair of scissors and snip all six strings (or just one). By cutting off the strings, you will still have to remove the small scrap parts such as the parts around the bridge.






Unwind them until they fall off. Although this way is longer, it's much safer as you won't have pieces of guitar string flying everywhere and all over your room. It's best to use a string winder as this makes the process much faster. If you don't have one, just loosen the string (like you would to tune it down) until you can slide it out of the guitar.
 If you've picked up a set of acoustic guitar strings, that usually means steel strings. You want classical. Never string a classical guitar with steel strings. This will put way too much pressure on the neck, eventually causing it to bend and crack, not to mention they sound awful on a classical. Only use classical strings on your classical guitar. You can pick up some cheap ones at a local music shop or off the internet.

 The power of positive thinking is not just a myth. In fact, positive thoughts are key to dieting properly. Thinking positive thoughts can increase your motivation and energy levels. Negative thoughts, on the other hand, can lead to behaviors such as emotional eating and skipping a workout. Avoid negativity. Try to not get angry at yourself if you slip up and reach for pizza instead of a healthier option. Instead, get back on track the next day.
 Some days it can be hard to feel comfortable in your own skin. It doesn't help when you're surrounded by images in the media of exceedingly thin celebrities; however, a positive body image is very important to your overall health and wellness. It will increase your confidence and make you more likely to make healthy choices. Focus on the good things. If you really like your arms, tell yourself that when you look in the mirror. Make it a habit to compliment yourself at least once a day.
Tape a positive affirmation or quote to the mirror. Seeing encouragement each day will help you gain a more positive body image over time.
 Stop beating yourself up. Research shows that if you are kinder to yourself you will be more successful in your fitness goals. When you have a negative thought, try to acknowledge it and then let it go. There's really no point in berating yourself for skipping the gym. It's much more effective to forgive yourself and move on.

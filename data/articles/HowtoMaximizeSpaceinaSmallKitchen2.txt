 Food that comes in bags or boxes often doesn’t fill its packaging. Accordingly, you’re using valuable storage space on this extra space. Especially once you open something, like a box of cereal or crackers, remove the cardboard and recycle it. Roll the bag up tightly and fasten with a rubber band.Consider purchasing jars or tubs with tight, resealable lids to store foods once they are open. Clear jars with airtight seals are best, as they’ll keep your food fresh and allow you to quickly find whatever you’re looking for.
 Get metal or plastic risers - think miniature tables, just for holding dishes or food - that fit within your cabinets. These will effectively serve as another shelf in your cabinet. While they will shorten the distance between surfaces, the extra surface area is ideal for storing and organizing shorter items, like mugs or canned goods., You may find you have plenty of additional space on the back of cabinet, cupboard, and pantry doors. There are all sorts of hanging organizers that will hang from the top of the door and fit within the storage area when closed.If you want to avoid seeing hooks hanging over the doors, simply attached organizers or small shelves directly to the inside of whichever doors have a bit of clearance hidden behind them.
 Dishes that fit into one another will help your kitchen stay organized, and will save plenty of space in the dishware cabinet. Plus, there’s nothing that looks as satisfactorily well-organized as a stack of perfectly nested mixing bowls.Modernity has brought with it some incredible inventions, one of which is the bowl-plate. These are exactly what the sound like - about the size of a dinner plate, but with a deeper well and edges similar to a bowl. Having a few of these nearly makes classic bowls and plates obsolete.

 Objects that are closer to us appear larger when compared to objects that are off in the distance. Knowing this, we can compare the sizes of two objects to see how far apart they are. Keep in mind that, since we are not using exact size measurements and angles, these distances are only estimations., Keep your arm at a forty-five degree angle and point it directly at the cloud. If the cloud is roughly the same size as your fist (or larger), it is most likely a low level cloud. A low level cumulus cloud is called a stratocumulus and exist from 0 kilometers (0.0 mi) to 2 kilometers above the ground., Your arm should remain pointed straight at the cloud at a forty-five degree angle. If the cloud is significantly smaller than your fist, it is probably above the lower level. Altocumulus clouds are mid-level cumulus clouds, ranging from 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) to 7 kilometers above the ground. From your vantage point on the ground, they can be identified as being roughly the same size as your thumbnail., Again, your arm should be extended toward the cloud at a forty-five degree angle. If the cloud in question is in the high altitude level, it will appear to be roughly the same size as your smallest fingernail. These clouds are known as cirrocumulus clouds and reside between 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) and 13 kilometers (8.1 mi) above the ground.

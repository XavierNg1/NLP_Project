 Accept that sometimes things won’t go according to plan, no matter how much you prepare. When something goes wrong, take a deep breath, do your best to deal with the situation, and continue with your day. Try to find something positive in unexpected occurrences., Become more open to the goodness of other people, the world, and yourself. Build up your confidence in your own ability to adapt to the unknown. Realize that most situations will work out in the end, even if they don’t go the way you expect them to.Strive to start giving people the benefit of the doubt. Open your heart and mind by giving them the chance to please you rather than automatically expecting people to let you down.
 Enjoy seeing where each day takes you. Cultivate a sense of fun, and allow yourself to deviate from your routine sometimes. Try different things, say yes to new opportunities, and challenge yourself when you get the chance.You can make room in your life for spontaneity by planning not to plan sometimes. Take a walk with no destination in mind, or keep one afternoon a week free of commitments so you can do whatever you feel like.
 If it’s not critically important that you handle a task yourself, ask someone else to do it. Delegating can feel scary if you’re used to being in control, but once you realize that other people are capable of getting things done too, you’ll feel less pressured to take care of everything yourself.For example, you could ask your kids to take over some of the household chores, or delegate part of a big project to a co-worker.
When you give someone else a job, don’t try to micromanage the way they do it. Give them a chance to do it their own way, even if their method is different from yours.

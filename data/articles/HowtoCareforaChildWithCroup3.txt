 The most prominent symptom of croup is the high pitched, barking like sound children make when coughing. The cough often starts suddenly at night and is usually worse at night. Croup causes vocal chords to swell, which narrows the airway in a child’s throat and creates a high pitched sound when air passes through them.Croup also causes a hoarse voice for some children.


While croup is possible in adults, it is less likely as adult airways are larger and don’t often create a whistling sound.
Inhaling deeply can also cause the throat to whistle in children with croup. It may sound like wheezing, and is called stridor.
 Because croup often displays symptoms similar to that of the common cold, it can be easy to mistake them for one another. Croup often causes severe sinus congestion which can make breathing through the nose very difficult.Sinus congestion can also lead to post-nasal drip, which may cause nausea.
Sneezing, runny nose, and a sore throat are all also tied to congestion caused by croup.
 Croup will often cause the body’s temperature to increase slightly. Fever may not be among the first symptoms to present themselves and may take a few days to appear. If a child presents a fever, make sure to check it periodically to make sure it doesn’t get too high.If your child’s fever reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit, seek immediate medical treatment.
Remember that your child must hydrate often to help their body regulate temperature.

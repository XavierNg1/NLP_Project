 Calluses and rough patches of skin are common on feet. There are several ways to address this problem.









An electronic callus remover is a handheld motorized device that is used to remove smooth out rough skin and remove calluses from the skin. It requires less effort than other means. However, callus removers can be somewhat price, costing between $20 and $30.If you do not want to spend extra money, a foot file or pumice stone might be a good option. You can use a metal or diamond file to rub out calluses and rough skin. You can use a pumice stone in a similar manner, but some find it to be less effective than other means., In the event of blisters, your best option is allow them to heal on their own. Trying to cure blisters via removal can cause scarring and, in rare cases, infection.


Keep the blister clean and protected throughout the day. Gently wash the blister in the morning with a mild, antibacterial soap. Then apply a band-aid to the blistered area.Blisters need to breathe to heel, so when possible take your shoes and socks off and remove any bandages. You may have to wait until you're home from work or school to do so., Toe nails sometimes get stained with dirt and debris. It's fairly easy to remove a toenail stain using household items.


Toothpaste, whitening strips, and hydrogen peroxide are all effective means of un-staining toenails. Hydrogen peroxide is the best option. Stain a q-tip or cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and gently dab on the stained area. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before washing the peroxide off.If you do not have hydrogen peroxide, you can try the same process using whitening strips or toothpaste. Keep in mind this may be less effective.

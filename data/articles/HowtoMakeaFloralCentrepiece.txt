 There are no right or wrongs in the flowers you choose to use. Be sure that the stems are clean, pliable, fresh, and smooth. You may want to just go out and buy or pick the flowers directly before beginning to construct the centerpiece.
 From the end of the stem to the tip of the flower, measure it at 70 centimeters (27.6Â in). Snip the extra stem off at an angle. This is to ensure the flower gets the maximum water absorption. You may also wish to mix some plant food (available at stores where you buy flowers) in with the water, when you do put the flowers in it. You don't have to cut the stems all equally. Take your time to decide how you want them to look. Then decide from that what length(s) you would like to cut your stems., Gently bend the flowers into the fish bowl with the stem at the bottom. Curve the stem around the fish bowl while being very careful not to break the stem. Ensure that there are no big gaps. Continue until all ten blooms are in and arrange them in a sweeping fashion. The effect will be a beautiful centerpiece: vine-like curves with flowers interwoven. You do not have to use a fish bowl to make the centerpiece. A simple vase will do. Just put the flowers into the vase, and start arranging them in different ways until you get the look that you want.

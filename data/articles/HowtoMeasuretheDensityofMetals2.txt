 Choose liquids of various high and low densities. Your estimate will be more accurate if you have a number of liquids of various densities.

 Place your object in the different liquids to see if it sinks or floats. 


, An object immersed in a fluid of similar density will float within the fluid. If it is less dense, it will float, but if it is more dense, it will sink.

 Drop your object in a fluid of known density. 

 If it sinks, try putting it in a different fluid that is more dense. If it floats, put it in a fluid that is less dense. 


, Archimedesâ€™ principle states that an object submerged in a fluid will produce a buoyant force equal to the weight of fluid displaced. When your object floats within the fluid, you have found the approximate density of the object.

 By pressing "M" on your keyboard, you can see the most recent notes that your character has written (if any) that could give you a hint of what to do next.;
, By pressing "N", you can see all of the notes you have collected so far. While many of these are storyline-based, and just help to provide background information, some are written to help you get through a puzzle, especially the ones with the recipes for potions!

, When in doubt, scour the immediate area for any items that you can pick up, any levers to pull, anything! If nothing else, you might find some Tinderboxes or Oil.
 If you're stuck, odds are that someone, somewhere has also been stuck, and there's probably a topic that can help.

, As with the digital multimeter, it may be marked “OHM” or with an omega (Ω).
 Red lead to positive (longer) terminal, black lead to negative (shorter) terminal.
 Analog multimeters use a needle to display their results. How the needle behaves determines whether or not the capacitor is good.


If the needle initially shows a low resistance value then gradually moves to the right, the capacitor is good.
If the needle shows a low resistance value and doesn’t move, the capacitor has been shorted out. You’ll need to replace it.
If the needle shows no resistance value and doesn’t move or a high value and doesn’t move, the capacitor is an open capacitor (dead).

These techniques have been shown to improve pain over time, and they may even boost your immune system.Try some techniques on your own. For instance, you can try simple deep breathing. When the pain is bad, try closing your eyes. Focus only on your breathing. Breathe in for four counts through your nose. Hold it for four counts, then blow it out for four counts. Keep breathing to calm yourself, and try to work through the pain.
You can also try to find a meditation center or class in your city. You can take a class or join a group so that you can learn new meditation techniques.
 Some people with multiple myeloma have some luck easing the pain with massages.

 This is typically located between the F12 and Screen Lock buttons. You may have to use the Function or Fn key if you are using a laptop. Most major ones, such as Ubuntu or any other GNOME distribution, support the Print Screen function. This will copy your screenshot to the clipboard to be pasted in a document or image editing program.
 Open your terminal and enter the following command: sleep 3s; import –window root screenshot.png. This will create a screenshot file of your desktop after a 3 second delay, so that you can close any windows you don’t want appearing.


You can change the parameters to suit your needs. If you want a longer timer, change the number after sleep. If you want to change the name of the screenshot, enter a different file name. You can also change the extension, and make it a .jpg.
The screenshot file will appear in the folder you are currently working in.
 Almost every distribution has a program available that can take and manipulate screenshots. Check your distributions forums for more information specific to your distribution.

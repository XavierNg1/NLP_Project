 To stay visible to drivers at night, you must not simply wear bright clothes, but reflective ones. Reflective strips on clothing move up and down as the cyclists move, which makes them visible to drivers. Look online or in a sports store for reflective jackets, pants, and shoes to make your nighttime cycling safer., Wearing a headlamp on your helmet will allow you to have a light that follows your vision as you move your head. Headlamps should attach securely to your helmet and tilt easily to accommodate the spaces you want to shed light on. Look online and in sports stores for different models.Note that a good quality headlamp can cost around $100.
An ideal choice for urban riding is a USB-rechargeable headlamp with a 500 Lumen output. For darker, rural settings, a light with a higher Lumen output is a better bet (e.g. 750 Lumen).
 Specific arm movements are used by cyclists to signal left-hand turns, right-hand turns, and stops to drivers near them. At night, make sure to signal broadly and clearly. These signals should start about a third of a block before your turn or stop, giving motorists ample time to slow down. To ensure visibility, make sure you have reflectors on your arms, wrists, or hands (e.g. reflective gloves.)For instance, it is imperative to signal a right hand turn so that the car behind you gives you enough time to complete the turn before continuing straight ahead.
If you are changing lanes, you must indicate your direction clearly to the vehicles behind you at least a third of a block before you make that switch.
 Cyclists and pedestrians alike tend to assume that they are more visible than they are to drivers, which can lead them to be less vigilant about their safety at night. Be conservative about your positioning and movements at night. For example, be especially cautious when crossing an intersection. In your dress and movement, do everything you can to be as conspicuous to drivers around you as you can be.

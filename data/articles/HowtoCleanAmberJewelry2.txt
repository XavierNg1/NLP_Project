 You can find one in the beading department of an arts and crafts store, or in a jewelry supply shop. You can also purchase one online. Choose a polishing cloth that has both light and dark panels. The light panel will be used to remove any surface dirt or tarnish, and the dark panel will be used to polish the amber.
 If your jewelry also contains silver, you may see dark smudges appear on the cloth. This is tarnish, and means that your jewelry is becoming clean. Keep rubbing your amber jewelry until you can no longer see any tarnish, or until it looks clean.
 Rub the cloth over the amber, using quick, circular movements. Do this until the amber looks clean and shiny, and its glow is restored.

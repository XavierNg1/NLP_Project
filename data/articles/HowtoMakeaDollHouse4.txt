 Find a wooden bookshelf with deep shelves. A shorter shelf, roughly 3 1/2' or 4' bookshelf is preferable. A larger shelf will need to be secured against a wall to be safe to play with.
 Adjust the shelves at the correct height to create "rooms" which are about 20" tall. If you got a double-wide bookshelf at the suggested height, this should give your dollhouse 4 rooms.


If the shelves cannot be adjusted to the desired height, you can add extra peg holes for the correct height or brace the shelf at the desired height with L brackets.
 Use a jigsaw to cut windows from the back or sides of the bookshelf if you really want a window. Sand down any cut edges to avoid injuries for your child.
 You can fashion a roof to go on top of the bookshelf by using the Pythagorean theorem and cutting two wooden boards joined with a 45 degree mitered edge at the center so that they form a peak.
 Use extra floor tiles, carpeting squares, or any other material you want to make the floors of the rooms look how you want them to look.
 Add wallpaper, paint, or tile to make the walls of each room match the floors and complete the look for that room. Get your child to help!

, Once everything is dry and ready to go, you can add in your furniture and enjoy your new dollhouse!

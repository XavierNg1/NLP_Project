 If you have a large, hard, thick protrusion, made entirely of skin, it is likely that you have a corn or a callous. If it bleeds or oozes it is not a corn. Instead it might be a wart.


A corn will have a center of skin that is of a slightly different thickness than the rest of the mass, whereas a callous will be consistent throughout. It can be hard to distinguish the two, but it is not necessary. You will treat both the same way.;
, This is the simplest way to get rid of a corn. The skin will become soft after soaking, and you will be able to easily remove the dead skin. Just soak your problem area in warm water for ten or twenty minutes. Use a pumice stone to gently sand the corn away. Repeat the treatment as many times as necessary., Like soaking the foot, moisturizing cream will soften the corn, making it easier to remove with a pumice stone. Apply ample cream and allow it to sink in and loosen up the skin. Repeat this process until the corn has been removed.


One strategy is to apply ample cream and cover overnight with a plastic bag or sock. This will trap in the moisture. In the morning use the pumice stone to remove the dead skin.
Alternatively you can shower, apply moisturizer, and then rub off the dead skin.Moisturizers with the active ingredient “urea” can be particularly effective for treating corns and callouses.
 As mentioned in previous steps, you will want to rub the corn with an abrasive surface to help remove the dead skin. Do not, however, take a sharp object and try to cut the corn. This can be extremely dangerous.

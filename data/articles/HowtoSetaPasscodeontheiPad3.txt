 Once you enable your passcode, this is the screen on which you'll enter it.
 This is the grey gear app on your home screen.



If your iPad supports Touch ID, this option will be called "Touch ID & Passcode".
 This will take you to the passcode entry screen.
 This gives you three different passcode choices in addition to the standard 6-digit passcode.


The "Custom Alphanumeric Code" option allows numbers, letters, and symbols, with no character limit.
The "Custom Numeric Code" option allows numbers with no character limit.
The "4-Digit Numeric Code" option allows a traditional 4-digit passcode.
 You'll need to enter it again exactly the same way on the next screen to verify.
 If both your new passcodes match each other, you'll be taken back to the "Passcode Lock" screen.
 You still need to confirm that your passcode is active.
 Your iPad is now passcode-protected!


You can change or remove your passcode at any time in the "Passcode" menu.

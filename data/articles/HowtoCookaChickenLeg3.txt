, You should use about 2-3 tbsp. of olive oil to do this.
 Rinse the chicken legs in water and pat them dry with paper towels. Then, Rub some olive oil over the chicken pieces. Rub the olive oil over the chicken pieces to prevent them from burning and to give them an even richer flavor. After that, sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and freshly ground pepper.
 Leave a little bit of room between the pieces so they aren't crowded in the pan.
 Place the pan in the oven and begin to cook the chicken.
 You should cook the legs for about 14-15 minutes for each pound of chicken. Cook them until the juices run clear instead of pink when they're poked with a sharp knife. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165ยบF (74ยบ C). If the pieces aren't browning as much as you like, you can broil them for the last five minutes.
 Remove the chicken from the roasting pan and place it on an aluminum plate, tenting it with foil. Let it rest for at least 5-10 minutes before you serve it.
 Enjoy this delicious baked chicken on its own while it's hot.

 Each circuit breaker should have its amperage marked on the handle. This is the maximum amperage that circuit can take before the circuit breaker trips.


In the United States, standard household circuits are rated for 15 amps, or 20 amps for newer homes and high-load circuits.;
, For everyday use, it's a good idea to expose the breaker to a maximum of 80% of the rated amperage. It's fine to exceed this for short periods of time, but continuous current above this amount could trip the breaker.


Your electrical panel might have a note about the breakers operating at 100% of the rated value. If it does, you may skip this step.
 Some high-voltage devices may be wired to a double-pole circuit breaker â€” two standard circuit breakers sharing a handle. Do not add together the amperage of the two breakers. This circuit will still be tripped by the amperage displayed on one circuit breaker handle.
 Now you know how much amperage your circuit breaker can handle. To find out whether your circuit exceeds this amperage, continue on to the next method.

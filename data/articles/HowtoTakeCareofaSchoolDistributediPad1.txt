 You can purchase your own if you wish. The school will provide cases, but they may not be the sturdiest.;
, Before school starts, your school should offer how-to classes for the working of your iPad. You should go to or have gone to these classes to get a better understanding. If you didn't go, you can visit your school's help desk if you have questions.


After you have had your iPad for a while, begin to learn. You will need to know important things about how the iPad works in order to succeed with it.
 Most classes will require you to download apps specifically for their class. If there is an app that you already know you need, download it. You will be one step ahead of the pack. Also, you should refrain from downloading games at school. You can do that on your own time. Remember why you got the iPad, for making schoolwork easier to do.

 You can buy any face-scrub or you can create one on your own. Mix one t/b.p of Greek coffee, 2 t/b.s, of natural yogurt, one tea-spoon of natural honey, one tea-spoon of sugar and just a little amount of lemon. Don't forget to moisturize your lips by creating a scrub of honey and sugar.;
, This step will help you to avoid any cake-face that may provide your make up and also will protect your skin.
 Find any make up that suits best your personal needs (oily skin, dry skin, etc) and also find a make up that is similar to your natural color. Apply the foundation with a wet sponge and don't forget your ears and your neck.
 I suggest a colour that is one tone lighter than your natural colour.Apply it under your eyes and don't forget to buy a product that can hide your under eyes circles.
 It can really change your face! Take a dark brown eye shadow or any bronzer and apply it with a brush.Starting from the cheekbones create a line that starts from your ears and follow the natural line of your cheekbones.Do the same in your nose. Make sure that you have blended the product really well.You can also put on our neck and this will give the illusion that you've lost a thousand pounds!!

, Put some product on your wet sponge and apply it under the line that you create with the contouring before (nose, cheekbones). Blend really well. don't forget your T-zone!

, Take any blush you like(pink shades suit best on light skin and peachy shades look fabulous in darker tones)and apply it on your cheeks.
 Make your eyes really pop by never making a cat eye and finish the look with a generous coat of mascara.

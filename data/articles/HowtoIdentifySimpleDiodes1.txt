 Standard Signal - This is the regular forward-biased diode.







2. Zener - Operated in reverse-biased to hold a constant voltage







3. Small Signal - Used for applications with a much smaller current but with much more accuracy





;
, Light Emitting Diode - Emits a colored light based on the materials used internally







2. Photodiode - Captures photons to generate current







3. Infra-Red - Emits light at the infra-red spectrum







4. Varactor - A reverse-biased diode used as a capacitor







5. Schottky - Used for precision and when voltage needs to be conserved







, These will be chips in the form of a SMD (surface mounted device). To identify these you will need to look at the number.

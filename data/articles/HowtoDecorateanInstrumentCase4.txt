 Considering how much wear and tear instrument cases can suffer, small, cheap stickers may not be the best idea. Bumper stickers can be a good choice, especially for larger cases.
 To make use of space, try to get them as close together as possible, without overlapping. You may also want to go for the "tacky tourist suitcase" look and stick them in all different directions at random. If your case is in bad shape, with holes in the leather or numerous scratches, you can try using stickers to cover up the blemishes.

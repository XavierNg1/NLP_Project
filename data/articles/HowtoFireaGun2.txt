 You are about to use an extremely dangerous tool. Unlike weapons with stocks like the rifle and the shotgun, you control your handgun with only your hands and your wrists. This can make it very easy to accidentally break rule 2 (where your gun is pointing).;
, Depending on whether your handgun is a pistol or a revolver, this procedure will vary.


For a magazine-fed pistol like a 1911 or a Glock, you must insert bullets into the magazine, insert the magazine into the gun and then "rack" or pull and release the slide in order to cycle a bullet into the chamber and make the gun ready to fire. Keep your finger off the trigger while doing this!
For a revolver, insert your bullets either individually or using a clip if provided, and close the cylinder. Try not to slam the cylinder shut - this can cause damage to your revolver.
 Although different styles of handgun technique exist, most modern practical and competition training utilizes a modified isosceles shooting stance with a two-handed grip keeping the webbing of your thumb and forefinger high up on the back of the gun, but not so high that it begins to interfere with the slide or hammer of the revolver. In combination with locking the bones in your wrist, this technique makes it easy to absorb recoil and shoot the weapon rapidly and accurately.
 Not all handguns have manual safeties. Smith & Wesson M&P pistols and Glocks are common examples of guns lacking an external safety aside from the trigger. Other types of pistols such as the 1911 may not allow the slide to be racked if the safety is engaged.
 The sighting system on handguns requires that you focus on the front sight to ensure that you are aiming correctly. As long as the front sight is properly aligned with the notch in the rear sight, the bullet will go where you put the front sight.
 Focus on pulling smoothly and evenly to ensure that the weapon will stay on target during the trigger pull. It is very easy, particularly for new shooters, to flinch or otherwise disrupt the alignment of a gun while squeezing the trigger.
 As with all other stages of firing except actual firing, ensure that your finger is straight and off the trigger and the gun is pointed in a safe direction while you reload.


For a revolver, this will mean releasing the cylinder and removing the expended shells either by means of a clip or a pushrod built into the cylinder.
Most pistols will "lock back" their slides when the magazine is empty. This state is referred to as "slide lock". A pistol at slide lock must be readied to fire by inserting the magazine and releasing the slide, either by means of pulling back slightly upon the slide and then allowing it to go forward, or by means of the pistol's slide release lever.
Some handguns, particularly older models, may go into battery (the slide will come forward and the weapon will be ready to fire) when a magazine is inserted while the handgun is at slide lock. If your finger is on the trigger this will produce an accidental discharge! Remember rule 3 - finger off the trigger unless you are shooting.

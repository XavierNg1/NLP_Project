 It should be as close to the bottom of the barrel as possible, with the stand leaving you enough room to fill a bucket under it. Use an electric drill. A 3/4th inch hole should be right to fit most hose-compatible spigots. But pick your spigot before you decide what size hole to make!

, Teflon tape is a good choice to make sure your spigot is watertight.
 Screw your spigot into your hole and secure it to the barrel with a properly sized washer. Then seal over the edges around the spigot with waterproof sealant or more teflon tape.

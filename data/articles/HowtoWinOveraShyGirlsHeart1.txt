 If you have not formally introduced yourself to her yet, now is the time. Introducing yourself to a shy person can be difficult. She is not likely to maintain a conversation without prompting. Use an icebreaker to get a conversation started.Bring up any mutual friends that you know you have. Say something like, “Hi, my name is Mike. I believe that we both know Joe Smith. I used to work with him.”
Compliment her.;
, Talk to her about your job, your childhood, and your interests. Keep it light and try to make her laugh. This helps keep the mood upbeat and take the pressure off of her to talk the whole time.
 Ask her questions about her life. By asking her questions you are taking the pressure off of her to come up with something to talk about. You should understand that it will take some time for her to warm up to you. When she does talk be sure to listen and not dominate the conversation.Avoid small talk. Shy people tend to hate small talk.

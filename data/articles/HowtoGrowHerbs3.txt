 Use a garden rake to loosen the dirt and rake in the soil mixture you purchased for the herbs to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2Â cm). Sprinkle water over the soil to moisten it. Dig holes several inches apart in preparation for planting the herbs.


If you're planting the herbs in pots, determine how many will fit in each one. Many herbs get quite large as they grow, so you may not want to plant more than 2 - 3 seedlings in each container.
You can add a bit of fertilizer to the soil, but again, don't over-fertilize or the herbs won't thrive.
 The herbs are ready to plant when they are well-established and have sprouted several mature leaves. Plant them when outdoor temperatures are above 50 degrees, and the chance of frost is gone. Carefully lift the seedlings from the pots, loosen their roots, and plant them in the ground. Pat soil around the base of the stems, then dampen the area with water.


If you're planting the herbs outside, it's a good idea to transition them to outdoor temperatures by allowing them to "harden off" in a garage or other covered outdoor space for a few days before you plant them in the ground.
 How that the herbs are established, you have only to care for them by making sure they consistently get enough sunlight and water. Pay attention to the moisture level of the soil, and never let it get dried out. Your herbs will grow healthy and strong, and soon it will be time to harvest them.

 Google accounts are only kept for a short amount of time after being marked for deletion. If you’re acting quickly, you may be able to recover your account, but you only have two days to do so.These two days are not guaranteed. The faster you move the better.
 On the sign-in page, select the "I'm having other problems signing in'" option. Enter your deleted email address, and click "Continue".
 You will be directed to a page that asks for the most recent password you remember. Enter it, then click "Continue"., When you enter your password, you will be directed to a page that informs you that your account was deleted. You will see a link to a recovery request form. Click it.


If you do not receive a link to the recovery request, then your account has already been permanently deleted. There is no more that you can do., Once you’ve clicked on the recovery request form, you’ll have a series of verification steps to complete. Enter an email address that you have access to, and answer the questions about your password, your last account access, and when you created your account. Google will use this information to verify that you are the actual owner.


If you don't have any of this information, you may still be okay. Submit your claim anyway and explain your circumstances, then wait for your response.
 Google will send an email to the address you provided. This email may take a little while to appear. Check that email and click the enclosed link to create a new password for your account. You have successfully resurrected your deleted account.


Remember, deleting your account deleted all your data, too. It will take time to download it all back.
Note that you may get an email that says your "account was deleted and is no longer recoverable." If you get that message, your Gmail account is gone forever.
If your account has been deleted, you can create a new Google account, but it cannot use the same name as your old account.

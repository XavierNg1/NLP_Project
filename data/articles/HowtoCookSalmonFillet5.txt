 The pan should get hot, but it should not begin to smoke.


If desired, you can spray a thin coating of cooking spray on the pan or coat it in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil before heating it. This step is not necessary if you marinated the salmon fillets or brushed them with olive oil, though.
 Cook for 3 minutes before flipping each fillet over and cooking for an additional 3 to 4 minutes.


Use a fish spatula to turn the fish. Do not use tongs, since the salmon will likely break apart prematurely if handled with tongs during the cooking process.
The salmon is done when you can flake the center apart with a fork and when the entire fillet is no longer translucent.
 After removing them from the heat, you should let the fillets rest at room temperature for 5 minutes before you serve them.

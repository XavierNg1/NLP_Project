 When raiding an enemy base, nighttime is the right time. Daytime is the worst time because your enemy could easily spot you. If you want to, dusk and dawn are the next best times, but the full moon provides just enough light to guide you while not revealing you to your enemies. This is the most bold method for the fearless ones.;
, See who's there and how to use the terrain to your advantage. For example guards can be taken out by sneaking around the back of a ravine and shooting them with a bow and sentries can be taken out by hiding around a hill and sniping them with a bow and arrow.
, This is what makes this method so dangerous. Place TNT on the unguarded wall and light it with flint and steel or a Flame-enchanted arrow. The TNT will blow up, giving you a pathway into the base.
 Fight as best as you can (including splash potions) and resort to TNT at your last cost. All the enemy inside the base will be dead and you can do whatever you want with the base.
 Any sentries can be picked off with a bow and arrow and you can kill the guards with swords.

 A doll's hair is much different than human or animal hair. They are usually made from a fiber commonly used in wigs, either Kanekalon or Saran fiber, and are prone to getting dirty. Washing your doll's hair will restore its shine and make it nice and smooth for cutting. Lie your doll in some sort of basin or bowl appropriate for the doll's size. Remove all of the doll's clothes to avoid getting them wet. Wet the hair and then apply a tiny dot of fabric softener. At this point you should try to detangle any knots in the hair using your fingers, and if needed a comb. After working in the fabric softener, let it sit for twenty-minutes. Rinse out the fabric softener and let it air dry. If you do not have fabric softener, you can use shampoo or common dish soap. Avoid any harsh chemicals.
Avoid using any sort of electric heat to dry the hair as this can be damaging.
You may use cold or warm water. However, avoid water too hot because it can damage the hair.;
, After the hair is dry, you'll want to get it as straight as possible. This will help so that you know exactly how long the hair is and have a better idea of where you want to cut. Start from the end of the hair and use short strokes with the brush to detangle the ends. Slowly move toward the scalp, replicating the downward brushing pattern until you have done the entire hair. If you brush upward, you'll leave heavy knots in the hair. Brushes and combs used for human hair may not be your best option. You can buy a special doll hair brush or use a brush especially designed for wigs found at any hair care store.
 Determine how long you want your doll's hair to be and how much you'll cut off. Take a small rubber band or hair tie and place it at the cut point, making sure it gathers all the hair. This will be where you make your cut.


If you want to take an inch off the doll's hair, you'll place the rubber band or hair tie an inch from the bottom of the hair.

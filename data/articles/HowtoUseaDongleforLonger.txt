 In short the internet works by downloading pages from servers allowing you to view them. Depending on that page depends on how big it is in memory. This applies for emailing and downloading.;
, If you do need to download something then make sure it's a small file, otherwise expect your internet data to run out quickly.
 Also don't attach a file unless you really have to (e.g. for a deadline of some sort).
 For example if you're on Facebook, providing you don't keep clicking on links to your profile then to a friend's photo album you should be able to talk to friends for ages before your data gets low (although Facebook chat may take a small amount of memory up).
 Even if you're just going to be 5 minutes away from the PC it's best to disconnect and save the most of the internet until you're using it.
 Say if you're on holiday and there is free wifi at the local pub, then use that when you can and only use the dongle if you're in your hotel or lodge. Although some hotels may offer free wifi, most of the time they block websites such as Facebook and Youtube.

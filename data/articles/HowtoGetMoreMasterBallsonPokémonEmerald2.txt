 In Pokémon Emerald, you can find your one in-game Master Ball in Team Aqua Hideout. You will have to find your way through a maze of teleporters to reach the item, which will be found in the top left corner of the middle room on floor B1., After you beat the elite four, awaiting for you to south of Route 130 will be a new area for you to explore: the Pokémon Battle Frontier! Here you can find the Battle Tower, where you will exploit a glitch to clone Pokémon and items., Equip your Pokémon with a Master Ball, as this glitch works by cloning your Pokémon and any items in its possession. Now you can save your game in preparation for cloning.
 Speak to the first girl from the right at the counter to enter a Link Multi Battle. Choose the Pokémon carrying the Master Ball.
 As the game is saving, before you've entered the Battle Area, you must turn off your system to clone your Pokémon. Turn your game back on to complete the glitch.


During the warning message, "Saving, don't turn off the power," turn off the game.
 The nature of this glitch overwrites the slot where you first saved your Master Ball carrying Pokémon, also overwriting any Pokémon you left in that slot, with a copy of the Pokémon carrying the Master Ball. You should now have another Pokémon in your possession, and a Master Ball in its inventory.

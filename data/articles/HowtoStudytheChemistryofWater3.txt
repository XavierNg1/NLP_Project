 Since water molecules have a positive and negative end, they are considered polar. You can show this polarity by moving a magnet (or other source of electromagnetic field) toward the water running out of a faucet. The water will bend in response to the magnet because the charged ends of the water will repel against the magnetic field or bend toward it., Fill a cup or dish nearly full with water. Mark the water level so that you remember how much water you start with. Place the water in front of a sunny window and leave it there for several hours. Come back periodically and check the water level. Mark the new level each time.You will notice the water getting lower and lower. This is because some of the water gets warm enough to leave in the form of water vapor. This is known as evaporation.
 Put hot water into a cup and cover the cup with a lid. Place an ice cube on the lid. As the hot water evaporates, the vapor will come in contact with the cold lid and condense. This will allow small water droplets to form on the lid.A clear or transparent lid will allow you to see the droplets best.
 Fill a plastic bottle with water. Cover the bottle with aluminum foil and place it carefully in the freezer. When the water has frozen, take the bottle out and observe the results.You will notice that the water expanded up and out of the bottle, freezing onto the foil as well.
Avoid using a cap. This could cause the water to burst the bottle when freezing.

 One example of a style is “the rocker”, he wears band tees, jeans, leather jackets and converse tennis shoes. Look at the clothes you already own, and decide what kind of style you may already have. If you don’t have a style yet it is helpful to decide what style is right for you.


First, it might be helpful to think about someone who dresses in a way that you like. Identify that particular style- for example, if you like plaid shirts, tweed jackets, bow ties and oxford shoes- you like the professor look. Before you decide on a style, ask yourself: does that look make sense for me and for my interests?
Choose from the following list of some common styles for men: the professional, the collegiate, the sportsman, the playboy, the minimalist, the professor, the rocker, the woodsman, the man of leisure. There are, of course, more styles than are listed there. Remember, styles are flexible. The objective behind choosing a style is to give you a template to build your style. You will be the most confident and attractive when your style becomes an extension of you. ;
, Ask the people you know who have that style where they get their clothes, and go to those stores to shop.


Do research online to find examples of men wearing that style, and then search for the companies or brands associated with that style. For example, if you like the woodsman style you might want to start shopping at Lands End.
Online shopping is another great option, and if you don't like crowds, it will keep you from rushing while you shop. In addition, there are online companies and consultants who will help you find the style that is right for you, however, this option is a bit more pricey.
 The right accessories will go a long way for your style.


Consider the accessories that go along with your style, for example, you can buy a classic pair of ray bans if you are going for the rocker look or a nice leather watch to go with the professor style.

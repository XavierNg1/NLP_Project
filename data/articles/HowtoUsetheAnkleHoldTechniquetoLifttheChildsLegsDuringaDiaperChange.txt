 Make sure their legs are completely extended and spread slightly apart.;
,, The space between your index finger and middle finger should be holding onto the child's right leg (the leg that is on your left, if facing the child). Continue holding this leg with these fingers as you move the leg over so you can grab the other leg.
 Hold both of those legs together using these fingers. You should now have an empty space between your middle finger and index finger, and by now, should now be holding both legs.
 These two legs should be done simultaneously, since you're already holding both simultaneously.
 Keep their legs straight though. The legs won't bend so far as to reach their face, and may break if you even try this method.
 (i.e. Lower the child's legs once the changing pad has been set down underneath them, or the diaper has been placed underneath them.)

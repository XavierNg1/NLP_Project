 Since the computer will need to be turned on in order to access the printer, install the printer on a computer that spends a lot of time powered on.


When installing a printer on a Mac, you can usually just plug it in via USB and OS X will install everything automatically.
 Once the printer has been installed, you'll need to enable printer sharing so that your laptop can connect to it.


Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences".
Click the "Sharing" option.
Select the "Printer Sharing" option to enable printer sharing.
 Once you've enabled printer sharing, you'll want to share the printer from the same window. Check the box next to the installed printer to share it.
 Now that the printer has been shared, you can connect to it from your Mac laptop.


Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences".
Select the "Print & Scan" option.
Click and hold the "+" button and select your newly-shared printer.
Click the Download & Install button if it appears. While OS X comes with the software for most printers already installed, your printer may require additional software from Apple. If it does, you will be prompted to download it after adding the printer.
 Once you've installed the shared printer on your laptop, you can print to it just as if it was connected directly to the laptop. Make sure that the computer that the printer is connected to is turned on.


Open the Print dialog in any program and select the shared printer from the list of available printers.

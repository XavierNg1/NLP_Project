To make things easier, imagine an ice cream cone with a long curvy tail.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.



Draw 2 tall pointed arcs for the ears. Add two small circles at the inside bottom of the base of the ears. These will help you add shape to the head of the fox.
Add two tilted letter L’s at the side of the triangle (ice cream cone). It should end up looking like 3 slices of pizza left on the pan.
This will be the jaw or the cheek of the fox.



Draw a small circle on the apex of the fox’s jaw. This will be it’s snout.
Draw a wide, curvy horizontal line for the fox belly. It should connect the snout to the end of the tail.
Add a long boat-shaped figure for the fox’s tail.



This will be your fox’s hip and shoulder joints.



This will be your fox’s legs.



This will be your fox’s lower legs. Fox hind legs are longer and bent when compared on the ones on the front.



This will be the fox’s feet.
You should have the basic drawing skeleton right now.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The lineart might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose and fur.
You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.



Foxes can go in different shades from orange to red.

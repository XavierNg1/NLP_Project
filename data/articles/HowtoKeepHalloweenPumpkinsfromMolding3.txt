 Pumpkin preservative, like Pumpkin Fresh, are available online and at Halloween specialty stores. Pumpkin preservatives may contain water, sodium tetraborate decahydrate (borax), and/or sodium benzoate (a preservative and fungicide). They act as fungicides.
 Spraying is more convenient, but dunking may be more long-lasting.


If choosing to dunk, be sure to pat the pumpkin dry. Remember that mold hits where moisture fits.
 Spray the outside and inside with the preservative and watch as it fights off mold and decay. Pumpkin preservatives help the pumpkin last relatively mold-free for up to 14 days.

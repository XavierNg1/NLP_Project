 Staple every 4-6" along the edges to ensure that the paper will hold the weight of the foam and portland. Overlap paper about 6" and seal off edges with packaging tape. Be sure paper is cut to about 1" larger than the area you want to cover. It will be trimmed at the end.;
, This foam is very difficult to remove from skin and other surfaces (tile, carpet, walls, etc). If you don't want foam on it, cover it up.
 Shake the can thoroughly and hold it upside down when you spray the foam (as per instructions on can). Spray foam directly into gloved hand and smear a thin layer (1/4" or so) onto paper. Don't worry about spreading the foam into an even layer. Uneven layers will add texture and shape to your wall. As round bubbles appear, smooth over them with your gloved hand to shape the texture. Add any details now (like crags, shelves, etc) with the foam. Change gloves as needed (you may find that you need to change gloves after each can). Foam will expand for about 30 minutes. Cover entire area and let dry for approximately 2-4 hours, depending on how thick you applied the foam.
 Using a large brush, "paint" the portland mixture onto the wall. It helps if you only mix a little at a time (make about 2 gallons, use it, then make more). Let portland dry on the wall overnight (or approximately 8 hours). Portland will dry a light grey color, but you can add cement dyes or stains in if you wish. These can be picked up at your local hardware store.
 Pick colors that are natural and would look good with your other decorations (e.g. a spray paint with a thick, large-grained texture).
 with an exacto-knife or razor blade.

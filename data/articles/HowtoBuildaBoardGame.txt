 Think of what you want your game to be about. Do you like aliens? Sports? Just think of a theme. Write down ideas on paper or in a text document. You should also draw out a rough design of the game board. If it doesn't look right you can go back later and fix it.;
, What are the playing pieces? Are there special spaces or other features on the board? This is where you can get your creative juices flowing.
 This is one of the creative stages. Use colored paper or shiny pieces of metal or foam board or anything else you like. To make the game board you can use cardboard or poster board cut to the right size.
 Play your game with a friend or sibling. Follow their advice and try to improve the games rules.
 This is the most important part! If you don't have fun with it, you will never finish your game.

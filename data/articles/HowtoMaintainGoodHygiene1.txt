 Even if you're in a hurry, brushing your teeth will remove bits of food, bacteria, and stains that can cause problems if left to fester. Try brushing once in the morning and once before you go to bed, and spend at least two minutes each time you brush. It will keep you fresh the whole day.


If you are constantly on the go, have a travel toothbrush in you purse or briefcase so you can pop into the bathroom at work.
Spend equal time brushing the front, back, and tops of your teeth, especially the molars.;

Using a short piece of floss, get in between your teeth and along the gum line, using your fingers to add pressure.

Monitor your teeth, note any changes or worrisome pains, and get your teeth professionally cleaned at a minimum of once year. Smokers, diabetics, and people with a history of cavities should see the dentist twice a year or more.

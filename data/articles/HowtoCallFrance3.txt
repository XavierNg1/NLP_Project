 Whether you use a landline or a cell phone, you can save money if you make frequent calls to France. Depending on your provider, you could purchase an international calling plan for a flat fee or a reduced per-minute rate. Ask your service provider about flat monthly fees and overage charges for calls to France., Many apps, such as Vonage, Skype, or WhatsApp, allow you to call France for a steep discount or even for free. Weigh the options of how much the app costs versus how much it will save you in charges. Shop around for the app that’s best for your calling habits. Consider how long you’re planning to talk, how often you plan to call, and whether you’re calling a landline or a cell phone., If you don’t have a smartphone, phone services through VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) allow you to call landlines, cell phones, or computers. Through VoIP providers like Vonage or Magic Jack, you can call France and many other European countries for a fraction of what you would pay through a traditional landline service., You can talk to anyone in France or anywhere else in the world free of charge over many video chat services. Be sure to check the fine print. With Skype, for example, your chat is free only if your contact is also using Skype and if you’re only talking to one other username. Three-way chats cost extra., Choose texting if you want to send short messages on an infrequent basis. If you want to let your friend in Paris know you’ve arrived in New York safely, $0.15 for a single text is the more affordable option than the $0.99 per minute a voice call could cost you.

 For this method, you're basically melting styrofoam in paint-thinner, creating a semi-hard plastic-type substance that you can use to mold in different shapes and forms. To do it, you'll need:


Acetone or paint thinner, commonly available at hardware stores
A mason jar, or other glass container
Styrofoam cups, or some other kind of expanded polystyrene
Gloves
Eye protection;
, To complete the job, you'll need a half-inch or at least a few centimeters of acetone at the bottom of the jar.









Put on your gloves and glasses at all times when handling acetone, which is quite dangerous. Avoid breathing in the fumes and make sure you do this in a well-ventilated area with adult supervision, if you're under 15.
 Whether you've got some old packing styrofoam or styrofoam cups lying around, start tearing them into pieces small enough to fit into the glass and push all the way to the bottom.
 You should start to see the reaction relatively quickly, so it's important to keep your safety glasses and gloves on while you do this. Put the cap on the top of the jar, or cover it with a heavy object like a book and let the jar sit for several minutes while the acetone breaks down the styrofoam.









The more you wait, the more solid the melted product will become. In general, it's at a good moldable consistency between 3 and 5 minutes.
 When you remove the styrofoam from the jar, you'll have a weirdly moldable plastic substance you can shape and mold, much like clay. Keep your gloves on and mold it into a shape you'd like, then let it dry.









In about 12-24 hours it should be fully formed and solid.
 Use your imagination and mold your new plastic into a fresh shape, making a small plastic sculpture you'll be able to paint later, or some other cool design. This is a fun science project for kids and students, providing them with a cool souvenir for later.

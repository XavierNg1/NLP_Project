 Schedule a time and stick to it every week. Many people shop on Saturday or Sunday and meal prep on Sunday.;
, Although meal prepping can be done without official recipes, you should do this if you enjoy casseroles, pasta, slow cooker meals or soups.
 That way, you can choose several meals for the same protein, vegetable or whole grain.
 Get out your ingredient-based binder and find the ingredients you want to use for the week, such as chicken or pumpkin. Make a list of all the ingredients you need so that you aren’t relying on impulse buying.
 If you don’t have a warehouse membership, you may want to try one out. Meal prepping and bulk shopping go hand in hand because you cook large portions on one day that you can use all week long.
 Your list should include two main proteins, three to five vegetables, two to three whole grains and other recipe ingredients. The following is a sample list:


Dairy products: low fat feta, Parmesan, Greek yogurt and low-fat mozzarella.
Packaged/bulk products: black beans, chickpeas, corn, whole-grain bread, pasta sauce, vegetable broth, quinoa or couscous.
Produce: Basil, bell pepper, a head of broccoli, one pint of tomatoes, a head of garlic, a head of lettuce, lemon, parsley, two onions, potatoes, strawberries.
Protein: chicken breasts, eggs, shrimp, ground beef or sausage.
Spices and oil: olive or coconut oil, spices, vinegar, mayo, aluminum foil or parchment paper.

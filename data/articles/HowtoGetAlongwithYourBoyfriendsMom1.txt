 Some mothers are perfectly fine with you calling them by their first names; some are not. Find out your boyfriend’s mom’s preference and stick to that. You’ll send the wrong message by greeting her with “It’s so nice to meet you, Pam.” Stick to “Mrs. Wilder” unless she suggests something else.
 What you wear shouldn’t matter, but unfortunately it does. If your boyfriend’s mom is really conservative, you might offend her by wearing revealing clothing or tops with graphic images or words. You don’t have to go out and buy a new wardrobe, but wear something modest when you meet with her—at least until you become better acquainted.Dressing appropriately around your boyfriend’s parents is a sign of respect. If you’re not sure what’s appropriate, check with him.
A good choice might be a simple, modest-length dress or jeans and a nice shirt.
 Another way to show respect to your boyfriend’s mom is using your manners. Answer with “please,” “yes, ma’am,” or “no, ma’am.” Say “thanks” for an invitation to dinner. Turn your phone off during the meal and offer to help with the dishes afterwards. These small courtesies really make a positive impression., You’ll have trouble winning over your boyfriend’s mom if you go out of your way to disrespect her. If she has communicated (or you heard from your boyfriend) about any guidelines she enforces in her household, be sure to follow them.For example, if she states “no company after 11pm,” don’t force her to have to kick you out at 11:02. Say your goodbyes before the curfew arrives.
 Many families have special nights just for family. If your boyfriend’s family has a certain tradition they follow, be sure not to intrude. Don’t expect that just because you’re dating him that you’re welcome to join in on family traditions. If Friday evenings are his family game nights, make plans with your friends or spend time with your own family.His mom will appreciate that you allow him to have special time just with his family.

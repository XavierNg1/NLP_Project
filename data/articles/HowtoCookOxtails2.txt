 Rub the oxtails with the salt, using enough salt to coat the meat on all sides. Allow them to sit in a glass bowl at room temperature for 2 hours or in the refrigerator overnight.
 Use running water and scrub the salt off with your fingers.


You need to remove virtually all salt from the meat. Otherwise, you will end up with an excruciatingly salty dish by the end.
 The oven needs to be preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Heat 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil in the pot over medium-high heat.


Vegetable oil, shortening, or bacon drippings can also be used instead of the olive oil.
The pot must be oven-safe since you will be transferring it directly from the stovetop to the oven. It should also have a lid.
 After the oil begins to smoke, Saut√© the minced garlic, stirring frequently until it begins to brown.
 Add the oxtail slices cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, until they are brown on all sides.
 Fill the pot with the beef broth and Balsamic vinegar. Use enough red wine to cover the top of the meat by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Mix in the rosemary, thyme, oregano, and tarragon.
 Cover the pot and put it into the preheated oven for 3 to 4 hours.


Check on the oxtails periodically to make sure that there is still enough liquid. If the volume begins to dip below the surface of the meat, add more wine.
The oxtails are done when the meat begins to fall off the bone.
 Continue cooking for another 30 minutes.


For a milder flavor, substitute the onion for 2 chopped leeks.
 Remove the bones from the oxtails prior to serving, or allow your guests to do so themselves.


If desired, create a gravy by stirring the flour into the cooking liquid and heating the liquid on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Allow the liquid to boil and thicken, adding more flour if necessary, and serve with the oxtails.

 On one hand, donâ€™t find excuses to continually postpone starting Atkins. On the other hand, be realistic. Stressful times in your life generally make dieting more difficult. Also, starting before a holiday or a vacation can make the process more difficult.
 Find a list of acceptable Induction Phase foods and stock your pantry with those items. Remove items that will tempt you away from your goals. If you share your kitchen with people who are not on the Atkins diet, try to isolate the foods that you are avoiding so that they are out of your sightline.
 For instance, your morning trip to the donut shop to order a jelly donut and a coffee full of sugar will have to go. Instead, find a place that sells good coffee sweetened with a sugar substitute. Or you can avoid the trip altogether by taking a different route to your workplace.
 What have you accomplished that has made you feel good about yourself? Think of how you behaved in those situations and duplicate that behavior to achieve your weight loss goals. For example, if you set small but achievable goals and met those goals, duplicate that behavior while you are on Atkins.
 When you plan your meals before you go to the grocery store, you will guarantee that you have the ingredients and foods that you need on-hand. Look through your Atkins book or consult the Atkins website to plan healthy meals for the Induction Phase of the diet.

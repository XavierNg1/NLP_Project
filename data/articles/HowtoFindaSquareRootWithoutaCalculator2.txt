 It's tougher to figure out square roots of numbers that are not whole. But it's possible.


Let’s say you want to find the square root of 20. You know that 16 is a perfect whole number with a square root of 4 (4X4=16). And 25 similarly has a square root of 5 (5X5=25), so the square root of 20 must fall in between.
You could guess that 20’s square root is 4.5. Now, simply square 4.5 to check your guess. That means you multiply it by itself: 4.5X4.5. See if the answer is above or below 20. If the guess seems off, simply try another guess (maybe 4.6 or 4.4) and refine your guess until you hit 20.For example, 4.5X4.5 = 20.25, so logically you should try a smaller number, probably 4.4. 4.4X4.4 = 19.36. Thus, the square root of 20 must lie in between 4.5 and 4.4. How about 4.445X4.445. That’s 19.758. It’s closer. If you keep trying different numbers using this process, you will eventually get to 4.475X4.475 = 20.03. Rounding off, that’s 20.
 This process also starts with you trying to find the closest whole numbers that your number falls in between.Then, divide your number by one of those square root numbers. Take the answer, and find the average of it and the number you divided by (average is just the sum of those two numbers divided by two). Then take the original number and divide it by the average you got. Finally, find the average of that answer with the first average you got.
Sound complicated? It can be easiest to follow an example. For example, 10 lies in between the 2 perfect square numbers of 9 (3X3=9) and 16 (4X4=16). The square roots of those numbers are 3 and 4. So, divide 10 by the first number, 3. You will get 3.33. Now, average the 3 and 3.33 by adding them together and dividing them by 2. You will get 3.1667. Now take 10 divided by 3.1667. The answer is 3.1579. Now, average 3.1579 and 3.1667 by adding them together and dividing the sum you get by two. You will get 3.1623.
Check your work by multiplying your answer (in this case 3.1623) by itself. Indeed, 3.1623 multiplied by 3.1623 equals 10.001.

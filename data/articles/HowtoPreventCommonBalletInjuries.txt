Get your heart rate up by doing some laps around the studio and maybe holding plank for a minute or two.






Warm up your ankles, back and hips. Those are definitely the main three.






To warm up the feet, circle the ankles both ways about 10 times. Do some jumps, relevés and tendus. #*To warm up you back be sure to crack it (if you can) and do some twists (like turn around from the waist up) and do some bridges or "seal stretches".






To warm up your hips, do some battement cloches, splits, and some deep grande pliés.Don't forget to warm up other parts of your body: like hamstrings, shoulders, neck and such.

, Stretching at least 40 minutes per day prevents injuries and improves your dancing. If you do not have the time, it's your choice, but try to stretch every day. Even if you are on a vacation, a break or it's New Year's Eve or your birthday. If you can't do a longer stretch, try to do at least a shorter one.
 Strengthen your core and turnout muscles to prevent knee or back injuries. Simple things like doing plank, sit-ups, plies and easy classes while paying attention to every single muscle all work.
 Don't push it to make it work. Of course, all you want to do is dance, not sit and watch people do your class, but if you push it, it can become worse. If you want to, learn by watching your class closely while you rest the injury.

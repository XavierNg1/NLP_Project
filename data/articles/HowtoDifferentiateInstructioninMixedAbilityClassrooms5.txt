 Allowing students to work within an interest group gives them the advantage of building and furthering knowledge within the scope of their preferred focus. Hold a brainstorming discussion in class where students can propose ideas, and where you can gauge the range of common interests in the peer group. Following the discussion, used the ideas gathered to form specific group for students to join.For instance, if a history class is focusing on the 1960s, have students discuss historical developments of the period that interest them the most and form groups for the suggestions that resonated with multiple students (e.g. the Vietnam war, civil rights movements, womenâ€™s rights movements, the moon landing).
 In the spirit of collaboration and investigative learning, provide students with enough flexibility to use a wide range of resources for their group projects. For instance, let students use traditional library research or internet sources, but encourage creative ideas like interviewing sources and searching for historical records or documents. For instance, a project on the subway system could include traditional research as well as an interview with a conductor., Having specific focus groups will allow you to give special attention to certain areas of course content and provide advanced instruction. Finding a mentor for students working on a particular theme can enrich their study of the material and provide them with additional perspective about it. For instance, invite a former student who also took a special interest in a topic to speak to an interest group working on a similar project.

 Avoid massive clans of low levels because they will lose in the run-in wars (First to 25 kills, etc). Get a few friends your level or higher and advertise at clan wars "Join_________ 75+" or whatever minimum level you want.;
, If you want you can make your friends generals and recruited people captains, that way everyone can accept challenges.
 Only allow food and potions if everyone in your clan has plenty of both, which usually won't happen.
 Wait awhile to see how many players the other team has. If they have more, stay by your portal because it's a 1v1 area and they can't pile there. If your clan has more, go meet them at the middle.
 They should not have full mage clothing because the melee's will just kill them. In a multi combat area the mage should hide and when the opponent is using protect from melee prayer, attack with mage. If the other team comes after the mage, he should put on protect from melee and switch to melee armor. All the players should help kill off the players attacking the mage.

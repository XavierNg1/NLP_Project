 If you want the environment to be natural, do not use one. If you want a full color, no character shot, sure, use the flash. But otherwise, don't.;
, There is no way around it. Without the flash, you will have to go with longer exposures. You have to have a tripod.
 Since you have the tripod, an exposure that encompasses a few seconds is fine.
 You want to control everything with the aperture.
 You want the background to be blurred and this can help shorten your exposure time.
 To do this, shut your aperture down to about F16. This will cause your camera to choose a longer time for the shutter value.
, You don't want any camera shake (unless that is what you want), to interfere with the shot.
 To do this, you could:


Include people in the photograph
Step back far enough to include more than the tree
Include something to give it meaning for that event. Be sure something is separating that Christmas tree from any other.

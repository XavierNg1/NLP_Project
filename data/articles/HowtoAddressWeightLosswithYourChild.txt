 Help them to find some vegetables that they like (sugar snap peas, carrots, tomatoes).
 Skip out on the processed foods, and go for the more natural stuff.
 Make sure that they have something to drink on the go, because sometimes, they think they are hungry, when they are really just thirsty.

Kids love night walks!
Go out into the woods, go on a hike and have a treasure hunt.
Go to the beach and play!
Go down to the park, and have competitions. You make the rules! They will have a blast. Have races, pop bubbles, you could even bring some small dollar store prizes for competition winners. Use the playground as an obstacle course, play red light green light.

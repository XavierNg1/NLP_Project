Carefully remove the clay, leaving the rubber mold half intact.
Use a hobby knife to cut 3 or 4 pyramid shapes into the face of the mold. These will serve as matching-up joints for the 2 finished mold halves.
Create a new box to make a mold in, this time to the existing mold's length and width, allowing enough space in the height to pour the second part of the mold on top.
Set the object, mold side down, in the box. Make sure it fits snugly enough to not allow any new rubber compound to drip down the sides.
Paint the face of the mold you will be pouring on with mold release compound or thin film of vaseline. This will prevent the 2 mold halves from sticking together.
Pour your mold, let it set, then remove the box and pull the 2 sections apart. Your 2-part mold is complete.

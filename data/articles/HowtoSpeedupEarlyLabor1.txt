 Walking can help the baby shift in the uterus, causing it to the descend towards the pubic bone. This sends a signal to your body that the baby is ready to be born, which may trigger labor to progress.Walking up and down stairs can be especially helpful to shift a baby in the right position for birth.;
, Even if you're too tired to be walking up and down the stairs, you can move around in bed to help the baby reposition. Shift from your back to your side, for example, and then switch it up again a few minutes later. Staying in the same position will not help the baby move to speed up labor.Going from a sitting to standing position can be helpful. Try to get out of bed a few times an hour. If possible, walk around the room a bit before lying back down.
Try lying on your left side. This increases blood flow to the baby and can improve pain., Your back will feel better, and you'll help the baby rotate into the face-down position he or she needs to take in order to come out. Get on the floor and gently hold yourself up on your hands and knees. Kneel on a pillow if that's more comfortable.However, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you try this or any other unusual stretches or movements. You want to make sure such motions are safe for your specific pregnancy.

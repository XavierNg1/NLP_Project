 Make an effort to impress her with your outfit and hygiene because this will show you think she’s worth that effort. Avoid looking sloppy or like you don’t care. Don’t worry about dressing in your best clothes -- you just want to look put together., Talking with her in person will impress her and show her you’re sincere. Send her a text or a private message on Facebook or Instagram to break the ice if you’re feeling shy. Follow up with a phone call to make it more personal., Ask her to dinner or lunch or invite her on a picnic. Suggest something fun, like ice skating or another activity you both enjoy. Be prepared to treat her since you’re asking her out.For example, you can say, “I’d love to take you out to dinner, and then we can go to glow golf.”
If the weather is nice enough you can suggest, “Let’s spend the afternoon at the lake. I’ll bring a picnic and we can rent a boat. What’s your favorite picnic food?”

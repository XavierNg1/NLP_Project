Understand that the 1904 Model B was the first model, and this was followed by the 1909 Model F. The first closed-bodied cars were introduced in 1911, and early Buick vehicles were sometimes used as vehicles in the racing circuit.

Models with Delta fins were sold starting in 1958, the "dollar grin" grille dates back to the 1940s, and the nailhead V-8 engine was popular in vehicles from the 1950s and 1960s.;

 Not only is water the best thing you can drink for baby, but it won’t cost you a thing. In most homes, tap water is perfectly safe to consume. If you are concerned about the safety of your drinking water, consider putting a filter on your faucet. This may require a small investment at first but most filters last between 1 to 3 months.

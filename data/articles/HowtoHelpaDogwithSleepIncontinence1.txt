 When a dog is incontinent they will often respond to their bladder leaking by licking around their genital area. The dog’s skin might appear irritated and red. You may also detect the strong odor of urine on their fur or in their bedding area. These are all indications that your dog is suffering from incontinence and needs medical attention., It is good idea to take your dog to the vet when you first notice any signs of incontinence. Your vet will perform a general inspection of your dog to determine if there are other health issues that need to be addressed as well. The vet will also ask you about your dog’s habits, such as their drinking, eating, and sleeping patterns.Especially with senior dogs, incontinence can appear alongside other conditions, like urinary tract infections or spinal injuries., Your vet might suggest a medical approach to your dog’s bowel issues. Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is one medication often used to treat incontinence directly. Other medications might focus on treating the underlying causes of bladder injuries or urine infections. If your vet suggests a drug treatment, make sure to follow their dosing directions precisely.Some vets are even using collagen injections to treat incontinent dogs., With your vet’s guidance, you may want to put your dog on a hormone regimen. This will help to balance out a deficiency that may be contributing to your dog’s loss of bowel control. After a starting period, these medications are usually given weekly.However, be aware that if your dog starts on hormone therapy then they will need to continue it throughout the rest of their life. Hormone therapy can also be quite expensive, depending on the types of medications used.
Hormone therapy is often suggested for dogs whose hormones have reduced as a result of spaying or neutering. Older pets also can see a reduction in the production of hormones to regulate the bladder.

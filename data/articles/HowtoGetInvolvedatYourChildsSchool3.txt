 There are schools that allow parents to be lunchroom or playground monitors. They do this because the student to adult ratio can be 30:1 in some classrooms and often the schools will combine the lunch and playground time for all of the children in one or possible two grades. The total can reach 90 or more children per group with several groups rotating from classrooms to the lunchroom and then the playground.


Having extra adults keep an eye on the children during lunch and play time helps reduce the possibility of misconduct among the children.
 This volunteer opportunity usually lasts about an hour unless the parent decides to monitor more than one group of children. Sometimes all that is needed is for the parent to be present, but at other times they may need to remind children of the rules or actually stop children from misbehaving.


Usually the discipline of the children is handled by the teacher or other school staff member that is also monitoring the children.
 If you have early morning or mid-afternoon time available, you can sign up to be a crossing guard. You will be assigned a particular street intersection and will be responsible for helping the children safely cross the streets when they are walking to or from school. The available intersections are usually within a certain distance of the school building.


Crossing guards wear reflective safety vests and usually carry some type of sign that is used to stop the traffic so that children can cross safely.
The morning shift usually starts about 30-60 minutes before school starts and ends about thirty minutes after the tardy bell rings. The afternoon shift starts about fifteen minutes before the end of the school day and usually ends within an hour.

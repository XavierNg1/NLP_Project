 Each team member should be familiar with the other membersâ€™ personalities. This can help to set the stage for both respect and openness, both of which are needed for fast brainstorming sessions.When team members know each other well, they may also arrive at more creative ways to think collectively.
 These walks could focus on problem solving, or on general conversations. Sharing experiences they have had can help employees to develop a deeper understanding of each other.


At the same time, walking (and moving in general) can often help to spur on creativity. Walking, particularly through nature, can help you to see things in a different way.
 Involve every team member in the process of identifying solutions. By doing this, individuals will feel more comfortable sharing ideas and positive criticism with the rest of the group.
 Give your teams whiteboards or other things where they can write down ideas so that they can have those ideas right in front of them.


Each time an individual has an idea, have him or her write it up on the whiteboard. You could even consider numbering the ideas so that your team can assess them in order during the next meeting.
 After evaluating the ideas, let both individuals and teams try implementing the ideas. Be open to letting your employees learn from their mistakes.

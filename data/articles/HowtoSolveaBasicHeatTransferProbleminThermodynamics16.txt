 The cv constant needs to be evaluated at that temperature to be accurate. This is done through interpolation. Interpolation is the technique of assuming that the data is related linearly, and with two points one can calculate the value at a third point. Yet for this case, the difference between the cv values is extremely small. Thus this interpolation can be assumed to just be an average of the two numbers. The mean is calculated below in equation 25.

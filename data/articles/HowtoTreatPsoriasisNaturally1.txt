 Eating well will alleviate a variety of health problems and reduce inflammation, which is key to controlling psoriasis. There are a few specific guidelines you can follow in order to better treat and reduce the severity of psoriasis.


Avoid fatty red meat, high-fat dairy products, and processed food. All of these foods can increase inflammation throughout the body, worsening psoriasis.
Eat whole foods instead. Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, broccoli, and strawberries.;
, Your body can easily digest omega-3 fatty acids.. These fatty acids can also help the immune system to stop sending the wrong signals to your skin and reduces inflammation, which makes it an important part of any person’s diet who is dealing with psoriasis. You can find omega-3 fatty acids in foods like:


Sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp and winter squash.
 Foods covered in oil are not very easy to digest. Fried and greasy foods are also generally very high in fat; fat can clog your arteries as it is not easy for your body to digest.You should also limit your intake of processed and refined foods.
 Following a gluten-free diet may help to reduce psoriasis for those with a gluten allergy or Celiac disease. Some studies have shown a reduction in psoriasis symptoms for those following a gluten-free diet. However, before eliminating gluten you should consult with a medical professional and get a blood test to assess whether or not you have an intolerance to gluten.
 To speed up your body’s elimination of toxins, you can try doing a detox. Doing this will allow your bowel to rest so that the swelling can go down and your skin can become healthy again. While you can choose different detoxes, a three day detox may work when you are dealing with psoriasis. Limit your diet to:


Lots of water, broths, soups, juices
Fresh fruits
Green vegetables
Nuts

, If you have a hard time believing it, there's always something you can change; for example, if you would like to lose weight, then try getting active. Don't change yourself completely; always stay yourself! Nobody is alike; you're a unique person!

, Nothing is true; for example, people might think that sushi is the best food in the world, but others might not, and some people could find you ugly while some people may notâ€”it's all a matter of opinion. If you constantly believe negative things, then you'll have low self esteem.
 Feel good about yourself, get fit, wash your face, take care of your nails, and shower. Good hygiene or maybe some new clothes or a new hairstyle could help you feel better. For girls, you can always try some make-up if you want. You don't have to if you think you are better off natural. If you are going to try make-up, don't overdo it; use some foundation for a base and then apply concealer and then you can add some mascara for a cute natural look.
 Improve!

As you buff, the finish will get smoother and smoother., Grab an soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush or kabuki brush, and gently sweep the tops of your nails. This will knock off any excess powder.You can also use a thin brush or Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe down the ski around your nails.If you applied glue or latex in the beginning, simply peel it off!

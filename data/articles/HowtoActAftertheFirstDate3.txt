 If someone is not responding to your texts promptly and giving short replies, you may be texting too much. It's okay to text a lot after a first if the person is encouraging conversation, but if you're getting silence on their end, it may be best to tone it down. You don't want to seem overeager, as this could potentially put someone off.
 For the most part, people rarely make phone calls anymore, especially in the dating game. Texts are generally the preferred method of communication, so stick to texting your date rather than calling them.However, if you're older and do not use smart phones, calling may still be appropriate. If your date has preferred phone calls previously, calling may be a better route in this case.
 Again, it's okay to interact on social media if you're already connected there. However, if you're not, do not add them on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You should also avoid scrolling through their profiles, as this may cause you to overanalyze things and jump to unfair conclusions., Even if it went well, one date does not mean you're in a relationship. If you're talking to other people you're interested in, keep in touch with them. This relationship may not work out, so it's okay to keep looking in case things fall through.

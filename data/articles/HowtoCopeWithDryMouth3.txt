 If your dry mouth is persistent and at-home remedies haven’t done the trick, it is time to see a professional. Discuss your full medical history with your doctor. Numerous conditions, diseases, and syndromes can cause dry mouth, including:Diabetes
Parkinson’s disease
Sjögren’s syndrome
Sicca syndrome
Certain forms of radiation therapy Some dental surgeries, like having your wisdom teeth removed
The use of some medications, including antihistamines, decongestants, painkillers, blood pressure treatments, antidepressants, and many others

, Currently, there are a few options:


Cevimeline is approved to treat dry mouth caused by Sjögren’s syndrome.
Pilocarpine is approved to treat dry mouth caused by Sjögren’s syndrome as well as by radiation therapy.
Amifostine protects against the damage of radiation, and studies show that it can reduce the severity of dry mouth for many patients.
 Since dry mouth is often caused as a side-effect of medications, you doctor should review any that you are taking. If your dry mouth is severe, he or she may be able to write a prescription for a different medication to eliminate one that is causing the problem. In some cases, the irritation associated with dry mouth outweighs the intended benefits of the medication.
 In many cases, your problem may be chronic or reoccurring. If you doctor tells you to take a prescription or to use a fluoride treatment for a period of time, follow his or her instructions even if your dry mouth goes away after a couple of days. Doctors try to treat root causes and their symptoms.

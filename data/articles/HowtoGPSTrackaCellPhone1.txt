 The Android Device Manager is a tool that lets you track your lost or stolen Android Device. You can download the Android Device Manager app to another Android device, or you can access it through a web browser.;
, When you first open the Android Device Manager, you will be asked to log into your Google account. Ensure that it is the same account that is linked with your lost device.
 After logging in, Android Device Manager will attempt to locate your device. The last known location will be shown at the center of the map. Your device's details will be shown in the small window in the upper-left corner.
 There are several different actions you can perform with your lost phone:


Ring - This will make your phone ring, making it easier to find if it is lost nearby.
Lock - This puts a new lock code on your device, keeping others from accessing it. You can also include a message that will appear on the lock screen.
Erase - This will wipe the data from your phone in case it is completely lost or stolen. Be careful when selecting this option, as it is irreversible.

 Bomber jackets, double riders (also called “Schott Perfecto”), and moto “racer” jackets are the most common, classic leather jacket styles. The best jacket style for you will be the one that matches your taste. Start by looking at variations of these three styles.


The double rider is considered a classic American leather jacket. While it varies between different manufacturers, it usually has an angled zipper across the front, wide lapels, and a flared collar.
Bomber jackets are waist length, casual, and have a soft inner lining. The lining usually extends to the collar, so it is fabric instead of leather. They typically have large pockets and are built for warmth and comfort.Moto “racer” jackets are the dressiest leather jackets, with a snug fit and a small or absent collar.;
, You want your leather jacket to fit snugly, but not so tight that you can’t move your arms. When trying on your jacket, be sure to wear the type of clothing that you will wear underneath it on a normal day—this will help you ensure that there is enough room inside the jacket. Hug yourself and lift your arms above your head to be sure that you are able to move comfortably without pulling the back of the jacket too much.


Armholes that are higher up on the jacket will give you a wider range of motion than lower armholes, which tend tend to pull on the body of the jacket when you move your arms.
Be sure to check the sleeve length of the jacket. You will want the sleeves of your jacket to stop just before or at your wrists. They shouldn't extend down over your hands.
 Of course, the color that you choose depends on your personal preference. Just keep in mind that black and brown are the most versatile colors, and they will hide imperfections and marks better than a colored jacket.


If you want to wear your leather jacket to dressy events, consider a moto "racer" jacket in black or brown.

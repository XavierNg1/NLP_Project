 The physics concept of acceleration doesn't always match how we would use the term in everyday life. Every acceleration has a direction, usually represented as positive if it's UP or RIGHT, and negative if DOWN or LEFT. See if your answer makes sense based on this breakdown:



Behavior of a Car
How is Velocity Changing?
Direction of Acceleration


Driver moving right (+) hits gas pedal
+ → ++ (more positive)
positive


Driver moving right (+) hits brakes
++ → + (less positive)
negative


Driver moving left (-) hits gas pedal
- → -- (more negative)
negative


Driver moving left (-) hits brakes
-- → - (less negative)
positive


Driver moves at constant velocity
remains the same
acceleration is zero



, Remember, a force only causes acceleration in the direction of the force. Some problems may try to trick you with irrelevant values.


Example Problem: A toy boat with mass 10kg is accelerating north at 2 m/s2. A wind blowing due west exerts a force of 100 Newtons on the boat. What is the boat's new northward acceleration?
Solution: Because the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, it does not have an effect on motion in that direction. The boat continues to accelerate north at 2 m/s2.
 If more than one force acts on an object, combine them into a net force before you calculate acceleration. For a problem in two dimensions, this looks something like this:


Example Problem: April is pulling a 400 kg container right with a force of 150 newtons. Bob stand on the left of the container and pushes with a force of 200 newtons. A wind blowing left exerts a force of 10 newtons. What is the acceleration of the container?
Solution: This problem uses tricky language to try and catch you. Draw a diagram and you'll see the forces are 150 newtons right, 200 newtons right, and 10 newtons left. If "right" is the positive direction, the net force is 150 + 200 - 10 = 340 newtons. Acceleration = F / m = 340 newtons / 400 kg = 0.85 m/s2.

 Most Mac computers come with Bluetooth installed. If Bluetooth is installed and activated, you will see the Bluetooth logo in the upper-right corner of your screen. If you don't see the logo, you can check to ensure that you have the proper hardware installed.


Click the Apple menu and select "About this Mac".
 This will open a new window, displaying all of the hardware, network protocols, and software installed in your Mac computer. Make sure the Hardware category is expanded, and look for the Bluetooth entry.


If the Bluetooth option is not available or nothing appears when you click it, then you don't have any Bluetooth hardware installed. You will need to purchase a Bluetooth USB dongle, which are a few dollars on Amazon or other retailers.
 You can also check for Bluetooth capability from the System Preferences window. Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences". Look for Bluetooth in either the "Hardware" or "Internet & Wireless" section.
 Once you've checked that Bluetooth is present, you can start using your Bluetooth devices. See this guide for ideas on how to get the most from your Bluetooth devices.

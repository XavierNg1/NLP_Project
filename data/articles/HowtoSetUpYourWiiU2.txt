  Take out all the compartments and put them somewhere neatly within reach you should have (Please note that the GamePad Charging Cradle and onwards are only contained in the Deluxe Version):

Wii U console
Wii U GamePad
Wii Remote Sensor Bar
Wii U GamePad charger (They don't use AA or AAA batteries!)
Wii U AC adapter
HDMI cable
GamePad Charging Cradle
GamePad stand (Does not charge the GamePad)

Nintendo Land game

, Put it near a TV somewhere near your bedroom so you can play without the TV just on the GamePad when desired.

Put the stands on the bottom if you wish to stand it up.
  Plug the other end into a powerboard.,

You can use component cables if you have and older, standard definition TV

,  Place it either directly on top, dead in the middle on top of your TV or directly below it, dead in the middle.  Wii Remotes are very touchy and sensitive and it will make it worse if you don't set up your Sensor Bar perfectly.,  Place AA batteries in your Wii Remotes and plug your Wii U GamePad charger into a powerboard and plug it into the top of the GamePad.,

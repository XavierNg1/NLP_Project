 Search engines rely on titles, so use straight-forward, compelling language. Make sure it is under 22 words to be listed on Google.


You can include a sub-headline. It can include information that didn't fit in your initial headline, and you can use important keywords. It will often appear in search results.
 Include keywords in your headline, sub-headline, first sentence and first 2 paragraphs. Make sure to use 2 to 3 keywords in these areas.
 While keywords usage is essential for SEO, it will get picked up by other sites if it is written in an engaging, fact-based way. Strike a balance between getting your keywords into the correct places and writing a knowledgeable, interesting piece.
 A quote is good material for journalists and bloggers. They are more likely to choose a story with quotes that they can use verbatim, so your release will be distributed further.
 Most people search online to solve a problem. By stating a "how to," such as "how to exercise," in your press release, you increase its chances of appearing on a search.
 It should not be much more than 1 page of text. Usually a page of text is around 400 words, so take out anything that is unnecessary to achieve your goals.
 You should include Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Google+. In many cases, these links don't have to be written out, they can be small favicons at the top corner of the web page.
 Many people who read press releases will look for a site where they can read more. A landing page is also easier to track than a company home page.

 You should first check to see if the item is brass or brass-plated. If it's brass-plated, you need to be even gentler with it, as you don't want to scrub away the plating. A magnet won't stick to pure brass, but it will stick to brass-plated items. Therefore, if the magnet doesn't stick, you have pure brass., Start with a whole lemon. Cut the lemon in half, width-wise, so you have a good-sized scrubber that will squeeze out lemon juice as you rub. Sprinkle salt on the cut side of one of the halves. You can use whatever salt you prefer., Take the salted lemon half, and scrub the brass. The salt will work as a light abrasive, and the lemon juice will help remove grime. Work it in over all the brass. If you have a big piece, you may need to move to the second lemon half, adding salt to it first., Use a soft cloth to remove all the salt and lemon juice. You may need to switch out cloths halfway through. You can also rinse it, if you prefer, but make sure you dry it very well afterwards.

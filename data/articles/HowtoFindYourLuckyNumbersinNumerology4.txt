 If the vowels tell us what is most true about our inner self, perhaps the consonants tell us what is seen on the exterior. In the study of Numerology, this is held true. One's Personality Number reveals those parts of yourself that are easiest to show to others. It articulates how to filter the people and experiences you want out of life through your external behavior.


This number goes beyond your own agency and also explains what others observe about you within a brief encounter. It shows the principal personality traits that are noticed with little effort on the part of those around you.
 Follow the same pattern as above using only the consonants to determine your number. Returning to ROBERT NESTA MARLEY we get the letters R, B, R, T, N, S, T, M, R, L, Y. Note that we count Y as a consonant and not a vowel in this case. Within numerology Y is always considered a consonant if it is next to a vowel with which it forms the same syllable. So it is in this example, where it functions to produce an "ee" sound.


R+B+R+T = 9+2+9+2 = 22 = 2+2 = 4

N+S+T = 5+1+2 = 8

M+R+L+Y = 4+9+3+7 = 23 = 2+3 = 5

4+8+5 = 17 = 1+7 = 8

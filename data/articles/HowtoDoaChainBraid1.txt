 Secure it with a hair tie that matches your hair color. This style works best with high and mid-height ponytails, but you could try a low ponytail as well.






;
, Clip one of the sections out of the way for now. You will "braid" both of these sections separately.If you need to, use the end of a rattail comb to split your hair.
 Leave the other section alone for right now. Do not unclip it yet.
 Do not twist them together just yet. Use your fingers to twist each strand into a thin rope.
 This time, twist the strands to the left. This way, they will lock together, and won't come undone during the next step.
 If you are braiding someone else's hair, you can have them hold the end of the rope for you.
 Unclip the second section of hair. Divide it into two strands. Twist both strands to the right, then twist them together to the left. Tie the second rope off with a clear elastic or mini hair tie.
 Make sure that you twist them to the right. This will help lock them together, and prevent them from unraveling. As you twist them, you should notice a chain forming!







, If you'd like, you can add a hair accessory to the top or bottom of the braid. Give the braid a light mist of hairspray to keep it sleek and smooth.

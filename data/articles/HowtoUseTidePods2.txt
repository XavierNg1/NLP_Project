, Tide pods can be toxic if ingested by children or animals, which is a concern given the pods’ colorful and candy-like appearance. Store Tide pods securely in a high cupboard, out of reach for kids and pets. Be vigilant when using laundry pods (e.g. avoid putting a pod down on a counter or table while preparing laundry, or simply make sure kids and pets are out of the room before doing laundry)., Make sure that the lid of your Tide pods container is shut firmly before storing, and that the pods are kept dry. Wetness could cause pods to leak and stick together in the container. Accordingly, only use dry hands to handle Tide pods when doing laundry.

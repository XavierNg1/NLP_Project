 Interact with your toddler during stroller walks so they feel engaged and excited to be in the stroller. Chat with them about the day and the things they are seeing outside. Do singalongs with them to keep them busy and engaged.For example, you may ask your toddler to describe what they see from inside the stroller. Or you may sing their favorite song to them to keep them occupied.
 Start off the game by saying, “I spy with my little eye something…”. Then, let your toddler guess. Once they get it right, it becomes their turn to spy something based on a color around them.If your toddler knows their shapes, you can also play “I Spy” with shapes, where they have to spot items based on their shape.
 Keep the stroller walks or jogs interesting for your toddler by switching up your walking routine. Go for different walking paths or trails. Try taking your toddler to different or new settings in the stroller. This way, you can point out new things to them and keep them busy by exposing them to different environments.As part of a game, you may also ask your toddler where they want to go today in the stroller. Let them choose the destination so they are more excited to be in the stroller and are willing to stay calm in the stroller as you walk to their chosen destination.

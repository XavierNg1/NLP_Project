 Pepper plants like heat, but they need moist soil. Water your sweet pepper plants several times a week throughout the summer. Daily watering may be necessary during particularly dry, hot spells. You can help keep the soil moist by mulching it with grass clippings.Water near the roots, rather than showering the water from overhead. This prevents the leaves from getting burned by the sun.
Water in the morning, rather than at night. This way the water will be absorbed during the day. Watering at night leaves the plants prone to mold growth.
 This will help the plants produce large, healthy peppers.
 Hoe around the plants to keep weeds away. Be careful and do not hoe too deeply, or you may cut into the roots of your pepper plants. You may also pull the weeds by hand. Be sure to discard the weeds in a separate area so they don't drop seeds and grow back.
 Pepper plants are susceptible to aphids and flea beetles. If you see pests on your plants, pick them off and drop them in a pail of soapy water. You can also spray them off using a strong stream from your garden hose. As a last resort, spray your plants with pesticides, making sure they're safe for use on vegetables.


If you're dealing with a big pest problem, you can cuff the plants. Arrange a piece of cardboard in a circular fashion around the stem of each plant. Make sure the cardboard sticks into the soil about an inch deep, and rises up several inches. This will prevent insects from climbing up the stems.
 Place a garden stake next to the main stem and fasten the stem to it loosely with twine. This will help the plant grow upright and keep the peppers from growing against the ground.
 The peppers are ready to cut when they're bright and color and look fully ripe. When the peppers have reached the correct shape, color and size, harvest them by cutting them off with a knife. The plant will now be free to produce new fruit.

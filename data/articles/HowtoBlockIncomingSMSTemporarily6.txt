 Android’s “Blocking Mode” is designed to temporarily block calls, notifications, and/or alarms.
, This feature is located in the section labeled “Personal”.
 This toggle is located in the very top, right corner of the screen. This will allow you to access and alter all of the settings associated with “Blocking Mode”.


To disable “Blocking Mode”, slide this toggle to the left (off).
 When you activate “Blocking Mode”, your incoming calls are blocked, your notifications are muted, and your alarms are muted by default. If you only want to mute notifications, uncheck the boxes next to “Block incoming calls” and “Turn off alarm and timer”.


Use the “Allowed contacts” feature to select individuals or groups that can contact you when you are in this mode.

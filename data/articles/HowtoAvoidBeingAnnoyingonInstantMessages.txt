 If you can't contribute to a more in depth conversation, respond to the original 'verbal' gambit and stop. The button flashes. The screen pops up. Your friend has just said how much they enjoyed the movie last night. You too enjoyed the movie, but it isn't necessary to say it. Obviously Instant Messaging wasn't invented for emergency use only, it was invented to keep in touch. Okay, so you say you enjoyed the movie, but don't go on and on about it. Try bringing up a new topic or an item involving the movie, such as the actors or similar movies. This helps to develop idle chit-chat into a great conversation.;
, Topic changes can happen fast. Your best friend is now asking what you did last night. You immediately think "Ooh, I bought that great new CD," but your friend then types again-"I went to that new nightclub that opened." You want to reply, but feel your friend has to finish what they started. Ask them more about the nightclub (or topic they brought up) and what was good and bad about it. Only ask this once, and be polite. Listen to your friend, and if they ask you stop asking questions or seem to be getting annoyed, stop.
 Your friend from class laughs at what you ate this morning. You ask why. They laugh again. Things may be annoying to them, but also to you. Explain that that's very annoying, and you'll block the contact if they take it any further.
 Your new buddy makes you smile, and laugh, maybe even cry. You type "That's so cool!" Okay, no big deal. Except every single letter is flashing and sparkly. This is extremely annoying. A few of these are okay, but don't overdo it.

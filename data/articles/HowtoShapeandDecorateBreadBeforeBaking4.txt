 Split in half to make 2 loaves or make 1 large loaf. Press the dough ball flat on the table in a round shape and form into a nice circle using one of the two methods:


For Beginners, its easier to start folding the edges of the dough and pressing them into them middle, turning and pleating the dough as you go. Once all the edges are pressed in, you typically will have a nice round loaf. Grip the centre seams and pinch them, then roll or rock the ball around the bench top to round the loaf's edges. The pinched side will end up the bottom of the loaf, so the good side is face down in this method.
For more practiced bakers, gather the dough and place your hand to the side of the dough, palm facing the dough. Press the side of the ball with the edge of your hand and press down, pushing it forward. The dough should rotate as you do this. With this method it stretches the dough after several repetitions into a nice round shape, with the good side up.
 With this bread, you may do a wide range of decorations with a razor, such as a spiral from the outside into the centre, diagonal slashes, diagonal slashes coming inwards like a vortex, a cross, a chequerboard, or a flower shape - such as on Galette Des Rois - or anything you desire.
 Tap the base of the load and it should sound hollow when cooked. If the dough feels heavy, leave it in the cooling oven for another 10-15 minutes.

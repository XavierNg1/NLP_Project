 This sounds simple, but it only takes seconds for something to happen. This doesn't exactly mean that you must be in the same room as the candle, but make sure you can see it wherever you go.;
, Don't leave candles on a plastic or otherwise flammable tray or on an end table that can be easily knocked over. Rule of thumb: If anyone, or a pet, can knock over the table, it's unsafe for the candle.
 Be sure that your cat can't jump onto the table. If a candle is on a countertop, make sure it is as far back as it can go while staying four inches from the wall and other things. This way, a child can't reach over and grab it.
 Nothing can ignite if it's not close enough, right?

, Candles can get bumped over easily in high-traffic rooms. It's safer to leave them in sitting areas or bathrooms than a living room or hallway.
 A sudden draft could easily blow those curtains into the flame. If your windows are open, avoid burning candles altogether.
 If a wick is too short, the holder will extinguish the flame. But, if you just have a candle sitting on a counter, you run the risk of burning the surface.
 These little silver plates go over the top of a candle to keep the flame burning in one direction and eliminate smoke.
 Votive candles should be placed in a tightly fitted cup as they are meant to pool. If you put a votive candle on a plate, it would pool in two hours and run everywhere. If you put the votive in a tightly fitting votive cup, the candle will burn for around fifteen hours. Also be sure to use properly fitted holders for taper candles.
 The wick is too low and is unsafe for burning.

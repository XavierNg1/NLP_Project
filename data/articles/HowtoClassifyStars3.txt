 This will give you a range of colours, called a spectrum, like what you get when you shine a torch through a prism. The spectrum of a star should have dark lines on it. These are absorption lines.
 A good astronomical database should give a typical spectrum for each star type. This is why the type is, sometimes called the spectral class.

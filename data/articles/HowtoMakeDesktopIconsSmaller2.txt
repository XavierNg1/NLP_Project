 A dialog box will appear containing desktop customization options.
 The current icon size is displayed (in pixels) next to “Icon Size” at the top of the window (e.g., 48 x 48). As you move the slider to the left, the Icon Size value will decrease.


The smaller the number, the smaller the icons.
The smallest possible icon size is 16 x 16, and the largest is 128 x 128.
 If you are dissatisfied with your changes, return to the View Options and try a different size.

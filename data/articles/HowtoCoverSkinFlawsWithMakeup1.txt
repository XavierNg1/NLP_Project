, Cover the sides of the blemish and/or dark spots completely by creating an “x” movement with the formula (preferably one a shade or two lighter than your skin tone). Blend the concealer with your fingers, dabbing your skin, careful not to rub it against the blemish/scar.Conceal your dark or under eye circles after concealing your blemishes/scars.
If you’re looking for your concealer to act as extra coverage, wait until after you have applied your foundation to apply concealer.
 Start at the nose then sweep outwards, creating round motions. Make sure you don't have any foundation lines on your jaw line- always blend your foundation into neck for a more natural look.
 Wait a few minutes for your makeup to set on its own and reinforce your work with a powder. Buffer on some loose powder on your chin, forehead, and the bridge of your nose with a large, fluffy brush in circular motions.

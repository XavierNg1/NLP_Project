 Not all rats will willingly be fed by syringe. If your rat does not take his medication on his own, you will have to force feed him. First, get your rat ready.


If your rat is very big or rambunctious, you may need to gently wrap him in a cloth or towel. You wrap your rat sort of like a burrito, pulling the cloth or rag around him firmly enough that he cannot move easily.However, as rats are small this may not be necessary. You can simply hold your rat with one hand. Pick him up with your non-dominant hand and place your thumb and forefinger around his chest, keeping these fingers under his front legs. Some people find placing their rat on their lap or chest works well. If your rat is social and enjoys climbing on you, this may help keep him calm., Once you've restrained your rat, move his right leg between your ring and pinky finger. This will prevent him from pushing the syringe away. Then, gently turn his head towards you. Position his mouth at an angle from which you can easily administer the syringe., Once your rat is restrained and turned towards you, place the syringe in his mouth. Bend it at a roughly 45 degree angle. Bending the syringe too sharp could cause your rat to gag., Slowly release the food, medication, or liquid into the rat's mouth. Go in increments, pausing on occasion to allow your rat to swallow. Go slowly, giving him enough time to swallow all the liquid. If your rat tries to spit up the liquid, you may have to gently close his mouth to prevent this.If your rat becomes very distressed, take a break. Allow him to calm down before administering more medication, food, or water. You do not want to create too much stress as this can make your rat sicker.

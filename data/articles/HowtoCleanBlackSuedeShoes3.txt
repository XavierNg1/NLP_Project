 Though you don’t want to use water for basic stains on suede, water stains can be treated with the same substance. Dampen a soft cloth, and then cover the shoe in a light layer of water. Make sure the water is evenly spread over the shoes.Use a dry cloth to dab up the excess water.
Place a shoe tree or balled up paper inside the shoe to keep the shape. Then, let it dry overnight.
Brush with a suede brush to liven the look of the suede.
 If you have an oil stain on your suede shoes, try using the suede brush. If that doesn’t remove it, use cornstarch. Sprinkle a light coating of cornstarch on the oil stain. Let the cornstarch sit for around eight hours.Brush away the cornstarch. Then use the steam from a steam iron to dampen the stained area lightly. Use the brush to finish removing the stain.
 If you get chewing gum, wax, or something else sticky on your suede shoes, a brush won’t work. Place the shoe in the freezer until the sticky substance is frozen and hard.Use a brush to chip away the hardened substance.

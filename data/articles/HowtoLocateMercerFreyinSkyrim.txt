 Riften is the town on the southeastern corner of the map. From Whiterun, head straight towards the southeast direction, passing two rivers until you come across a town just beside a lake; this is Riften.;
, Right after completing the “Taking Care of Business” quest, head to the the Bee and Barb tavern found at the center of Riften. There you’ll find a man named Brynjolf. Talk to him and he will tell you that he has a job waiting for you.
 After talking to him, he’ll tell you that you need to see a man named Mercer Frey first and ask you to follow him. Follow Brynjolf to the Marketplace at the center of the town, through a small door at the western side of the area. Step inside the door to get to an underground hall below the town called the Ragged Flagon.
 As you enter the Ragged Flagon, a pale man with blond hair will talk to you and Brynjolf. This is the man you’re looking for; Mercer Frey.

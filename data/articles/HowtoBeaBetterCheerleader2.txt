 If you don't take yourself seriously and look like a mess, why should other people take you seriously? Wear clothes that fit you, not ones that are too tight or too baggy. The best choice for cheer clothes are soft shorts and a T-shirt or tank top.


Wear your hair up - ponytails are ideal. Not only does it look pretty, but it also keeps the hair out of your face while cheering.
Never wear jewelry! It can get caught, snagged or ripped, and that hurts.
 Don't be afraid to yell! However, don't start screaming. You will stand out to the coach if they can hear you over everyone else. Remember to shout loudly and say the words clearly.
 If you don't make it the first time, keep practicing and trying. If you do make it, then don't think, "Gee, I'm the best." Obviously you have skill if you've made the team, but no one (including the coaches) will want to deal with that kind of attitude, and it can affect you next tryout season.
 Always have a positive attitude! Always believe in yourself. If you believe in yourself, you will succeed!

,,,, You perform what you practice, and if you practice not trying, or saying it's too hard, you won't perform as well. As as long as you can say "I gave 100%," your coach will be happy.
 This step is another important one. When you watch movies, you may see cheerleaders being stuck up and rude but in reality, that's not how a cheerleader should be. If you're an awesome cheerleader, you will have respect for yourself and others. Don't pick on the new guy or people lower than you. That`s not cool even though your friends do it. A cheerleader is nice to everyone, and being nice means being nice to your team members too

Ask questions, ask your coach for things they are looking for also ask for previous routines and tapes.
 Ask someone who's been on the team in previous years, preferably Varsity cheerleaders with more experience.

Write with the specific audience in mind if you are using the statement for a particular grant or funding application. Gear the statement towards what the funding source is looking for in the history of the nonprofit, such as longevity, strong board support or financial stability.

Include an organizational chart if that will help demonstrate how the organization has changed since its inception. For example, the group may have started with 2 staff members but over 10 or 15 years has grown into 50 employees.

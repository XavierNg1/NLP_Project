 A slow and gradual cessation is better for both the baby and mom. Abruptly ceasing all nursing sessions can be traumatic for both the baby and moms body, and can even make the mom more susceptible to developing a clogged breast duct, inflammation or the painful breast infection Mastitis.
 If your baby has become accustomed to a nursing session after lunch everyday, eliminate all after lunch sessions for one week. The following week, remove the early evening sessions or any other session that occurs routinely. Now, two routine feeding sessions have been taken from your baby. Continue to reduce all nursing sessions until you have effectively weaned your baby completely.

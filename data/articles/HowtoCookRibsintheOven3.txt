 Remove ribs from the packaging and pull off the membrane, which is usually attached to the underside of the rib cage. Season the ribs with salt, pepper, and other spices that you like.









The membrane becomes tough when cooked, so it's important to remove it. Slide a knife underneath it and gently pull it up, working carefully to remove all shreds of the membrane.
 Leave enough foil hanging over the edges to fold over and cover the pan while the meat is cooking.









The pan should have at least two inch sides, and be large enough for all the meat to fit in one layer. Stacking the meat will cause it to cook unevenly, and very thick layers may result in some of the meat not being cooked thoroughly.
 The water will create steam to keep the meat moist, while keeping the bottom of the pan and foil from scorching. This also reduces the actual temperature in the tent you'll create with the foil.
,, An alternative to foil is a turkey baking bag. Using a baking bag will make clean-up easier and produce an evenly cooked product. Follow the directions on the cooking bag box. The addition of water isn't necessary as the bag acts as an ad hoc pressure cooker. If all that is available to you is foil, lay some wax paper or parchment down to make a barrier between the ribs and the foil, especially if you like to use B-B-Q sauce. the foil is reactive and the paper prevents sticking and any adverse foil-acid reaction.
 Unfold the foil, then return it to the oven, raise the temperature to 375F / 190C degrees and allow to cook 10 to 15 more minutes. This will allow the ribs to brown and will cook off some of the juices in the pan.

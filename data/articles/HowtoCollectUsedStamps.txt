 Look in the trash or recycling bin for envelopes with stamps attached. Ask your parents, siblings (beware of rivalry!), neighbors, relatives, and friends to give you their stamps. Rip a section of the envelope with the stamp attached. Do not remove the stamp from the envelope at this point.;
, Prepare a cup of warm water. Be sure that it is not hot, which will cause the stamp to be damaged. Submerge the envelope sections with the stamps attached for 30 minutes or so.
 After a period of time, the stamps should separate from the envelopes with ease. If the stamps refuse to come off, soak for a longer period of time. Some stamps are naturally harder to remove than others. Be very careful here!

, Carefully remove superficial water by drying the stamps with a paper towel. When doing this, do not wipe the stamps for obvious reasons; press the towel to the stamps instead.
 Arrange the stamps on a sheet of paper. Stack additional layers of paper above and below this original layer. Place a textbook on top of this arrangement. Let the stamps dry completely for a couple of hours. In short, press the stamps as if you were pressing leaves.
 Purchase a stamp album to hold your stamps. (I personally do not have an album, so I store my stamps in small homemade envelopes. For example, each unique type of stamp has its own envelope. I use a larger envelope (based on year) to contain these small envelopes.)

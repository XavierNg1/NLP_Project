 Insomnia or changes in sleep patterns may cause headaches.Insufficient sleep can also increase stress, cause mood swings, and impair concentration. The average adult needs at least 6–8 hours of sleep., Mental stress is one of the main causes of tension headaches. Studies have shown that exercise reduces levels of the body’s stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. It also stimulates the production of endorphins — a chemical in the brain that is the body’s natural painkiller and mood elevator.A daily 30–45 minute workout with moderate exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or a 15–20 minute vigorous workout with exercises such as weight training, hiking, and competitive sports is recommended., Alcohol, especially beer, can trigger cluster and chronic migraine headaches. Passive smoking, secondhand smoke, and other forms of nicotine (chewing gums or tablets) should be avoided as they may trigger severe headaches. Smoking can also irritate nasal passages during a cold causing sinus headaches.People with a history of migraine or cluster headaches should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol completely as these headaches are associated with dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. If you experience suicidal thoughts, call 911 or seek medical help immediately.

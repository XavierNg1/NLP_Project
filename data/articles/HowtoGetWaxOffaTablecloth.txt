 The easiest way to do this is fold the tablecloth with the wax on the outside top layer and put the entire cloth in the freezer. Or, you can fill a bag with ice and place the ice pack on top of the wax while the cloth is still laid out on the table.;
, If the tablecloth is made of lace use extra care not to tear the lace material while scraping the wax.



Place paper towels or pieces of brown paper bag on both sides of the stained area. If you use a paper bag, be sure to choose one that does not have any writing on it.
Set your iron to warm or medium and iron over the paper. Do not use steam while ironing. The heat from the iron will cause the remaining wax to melt off of the tablecloth and soak into the paper.
Repeat the ironing process if necessary using fresh paper towels or brown paper bags. Keep changing the paper and repeating the ironing until all wax is removed.
Launder the tablecloth as usual once all the wax is gone.

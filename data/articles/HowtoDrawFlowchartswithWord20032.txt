 Hover over connectors and choose the style that you want to insert. You can choose between straight, crooked, or curved.


Each connector can have arrows pointing towards either end of the line.
 Place your cursor on the edge of the first shape. Click and drag the connector towards the next shape in the sequence. Word will attempt to automatically connect the line to a designated spot on the second shape.


Once the shapes are connected, you can move them around the canvas and they will stay connected.
 If you are using a crooked or curved connector, you can move the path of the connector around. Click on the connector to select it. A point will appear halfway through the connector that you can click and drag. This will move the connector line around.


You can move the end points of a connector in a similar manner, by selecting the line and then clicking and dragging the end point to a new connection.
 In the Drawing toolbar, click the Text Box button. Click and drag your cursor to create a text box anywhere on the canvas. Place the text box near the arrow that you want to label.


Enter your text into the text box, you can format it the same way you would any text in Word.
To remove the Text Box border, right-click on the border of the box and select Format Text Box. In the Line section, click on the Color dropdown menu and select No Line.
 Once everything is connected, follow the flowchart from beginning to end to make sure that it reads well and that it makes sense. Make any adjustments that you need to regarding shape placement and connections so that your flowchart is easily understood.

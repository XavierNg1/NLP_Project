 Cats are natural hunters and need to release their aggression. Sometimes cats choose to do that by attacking other pets or their owners. Prevent that reaction in your cat by giving them toys that allow them to chase and attack in a safe way.The novelty of the new toy should entice your cat. It may have become bored with its old toys, leading it to choose your dog as a plaything instead.
 Since your cat needs to chase and attack, feathered toys are a great option to stimulate and release those urges. If your cat has a particular affinity for your dog’s tail, then toys with feathers can help divert that urge.Toys with strings or ribbons are not advisable, as your cat can accidentally swallow the string. This can cause intestinal obstructions or other internal damage.
 If your cat has plenty of toys but still likes to pounce on the dog instead, try rubbing the toys with catnip. The catnip will draw your cat to the toys instead of your dog.Rub a few toys at a time with catnip to avoid overwhelming your cat.
Make sure that you wash your hands after using catnip; otherwise, you may accidentally rub catnip onto the dog.
 Cats need to run and play, so help your cat work off its aggression by getting in plenty of activity.Play interactive games with your cat with a feathered toy or laser pointer.
Get your cat toys that allow it to chase, such as electronic mice.
Provide your cat with a cat tower that allows it to climb.
 Some cats naturally have their innate hunter triggered by watching the outside world. If your cat becomes worked up by experiences like watching birds outside, then you may need to block out the windows with curtains, blinds, or even taped on window covers, such as newspaper or foil.Keep your cat away from your dog while it’s struggling with redirected aggression. During this time, you may also be vulnerable to scratches or bites.

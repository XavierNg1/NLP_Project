 Before you can fix the problem, you need to know what it is. Since your parents are the ones who want to give away your dog, they’ll probably be able to tell you what your dog is doing wrong. Be respectful when you bring up the issue. Your parents will be more likely to hear you out if you appear mature.Approach your parents at a time when they’re free to talk, such as during dinner. Say, “I know you’ve been wanting to give away my dog and I was hoping we could talk about it.”
Be specific with your questions. For example, instead of asking, “Why don’t you love my dog?”, ask, “What problems are my dog causing that makes you think we need to get rid of her?”;
, If you spend a lot of time with your dog, you’re in a good position to notice any issues your dog has been having. Chances are, if you notice the problem, others have too. It’s also possible that your dog only acts badly in specific situations, such as when it’s around other dogs.Ask yourself whether your dog has been acting differently lately.
Think of how many times your dog has been aggressive or pooped in the house.
You can also evaluate your dog’s behavior by putting your dog in potentially stressful situations, like being around other dogs. Take your dog to the park and see how it reacts to other dogs.
 If your dog has been acting out of sorts, they might be sick or have some other problem. A vet will be able to tell you exactly what is wrong and what you need to do to fix it.Bring up the possibility of a visit to a vet with your parents. Tell your parents that you’re concerned that your dog might be sick or injured in some way.
If your parents think going to the vet is an unnecessary expense, tell them you’ll pay for it out of your allowance. This will show them how important your dog is to you.

 Dishwasher drains can be blocked by excessive food, and food left on plates can remain stuck even after going through a cycle. If your home has a dishwasher then, after the initial rinsing and before scrubbing have your child assist you in loading the dishwasher. Instruct your child on how to maximize space in the dishwasher by lining up plates properly.
Make sure that plates are not placed too close together, otherwise they may not get clean.
For older children who can handle sharp objects, teach them that sharp knives should be placed so that they always face downward.
 Soap is usually added to a dishwasher on the inside of the door, though this varies from model to model. It is important to instruct your child how to close and lock the dishwasher door properly after loading. The plate racks need to be pushed in before the door is closed. Once the doors are closed and locked, show your child how to run with wash cycle.
 Once the dishwasher has finished cleaning the plates, show your child how he or she can tell that the cleaning has stopped. The is usually indicated by a light or beeping noise. From there, you can show your child how to unload the clean plates, glasses, pots and pans. Help your child put the clean objects back where they belong, and celebrate a job well done together.

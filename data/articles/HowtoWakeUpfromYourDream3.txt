 Once you are able to achieve lucid dreaming, you may not feel the need to wake up any longer because you can change the dream into something less uncomfortable. Lucid dreaming, however, is different for everyone, and it may not be especially easy for you to change your dreamâ€”it may require practice. Nevertheless, once you have realized you are in a dream, you might be able to change things that are happening, and remove whatever is scary and making you want to wake up. This may be better than fully waking yourself up.


Once you are lucid in the dream, you should be able to control the dream. You will have more control if you become more aware of the dream world, so pay attention to your surroundings., One very straightforward way of changing the dream is by simply doing what is is you want to do. The difference, of course, is that you are in a dream, so the constraints of the real world do not apply. A common way of testing this out is to produce a brick wall and put your hand through it. Doing so is a good test of your ability to control the dream, and the realization that you are in control can empower you to change dreams that are making you uncomfortable., Another way of exercising control over the dream if you are dreaming lucidly is by voicing your desires. Try saying whatever it is you want to change about the dream, and you may see results. For instance, if you are being chased, try saying that there is no one chasing you, and you may succeed in making whom or whatever is chasing you vanish. In whatever situation you may find yourself in the dream, voicing your desire to change it may work for you.

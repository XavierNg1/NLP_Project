 If you donâ€™t know what your operating system we can help you out. Once you log into the machine, go to the Start Menu (circle orb button with the Windows Logo) on the bottom left and click to open the menu. Then, look for the Computer button and right click on the button. A menu should appear with choices including the properties menu. Select that choice and a window will open with general information that will tell what the operating system is on the computer. Now you know what you are working with because these instructions are designed for Windows Vista, not an earlier Windows operating systems. You can close the window with the X button on the upper right corner of the window.;
, Look for the Computer button and left click the icon. The Computer Window opens up with all the hard drives/storage drives available on the computer.
 Usually named Local Disk (C:), but could be named something else or has a different drive letter. If that is the case, ask the person that renamed the drive. Once the window opens it will show all the files and folders on the hard drive.
 A window with folders for each person that has log into the computer will appear.
 This folder is associated with the login name. Double click the folder to open the folder. You are now in the folder where Windows saves your files and settings according to your login name (also called a profile or account).
 All these folders do not need to be copied; only the folders that you want to back up. These behind the scenes folders contain the files located on your Desktop, Documents folder, and Favorites in Internet Explorer. Figure out which folders you want to back up to an external device.
 External Hard Drive, Jump/Flash/USB Drive, Burnable CD/DVD, server, etc are examples. Make sure the location is big enough to hold the amount of information you are backing up. If you need help, I suggest you find instructions for the external media of your preference.

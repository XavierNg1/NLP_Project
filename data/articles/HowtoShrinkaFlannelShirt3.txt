 Smooth out the flannel shirt flat on the floor. Place a button up shirt that fits you well over the flannel shirt. Tuck one of the well-fitting shirt’s sleeves all the way into the armhole so you can see the seam that connects it to the body.Make sure to smooth out wrinkles and get the shirts as flat as you can.
 Grab a pair of fabric shears or sharp scissors. Using the well-fitting shirt as a guide, trim off the baggy flannel shirt’s sleeves, trim away their excess fabric, and remove the extra fabric from the sides of the shirt’s body.Use the seam between the well-fitting shirt’s body and sleeve to help you create a new armhole in your flannel shirt.
Be careful when using scissors and other sharp tools. If necessary, get help or supervision from a parent.
 Spread out your well-fitting shirt and look at the seam that connects the sleeve to the body. You should be able to make out an “S” shape. Use the “S” shape to help you cut the flannel shirt’s sleeves so you can sew them back into your new armholes., Turn the flannel shirt inside out so you can sew its new side seams. Then turn the sleeves inside out and sew them back together. You can hand sew or use a sewing machine, depending on your preferences., Leave the shirt inside out, but turn the sleeves right side out. Slide a sleeve cuff-first all the way into the appropriate armhole (either left or right), then match up the edges of the shoulder side of the sleeve with the armhole. Pin them together, sew to create the new shoulder seam, then repeat on the other sleeve.

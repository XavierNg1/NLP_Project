, If you think the way people treat you is okay, then you don't think you have low standards. Here are some ways to know if your standards are low:


If you keep repeating that is how she or he is, then it shows fear of asking what you really want and what you really deserve
When you let a friend etc, talk to you harshly. When they criticise you without suggesting ways you can improve . They want to make you feel they have control over you, since they are "better than you,"
They never hear out your opinion.When you're upset, they always think you are a drama queen, roll their eyes and walk off without caring. They think your opinion has no value.
 Write down a list of where your standards are low and focus on them

, Realise who you really are. People with low standards usually want to hang out in a group for a little comfort, don't know how to be original and most of the time lose their identity in fear of losing others


What are your talents. Work on them
Why not visit somewhere where your mind can be cleared. Whether it be local or another country
Why not try something new. It can be simple as reading a different type of book or taking up a new instrument, whatever suits you best. It can turn out to be an awesome experience!

, Add people who make you feel good, and think positively about yourself. After all, it all starts in the mind the way you see yourself.
 Like stated before, you can go visit a new country, but you can also do so much more. Go out in the countryside, climb a valley, a mountain, go climb Mount Everest if that has always been your dream. Smile, and see how wonderful the world is out there.
 Even with your failures and flaws you are still an amazing person. Don't let anyone change your mind!

 You will be covering the wreath ring with newspaper leaves, so consider using a template that you either download from the Internet. Or, you could even locate a few fallen leaves outside and use them as your inspiration for the template.


Add a pop of color on your wreath by cutting out colorful tissue paper leaves to weave intermittently through the wreath.
 This dry run allows you to see if you like the design and to check you have enough leaves to cover the wreath.
 Just a dab of glue on the leaf base will secure and hold the leaf in place.

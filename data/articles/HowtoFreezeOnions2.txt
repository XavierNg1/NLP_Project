 Prepare the onions by trimming off the top and the bottom with a sharp knife. Next, remove the papery skin by peeling it off. Use the knife to chop the onions to the size that you prefer., Fill a large stockpot with water, and place it on the stove. Set the burner to high, and allow the water to come to a full boil, which should take approximately 10 to 20 minutes depending on how much water you’re using.The amount of water that you should boil depends on how many onions you’re blanching. For every pound (373 g), use 1 (3.8 l) gallon of water.
 Once the water has come to a boil, place the onions in the pot. Cover the pot, and allow the onions to cook for 3 to 7 minutes, depending on how many you’re blanching.The more onions that you’re blanching, the longer you should leave them in the boiling water.
With chopped onions, it’s easier to place them in a wire basket or perforated metal strainer and then set them in the boiling water. That way, you can quickly and easily remove them when they’re done. If you don’t have a basket or strainer, remove them from the boiling water with a slotted spoon.
 As soon as you remove the onions from the boiling water, place them in a bowl of ice or cold water. Let the onions sit in the cold water for the same amount of time that you boiled them to stop the cooking process.The ice or cold water that you place the onions in after boiling shouldn’t be more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).
While the onions are in the cold water, stir them several times to ensure that they’re cooling evenly.
 When the onions have cooled long enough, drain them thoroughly in a colander. Shake well to remove the excess water, and blot with a clean towel. When they’re dry, transfer them to freezer bags and place them in the freezer.Be sure to label the freezer bag with the date so you can keep track of how long the onions are in your freezer.

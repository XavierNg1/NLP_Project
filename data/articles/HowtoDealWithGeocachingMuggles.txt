 There are four basic types of muggles, and some pose more of a threat than others. These types are:



The Oblivious Muggle: Muggles that are just going about their daily life and will pay you and the Geocache no attention.

The Lingerer: This muggle is going about their daily life and doesn't care about Geocaching, but they will linger in the spot right near the Geocache for long periods of time.

The Semi-Curious Muggle: Muggles whose curiosity is aroused when they see you Geocaching. Be prepared for them to come over and ask you what you're doing.

The Whistle Blower: These are the most dangerous type of muggles, as they will come over and pester you about what you're doing or call the police on you because of your 'suspicious' actions. They may also come over and attempt to find the Geocache after you've left.;
, Avoid suspicious actions, such as constantly looking over your shoulder, or huddling over your GPS in heavily populated areas. These actions will draw attention to yourself, and a muggle is bound to either call the police or ask you what you're doing.
 If there are too many people around, or there are a few "lingerers" in the area, leave and come back later. Go get a coffee or go home for a couple hours, and then come back at a time where the area would be less populated so you can search for the Geocache then.
 If you need to dig around in the dirt, drop something and dig through the dirt to pick it up. If a muggle is approaching, put your GPS to your ear and pretend that it's a cell phone.
 If a muggle comes over and asks you what you're doing, just admit that you're Geocaching. If they're interested, explain to them what Geocaching is, and tell them to look up the Geocaching online.

 It is important that your horse is hydrated while on the road and while stabled at show locations. Give your horse fresh, clean water every two hours while you are traveling to a show. While stabled at the show, fresh water should be available around the clock. Offer your horse water between events or classes.Horses should drink 8-30 gallons of water per day, depending on activity level and climate.
 Sometimes horses are reluctant to drink water away from home. The water can smell or taste different due to locale and chlorination. If you are traveling to a trail ride, show, or event, consider bringing along water from home. This will help ensure your horse remains hydrated during the time it is away from home. You can transport the water in a large water tank that will fit in the back of a truck., If your horse is reluctant to drink water away from home, consider adding a flavoring agent to it. A few days before travel, begin flavoring your horse’s water at home. This will help ease your horse into drinking flavored water while on the road. Just make sure the flavoring doesn’t contain caffeine or other additives that might trigger a drug test.Wintergreen and vanilla are good flavoring choices.
You can also use apple juice or molasses, but both will add sugar to your horse’s diet.
Always offer your horse a bucket of plain water alongside the flavored water.
 Dehydration and extreme heat can occur during show season, disrupting your horse’s electrolyte balance. Add dissolvable electrolytes to your horse’s water at least a week before the show. Make sure you offer a bucket of plain water alongside the supplemented water.You can also deliver electrolytes to your horse through the mouth with a syringe.
Powdered electrolytes can be fed to the horse as a dressing on grain.

 A website's written address is used for easy access by visitors, because its numerical (IP) address may change on a regular basis. When you enter the website's written address, your browser contacts a DNS server to find the current numerical address for the site. Your "hosts" file allows you to override the results of a DNS lookup. You can block websites using the "hosts" file by redirecting a website address to a blank page on your local computer.
 You'll need to use the Terminal utility to access the "hosts" file. You can find the Terminal in the Utilities folder.
 Enter your administrator password when prompted. You need administrator access in order to edit the "hosts" file. This command will open the "hosts" file in a text editor.
 You can add a new line for each website that you want to block

, This will tell your computer that the following website should be redirected to 127.0.0.1, which is a local blank page.
 You don't need to include the http:// part of the address. For example, to block YouTube type the following:


127.0.0.1 www.youtube.com

, You can reroute as many websites as you'd like to 127.0.0.1 by creating new lines for each. Make sure that each line starts with 127.0.0.1.
 Your changes will be saved and the file editor will be closed.
 This will clear the DNS cache and make the new rules take effect. You may need to enter your administrator password.
 Anyone that knows the administrator password can make changes to the "hosts" file. Make sure that each user logs into the Mac with a standard account, and that only you know the administrator password.

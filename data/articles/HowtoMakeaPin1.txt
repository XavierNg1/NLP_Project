 Aim for something that is about 1 inch by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters by 2.54 centimeters). If necessary, resize the image using an image editing program or a photocopier.;
, You will need this excess material to wrap around the back of your pin.
 The cardboard will make the base for your pin. The colored paper will make the back. The colored paper can be solid-colored, or it can have an interesting pattern.
 Turn the image over so that the back is facing you. Spread a thin layer of glue onto it. You can use a glue stick or school glue. If you are using school glue, you might want to apply it with a paintbrush.
 Try to center the cardboard as much as possible. You should have a Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) border all around the cardboard.
 Start with the corners first. Once you have them glued down, fold all four side over onto the back of the cardboard. This will give you some nice, folded seams.
 Coat the paper with glue, then press it onto the back of the cardboard. You can use a glue stick or school glue for this. If you are using school glue, you might want to apply it using a paintbrush.
 You can use any sort of finish you like: matte or glossy; glossy, however, will look the best. Paint the front first, let it dry, then do the back. This will "seal" your pin and protect it.


If you are using a decoupage glue, you may need to apply 3 to 4 layers. Let each layer dry before you apply the next one.
Acrylic sealers come in brush-on and spray-on form.
 Draw a line of hot glue across the back of the pin. Quickly press the back of the pin down into the glue.

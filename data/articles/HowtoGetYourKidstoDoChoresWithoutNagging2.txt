 You wouldn’t expect your toddler to wash and fold clothing, and you also know that your teenager is capable of doing more than just making the bed. Selecting chores that are age-appropriate is key, as you don’t want your children getting frustrated or bored because tasks are either too difficult or too easy.


As your children get older, increase the amount of chores and their complexity. For instance, grade school kids can help to match socks, place clothing in the hamper, and feed the pets. Older kids can do dishes, laundry, and help keep the house tidy., Children, especially those that are younger, often learn better by watching how the task is completed, rather than just hearing verbal directions. Therefore, in addition to hearing you explain the procedure, show them, as well., A majority of children thrive on schedules and routines, and chore-completion is no exception. The more you are able to attach chores to an already existing routine, the more likely your children are to complete them without arguments.For instance, have child son walk the dog right when they gets home from school, before they become involved in another activity. That way you can prevent them from getting upset when they have to stop a favored activity to complete the chore.
 If your children tend to put off doing chores, set a timer to only give them a certain amount of time to get it done. If they don’t complete the task in 20 minutes, for example, they don’t get allowance or rewarded for doing chores.Setting a timer may also help motivate your children, as having to get the chores completed within time constraints may feel like a game. Say something like “The timer’s set for 20 minutes. Jump on those dishes!” to motivate your children.

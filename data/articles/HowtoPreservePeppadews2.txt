 Use a sharp knife to cut off the stem end of each peppadew. Dig out the seeds with a small spoon.


Place the peppadews in a large mixing bowl after seeding them.
 Boil 3 or 4 cups (750 or 1000 ml) of water in a kettle, then pour the boiling water over the peppadews. Allow the peppadews to soak for 10 minutes.


After soaking the peppadews, pour the contents of the bowl through a colander. Allow the peppadews to sit in the colander for another 2 to 4 minutes to ensure that they drain well.
 Place the mustard seeds, allspice berries, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, ground ginger, crushed bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, and cloves in a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake well to combine evenly.You can replace this blend of pickling spices with your own or with a commercially prepared mix, if desired.
 Combine 1 cup (250 ml) of water with the vinegar, sugar, and pickling spice mix in a large saucepan. Heat on the stove over medium-high until the mixture reaches a boil.


Even though distilled white vinegar is recommended, a wine vinegar, malt vinegar, or spirit vinegar would also work.
 Place the prepared peppadews in the boiling pickling liquid. Continue boiling the contents of the saucepan for another 15 minutes.


Boil the peppadews uncovered.
Stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally to ensure even cooking.
 Spoon the peppadews into prepared canning jars and pour the pickling liquid over them.


Use half-pint (250-ml) or pint (500-ml) jars. Do not use quart (1-L) jars.
Leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar.
Stir or poke the contents of each jar with a spoon or skewer to release any trapped air bubbles.
If you are using more than one jar, make sure that you distribute the peppadews and pickling liquid evenly within both jars.
 You can process the peppadews in a boiling water canner, but a pressure canner is recommended.


For dial gauge pressure canners, process the jars for 35 minutes under 12 lbs (82 KPa) of pressure when at an altitude between 0 and 2000 ft (0 and 610 m). Add an extra 1 lb (7 KPa) of pressure for each additional 2000 ft (610 m) in altitude.
For weighted gauge pressure canners, process the jars for 35 minutes under 15 lbs (102 KPa) of pressure when at an altitude of 1000 ft (305 m) or below. Add an extra 5 lbs (35 KPa) of pressure when the altitude exceeds 1000 ft (305 m).
When using a water canner:

Process the jars for 10 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 ft (0 and 305 m).
Process the jars for 15 minutes at altitudes between 1001 and 6000 ft (306 and 1830 m).
Process the jars for 20 minutes at altitudes above 6000 ft (1830 m).


Let the canner cool until it depressurizes, then slowly open the lid. Remove the jars with a jar lifter and place them on dry dish towels. Let cool for 12 to 24 hours at room temperature.
Sealed (indented) jars are ready for storage. Jars that did not seal properly should be stored in the refrigerator and used within several weeks.
 Store the sealed pickled peppadews for at least 2 to 3 weeks before enjoying. Waiting at least this long will improve the flavor.


No matter where you store the peppadews, the storage temperature of unopened peppadews should remain at or below 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24.1 degrees Celsius) to maintain the best level of quality.
An opened jar should be stored in the refrigerator.

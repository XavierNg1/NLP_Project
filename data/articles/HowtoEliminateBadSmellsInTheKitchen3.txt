 The sour smell of the vinegar will only last 10 to 15 minutes before it starts to eliminate the odors. Leave the bowls for 6 to 12 hours for best results.
 Fill a saucepan with 1 part water and 1 part vinegar. Place orange and lemon peels in the water to create a more pleasant scent.


Simmer the mixture for 1 to 2 hours. Turn off the stove and allow the pot to sit overnight. Dispose of the mixture in the morning.

 Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Grab a clean large bowl and a small saucepan.;
, In the large bowl, stir together oats, brown sugar, wheat germ, coconut, nuts, and both seeds. Break apart any clumps in the mixture. Everything should be well mixed and separated. To ensure this, stir by scooping under the mixture with a spoon and dumping it on top.
 In the small saucepan, heat canola oil, honey, and vanilla. Stir slowly with a wooden spoon until the edges start to bubble. Pour the hot mixture over the granola bits. Mix thoroughly. Again, break apart any clumps.
 Grease two 10x15 inch baking pans. Spread the granola mixture evenly between the two pans. Bake 20-30 minutes, sometimes stopping to stir the mixture. The granola should be crispy and the coconut should be lightly browned.
 Remove from the oven and cool. Stir it until the pan is cool enough to touch. Store it in an airtight container. This type of granola can also be frozen for later use.

 Credit card companies will look more closely at your income when you have a bankruptcy on your credit report. They want to be sure you can afford credit card payments.


Although a lot of people think they can't afford not to have a credit card, getting behind on credit card payments is a very easy way to slide into debt. Be very cautious about applying for new lines of credit right after bankruptcy.
 It is common for a consumer to be deluged with offers for credit cards immediately after bankruptcy. The terms are often harsh, so make sure you review the offers carefully. If you can't find an offer you like, check with a local bank or check online.


Credit card companies will market aggressively to you for two reasons. First, you can't declare bankruptcy again for eight years after you've filed for bankruptcy. Second, they know you are debt-free. A debt-free consumer who has to pay a high-interest rate is very profitable.Even if you have a higher credit limit on an unsecured card, racking up more debt at a high interest might not be the wisest choice. Consider your options carefully.
 An unsecured card means you are borrowing money from the credit card company, and they need to protect their risk in lending you that money.


The typical interest rate for any credit card is about 15%. An interest rate for someone with bad credit is usually about 22% â€” stay away from anything much higher than that., This will raise your credit rating, which will allow you to get lower interest rates and higher credit limits in the future.


Use between 10 percent and 25 percent of your available credit, because banks have determined that those with the best credit typically use no more than 20% of their available credit limits. If your limit is $500, carry a balance that is no more than $100.

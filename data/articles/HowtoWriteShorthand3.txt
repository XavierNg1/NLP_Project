 There are many books available on how to teach yourself shorthand. These can be found in bookstores, libraries, or online.
 Go through the entire alphabet and learn the symbol for each letter or sound, depending on which type of shorthand you are studying.
 Since shorthand requires a lot of memorization, flashcards will serve as a great tool to help you remember which symbol represents which letter, word, or sound.
 These were designed by professionals to help you learn quickly and thoroughly.
 Until you have completely memorized the shorthand alphabet, practicing writing it will help you build intuition and understand the language more deeply than simply using flashcards alone.
 Just as with any other language, reading and understanding shorthand will improve your ability to write it.
 Using the flashcards you have made, ask a friend to test you on your knowledge.

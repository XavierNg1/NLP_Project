 There are three kinds of Ponds in the game: the Mosquito pond, the Frog pond and the Eel pond. The first two kinds are readily available on the surface, while the third is exclusive only to the Ruins portion of the underground. Frog ponds are more common and found in more places than the Mosquito ponds, and they spawn Frogs during the daytime. Meanwhile, Mosquito ponds are found in the Marshes and spawn Mosquitos during dusk and nighttime.


For visual differences, Frog ponds have a green border, Mosquito ponds have a purple border, and Eel ponds have bright green water.;
, Following the trail of a cobblestone road or a dirt path is often the most reliable way to get anywhere in the game. Oftentimes, they would lead you to places like Pig Villages or Things. More often, though, they tend to lead you towards a pond or even a large cluster of ponds!

, Forests are one of the places you can find Ponds in. You can usually find them scattered near the trees. They’re a bit uncommon though and are generated one at a time. With the addition of the multiple trees making your view limited, it can be tricky to search in the Forest.
 Ponds are a bit easier to find in the Grasslands, and not only because they have less trees blocking the view. Ponds spawn more often and tend to cluster around each other in the Grasslands, making it one of the surest areas to search when looking for your Ponds.
 If you’re exploring during the day, you can usually hear the Frogs croaking and wandering about a short distance before encountering any ponds. Frogs spawn during the day and tend to wander around the area near their ponds, and then retreat during dusk. Be careful, though! Frogs are aggressive, pesky little buggers, and they tend to knock away things from your inventory whenever they attack. You can always pick your stuff back up, but it would leave you vulnerable to more Frog attacks, so watch yourself if you plan on looking for Ponds!

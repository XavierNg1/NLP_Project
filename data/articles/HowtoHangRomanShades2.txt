 An exterior mount is when you hang your roman shades outside of your window frame, typically by attaching them directly to the wall slightly above the window. Select windows that have a sturdy frame that can bear weight.
 Place your blinds above the window frame in the location you want them to hang. Use a carpenters pencil to mark this location on the wall; the edge of the brackets should be flush to the edge of the window frame. Typically the location of these brackets is located about 3-inches in from each edge of the shades, but there may be more based on the overall size of your shades. If there are multiple loose brackets, space them evenly over the top of the shade.


Always check to make sure that your shades are level prior to marking the location of the brackets.
If you prefer, you can simply measure the overall size of the shades and use this measurement to estimate the location of the brackets.
 Use the brackets and screws that came with your roman shades for installation. Place each bracket on the marked location on the wall, so that the part that sticks out from the wall is at the top. Use the screws to attach the brackets to the wall; you’ll normally need two screws per bracket. Installation of the brackets will differ slightly between brands of roman shades, so follow the specific directions that came with yours.
 The top of the roman shades should have flat brackets that click into place with the brackets you’ve attached to the wall. Carefully slip the roman shades in, so that the brackets at the top click together. Pull on the cord that adjusts the shades, to verify that the shades are secure and functional.

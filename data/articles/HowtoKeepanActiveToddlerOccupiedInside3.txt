 Pipe cleaners are available at craft stores, they come in different colors and lengths that you can use to make different things from flowers, to houses, to cars, to shapes and letters, which you can then just glue on cardboard.


If you want, you can have these framed and hung on your child’s bedroom wall for decoration.
 Allow you toddler to draw on some white porcelain cups or mugs with colored permanent markers. Get them to doodle your name, their dad’s name, their own name, or even the pet’s name so it becomes personalized.
 Collect smooth stones of different shapes and sizes and ask your toddler to paint them. After the paint is dry, you can paste on a pair of wobbly eyes and attach pipe cleaners to make little critters out of these stones.
 Felt cloth is so versatile that you can use it as a base for a project or as the main component of a project.


You can cut out shapes from felt cloth, such us petals and leaves and stems to make a flower, or stars, moons and clouds to make an evening scene.
Only you and your child’s imagination sets the limit to what you can do.
 Just use pipe cleaners, felt cloth, wobbly eyes, some colored paper and let your imagination run wild.
 Toddlers can do this while it’s raining outside (or even on sunny days). Just make sure to let them know that they are only allowed to draw on the windows - the walls are off limits.


Make sure to only stock up on white board markers because the last thing you want is for your toddler to use permanent markers by mistake.

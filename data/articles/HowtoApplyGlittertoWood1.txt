, Glitter has a reputation for making a mess so you’ll want to make a glitter station that is easy to clean. Ideally, you could work outside so you don’t have to worry about cleaning glitter from carpet or your furniture. For your glitter station, you’ll need to select the products that you want to use for your project. Use a cardboard box if you are working with larger pieces of wood. You can use a paper plate for smaller projects., The wooden item that you want to add glitter to can be in a variety of shapes in sizes. Sanded and smooth wood will allow the glitter to adhere evenly, though you can use non-sanded wood to create a more rugged design.


You can sand the wood using a piece of fine-grained sand paper if you desire.
 You can section off areas of the wooden object to create glitter designs. If you intend to add glitter to the entirety of the wooden object, there is no need to do this. You will use clear tape to section off areas of the object that you do not want to glitter.


You can use adhesive stencils to create designs with the glitter.
You could use stickers to leave certain shapes un-glittered, like a heart or a star.

 Train strength to level 3 on the island.;
, Buy an Iron Scimitar and a Kite Shield.
 Train your player on the cows until you have reached about 20 in strength. Collect all cow hides and deposit them in your bank. You will need to make trips back and forth to complete this step.
 Go back to the cow fields. Train strength again until you reach level 40.
 Nice players will usually let you kill them to train. Do this until you've reached about 50 strength.
, Go for archers with low range and other people with Adamant Scimitar. Since other level 40 players stats are about 30 attack, 30 strength, and 30 defense you can hit way higher numbers than they can. Go for them when looking for your targets! If they have Adamant Armour, make sure you have food because it will take a while to kill them. This is due to the fact that they are defense "noobs" and makes it harder for you to hit them. Stay away from those with full Rune Armor until you increase your strength. Also remember you can't wear any decent armor since you haven't trained any experience into defence therefore the best armor for that is to wear some leather or low level mail. Also remember when you are dueling or killing enemies to switch your form of attack to strength as your strength proficiency will certainly help you in any situation, but be careful strength pkers are very common in this era of runescape, not to mention the other form of pure killers such as archers, defence and some magicians. Perhaps it would b a good idea to train your attack level to improve the weapon you can wield.

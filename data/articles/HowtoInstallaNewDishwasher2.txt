 At the top of the dishwasher counter flange, you will find some screws. Unscrew them with the screwdriver to remove them.
 Now pull out the bottom cover.
 At the end of the wires, attach wire nuts. Now remove the wires from the terminal screws and tuck them out of the way.
 Find out where the water supply is, usually under the washer.
 Disconnect the water supply line from the water inlet by removing the nut.
 Loosen the clamp and remove the hose to disconnect the drain hose from beneath the sink.
 After disconnecting all the attachments, place a blanket in front of the old dishwasher, slowly lift up the old dishwasher and put it onto the blanket.
 Keep a towel ready with you because in this process of lifting up the old dishwasher and putting it onto the blanket, some water may spill out. If it happens, just wipe it with the towel.
 Now that you have removed the old dishwasher, clean the area where the old dishwasher was placed and where you have to install the new one.

 Precursor is the material that you use to make the carbon fiber. Almost all carbon fiber is made from a polyacrylonitrile precursor. You should dissolve the polyacrylonitrile in an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide., Once the precursor is dissolved, you put it in a coagulation bath. Then, run the slush through a spinneret. The material is forced through the fine holes of the spinneret to create long strands., Oxygen is needed to crosslink the polymers and make them more suitable for fibers. To oxidize the strands, heat them in an oxidation oven that ranges from 200 °C (392 °F) to 300 °C (572 °F). You must maintain appropriate airflow during this process to avoid catching the strands on fire., Once oxidized, the strands must be heated in an oxygen free environment. Since there is no oxygen, the strands will not burn. Instead, they undergo a process called pyrolysis, which removes almost all impurities, such as organic solvents. A series of pyrolysis ovens are used that range anywhere from 700 °C (1,292 °F) to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F)., Pyrolysis leaves you with carbon fiber threads. Before being shipped to customers or processing plants, the threads must be treated. This includes etching the fibers with an acid, such as nitric acid. After etching (referred to as treatment) the fiber is coated in a process called sizing. The coating increases the size of the fibers and makes them more sturdy for processing and customer use.

 Within 90 days of receiving your official LLC from the State of California, you will need to submit a Statement of Information to the Secretary of State along with a check for $20. The Statement of Information asks for the following information:The name of the LLC and the company number issued by the California Secretary of State.
The business address and the names and addresses of the chief executive officer and managers.
A general description of the type of business based on business activities.
Name of the agent (if any) designated to accept service of process if the company is sued.
Failure to submit the Statement of Information will incur a $250 fine.
 While this is not required by the state, it is a good idea to put in writing an official operating agreement. This will describe how decisions will be made, what happens if a member of the LLC leaves the business, how profits will be shared, etc.
 If you plan to set up a separate bank account for the LLC you will need an employee identification number from the IRS. The form can be found at Apply for a EIN Number.
 Many cities and counties in California require a license to do business, and permits may be necessary for parking and building occupancy. If you own a building there will be fire safety regulations to follow.


Business license fees may be charged at a flat rate, percentage of gross sales, or a combination of the two.

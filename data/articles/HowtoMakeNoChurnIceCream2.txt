 Add a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk, ½ cup (50 g) of unsweetened natural cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and a pinch of fine salt to a large bowl. Use a whisk to blend the ingredients until they’re completely mixed, and set the bowl aside.It’s normal for the mixture to become very thick as you mix it.
 Add 2 cups (480 ml) of very cold heavy cream to a medium, chilled bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat the cream on medium-high until stiff peaks form, which should take approximately 2 minutes.You can use a stand mixer to whip the cream if you prefer.
 After you’ve whipped the cream, add approximately 1 cup (60 g) of it to the cocoa mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the cream until the mixture is just combined.Be careful not to overmix the whipped cream into the cocoa mixture. You want to maintain the light, airy texture of the cream in the finished mixture.
 Once the cocoa mixture is lightened by the addition of some of the whipped cream, add it to the remaining 1 cup (60 g) of whipped cream. Fold the cocoa mixture into the cream until they are well blended., After the ice cream mixture is fully blended, transfer it to a chilled 9-by-5-by-3-inch (23-by-13-by-8-cm) metal loaf pan and chill it in the freezer for 2 hours or until it has the consistency of soft serve. If desired, add in any mix-ins while the mixture is still soft enough to stir.Cover the loaf pan with a piece of plastic wrap and then foil to ensure that it doesn’t develop any freezer burn.
Some mix-ins to consider for chocolate ice cream include chopped nuts, marshmallows, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or malted milk balls.
 Once you’ve added any mix-ins, put the ice cream back in the freezer. Let it chill for another 3 hours, or until it is completely solid. Scoop it into bowls or cones to serve.Make sure to cover the ice cream with plastic wrap and foil before returning it to the freezer.

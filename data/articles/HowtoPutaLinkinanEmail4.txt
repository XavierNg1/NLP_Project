 While you can't add hyperlinks to an email in the Mail app on iPhone, you can add them to an email written from the desktop iCloud Mail site.


If you aren't already signed into iCloud, enter your Apple ID and password and click â†’.
 It's the blue app with a white envelope icon.
 This button is at the top of the iCloud Mail page. Clicking it will open a new window in which you'll compose your email.
 This will include a recipient's email address in the "To" field, a subject in the "Subject" field (optional), and the email's body text in the area below the "Subject" field.
 It's in the top-right corner of the page.
 Click and drag your cursor across the text in the body that you wish to turn into a link. Doing this will highlight the text.
 It's near the top-right side of the page. Doing so will bring up a window with your highlighted text and a URL field.
 You'll enter the URL in the "URL" field that's below the field with your highlighted text in it.
 Doing so will save the hyperlink. Your website is now linked to the highlighted text. When your recipient opens the email, they'll be able to click the text to open the link.

 You want:


base shade
shadow shade: 1-3 shades darker than your base shade
highlight shade: 1-3 shades lighter than your base shade

, This is creating the basis for your look.
,, Using your ring finger, a lip brush, or a cosmetic sponge, gently blend your lip liners together.


Reapply any of the shades where you may need them, such as the highlight shade to the high points of your lips if any shadow shade smudges up there.
There should be no harsh lines visible.
 Use a setting spray to keep your liner in place. Don't let your lips touch until it has dried!

, This gives a glossy/dewy finish to your lips. Be warned that this could blend the liners more than you wanted!

, Instead of re-applying all shades throughout your day, carry a lipstick on you that matches your base shade to reapply when some of your liner wears off.

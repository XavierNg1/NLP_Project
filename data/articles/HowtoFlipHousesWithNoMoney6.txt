 Even if you do not have a lot of liquid cash to flip a house, you might still have assets that can help you get lines of credit to purchase a low-cost home to flip.Examine your own home, your retirement accounts, and your credit lines to see if any of these can be tapped for a down payment.
 An IRA (Independent Retirement Account) is a retirement vehicle. There are serious tax penalties for withdrawing money before the age of 59.5. However, there are exceptions for first-time homebuyers. You can use up to $10,000 of your IRA to purchase a home. Discuss this option with your financial advisor to make sure that you are using the money properly and that you will not incur penalties.Keep in mind that withdrawing money from your IRA might hurt the long-term growth potential of this retirement account. Beware of the risks involved in diminishing your retirement accounts too early.
 A home equity line of credit (or HELOC) is a potential option for you if you already own a piece of property. A HELOC provides you with a fast source of cash, and you only have to pay interest on the money that you borrow from the HELOC.For example, you might have a HELOC that is worth $75,000. But if you borrow $10,000 of that amount, you only pay interest on the $10,000 amount.Be very careful with your HELOC: if you do not repay your loan in a timely way, you are in danger of losing your home.Be aware that HELOC interest rates might be higher than loans from private lenders.
 Credit cards are another source of quick cash, as long as you plan on paying them off very quickly. The interest rates on credit cards can be very high at 18-20%. However, you are not placing any of your other assets at risk, as you would with a HELOC. You might consider using credit cards for lower-stake purchases during the flipping of a home, such as to purchase building materials from a home goods store.

 Cut a piece of yarn or something similar and drag it around the floor or bed, and watch your cat go crazy after it! This is almost guaranteed a success, since all cats love strings!

, Ever heard of Maru? Cats are in love with boxes and will most likely jump in them, because they seem so fun! Specially if there's a treat waiting in the box.
 This might leave some scratches! Have your hand under a blanket, and wiggle your fingers to make the blanket move. Your cat won't know it's you, and he/she will be acting mad, trying to catch the little "mouse" under the blanket!

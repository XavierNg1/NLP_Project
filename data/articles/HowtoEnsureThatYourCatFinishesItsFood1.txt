 Your cat may avoid eating based on the shape or size of its food bowl. Exactly what your cat doesn't like about a particular food bowl will depend on your cat's specific preferences. Try offering food in a new food bowl that has different features from the first to encourage your cat to start eating more easily.For example, if the original food bowl was large, opt for a smaller one.
Swapping out a rectangular bowl for a circular one can let you know if the shape of the bowl was bothering your cat.;
, Both humans and cats dislike eating out of dirty bowls. Any leftover food can give off smells that will make your cat less likely to eat its food. If your cat's bowl hasn't been cleaned in a while, you can give it a quick wash to help make it more appealing to your cat.You can wash the cat's bowl with soap and water.
Make sure you clean out any old food that may have become stuck to the bowl.
Fully rinse all soap off from the bowl and make sure it is completely dry before using it again.
 The location of the food bowl is important when trying to get your cat to eat more of its food. Cats prefer clean and quiet places to eat, free from loud noises, bad smells and other animals. Check the location of the food bowl and move it if needed to help your cat recover its appetite.Make sure the food bowl is in a quiet place.
Keep the food bowl away from the litter box.

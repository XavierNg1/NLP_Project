 Fabric that does not fray would work the best. Great choices include flannel, fleece, felt, and t-shirt material. What color you pick depends on what turtle you want to be:Donatello = purple
Leonardo = blue
Michelangelo = orange
Raphael = red;
, You want the fabric to be long enough so that you can wrap it around you head, tie it, and have a couple inches leftoverâ€”about 3 feet (0.91 meters). If this is for an adult, start with a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide strip.If this is for a child. start with a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strip., There are two ways you can do this. You can measure the distance between your eyes, and make marks on the mask. You can also drape the mask across your face, and make marks over your eyes with a pen., Spread the mask out on a flat surface. Draw two almond-shaped eyeholes on the mask, right where you made the marks. It is better to start with smaller shapes that you think you might need. Remember, you can always cut the holes bigger if they are too small.
 Make a small slit in the center of each eye, then cut the holes out along the eyes that you drew.
 Be sure to tie the mask behind your head, as the fabric will scrunch up a little. If the eye holes are too small, take the mask off and make them bigger. If the mask is too wide, untie the mask, and cut it narrower., For an added touch, you could cut the ends of the mask at angles. You could even cut notches into the ends to make them more tattered looking.You can also cut a small curve into the top-center and bottom-center of the mask, right between the eyes.

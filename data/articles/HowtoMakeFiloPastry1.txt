 Whisk it up quickly to make sure it is all well mixed and evenly distributed, without chunks., A well is simply a hole in the center of the bowl of flour, which stores the liquids in one place so that you can mix them in gradually.

Warm water will help you maneuver the dough, and start to loosen up the flour proteins. Use the hottest water you can get out of the tap for the best results., If you have a stand mixer, like a Kitchen-Aid, use the paddle attachment for 3-4 minutes. Otherwise, use a wooden spoon to fold the ingredients slowly into one another, working towards your well of liquids to slowly incorporate the flour. The dough should be shaggy, but still one consistent piece.

If the dough is too dry or hard, and you have trouble mixing, add more water in 1-2 tablespoon increments.
If the dough is too wet or soft, add more flour slowly, mixing it all in before adding more.
 This is to help the kneading process. It also helps incorporate some more olive oil into the dough evenly., You want to really put your weight into the dough, working it into a shiny, consistent ball. To knead, pick up a third of the dough ball and fold it to the top of the dough. Then, use the heel of your hand to press this fold down into the center of the dough. Rotate the ball a quarter turn and repeat, pulling up a different third of dough.

About halfway through kneading, flip the dough over and knead from the opposite side.
 You can leave it overnight if you desire. This lets the glutens developed in the flour relax, which will make the dough much smoother and easier to work with without ripping.

 Beware that you may need more than one, depending on what you are putting in there. Things you NEED to put in there include: Your business plan, monthly sales charts, goals for the future, expenses, employee records, etc. The amount of content in your binder will really just depend on you, but usually the more there is, the better it will be. You want to keep track of moves your business makes, and a binder is a great way to keep a record of all these things and more.;
, If keeping your files and papers organized seems like too much of a challenge for you to handle yourself (because there is a good chance of that happening), hire someone (or just get a family member if you don't want to have to pay) to help you and even advise you on how you should arrange all things business. Make sure everything is easily accessible, so if a customer asks a question over the phone or in person, you can quickly grab a file (already knowing where it is) and show it to him/her, instead of him/her waiting, watching you scramble through all your bundles of files.
 Do an organization check every 3-4 days, week, or 2 weeks at max. Go through and check that everything you need is where it is supposed to be, and that everything you don't isn't taking up valuable space. One way to check is to have a friend or co-worker ask where a certain paper is. If you can't find that paper within 7-10 seconds, you may need to rethink your strategy.
 With your new organized business, being an entrepreneur should be a lot easier, and a lot less stressful. Use your organization to your advantage by selling more and taking more action, because now you can keep track of it.

 If you decide to get breast implants, you'll meet with a plastic surgeon to discuss which implants are right for you. You should have a firm idea about what size and shape you want your breasts to be. The doctor will show you examples of how the implants will change your figure and walk you through the surgery process.


Look for a surgeon with plenty of experience and great reviews. You don't want to be the guinea pig for an inexperienced surgeon.
Talk to the doctor about medications you are taking to make sure nothing will interfere with the medicines you'll need to take during and after the surgery.

The surgery typically takes 1-2 hours. Your breasts will be covered with surgical tape, and you may have breast drains during the healing process.

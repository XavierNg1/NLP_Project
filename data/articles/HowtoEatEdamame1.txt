, Sprinkle 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp. of soy sauce over the edamame for a spicy snack.
 To eat the edamame, just put one edamame pod in your mouth, slide out the edamame beans with your teeth, and discard the pods. If you'd rather not do this every time you at edamame, you can remove the beans from the pods first, and then you can place them in a bowl and garnish them with spices of your choice., This edamame will hold in the refrigerator for at least two days.

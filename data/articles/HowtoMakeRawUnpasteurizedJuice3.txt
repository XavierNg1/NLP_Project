 It is important that you remove as much dirt and bacteria as possible by scrubbing the produce under hot water since your juice will be raw and, therefore, untreated., If using a hand juicer this step is likely unnecessary. If using a blender or electric juicer, though, removing the skin from the produce beforehand exposes more of the flesh, making it easier for the machine to squeeze juice out. Likewise, cutting the produce into smaller pieces also exposes more surface around and makes the produce easier to juice., Only add as much to the juicer or blender as you can fit without having to cram it in. If making a juice with multiple fruits and/or vegetables, be sure to include equal parts of each produce into the juice as you work, and combine all the juice into one container to make sure that equal proportions of each produce type are spread throughout the entire large batch., Unless you are using a juicer that strains the juice automatically, like a centrifugal juicer, you will need to separate the pulp from the juice manually. Do so by pushing the juice through a fine mesh metal strainer. For added thoroughness, you can also line the strainer with coffee filters, cheesecloth, or thin muslin cloth.

, Great Britain is a very good choice for players that want to get rich as quickly as possible due to the large number of ports you start out with. Spain also has an advantage because of trade routes and having neighboring countries that possess huge influence (like France).


If you're new to the game, it's best to choose an easier level to give you time to get used to the game system, menus, and features as you go on.
 A window will pop up showing the list of nations within the game, including their attitude toward you, their state religion, and their government type.

 Pirates are a constant threat to trade, so you'll want to ensure that your trade routes are well protected. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing large amounts of potential money.

Build industrial buildings (Metal Works, Pottery, etc.).
Build roads.

 Lunges in the water work much like they do on land. Work in the shallow end, and give yourself enough room to move forward. You'll need at least 10 to 15 feet in front of you to work.Take a large step forward on your right leg. Bend your left knee down, almost touching the floor of the pool.
Your right thigh should be parallel to the floor, and your knee should be at a 90-degree angle.
Keep moving forward, alternating legs.
 Grab a kickboard to use for floating. You can also use a water noodle. Simply grab hold of your flotation device while on your stomach, and kick your way across the pool.You can alternate kicking legs or try a mermaid kick (legs kicking together like a mermaid tail).
You can also do a frog kick, like you use for a breaststroke.
If you prefer, you can hold onto the side of the pool instead., Of course, you can turn to the old standby of swimming laps, which works your whole body at once and helps with back pain. You can swim the breaststroke, backstroke, the crawl, or even the butterfly, whatever you prefer.To make yourself move a little faster, try setting goals for yourself. Just setting goals for how many laps you're going to swim can make you go faster.
Also, listening to music can motivate you without you even realizing it. Try getting waterproof headphones and waterproof cover for your phone or mp3 player.

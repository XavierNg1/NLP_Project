 This beginner technique is sometimes called the "snowplow stop" because it relies more upon angle and stability than finesse. It is less graceful than the "hockey stop," but it will slow you down in a pinch.
 Skate forward on a straightaway, with no big turns coming up. Let yourself glide at a comfortable pace, and wait to stop until you are already slowing down. As you improve, you can practice stopping at faster and faster speeds.


If you feel out of control: don't panic, and don't try to stop right away. Try to find your balance. Wait until you slow down a bit before you try to stop.
 When you are ready to stop, point both of your toe picks inward. Your feet should form an upside-down "V.", Hold your feet at a steady angle as you slow down. The friction of the skates against the ice will gradually bring you to stop. Don't push your feet in toward each other, or you risk twisting your ankle.

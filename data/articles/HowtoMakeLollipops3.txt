, You can use all the same flavor, or mix and match different flavors. The Jolly Ranchers in each group should be touching one another; this way, they will melt together to form a lollipop. Leave about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) between each group to allow for spreading.

For smaller/square lollipops, arrange the Jolly Ranchers in groups of 2.
For larger lollipops/rectangle lollipops, arrange them in groups of 3.
 Don't let them completely melt and turn to liquid, however.To make caramel apple lollipops:Arrange some caramel hard candies on your baking sheet, leaving room for the Jolly Ranchers and lollipop sticks.
Bake them for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are almost melted.
Set down some green sour apple Jolly Ranchers, pressing them against the melted caramel candies.
Bake them for a few minutes more until the Jolly Ranchers melt.
 Give each stick a twist before letting go. Make sure that the sticks go about halfway up the melted Jolly Ranchers., This will take about 25 to 30 minutes.Once the candy is hard, you can wrap it in cellophane.

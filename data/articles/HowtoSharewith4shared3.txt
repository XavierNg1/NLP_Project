 On a new web browser tab, go to 4shared’s website at http://www.4shared.com/ and log in using your registered email address and password.
 4shared’s landing page is your main folder directory for your 4shared files. You can find all your folders and files stored in your 4shared account here.
 Navigate through your 4shared folders by clicking on them until you’re in the folder where the folder you want to share is located.
 Tick the tick box on the folder to select it. The selected folder will be highlighted.
 Click the “Share” button with the link icon on the header toolbar. A small window with the different sharing options will pop up.
 The first option for sharing a folder is the type of access. You can set it to Private Access or Public Access. Select the value from the drop-down list.



Set to Private Access. If you set it to Private Access, only the invited members can access your folder and its contents. A 4shared account is required for every member, and they need to be logged in under their 4shared account to view the shared folder.

Set to Public Access. If you set it to Public Access, anybody with the link can access your folder and its contents. A 4shared account isn’t even necessary.
 Under the “Add people” field, enter the names or email addresses of the people you want to invite to this folder. These people will be sent notifications with the link to your shared folder.


If you set it to Public Access, you don’t need to populate this field.
 After setting the sharing options, click the “Done” button on the bottom right corner of the window. Your folder is now shared.

 You will need paper, (cartridge or artist's sketch paper will be fine) and a pencil, (HB or 3B will be good. Both would be perfect) also get your extra supplies, like coloured pencils, pens,  etc.


Make sure you are working in a spacious, large area with a good light source, comfortable chair, and no distractions.;
, Do it in pencil, not pen, as you might need to rub the outline out later.  If you are doing a close-up portrait then you'll have more space to do more face detail. If you are doing a full-on body picture, then do more detail on her outfit.
 Esmeralda has emerald green eyes, thick black lashes, red pouty lips, wavy black hair going down to her shoulders, and medium coloured tanned skin. She has a little disney snub nose, too.
 Esmeralda has a low-cut puff-sleeved top with a long, flowing lilac skirt. She also has a purple gypsy shawl draped against her waist. She mostly goes barefoot, but in the sequel she wears small black flatties. When you have done her outfit, add in her lilac headscarf.
 Follow the picture to know her colours. You can use wax crayons, pens or coloured pencil to colour her in. Rub out any random outline marks and you are done! Why not draw one of her friend's with her?

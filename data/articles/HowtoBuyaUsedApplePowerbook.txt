 The Apple PowerBook is based on the PowerPC architecture thatÂ has not been supported by Apple for some time. They're limited when it comes to expandability and software support; the latest version of Apple Mac OS X to run on any PowerPC-based Mac is Mac OS X 10.5.8. They also tend to retain their value and can easily exceed $250.


The PowerBook, while not good as a main computer, can still manage as a secondary machine as long as a later G4-based model is used.;
, Many people who buy used Apple PowerBooks often buy them for collector's value, such as the earlier G4-based PowerBooks, the G3-based PowerBooks and earlier. Some people do buy them because the later PowerBook G4s look quite modern, and as they are from Apple, they may feel that they can score an Apple computer without paying the premium, but the PowerPC architecture which they are based on is very old and won't provide the same experience as even the earliest Intel MacBooks from Apple.


If buying for collector's value, look for a PowerBook that is in decent cosmetic condition and is operational. Buy the PowerBook that you want, but be careful - these PowerBooks can cost a lot of money if they're in decent cosmetic condition.
If buying as a secondary computer, look for a PowerBook G4 which features a PowerPC G4 processor of at least 1.33GHz with at least 1GB of memory.
 PowerBooks can be relatively easy to find on eBay, but do expect to pay a premium for shipping and handling. It also wouldn't hurt to ask your friends or extended family if they have one, and would be willing to part with it.



If using your PowerBook as a secondary machine, update it to the latest version of Mac OS X, which will be 10.5.8 on the later G4s.
With Mac OS X 10.5.8, the latest versions of Safari, iTunes and iLife that can be used with it are 5.0.6, 10.6.3 and iLife '09.
YouTube videos aren't watchable in the Internet browser; however, a free application called MacTubes can be used to watch and download YouTube videos without the issues of running it in the browser.
For office work such as creating and editing word documents, slideshow presentations and spreadsheets, LibreOffice 4.0 is an excellent, yet free program that works on PowerPC Macintoshes.

 This is where you will deliver the blow in order to apply maximum force. Take a breath or two, and prepare to strike.
 Stand sideways, with your dominant leg closest to the door, a couple of feet from it. You should be close enough that your foot can easily kick the door with a decent amount of force.
 With your dominant leg, side kick the area just below the doorknob quite hard. When executing this kick, your center of mass should be slightly in front of your back leg, so that your body has some momentum toward the door. When you kick, it will feel somewhat like you are "falling into" your target. Do not lean away from the kick, but keep your body upright as much as possible.


It is advisable to hit with the sole or heel of the foot, rather than the edge. Since you are trying to transfer total kinetic energy, rather than to damage the area directly struck by your kick, increasing the impact area in this fashion is not detrimental to the effect, and helps reduce the risk of injury to your foot.
It is also important to keep your base leg (the leg you are standing on during the kick) firmly on the ground to transfer the most energy into your kick. Think about pushing from that heel.
 If you feel the door bend inward a bit when you kick, kick it again in the exact same spot. Most doors need a few good kicks before they break. Eventually the door's frame should splinter and you'll be able to kick it loose.

 Straightening your knee fully can put a serious strain on your ACL that could lead to reinjuring it.Anything beyond a 75° angle will pull your ACL tight, which is something you want to avoid, particularly during the first few days after surgery.;
, The hinge should be placed about an inch higher than your kneecap. The hinge will keep your knee bent at a certain angle and will limit the amount of movement it can make.


While straightening out your knee can lead to reinjuring it, bending your knee too much can also put a strain on your healing ACL.
 While there are different kinds of ACL braces, most have a foam wrap that folds and wraps around your leg. First fold the foam wrap over your leg. Then take the foam wrap from the inside of your leg and fold it over, making sure that both sides of the wrap fit snuggly around your leg.
 The lower calf strap and the upper thigh strap serve as the two anchors of support for your knee and should be reinforced tightly. The anchors should act as a reminder of the importance of rehabilitating the muscles surrounding the knee joint. Eventually, as you regain your strength, the real anchors against injury will be your lower body muscles.The upper calf strap and lower thigh strap provide stability and support to the anchors of the brace.
 The tibial strap supports your knee as it begins to straighten out. It also helps your front thigh muscles to contract. When you contract your front thigh muscles while also straightening your leg a bit, the muscles take some of the tension off of your ACL.
 Dials located at the inner and outer hinges should have the same allowable degree of movement—this way, the same amount of pressure will be placed on both sides of your knee joint.Be very careful about setting each dial—even the slightest difference in the degree that the dials are turned may lead to unnecessary stress on your ACL.

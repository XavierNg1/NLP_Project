 It wasn't when you were near her constantly! It was when you were not around her wishing you were! So learn to control your eagerness! Don't smother the girl because she will lose interest fast!;
, Don't Jump into a very eager looking style conversation! Just say you have just met her and really like her! Remain calm and answer her questions, but don't tell her everything!

, It's a sign of desperation! Continue chatting calm and cool! If she asks you your name she's interested!

, Way too obvious that you like her! Remember remain a Mystery! Talk to other girls in your presence, but just offer that little more attention to her! Like a little lead on!

,, Her likes and dislikes etc! If the conversation is going well get to know her further!

, Girls don't like that! Refer to her, but don't seem to eager and don't smother her.
 Don't be real serious! Relax. You are meant to be enjoying yourself in this lady's presence!

, Learn to help her, be sensitive towards her and find a way to keep her upbeat and happy! Both of you will benefit!

, She will be thinking this is very awkward and wishing she could get away!

, Be cheeky but know the difference between cheeky and insult etc.
 ie. Did you just hurt yourself babe? answer What? Because you're an angel just after falling from heaven! Not a chance of getting anywhere!

, If you let this get to you and start trying to show off, you look desperate and it's a real turn off! Just relax and be yourself!

, Remain a mystery and just a simple "hi" will do! Again don't look desperate to talk to her!

, Trust me smelling of aftershave will always help.

 Cream cheese will not last long outside of the refrigerator. If you have cream cheese frosting, make sure you put in the fridge within two hours. If you spread the frosting on anything, like a cake or other baked good, this must be refrigerated., Make sure you select a covered container to store your frosting. This will keep it safe from airborne contaminants. Something like a Tupperware container would work well., If you can't find any uses for leftover frosting right now, it can be frozen. This will prolong its shelf life. Scoop the frosting into freezer bags and then press them flat.Place the freezer bag into your fridge. If you have multiple freezer bags, stack them on top of each other.
 You should always thaw frosting in the refrigerator overnight. It is not safe to thaw cream cheese frosting on the counter, as this can leave it susceptible to bacteria.

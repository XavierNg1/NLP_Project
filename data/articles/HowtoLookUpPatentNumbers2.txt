 You can navigate directly to the advanced search page, or move from the Quick Search page by clicking the “Advanced” button at the top of the screen.
 The advanced search page allows you to use command line search syntax to make more complex searches.Advanced searches aren’t case sensitive. For example, if you want to search for patents issued to Steve Jobs, you could also search for “steve jobs” and get the same results as if you used proper name capitalization. Boolean operators, however, should be in all caps. Otherwise the search engine won’t recognize it as a command.Make sure your search doesn’t include any of the USPTO’s stop words. These are words such as “invention” or “various” that won’t appear in your search results because they appear too often in patents to be useful.
If you want to search for a particular word in a particular field, use the field codes listed in the table underneath the search box.Searches have a maximum length limitation of 256 characters when fully expanded. You can find out the fully-expanded character length by right-clicking on the resulting hit-list link once you’ve completed your search, and selecting “Properties.” If your search is longer than 256 characters, it won’t work properly – even if it looks like it did., The advanced search page provides a drop-down menu just like the one on the quick search page that you can use to limit the years you search.


If you don’t choose a particular year or range of years, the form defaults to all post-1976 records, which is the full extent of the full-text database., The database will produce a list of records that matched your search criteria. If you aren’t satisfied with the results, you can refine your search or reset the form and start over.

 Changing certain daily activities can promote better sleep. Making slight tweaks to your lifestyle can result in your sleeping easier and longer.


Do not binge eat before bedtime. Late night snacking can lead to indigestion and other stomach problems that keep you up at night.Exercise. Whether you join a school sport or simply start walking or jogging on your own, exercising in the early afternoon can help you fall asleep faster at night. Be careful, however. Exercising a few hours before bedtime can lead to difficulty sleeping later in the day.Cut back on caffeine. Many sodas and energy drinks popular with teens are loaded with caffeine. Caffeine stays in your system for up to 6 hours after consumption, so having soda or a latte after school can inhibit your ability to sleep at night.Avoid napping too close to bedtime. If you have to nap, nap for less than an hour and do so early in the afternoon., Oftentimes, teens end up staying up late due to homework. While doing homework in the early evening can actually help with sleep, putting off a math assignment until 9 or 10 o'clock can result in you staying up way too late. Try to make homework a priority earlier in the day.
 Sleeping in over the weekends can seriously damage your circadian rhythm. Many teens love to snooze well past noon on weekends, but doing so can result in difficulty getting to bed Sunday night. Find ways to avoid sleeping in on Saturdays and Sundays.


Make plans with friends early in the day. Suggest you all go out to breakfast or brunch. Plan a day hike. Decide to go shopping at 11 AM rather than 2 PM.
Pick activities you enjoy to do over the weekend. Plan to get up early to take the dog for a walk or read a good book.
Plan to do your homework early in the day. This way, you won't worry about having put it off and you'll have motivation to get out of bed early.

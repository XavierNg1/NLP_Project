 Bowser will begin by punching you in the planet. When he does, run away as fast as you can and dodge at the last minute so that you don't get hurt by his gigantic fist. You can always predict where he's landing since his fist will make a gigantic shadow that will make things darker around you.;
, Bowser will roar and a group of giant circular meteors will come hurling towards you in a desperate attempt to kill you. Run away from the shadows before the actual meteors hit you.
 Trick Bowser to punching the ground yet again in order for the meteors to be lifted and used against him. However, make sure that you don't lead him to destroying the rocks.
 Run away quickly and then jump to the meteors which appear to be yellow rocks. Go to the spot with a white symbol and quickly ground pound it in the direction of Bowser's belly to hit him!

,, He will now start being more serious in fighting you.
 Bowser will breathe out fire and fly around the planet to burn you. Make sure you run in circles and not in a straight path as the fire will eventually catch up and burn you.
 Repeat the methods as before to dodge the attacks that he uses to squish you.
 Trick him to punching you and then ground pounding into his belly twice to defeat him and gain the Grand Star.

 Stir the water and sugar together in a small saucepan with tall sides. Place the saucepan on a stove over medium-high heat.


Start with cold water.
The ratio in this recipe will create a thick syrup suitable for cold fruit drinks, cocktails, and candied fruits.
To create a syrup with medium thickness for use in iced tea and warm beverages, increase the ratio to two parts water and one part sugar.
For a thin syrup suitable for use as a dessert glaze, change the ratio to three parts water and one part sugar.;
, Stir the mixture as it comes to a boil in order to dissolve the sugar.


Use medium-high to high heat and stir with a wooden or plastic mixing spoon.
It may take 3 to 5 minutes before the mixture reaches a rolling boil.
Check to see if the sugar has dissolved by scooping up a small amount in your spoon. If you see sugar crystals, continue to boil the syrup longer.
 Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer steadily for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.


If you want to create a flavored syrup, add the flavorings while the syrup simmers. Liquid ingredients, like fresh lime or lemon juice, can be added directly to the syrup and stirred in. Solid ingredients, like orange peels, mint springs, or cinnamon sticks, should be tied into a bundle with cheesecloth an twine and steeped in the syrup as it simmers.
 Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.


Do not place the syrup in the refrigerator during this cooling stage. Instead, let it come to temperature on the counter at room temperature.
 You can add the syrup to your recipe immediately or pour it into a container to cover and refrigerate for later.


The syrup should last in the refrigerator anywhere from one to six months.

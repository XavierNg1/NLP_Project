 When adopting or buying a stuffed animal, decide wisely on what you will choose. Size, shape, colour, texture and the type of animal all make a difference to your feelings for the little critter.;
, This will make it seem like a real companion for you.
 Or you could just make a bed for it. If it's very big or likes cuddling with you, it can live on your bed.
 This helps it to feel wanted. If you absolutely cannot take your stuffed animal with you, tell him or her they can't come and give them a hug or kiss.
 Do things such as:


Making a bedroom for it
Papier mâché projects
Have a party/tea party with other stuffed animals.
Have a sleepover party with other stuffed animals.
Write a story.
Draw funny pictures and caricatures of people.
Read a good story.
Cooking or baking pretend food.
Put in a movie and cuddle up on the sofa with a tub of popcorn.
Brush each other's fur and hair.
Play some make believe games.
Take a walk and tell each other some personal things.
Draw a family tree of all the family members in existence.
Play doctor with your companion or on your companion.
Go shopping and look at the new teddy bear styles.
 The best way of showing your stuffed animal or teddy you love him or her is to do things with them and have fun together.
,, If your teddy or stuffed animal receives a tear or loses parts, leave it on a little hospital bed until you can stitch it up. Ask an adult to help you, especially if parts need replacing.
 Your stuffed animal might like being groomed once in a while. Brush him or her with a soft brush.



For whole washes, place the stuffed animal in the washer on a low setting preferably in a closed pillowcase.
For spot cleaning (removing small marks), dip a clean old toothbrush into water and gently rub over the mark.
Make sure you always care for your animal!

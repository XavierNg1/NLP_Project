 The pot will need to be able to contain at least 4 quarts (4 liters) in order to cook the entire batch at once. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Wait one or two minutes before continuing to allow the oil to heat up appropriately.
 Stir frequently to promote even cooking and to reduce burning.
 Stir the new ingredients into the onions until evenly distributed. Allow the mixture to cook for another minute or two.
 Give the contents of the stockpot a good mix. Due to the large volume of tomatoes, it may take a few minutes of stirring before you see that the ingredients have mixed together evenly. Heat to a boil.
 Simmering the mixture for 15 to 30 minutes should be enough to break the tomatoes down and create a chunky sauce. You may need to simmer the sauce longer if you want something a little thinner, though. For a thinner sauce, allow the contents to simmer until the volume is reduced by one-third. For a thick, smooth sauce, simmer until the contents are reduced by one-half.
 After the sauce reaches your desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat.

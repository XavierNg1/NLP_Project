 Rinse the cabbage under cold, running water. Pull off the outer leaves and cut off the bottom of the cabbage with a knife. Cut half of the cabbage into thin slices.
 Heat a skillet on the stove over medium high heat. Add 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of extra virgin olive oil. Add 1 small onion, chopped. Add the cabbage, stir, and saut√© it for 3 to 5 minutes until it wilts. Add 1/3 cup (78.8 ml) of apple cider vinegar to the skillet. Sprinkle 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of sugar over the cabbage and stir it. Season the mixture with 1 tsp. (5 ml) of mustard seed, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 10 minutes before serving.

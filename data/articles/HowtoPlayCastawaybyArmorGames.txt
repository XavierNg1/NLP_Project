After taking a few steps, a green glob with wings will start following you. Keep it safe, because this is the only monster of its kind. Enter the next room.
 Defeat the sand beetle. Then, after you pick up its item, make your monster follow you and enter the next room.
, Destroy the three sand beetles (tell your monster to stay put), and then keep destroying sand beetles that reappear until you become a Level 3.

Now tell your monster to follow you. Attack sand beetles until you become a Level 4. (If your monster takes any damage, just feed it Wild Berries. Don't do this after its health is full, or you'll just waste them.)

 The oval will represent your head, so make it a good size. Just make sure the lines are light so you can erase them later. It doesn't have to be detailed, just draw an oval!;
, Draw one line vertically down the middle of the oval. Then, draw a horizontal line across the middle of the circle. This will split the face into four sections, so you have an idea of where to draw things. Also, make sure the lines are light because you will also be erasing these lines later, but not yet.
 First, put light little ovals in the top two sections of the face. Then, put circles inside the little ovals. You can add a line going through the top of the little ovals so your eyes aren't wide open.
 First, make the bridge of your nose. Then, make a curvy line connecting the bridge of your nose together. Just make it look like your nose and don't add nostrils or you will have a pig nose.
 First, you make a tiny U shape that is close to the nose that goes through the vertical line going down the big oval. Then, make a smile line (that's bigger) Under the U shape. After that, connect the ends of the lines with diagonal lines.
 Start making the picture look more like you. Just make sure you erase the lines going down and across the face.

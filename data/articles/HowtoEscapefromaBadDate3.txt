 Make sure a trusted friend or family member knows where you will be, and when. That way, if things go wrong and you need someone to pick you up or give you a way out, someone will already have your back., It’s always easier to escape – or get help, if you need it – if you’re in a public venue rather than, say, your own home, or a secluded spot somewhere. Arrange to meet your date at a place like a restaurant or a bar., If things are going poorly and you need to make an escape, you don’t want to have to rely on your date to drive you home. If you don’t own a car or can’t drive yourself, be prepared to call a cab, use a ride service (like Uber or Lyft), or call a friend to come pick you up.
 If you need to leave in a hurry and don’t want to worry about settling the bill, it’s a good idea to have some cash you can put down for your part of the tab. Cash is also useful to have on hand in case you need to pay for cab fare.

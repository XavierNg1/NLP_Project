 You have three options which are either as a regular user, student or as an educator/teacher. If you're just signing up to StoryBird for fun, choose the regular user option. If you're a student in a class, choose the student option. If you're a teacher and are using StoryBird for educating purposes, choose the educator/teacher option.


To become a professional writer or artist you must be 18 or over and have high skills in literature and illustrating.
 Here is where you'll need to put in your age group, your username, an email and make up a strong password. If you're 15 or under, ask your parents permission to join StoryBird and whether they can fill out the form for you.
 These are basically the rules StoryBird has applied for users. If you wish, you can read them but you don't have to. But you do have to follow the rules which are:


Do not give out any personal information such as your housing address, the school you go to, which region you live in, etc.
 This is how people can recognize you and how you show yourself. If you have saved an image to one of your files you can go ahead and upload that, but if you haven't done so you'll need to find and image you like. You can also skip the step and come back later if you wish.

 Press your Android tablet’s Unlock button (found along the side or at the top side of the device, depending on the make and model of your phone) to activate its display, and show the Home screen.


If your tablet has a security feature, enter the corresponding password or gesture pattern to activate the screen after pressing the Unlock button.
 While viewing a picture, watching a video, or simply scrolling along the Home screen or menu, rotate your tablet from its landscape orientation to portrait. You’ll notice that the screen will automatically adjust and rotate itself as you change your device’s position. To switch your screen back to landscape view, rotate the tablet back to its original position.


Portrait view refers to when your tablet’s narrower sides are at the top and bottom position. Landscape view refers to when your tablet’s broader sides are at the top and bottom position.
All Android tablets support screen rotation. However, your tablet needs to have a working Gyroscope in order for you to change your tablet’s screen orientation.
 Rotate your tablet to portrait view while browsing the Internet or using social networking apps like Facebook and Twitter to maximize the view. Rotate your tablet to landscape view when watching videos, movies or just looking at photos to allow the files to fit the screen for maximum visibility.

 Draw an oval with a triangle point on bottom.


Add in the typical anime girl features such as large anime eyes and small cute nose and mouth features.
Also draw in the hair; keep it simple and shaped into or around the face for additional cuteness.;
, Follow each of the drawing prompts provided here in a step-by-step fashion. Create a slim, elongated shape. The cat girl needs to be flexible, strong and shapely to be able to carry out her feline human lifestyle!

, Draw triangles on either side of the head positioned neither too high nor too low. Follow the drawing example.
 The tail type is up to you – you might want to do some research on different types of tails from tabbies to tigers – maybe there will be a cute kitty with the perfect tail. Or simply follow the design shown here. The important thing is to have the tail pointed upward to denote happiness or playfulness; only draw it straight down or between her legs if she's depressed or angry!

, Cat girls wear clothes that allow for fluid movement and still look good at the same time (after all, cats care about keeping their appearance nice). The colors and outfit are really up to you but try to err on the side of using Japanese women's or anime fashion for inspiration.
 Bows are a female anime character classic addition and they complete the look. Concentrate on a bow for the hair and around the collar. If you want, bows on the shoes could work too.
 Erase any lines that aren't needed now.
 The colors are entirely up to you and once done, touch up details on the face and anywhere else. If wished, take a photo and upload her to your web page or share on Google+, Facebook or Twitter.

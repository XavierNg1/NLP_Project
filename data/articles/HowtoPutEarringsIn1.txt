 It's very important to sanitize an piece of jewelry before you put it into your body. Even if you think that the earring is clean, there is still a chance that it might have picked up bacteria. Better to spend a minute cleaning the earrings than to risk a painful infection!


If you don't have a cotton ball, you can use a tissue, toilet paper, or any clean piece of cotton. The cleaning fabric should be able to absorb the rubbing alcohol.
If you don't have rubbing alcohol, use hydrogen peroxide or any other skin-safe disinfectant.;
, Wipe down the front and back pieces of each earring, and slide them into the alcohol-doused rubbing alcohol. Let the earring soak in the disinfectant for about 30 seconds. Then, remove the earring and wipe it dry with a clean cloth or tissue.


Make sure to clean the earrings before any time that you put them into your ears. You never know when a piece of jewelry will pick up harmful bacteria!

, Put some Vaseline or other petroleum jelly on the sharp end of each earring to make it slippery. This way, you may be able to more easily slide it into the ear.
 Make sure that your ears are pierced before you try to put in an earring. If possible, visit a professional piercer at the mall or at a tattoo parlor. The earring will go in much more easily if you've already pierced the ear in question.


Make sure that the gauge of your piercing matches the gauge of the ring.
If you are feeling especially bold, try piercing your ears at home. Be careful to sterilize all of your equipment. Consider asking a more experienced friend for help.

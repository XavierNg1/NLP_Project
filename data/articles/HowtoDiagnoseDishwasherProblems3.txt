, Check the door latch, float assembly, inlet and drain valves. Check the screens of valves for blockages.
 You should do the same for the inlet valve if visual inspection does not show anything.
 There are two parts to the drain valve, the gate arm and the solenoid.


Grasp the valve arm and try to move it up and down. The arm should move smoothly. If it is difficult to move, ensure the springs of the arm are not damaged or missing.
If the arm is undamaged but doesn't move properly, you will need to replace the solenoid. Remove the connecting wires with needle-nosed pliers and label them. Use a screwdriver to take out the screws and change the bad solenoid.

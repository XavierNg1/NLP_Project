 If you know you are going to your grandma's house then pack in advance. Consider what you could do there without being rude. If your parents don't mind you sketching at the dinner table as long as you listen, then bring a pencil and paper. If you are going on a plane, then you can do almost anything you want. Asking your family members or the host what you are allowed to do can be good too.;
, If you like writing stories, bring lined paper. If your a math person, bring some graph paper.
 You're bored anyway, might as well improve your grades. But remember if your at a party, this might make you look like a nerd. If you are listening to your iPod, it looks much cooler.
 If you bring your CD player, make sure you bring a few extra CD's so you can have different varieties. Don't forget to bring extra batteries or an A/C adapter.
 Sometimes cell phones have games on them. Try asking your host if they have a Wii or something. Maybe even a computer could be good.
 Look around the room where you're at. Make up a story about each people there. Where they live, what job they have, and are they married can make good plots.
,, Make sure you are in a well ventilated place, because nail polish fumes don't go anywhere for a while.
 Bring a compact mirror, brushes, combs, scrunchies and anything you need for your hair.
 Make sure not to talk too loud if you are in an office.
 Maybe they are as bored as you are.
 Take a small snack and drink with you to snack on if your parent's are there for a while.
 Write it down on paper and add beats and such.
 Try out different angles and poses such as extreme close-ups. Use your imagination to take photos that are funny, thought-provoking, creative and interesting so that you will never get bored and can proudly show your flicks to your friends later.

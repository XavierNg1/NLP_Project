 Lariat necklaces feature long strands that hang vertically down the front of your body. To show off the necklace, wear a neckline that complements the way it hangs. A deep v-neck is a great choice, since the shape of many lariats create a v-shape themselves. The double v effect can be very visually flattering.A v-neckline is only one option. You could also try tops with sweetheart, scoop, off-the-shoulder and square necklines, along with strapless tops.
 The vertical lines created by long lariat strands can look really interesting when paired with stripes. While horizontal stripes create the most contrast, vertical stripes mimic the way the lariat hangs, so experiment with both looks to see what you like best.Go for a garment with a simple stripe pattern in two colors so the overall effect isnâ€™t too busy.
 Lariats tend to look very striking when paired with multiple necklaces of varying lengths. Try wearing one of your favorite chokers, a pendant and a lariat together with a low-cut or open shirt that allows you to show off the unique jewelry.You could also layer dainty gold or silver chokers with a thin-chained lariat for a trendy and glamorous look.Keep your clothing simple and monochrome if you want the jewelry to be the star of the show.

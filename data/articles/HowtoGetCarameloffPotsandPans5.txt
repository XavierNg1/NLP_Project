 This can either be done while the caramel is still warm or after it cools.
 If the caramel has already hardened and seems especially stuck, fabric softener may prove more helpful, since many dishwashing detergents may be too mild.
 The water should be a dingy brown by the time you return to it.
 Submerge the sponge beneath the water and vigorously scrub at the caramel until it chips away. After soaking for an hour, it should wipe away with relative ease.
 Give the pan a final rinse beneath running water.

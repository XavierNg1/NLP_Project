 You can launch the game from the Start menu (Start button >> All Programs >> Electronic Arts >> Need for Speed Most Wanted) or from the desktop by double-clicking its icon.


The game will launch directly into the game world, resuming your racing career from where you last stopped.
 This will put NFS: MW in window mode, allowing you to use the mouse and the minimize button to switch between the game and the Most Wanted Car Changer application., Since you minimized the program, it should be on your taskbar.
, Vehicles on the list are displayed alphabetically, and with the exception of the SWAT truck, all cop cars are listed under “C” and are preceded by the word “Cop.” The cop cars available in MW 2012 are:


Cop Chevrolet Corvette Z06
Cop Dodge Charger SRT8
Cop Ford Crown Victoria
Cop Ford Explorer
S.W.A.T.
 This will confirm your selection.
 Now you can change the car you are currently driving to the cop car you selected in the Car Changer.
 To do this, drive very fast (Up Arrow key to accelerate, Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left and right respectively) and hit another vehicle, or a wall, hard.


After the crash, you will respawn in the cop car you selected.
 Switch to the Most Wanted Car Changer application again by clicking its tab. Select a different cop car from the list, go back to game, and crash your current car to respawn in the cop car you selected.

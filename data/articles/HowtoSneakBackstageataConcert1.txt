 The less attention you draw to yourself the better. If possible, pick up attire similar to what the crew is dressed in so you look like you belong.;
, If you start freaking out and talking about how excited you are to see the band, people will begin to catch on.
 Don't hang your head down or try to stay unnoticed. The more you act like you belong, the better the chance you have.
 Most security guards don't look closely at them and you will be able to get past if caught lurking around

, Don't stop, don't slow, keep moving like you know where you're going, even if you don't. By watching enough people, you'll figure it out sooner or later.
 If a crew member walks by, try to say hi to them or make a quick comment such as "The band sure are hyped up tonight" or "Man, the fans are crazy."

, But be smart about it. For instance if there's a code on the door, "What's the code? I forgot it, AGAIN!" or if you're in but not sure where to go, "Shit, where's (name a band member) dressing room again? All these venues start to blend in after a while."

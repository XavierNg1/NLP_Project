 Both coral snakes and scarlet king snakes like to spend their daytime hours under logs and leaf piles on the ground. They may also be found in caves and crevices in rocks. Be very careful when lifting a rock or log, or entering an underground space., If you see a colorful snake with a ring pattern climbing a tree, it's probably a nonvenomous king snake. Coral snakes very rarely climb trees. You should still look carefully to make sure it's not a coral snake, and play it safe by not getting too close.
 When coral snakes feel threatened, they move their tails and heads back and forth in order to try to confuse their predators. King snakes don't display this behavior. If you see a snake wagging its head and tail strangely, it's probably a coral, so stay back.Coral snakes are very reclusive, and it's extremely rare to see them in the wild. They only strike when they feel extremely threatened, so if you see one displaying this behavior, you'll probably have time to get away.
King snakes received their name because they eat other types of snakes, including venomous ones. They don't tend to display this sort of defensive behavior, although they have been known to hiss and shake their tails like rattlesnakes.
 In order to inject its venom, a coral snake must clamp down and chew its prey. Since it's usually possible to fling the snake off before it has time to fully inject venom, people rarely die from coral snake bites. However, left untreated, a coral snake bite can lead to cardiac arrest and death.A coral snake bite is not extraordinarily painful at first. However, if venom has been injected, the victim will experience slurred speech, double vision, and paralysis so even if you don't feel anything after a coral snake bite still call emergency services.If you ever get bitten by a coral snake, stay calm, remove constrictive clothing and jewelry and get medical help immediately.

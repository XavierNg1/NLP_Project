 Add enough oil to fill the stockpot halfway. Heat the oil over high heat until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).


Monitor the temperature of the cooking oil using a candy thermometer.
You could also cook the mushrooms in a deep fryer or dutch oven.
 The mushrooms should be cut first before being cleaned and dried.


Use a sharp knife to cut off the stems. The lower part of the stems can contain debris from straw or wood, and the stems, as a whole, are too tough to eat and should be discarded.
Cut or tear the caps into small pieces for this method of cooking.
Clean the gills of each cap by running them under rapidly moving water. Debris and insects frequently like to hide in these spaces. Use minimal water since these mushrooms are generally very moist.
Dry by gently pressing the oyster mushrooms in between clean paper towels.
 Gently beat the egg with a fork until the yolk and white are mixed.
 Stir the cold water, flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt into the beaten egg. Continue mixing with a whisk until a thin batter forms.


You can use either pastry flour or all-purpose flour for this batter. Pastry flour is less dense and will create a lighter batter.
 Dip the mushroom pieces into the batter a few at a time, turning them with a fork to coat all sides.


When you remove the mushrooms from the batter, you should hold each piece above the mixing bowl for several seconds to allow excess batter to drip off.
 Add the oyster mushrooms to the hot oil in small batches and cook for several minutes, or until they turn a rich golden-brown.


Monitor the temperature of the oil as you fry the mushrooms. The temperature will fluctuate as the mushrooms are added and removed. Adjust the heat supply as needed to make up for this.
 Remove the mushrooms from the hot oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on several layers of clean paper towels. Serve them immediately.

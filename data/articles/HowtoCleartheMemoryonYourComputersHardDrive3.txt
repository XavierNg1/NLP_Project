 Random Access Memory, or RAM, is how your computer stores information. If it is too full, it can clog up your computer.


The first step in freeing up RAM is to close any applications that you aren’t using. Another way to free up RAM is to limit the amount of programs your computer automatically opens upon startup.
In Windows right-click on an application and open “Preferences”. In the “Misc.” Section there is a box that you can check to ensure that it doesn’t open on startup.
You can stop applications from opening on a Mac by going to System Preferences > Accounts > Login Items, and unchecking the boxes next to apps you don’t want opening at startup.
 Clear memory on your computer and free up RAM by storing files you don’t need everyday on an external hard drive.


RAM is sort of like short term memory while your Hard Drive is like long term memory. By using an external hard drive you can free up both on your computer and reduce how hard your computer is using.
 You can clear memory by ejecting disk images from applications or other files you have downloaded.


This is more for Macs than it is Windows. When you have a removable disk in your computer, even if you aren’t using it, it takes up RAM and can slow your computer down.
This also goes for any external hard drives you have plugged in. When you’re not using them, eject them properly.
 By deleting your browser history and cache, you can free up RAM and help your computer to work faster.


Having several browser tabs open at once also makes your RAM work harder, so it’s best to close out any tabs that you don’t need as soon as you’re done with them.

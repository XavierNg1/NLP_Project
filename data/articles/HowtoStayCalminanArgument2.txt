 Attempt to get in the right head space if you know an argument is about to ensue. You can train your brain to stay calm in just about any situation, whether you’re facing the boss about work troubles or heading home to a heated discussion.


Look online for games and puzzles that encourage and train mental flexibility. Engaging in these activities regularly can help you stay calm under pressure.For example, if you had a heated discussion with your partner at lunch, and you promised to finish the discussion later, you may anticipate a disagreement later. Use the time in between to prepare yourself for the discussion.
 It's important to know your audience before walking into a debate. To consider how to present your point of view to them the most effectively, think about who they are—your boss, colleague, parent, friend—and base your case from there.


For instance, you may want to act more formal with your boss than you would your parent. On the other hand, your friend may respond to a softer and more personable approach., Create the potential conversation in your head and ask yourself how the person will likely respond. Preparing your comebacks ahead of time can help you feel more confident and less stressed going in.


Also come up with a few fact-based statements that can help your argument end on a positive note.For example, you might choose to say, "We are on the same side here." or "We love each other, so I know we can come to an agreement."

, One of the benefits of heading into an argument you know you’re about to face is having the ability to think about how to solve the problem ahead of time. Suggest ways you could possibly explore solutions, if you can’t think of anything solid on your own.For instance, you might say, "Why don't we both take 20 minutes to jot down some possible solutions? We can meet back up and go over what we came up with. How does that sound?"

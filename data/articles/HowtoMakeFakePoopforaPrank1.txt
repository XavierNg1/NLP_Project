 For this method, you’ll need 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, ⅓ cup of peanut butter, ⅓ cup of cocoa powder, and 1 tablespoon milk. You won’t need any cooking supplies besides a large bowl in which to mix the ingredients. The ingredients will form a dough that you mold into fake poop.The peanut butter you use can be creamy or chunky. Chunky peanut butter can add a little texture to the eventual product.
If you’ve only got creamy peanut butter, but want to add some texture, you can include some chopped nuts of any kind.;
, There’s no special order in which you need to add ingredients. Just throw them in as you’d like. Spend about 2 minutes stirring with a large spoon until all the ingredients are well-mixed. The color should be a dark brown and you shouldn’t be able to spot any constituent ingredients.


If the mix seems too thick for shaping, add more milk until it feels malleable enough to mold into pieces. If it seems too runny, consider adding a bit more cocoa powder or peanut butter.
 Once all the ingredients have been combined and mixed in with one another, you’ll want to begin to mold your fake poops. The size is entirely up to you, though it’s important to keep it reasonable if you’d like the fake poop to be believable. Depending on the size of your mold, this mix should yield six to eight separate pieces., Once you’ve molded all the individual pieces, set them aside on a large plate, uncovered, to dry. Due to the milk used in the mix the pieces will still be a little moist for use. There’s no precise amount of time you ought to wait; continue checking the pieces until you feel they’re dry enough to handle.


These fake poops contain dairy products. You’ll want to make use of them within the day.
If you want to make them last longer, refrigerate them.

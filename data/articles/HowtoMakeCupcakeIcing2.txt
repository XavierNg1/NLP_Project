 Do this in a medium saucepan, but don't turn on the heat. This reduces the risk of flour lumps forming, and will help the sugar dissolve.Use granulated sugar, not powdered. Powdered sugar will make slightly "rough" icing when used in cooked recipes.
 Pour in the milk as you whisk. Turn the heat to low and keep whisking. Bring to a boil. Cook and whisk until it thickens into a pudding. You should be able to see the bottom of the pan when you push the sauce away.Smash apart flour lumps with a rubber spatula.
 Move the pudding base to a plate with deep sides. Cover with plastic wrap tightly, pressing against the mix. This will prevent a skin from forming. Move to the refrigerator to chill while you start on the next step.
 Cream the butter by beating until it is smooth and lighter in color. If using an electric mixer, use butter from the fridge and beat at medium speed for a couple minutes. If beating by hand, cut the butter into pieces and let soften slightly before beating.
 Beat the flour mix in one spoonful at a time. It may look lumpy at first, but after a few minutes it should become silky and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla and a pinch of salt as well.

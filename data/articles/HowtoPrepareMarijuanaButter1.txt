 Also called "pre-baking," this step leads to stronger bang for you bud. Marijuana is filled with many compounds, some of which are medicinal/psychoactive, and some of which are not. You can get rid of the not so useful ones if you decarboxylate the weed first, which simply means baking it at a low temperature. This vaporizes compounds like THCA, which doesn't get you high, leading to a stronger butter.


You can also use shake, leaves, or a mixture of buds and leaves if you'd like.;
, You want a nice, low temperature. While a higher temp will remove the compounds faster, it will also cause wanted compounds, like terpenes (which give each strain it's unique aroma and flavor) to leak out too. 240Â°F is a good, safe temperature.
 You want smaller pieces of bud, roughly 1/2" or less in diameter, though exact measurements aren't needed. Use a baking sheet just big enough to contain all of the weed. Empty space will heat up the pan quickly, which causes uneven "cooking."

, When done, the weed will be a light brown color and will crumble easily in your hands.
 Don't grind it into a powder -- you just want it to be in small, manageable bits, like small pieces of gravel. You can use an herb grinder or simply pulse it quickly in a blender or food processor.
 This will remove some of the chlorophyll, dirt and fertilizers from the plant matter which can cause a "grassy" taste in your butter. THC and other cannabinoids are not water soluble, and will not be affected by the soak.


When done, strain out the water with a colander and pat dry with paper towels.

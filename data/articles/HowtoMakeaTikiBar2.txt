 Choose the decor you like best. Woven matting and bamboo paneling are probably the easiest to add, but palm fronds are a good way to add some frills if desired.


Hang a woven mat, or nail up more paneling, for the back wall as well.
Another idea is to use stencils and paint to make the front of the bar look like salvaged wood. Write things like "FRAGILE," "South Seas Trading Company," "Rum Shipment," etc., Long bamboo rods cut in half can take out any right-angles you have, lending a softer edge to lean on as well as a bit of essential Tiki ambiance.


Bamboo can be cut easily with a table saw, but you can also buy it pre-split from some retailers.
 Most Tiki bars have dark, atmospheric lighting, so don't feel like you need to go overboard. All of the options above can also be mixed and matched to create your own personal look.


Be very careful with any torches or real flames -- a thatched roof is especially flammable.
 Tiki is actually a Californian invention, meaning some "stereotypical" decorations are a part of the package. For a true Tiki feel, don't shy away from fake shrunken heads, wooden masks, and a few bamboo art., Don't stop the bamboo parade with the bar -- make sure the stools match!

, Tiki bars are supposed to be on the beach, so give people a beachy atmosphere to enjoy. Fishing nets can be tacked to walls or posts, shells glued to the back wall or scattered on the bar, and a big, mounted marlin or other salt-water fish proudly displayed nearby.


Old, woven rope is a cheap and easy way to add some ambiance as well. Try wrapping it around the bottom of posts or use it to hide the joints in your construction.
 A small touch, but a good one for authenticity, is weathered brackets and fixtures. If you've got any exposed metal, such as L-brackets holding beams together, give them a quick once-over with a rust coating to give them an authentically beachy vibe.

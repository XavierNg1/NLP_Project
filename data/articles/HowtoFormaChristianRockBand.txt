, Do you and the other members want to play Pop Rock, Hard Rock/Metal, Punk Rock, Alternative Rock, or Classic Rock? Talk with the other members, and settle on a Subgenre.
 Look for a cheap yet decent instrument.
 You can use them as warm-ups while your group is still thinking of more additions to the band.
 Of course, every song about the Lord is absolutely great, but try to aim for uncommon beats and sounds. Later on, it might be heard in churches all over the world.
 If you are committing huge sins every day and are not caring, singing your christian songs is like acting. Try to pray every day and appreciate what you have. Remember, Christians try to be as close to the Lord as possible. But, everyone makes mistakes. You only have to ask for forgiveness.
 If not, the band can end up breaking up or friendships can be lost. Also,try not to have a relationship(boyfriend/girlfriend) in your band because all loving couples argue and this can lead to many dead ends.
 Don't focus all on the band. Live your life while you have it.
 Love what you're doing always and you will succeed.

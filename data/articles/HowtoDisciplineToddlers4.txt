 It's easy to get really frustrated and take it out of your kids, making punishments much harsher than is perhaps appropriate. Avoid this by setting priorities, deciding ahead of time which behaviors get punished most harshly and which only result in a time-out.


Hitting and biting, as well as anything which could cause them serious injury are usually worthy of the more serious punishments, but you will have to decide what is best for you.
 Do not threaten your child with a punishment and then not deliver. This teaches your child not to take you or the possibility of consequences seriously. It is better not to react at all than to threaten and then not do anything.
 Don't feel bad for you child partway in to a punishment and then relent. It can be hard, because you love them and you want them to be happy, but it is important for them to fully experience the punishment and not come to expect that they can manipulate your emotions into getting them out of trouble.
 Negotiating is the quick route to a habitually misbehaving and disobedient child. Just don't. They get what you give them or they get nothing. They'll learn eventually. Be strong.
 Small children will not be able to understand subtleties so try to create a consistent environment by keeping rules the same across basic situations. It is also a good idea to show them that there is a place and time for certain behaviors, so that they don't feel flat-out banned. For example, establish that it is okay to yell but only outside. Try not to add modifiers to rules such as these, since it only confuses them. Wait until they reach around age 4 before adding conditions.

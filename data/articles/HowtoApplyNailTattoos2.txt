 Use a cotton pad with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol to clean on and around your nails. Don’t apply a base coat for this look – it can prevent nail stickers from properly adhering.
 Find a sticker that is the closest match to the size of your nail. If you can’t find a sticker that matches the size of a nail well, choose a sticker that’s larger than your nail. Then trim it down with small scissors to fit the nail. Rub the sticker in your hands to warm it up a bit – this can improve its flexibility and longevity., Remove the backing from the strip. Place the sticker on your nail plate, close to – but not overlapping – your cuticle. Smooth the sticker down from your nail bed to the tip.
 Use the warm setting on your blow dryer. If your blow dryer runs quite hot at close range, hold it back far enough that it doesn’t hurt your skin.








Heat helps nail stickers smoothly adhere to the nails.
 Hold a large-grit file perpendicular to the nail. File the nail downward to detach excess strip from the free edge of your nail. Start out with a rough file, and finish up with a finer grit.








Try using a glass file to smooth the edges once you’ve removed excess stickers.
 You can add a top coat for gloss, if desired, but it isn’t needed for longevity. Treat your nails gently, avoiding pressure and moisture. Avoid using lotion or oil-based products on your nails, which can cause separation of the stickers. Keep your nails away from heat, unless a decal starts to come off. If so, use a blow drier on your nail as you smooth the sticker back down.








For example, wear gloves to protect your nails when doing dishes or other wet or messy tasks.

 When you are at the gas station keep the receipt. After you fill up with gas make sure to reset your trip meter to 0. You can calculate your fuel mileage by dividing the driven distance by the amount of fuel used. Keep a record. There is no way to tell how much your mileage has improved unless you keep a record.;
, Think about how much fuel you are using when you are driving. Always keep it in your mind until you get in the habit of driving for fuel economy and not for speed.
 Sometimes it is necessary but keep it to a minimum. When you start your car in the morning don't let it sit and idle for 10 minutes, you are using gas and getting 0 miles/kilometers per gallon!

, Most of the time the people who are off of the line first are also the first ones to slam on their brakes at the next stop light. This is a huge waste of fuel.
 If you see the traffic light turn red or cars brake lights coming on then take your foot off the accelerator and let your car coast. By doing this you are using the momentum that you already have (from using gas to get your car up to speed) to get to the next stopping place.
 Your car is most efficient around 60 mph (97 km/h). After that you are wasting fuel. Drive as close to 60 mph (97 km/h) as possible when it is appropriate.
 The longer you are driving and the more you are sitting at stop lights the more fuel you are using.

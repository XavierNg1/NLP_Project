Do some serious inventory before you start to register for anything. Maybe you want an upgrade on something, or maybe you forgot all about something you already had. Take notes as you go so as to be very thorough with your assessment of what you own. If you are registering for wedding gifts, perhaps you want to categorize your list by room of the house. Or, if you are registering for baby gifts, consider dividing your registry list up by the type of need, such as bath time, sleeping and feeding.;

Registering doesn't just have to be practical. It is your chance to get some fun items you wouldn't buy yourself. Consider registering first for the items that are necessities. Then, once people begin to purchase some of those items, begin to add a few of the more recreational gifts. There is a good chance, if you think the item would be more fun then practical, that your friends would agree and may be more tempted to purchase those items rather than the ones you actually need to have.



Although people want to buy you special gifts for the major events in your life, most of them are still conscience of the price tag. Be realistic when you are choosing items and determine if someone in your life will truly spend that amount of money on that item. If the answer is no, remove it from your gift registry.

If there aren't very many things on your registry, particularly for a bridal registry, it is often an indication you would prefer to have money. Be thorough on your registry, but don't fret if it doesn't look like very many items. It is important, though, to consider the number of bridal or baby showers you will be having and counting the number of people that will want to bring a gift. It is more customary to give cash as a wedding gift, but not typically for a shower.

 This will make the body of your puppet. Your shape can be anything you want it to be, but good body shapes for puppets include circles, ovals, eggs, and lumps.


Make sure that the puppet is large enough to cover the back of your hand; you will eventually be sticking your fingers through it to make it "walk."
You can use construction paper, but cardstock will be sturdier.
 If your puppet has some thin parts, such as antlers or antenna, be sure to leave some space around them. This way, they won't break off.
 The holes need to be big enough for your first two fingers to fit through. They should also be about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) apart.
 You can color it with crayons or markers, or you can glue on things like buttons or pompoms. Be sure to give it some eyes, a nose, and mouth. You can even give it some other details, such as clothing and hair. If you glued anything on, remember to let the puppet dry before moving on to the next step.


If you'd like to get fancy, glue on some buttons or googly eyes for the eyes, and a pompom for the nose.
 Turn your puppet so that the blank side is facing you. Stick your first two fingers through the holes in the bottom. Place your fingers on the table, and move them to make your puppet walk or dance.

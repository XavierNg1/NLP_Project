 Another way to hear through a wall is with a hole and plastic membrane, a method recently discovered by scientists in Japan and South Korea. First, drill a very small hole all the way through the wall. A power drill with a small, long bit will work best to do this. Donâ€™t expect to hear too much through the hole alone. In fact, a plain hole in a wall seriously hinders sound transmission.
Try to pick a time when your neighbor is out to drill through the wall. Otherwise, they may well notice the sound or debris from the drilling.
 This is what should make the method work really well. You see, studies show that when you cover the hole with a thin membrane on one side the transmission becomes almost as if there is no wall, because the membrane equalizes the pressure on both sides of the hole and funnels sound through.


Try using a common household item, namely plastic wrap. In fact, the scientists who conducted the initial study used plastic wrap themselves., Once you have your hole and plastic wrap in place, listen away! If executed properly, you should be able to hear what is happening in the opposite room quite clearly.


For even better results, try this method in conjunction with the first. Put a glass over the top of the hole and plastic membrane.
Be aware that drilling a hole in the wall has very clear disadvantages, especially as regards secrecy. Your neighbor might hear the drilling; she might see the hole; or she might notice the drill debris on the floor and become suspicious. Use with care!

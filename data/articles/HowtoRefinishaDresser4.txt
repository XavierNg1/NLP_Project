 Once the hard work of preparing the dresser is over, the fun part begins. Which refinish will you use? Each finish has its own special look, with some more complicated to apply than others. Some suggestions include:


New paintwork (acrylic, enamel, dual colors, a pattern, a design, etc.)
Spray painting
Distressed painting
A paint wash
Wood stains with wax
Wax alone

Varnish or varnish stains
Oils
French polish
Lacquered finishes (hard for non-professionals but black japanned finishes are one possibility)
Decoupage
Fabric.

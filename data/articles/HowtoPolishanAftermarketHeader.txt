 Using the soapy water and a rag/cloth to wipe most of it clean. Then dip a toothbrush into the soapy water to get the hard to reach places like in-between the collectors.;
, If you want the nicest shine possible or your header is rusted this is where you grab the rust cleaner and repeat step one using the rust cleaner instead of the soapy water. Once finished with the rust cleaner repeat step one again with the soapy water solution.
 Take your old newspaper and spread it out over your work area. After the finding your place to work put your gloves on. Then grab your brake cleaner and spray a clean rag/cloth or paper towels and wipe down the header. This should get all the parts you missed before with the soapy water solution clean.
 This makes handling the sandpaper a lot easier. Begin to work away at the rusted header. Once you start to see the sandpaper get clogged up, give it a quick rinse to clean it out. Repeat this step for the whole header until most of the difficult rust is gone.
 grab your 1000 grit sandpaper and again rip the sandpaper into four equal pieces. Then use the sandpaper together with the metal polish to get your desired results quicker. This way is faster than just using sandpaper alone. Your sandpaper will get clogged up and the metal polish will turn a rusty brown color. Don't worry just rinse out your sandpaper or grab a new piece. Then wipe off the old metal polish with your paper towel and add some more metal polish to the header. Remember not to over apply the polish.
 Now if the header is looking good to your satisfaction, re-install it on your car and skip to step. If not grab your sandpaper and give the header another light scuffing.
 It will not shine like chrome so; do not get your hopes too high. Remove any excess polish with paper towel and wipe it down with paper towels and brake cleaner, so the oil on your hands will not heat up and ruin the finish again!

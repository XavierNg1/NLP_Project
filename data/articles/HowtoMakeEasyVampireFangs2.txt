 You'll need many of the same, easily found supplies as with the fake nail fangs.


Scissors
Denture glue
A plastic fork. This should be white unless you want to experiment with different colors.
 Measure about halfway between where the handle ends and the tines begin. Using the scissors, cut straight across the fork along this halfway line. You should be left with a roughly rectangular piece.
 Position your scissor between the middle two points of the fork and cut. You should be left with two sections, each with two tines.
 You should now have two pieces, both with a long point and a rectangular base.
 You'll want your fangs to curve in, not out. To do this, make sure you apply the glue to what was originally the front of the fork.
 Hold it there for about a minute to make sure the glue sticks. Repeat this for the other fang.


Since the fork tines will stick out of your mouth, you may not be able to put them on your canines. If they don't fit there, you can stick them to your incisors. These are directly next to your front teeth.
 Try talking and moving your lips around. With the fork method, your fangs will stick out of your mouth, so talking may be more difficult. If they fall off, just try again with a little more glue.

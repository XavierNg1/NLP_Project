 The horse's aggressive behavior may be an effort to challenge you. It's important not to back down or let the horse take control, to show the horse that the behavior is not effective. Even a little hesitation before responding to bad behavior can encourage the horse to keep trying.
 When the horse behaves poorly, speak in a low, serious voice. When praising the horse, speak in a high pitched, cheery voice. This way, the horse will easily understand what behavior is acceptable and what is not.


Avoid shouting, which can startle the horse.
 If the horse tries to bite you, knock his teeth with your knuckles. Stare at him and scold him in a low, serious voice. Do not yell.


A smack on the neck or rear is also an appropriate response to this kind of behavior.
 If the horse tries to walk ahead of you while you are leading him, stop moving. Once the horse stops, walk ahead. This establishes you as the leader.


If the horse keeps walking too quickly, slow your pace to keep the horse calm.
Keep a firm hand on the lead rope, but do not yank it.
 If the horse rears or tries to break free of your lead rope, do not let him go unless you need to for safety reasons. If you are on the ground, lightly and repeatedly pull the lead rope until he stops. If you are riding, grip the horse with your thighs to stay in the saddle. Scold the horse for a couple seconds in a low tone.


If you cannot safely stay on the horse, learn how to avoid injury when falling.
 Brushing the face and head last before you turn them loose so they relate the two together can help.
 Many horses react poorly to specific activities, such as getting in the sower, being tacked up, or entering the pen. If the horse is generally well-behaved, the horse may have a specific trauma related to the activity. Getting the horse to accept this activity will take a lot of reassurance and trust. Approach the activity in small steps, rewarding the horse for calm behavior.

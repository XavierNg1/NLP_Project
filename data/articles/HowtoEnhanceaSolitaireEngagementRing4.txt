 Pave rings are bejeweled with smaller diamonds or gemstones set in such proximity along the band that no metal shows. The stones encrusted offer a feel of a solid bed to enhance the look of the center stone. The smaller gemstone can surround the band completely called as “full pave” or stop halfway called as "half pave.” Select your design.
 First of all, decide on the center solitaire gemstone. Once the center stone is finalized, choose complementary or contrasting gemstones to be encrusted in the band through pave setting. The additional stones can be in one gemstone or diamond or a combination of two/three gemstones or one gemstone and diamond to create a dramatic effect.
 The difference between the two settings is the size of the gemstones. In pave setting, there is a variation in the size of gemstones. An assortment is used to fit the space as well as possible. However, in micro pave setting, the size of the gemstone is uniform and they are encrusted in a honeycomb-like arrangement in the band.

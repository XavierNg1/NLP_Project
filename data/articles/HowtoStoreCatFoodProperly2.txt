 Prior to opening, you should store canned cat food in a cool and dry place. A pantry is a perfect location for storing unopened canned cat food., Wet food should not be left in your catâ€™s bowl for more than four hours. If you feed your cat and it does not eat all of the wet food within four hours it should be discarded., Once you have opened wet cat food, you should store any unused food in the refrigerator. The temperature of the fridge should be approximately 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4-7.2 degrees Celsius). Opened cans can be kept in the fridge for 5-7 days. Any opened canned food that has not been consumed within seven days should be discarded., When storing opened canned food, you should transfer it into a glass container with a lid. This will help to keep the food fresh tasting. Alternatively, you can store the food in the original can, but place a plastic lid onto to the can to act as a seal.Some cats will not like eating cold food that has been refrigerated. As a result, you can heat the food slightly in the microwave before serving to your cat.

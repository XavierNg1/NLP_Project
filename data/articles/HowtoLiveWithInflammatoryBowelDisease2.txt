 Staying busy with hobbies and going out with friends can help eliminate stress and remind you that life with Inflammatory Bowel Disease does not mean a life of limited fun or mobility.
 Many individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease suffer from malnutrition and are underweight, although some IBD sufferers are overweight or obese.


If you are not at a healthy weight, work with your primary healthcare provider to get your weight into a healthy range, through a combination of physical activity and targeted dietary changes.
You may require nutritional supplements or a restricted dietary plan, but individuals with appropriate body weight and nutrition often suffer fewer symptoms and discomforts associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 Although some foods and drinks may produce some symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and should be avoided, IBD is not caused by food allergies, and most foods and drinks are acceptable.


Once you have identified foods that seem to trigger symptoms of discomfort, eliminate them and get busy enjoying your meals as you normally would. With appropriate medication, most people living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease are able to enjoy a variety of delicious foods like anyone else.

 If you have olive skin with a warm or yellow undertone, choose a golden color for your base. For example, choose a honey blonde, auburn, chestnut, or mocha color.If doing highlights, try a warm red color to really bring out the warmth of your skin tone.
 If you have olive skin with a cool undertone, as most olive skinned people do, pick a hair color that highlights these cool tones. For example, pick an ash, platinum, copper, or violet red.If you have dark olive skin with cool undertones, avoid choosing a light ashy blonde or something similar that will starkly contrast.
 If you have a warm eye color, such as hazel, brown, or green, consider choosing a color that will highlight your eyes. For example, if your hazel eyes have some flecks of red, choose a hair color that has a reddish hue in order to bring out your eyes.

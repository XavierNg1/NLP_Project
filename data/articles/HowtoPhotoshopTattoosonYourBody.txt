Open Photoshop by clicking on the icon or searching for it in the lower left corner where you should find the start menu.
In the left hand corner click File => Open => Select, to select the image which you wish to open.;
, Add this as a second layer on top of the person you wish to place the tattoo on.


It's important that your tattoo has a white background so when you click multiply in a later step, the background disappears.
 Do this by selecting the layer your tattoo is located on. Where it says Opacity at the top, change it to roughly 60, just for starters.
 Proceed by selecting Free Transform.


While Free Transform is selected, adjust the size and angle of your tattoo and place it where you wish for it to go by dragging the corners.



The Warp will help adjust the tattoo to the contours of the skin.
If you are unsure how Warp works, experiment with it before using it on your project.
 Click where it says normal. Select Multiply from the menu that pops up.


This should remove the background if it was white as previously stated.
If the tattoo still doesn't look correct, now would be a good time to adjust the opacity.
 If the tattoo still looks incorrect, you can add shading.
 The tattoo image should now look as if it rightly belongs on the person in the photograph.

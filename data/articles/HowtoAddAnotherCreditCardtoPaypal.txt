 Of course, since all of this information is kept behind a password, you will need to be in your account to make any changes.;
, Just like your actual wallet, the Wallet tab is where PayPal keeps your account information, including all links to your banks and credit cards. You should see icons for all your accounts., It should have a + symbol as well. This will open up an overlay window that gives you an opportunity to put in more information. If you want to close this window, click the X in the top right corner.
 PayPal gives the option of "Debit," "Prepaid," or "Credit." Make sure you know what type of card you intend to enter.
 The boxes prompt you to type in the card number, expiration date, card security code (CSC) number, and billing address. The billing address should already be filled out correctly, assuming it is the same address as your first card.


Make sure your billing address matches what is on your card statement. An incorrectly entered billing address is a common mistake.
 PayPal will make a small charge to your card to help confirm that it is yours. When the charge appears on your credit card statement, it will have a unique code that you will be able to enter on PayPal to confirm that this is your card.Under the link for "My Money," you should be able to click "Update," then "Confirm My Card" to get and the confirmation code. Once you have it, click "Update," then "Enter PayPal Code" to get a box to enter the code.


PayPal is updating their profile interface. To get some of these links, you may need to access the older version. To do that, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the link to "Classic Site."
The charge may take 2 to 3 business days to appear on your statement, though if you can access your statement online, you may see it sooner.
If you enter the code incorrectly three times, you will need to call PayPal directly to finish the process. PayPal suggests they may need additional information from you during that conversation, so be prepared for questions.
 It won't do you any good to try and attach a card that is already there.
 PayPal only allows credit cards to be attached to one account. If you want to use that card, you will need to remove it from the other account.
 The card should be in your name with your billing address. If someone else wants their card on PayPal to use, it is best to set up their own account.
 This is redundant, as PayPal already has access to your account. Plus, PayPal will charge a small fee for personal transfers using a debit card, but not a bank account.

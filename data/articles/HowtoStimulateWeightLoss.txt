 Overeating is caused by the structure of human nerve system. It takes the signal about 5-10 minutes to travel from your stomach to your brain with information that hunger is satisfied. This is a result of prehistoric times, when it was crucial. Eating as much as possible helped our ancestors to survive, because their food supplies were scarce. But nowadays, this atavistic instinct is rather harmful and should be inhibited. Otherwise, habit of overeating develops and people start gaining weight.;
, Losing a few kilograms to fit in your gorgeous dress again is possible, but these kilograms will be gained back in no time in case you do not drop your habit of overeating. Therefore, your goal is not to achieve short-term results, but to change your lifestyle and habits for better.
 Only bad things happen quickly, most of the positive changes need some time to happen. You cannot lose weight in two weeks. However, it is possible to change your lifestyle step by step, so in two months you will feel much better and in two years you will be a much slimmer person and happier with your weight.

And starting back a second time might be harder, so it is best to be dead set against letting any backsliding occur.

 There are tons of websites that will allow you to upload a music file and then select what portion of that file you want to turn into your ringtone. And the best part is they're all free! Search for a current popular option online using keywords like "free ringtone creator" or "free ringtone maker," and you'll see a lot of results.;
, You can choose the file from anywhere on your computer, and some services allow you to link to files in cloud storage. Most services accept all the major formats, including:


MP3
AAC
M4A
WAV
WMA

, Once the file has been uploaded, you’ll be able to designate which section of the song you’d like to use as a ringtone. Most phones support ringtones up to 30 seconds long.
 Most ringtone makers will default to a lower bitrate than a standard audio file, because the speaker on a phone is generally lower quality than headphones or stereo speakers. This allows the file to be smaller in size while still being a decent quality.


Most defaults are 96 kbps, you can increase this if you’d like. 320 kbps is CD-quality.
 iPhone ringtones need to be in the M4R format, while almost all other phones support MP3 files.
 Most services offer a choice between downloading the file to your computer, receiving the file via email, or having the file pushed directly to your phone.
 If you had the file delivered directly to your phone, then you should be able to select the ringtone in your ringtone menu. If you downloaded it to your computer, you will need to place it in the right directory on your phone:


For iPhone, place the M4R file in the Ringtones library in iTunes. Sync the library to your phone and your ringtone will be added to your ringtone list.
For Android, connect your phone to your computer. Open the phone’s drive and navigate to the “media” folder. Open the “audio” folder, or create one if it does not exist. Finally, open the “ringtones” folder or create one. Place the audio file in the “ringtones” folder.

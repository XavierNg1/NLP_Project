 In order to get your cat used to new things, you should introduce the kitten to things slowly. Let your kitten smell a new thing and approach it at their own pace.For example, if your kitten seems afraid of pots and pans clanging around in the kitchen, show the kitten a pan and let the cat smell the item. Then show the kitten the clanging sound that the pan makes so it will understand the sound and get used to it over time.
Kittens need to feel safe and secure in order to feel comfortable enough to explore freely in their environment. If your kitten doesn’t feel safe, it will hide and stay out of sight often. Introducing your kitten to new things slowly will help your kitten feel more comfortable at home.;
, If your kitten seems very afraid, you should help it feel more secure by confining it to a smaller space for a short period of time. This means that you should let the kitten live in a smaller room, like the bathroom, where it can explore the entire area easily and familiarize itself with the whole room.If you put your kitten in the bathroom for a few days, make sure it has all of the necessary supplies in the room as well. Leave the kitten’s food and water, its litterbox, a soft place to sleep, and a few toys in the room with it.
 Your kitten will feel much braver about exploring your home if there are plenty of things around for it to hide in or crouch behind. Give your kitten the option of hiding when it feels insecure by providing it with things to hide inside of.Put some baskets around different rooms or other boxes and items that your kitten can jump inside. This will help your cat feel less afraid.

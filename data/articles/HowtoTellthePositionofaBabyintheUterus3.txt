 Belly mapping might be a challenge, but it’s a fun challenge. In your 8th months of pregnancy, try belly mapping right after you see your healthcare provider for an ultrasound or fetal heart monitoring. Go home and gather some non-toxic paint or markers and a doll with moveable limbs., Lie down on your back where you'll be comfortable, and lift your shirt. Use firm pressure and feel around your pelvic area for a hard, round shape. Use your art materials to draw a circle for your baby’s head., Draw a heart over the area of your baby’s heartbeat – your healthcare provider probably just showed you where this is at your appointment. If not, use a stethoscope or fetoscope if you have one, or ask a loved one to put their ear to your belly and tell you where the heartbeat is the loudest., Gently feel around for your baby’s bottom, which will be hard and round, but softer than the head. Mark this on your belly., A long, flat area may be the baby’s back; knobbly points could be knees or elbows. Think about where you’ve been feeling kicking. Mark any other landmarks you can find., Start to play around with your doll, moving it into possible positions based on where your baby’s head and heart are. This can help you visualize your baby’s position better!, Draw or paint your baby like an art project, or do some fun photography. This can be a great keepsake.

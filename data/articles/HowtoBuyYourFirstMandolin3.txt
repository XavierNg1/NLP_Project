 You can purchase a hard case or a soft case, referred to as a "gig bag." Hard cases tend to be more expensive, but also offer greater protection. A good rule of thumb is to consider how much you have spent on the instrument and use that to decide on how expensive of a case to get for it. Either way, you will want to protect the instrument from scratches and nicks., Electronic tuners are recommended, and getting familiar with the tuning process is too. You will inevitably have to replace strings on a stringed instrument and tuning will be necessary to ensure the best sound and the longest life of the instrument. , This allows for ease in carrying and playing the instrument with less strain on your body. It also allows for less chance of dropping and damaging the instrument while playing or carrying while not in its case., There are wide varieties of both of these necessary tools and a lot depends on your own personal preference, so as a beginner consult others opinions and try some out for yourself.

When buying strings, the different makes can affect the sound. Roundwound makes the instrument a little more bluegrass in style whereas flatwound has a more classical tone to it., This tool is strapped to the fretboard of a stringed instrument to allow a different range of sound than would be possible without it. They come in either metal or nylon and a range of costs., You will need music to play after all is said and done, and while you may be able to find it online, it's nice to have something readily available to start with. Bring a book or two home with you.

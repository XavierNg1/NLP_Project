 Many tests allow the use of a blank sheet of paper for working out equations. If you are allowed to use note paper during your test, write down your cheat notes on the piece of paper you plan to use as scrap with a white-colored pencil. White colored pencil will be nearly impossible to detect from a distance, but should be easily visible to your own eyes, provided you have enough light.


White ink can also work for creating these “invisible” notes, but may be slightly more visible to others due to ink’s reflective properties.White Out is fairly visible as far as this technique concerned, and can blot out the natural lines in the paper. Use at your own risk!

, If your tests are self-marked in class, invest in a pen with erasable ink. When it comes time to take the test, use that pen to mark all the answers. Then, when you self-check the answers, discretely erase any answers that are wrong and replace them with the correct answers.


When taking the test, make sure to write lightly with the pen. If you press too hard, your old answers will be visible as indentations in the paper, giving away your actions!

, Some classes will require you to make edits to your test using a red pen to denote wrong answers. Replace the red ink in the pen with black ink and make the corrected changes in secret. Keep an actual red pen nearby in case your teacher is observing the changes you make.


This trick works best when corrections are made through additions to the existing work (such as with missing grammatical marks from papers). Try suggesting to your teacher that self-correction leads to better learning!Using erasable ink can help make extra space on the paper if you need to insert a word or number in order to make the answer correct.

, This is a trademark hair accessory for Angelina Ballerina.
 These can be real ballet slippers if you aren't walking too far or wearing them outdoors for a long time. If you are walking in them a lot, ask for ballet shoes suitable for street wear. Numerous shoe manufacturers make such a style of shoe, with ribbon ties included.
 Depictions of Angelina Ballerina tend to show her wearing all one color with few variations (see the image in the introduction). To mimic this style, it is helpful to keep your color theme to one color in varying shades.
 You will need a tail, a set of whiskers and some mouse ears. There are numerous possible ways for creating these but here are some suggestions to help you decide what you'll do:


Make ears from white paper, cut straws, tape them to your mouse ears, color in and attach to an Alice band.
Make a tail from white fabric stapled, taped, or glued securely on cardboard cut to look like a tail.
Make whiskers from thin black wire or black pipe cleaners.

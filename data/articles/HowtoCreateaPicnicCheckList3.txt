 Much like the romantic picnic, the family picnic is made much more festive when a little forethought is used. Nothing spoils the fun more than not having a corkscrew or a fork when you need one!


Keep a "picnic" box. Load it with plates and napkins, plastic utensils, a spare bottle opener and corkscrew, plastic food containers, wraps, bags, and other non-perishables.
Keep a copy of your favorite picnic recipes in the box, too.
 Picnics are fun, unless you are sitting on soggy or rocky ground, on a blanket that's too small, in the rain, with soggy paper plates.


If you are on the ground, make sure you pack pillows or chairs.
If the weather is iffy, have umbrellas in the car.
Make sure your blanket is big enough for your crew. If not, have enough for everybody to be able to spread out a bit. Lots of space is good, and it makes the ants work harder for their share.
 Have all your ingredients ready before the day of the big event. But prepare the food as late as possible, so that everything is fresh and delicious. If you're preparing things like macaroni or potato salad, make sure you keep them refrigerated so they don't spoil.
 Bring a softball, or a board game. Frisbees are fun, always. Have activities that everybody can be involved in.
 A family picnic has lots of opportunity for fun: running, playing ball, kicking your feet in the creek, or tossing the frisbee. In case that frisbee happens to whack Billy in the lip, though, bring along a little first aid kit. Some sun screen, bug spray, antiseptic wash, bandaids and gauzeâ€”nothing too complex.
 We've gathered a list of things you need for a picnic set out below.


Copy this list to a word processor document and alter it to fit your needs. Keep it in your picnic box.

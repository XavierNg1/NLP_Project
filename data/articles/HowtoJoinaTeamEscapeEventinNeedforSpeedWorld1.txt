Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to roam the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 While roaming the NFS World, look out for the Team Escape race marker on the road. The marker is red and consists of an arrow-shaped race track with a ring around it.


The marker for a normal sprint race looks similar but is blue instead.
 Drive anywhere close to the marker, and press “[“ (left bracket) on your keyboard. This will put you in the waiting list of players waiting to start the Team Escape race.


As soon as the countdown time has elapsed, the race will start, and you will have joined a NFSW Team Escape event!

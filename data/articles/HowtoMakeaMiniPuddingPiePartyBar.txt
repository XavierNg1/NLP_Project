Non-perishable food can easily be added into the desired bowls or platters and wrapped as is.
Cold items should always be kept in the refrigerator until they are ready to be served. Avoid cutting fruit in advance, as certain foods such as bananas discolor fast. Fill a bucket up with ice and add cups of food in there to keep it cold.

Lazy Susan
Cake stands
Fruit trays
Mason jars

Insert labeled sticks to each platter so your guests can know what the item is.

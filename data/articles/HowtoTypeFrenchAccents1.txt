The international keyboard alters how the colon, semi-colon, apostrophe, quotation mark and tilde keys work.



An accent aigu is only used over a capital or lowercase "e" to alter the sound. Type an "e accent aigu" by pressing the apostrophe key and then the "e" key. It will present the "�" character.
An accent grave is used over the a, e and u vowels in order to change the meaning of a word. Press the tilde (~) key and then press the vowel you want accented. Either the French character "�," "a" or "�" will appear.
The accent circonflexe can be used over any of the 5 vowels. Press Shift + 6, then the vowel in question. For example, an a accent circonflexe will appear as "�."
The c�dille is used under a "c" before the vowels "a," "o" and "u" to facilitate a French character with a soft "C" sound. Press the apostrophe key followed by the "c" key to type a "�."
The tr�ma, known as an umlaut in German, is typed by pressing the quotation mark key (Shift + semi-colon) before the accented vowel. The French character tr�ma is used only over the "e," "i" and "u" characters.

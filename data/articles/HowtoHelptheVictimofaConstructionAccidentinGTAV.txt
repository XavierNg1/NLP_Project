 Franklin’s high-level driving skill and related special ability will be beneficial for this random event. His special ability bar can be filled by driving at over 90% of a vehicle’s maximum speed, driving toward oncoming traffic, driving at high speeds and barely avoiding accidents, as well as drifting (driving fast and using the handbrake while turning corners).This random event is timed, so Franklin’s special ability of slowing time while driving makes this random event easier to complete.;
, It is located one block east of the Ammu-Nation.Once you’re at the construction site, a blue blip will show up on your radar if the random event is occurring. It represents the location of the construction worker.
 Several large metal pipes will fall onto the worker’s vehicle, trapping him inside. Once the cutscene is over, you will have 60 seconds to rescue him.
 If you fail to rescue him in time, the trail will ignite and his vehicle will explode. You will not be harmed by the explosion from inside the bulldozer, however.
 When you’re inside the Dozer, drive diagonally left toward the metal pipes on the driver’s side of the construction worker’s vehicle. Lower the scoop to ensure you push against the entire stack of pipes. Once you push the pipes out of the way, the construction worker will exit the vehicle. As long as he has time to run away from the vehicle before the gas trail ignites, two points will be added to your driving skill.


If you need extra time to perform this task, activate Franklin’s special ability.
Though you can push the pipes away from either side of the vehicle, the pipes on the passenger side are harder to get to and will likely take longer to move.

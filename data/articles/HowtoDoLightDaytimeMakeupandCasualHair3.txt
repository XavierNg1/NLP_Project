 Make sure your hair is clean and dry before beginning. Lightly mist hair with water or hairspray to subdue any stray hairs. Gather your hair in your hands and coax it into a mid-level ponytail.








The ponytail should be positioned on the back of your head, as opposed to on top of your head or just above your neck.
Secure the ponytail with an elastic or fabric hair tie.
 This is a great look for when your hair is dirty and messy and you’re short on patience and time. Back-comb your hair to give it a little more volume. When you’re done teasing, shake your hair to one side, then braid.Make the braid look a little bit more undone by strategically pulling small pieces of hair slightly outside the braid.
Secure the finished braid with an elastic or fabric hair tie.
Try a half-crown braid. Gather a two-inch strand of hair on the right side of your head and braid it at an angle around the back side of your head.
Secure the braid with bobby pins.Repeat the above step on the left side of your head.
Position the braid so it slightly covers the tops of the ears.
On days where your hair is slightly greasy, hold a can of dry shampoo six inches from the roots of your hair.
Apply the shampoo evenly to help conceal grease., Wrap your hair into a messy bun, positioned just at the nape of the neck. Wrap a silk scarf around the bun, then tie the ends of the scarf into a big bow and position the bow directly over the bun.If you don’t have a scarf, you can also try using a ribbon.
Forgo the bun entirely and wrap the scarf around the top of your head and position the bow on the top of your head.
Ignore the scarf and hide your hair with a baseball cap or fedora.
Use a headband to hold your hair back, then throw your hair into a messy bun.
On hot days, use a hairclip to keep your hair from clinging to your neck.

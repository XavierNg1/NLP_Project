 The controls are usually on the floor of the fireplace. They are typically located behind a metal plate or grate. Raise or lower the cover over the fireplace controls to gain access.
 Most newer gas logs come with a red ignition button. If you do not have an ignition button, you will light the log with matches and the key valve on your fireplace once you have lit the pilot light.
 The control knob will have the words "On," "Off" and "Pilot" on it. If the knob is not in the "off" position, turn the knob to "Off." Wait for a few minutes before continuing to light the pilot light.
 Turn the knob to "Pilot". Press down the control knob. Continue to press the control knob while depressing the ignition switch one time every second. Stop pressing the ignition switch when the pilot lights. Keep pressing the control knob for 30 seconds. Gradually disengage the control knob.


Repeat the process after a few minutes if the pilot light does not ignite. It might take awhile for the gas to enter the fireplace if it has been off for awhile.
If the pilot light still does not ignite, call your gas company.
 Move away quickly from the fireplace so you won't get burned.


Some fireplace have an ignition button. Flip the ignition button to "On."
If you don't have an ignition button, light the gas logs by holding a long match near the log. Turn on the key valve to bring in gas. The height of the flame will depend on how much gas you let in with the key valve.

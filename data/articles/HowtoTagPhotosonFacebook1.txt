 In order to upload and tag photos, you'll need to be logged in.


Navigate to your profile page by clicking on your name in the toolbar on the top of the page or on the top left side of the page, next to the thumbnail of your profile picture.;
, It's easy to tag new pictures by uploading them into an album.


Click on the photos tab located on the toolbar next to your profile picture. This will take you the page where your photos and albums are visible.
Click on the +Create New Album tab at the top right of the photos page, or select the Albums tab and then click the Create Album square.
If a browser box (which lets you search your computer for images) doesn't automatically pop up, click the blue Add Photos button in the middle of the new album page.
Select a photo to begin your album. Use the browser window that popped up to navigate to where the photo is saved. Select the photo and push the Open button at the bottom right of the browser window.
 Tagging your photos as you upload them will save you from having to go back through and tag them later.


Once the photo has loaded drag your cursor over the image.
Click on the face you want to tag. A search bar will open. Type the name of the person you want to tag. Once you've started typing a list of names will appear in a dropdown menu. You can either select the name from the dropdown menu or continue typing and press enter.
If the person you wish to tag does not have a Facebook account you can still tag them, however the tag will not link to their profile and the tag text will appear in black (instead of blue) font.
Continue to add and tag photos.

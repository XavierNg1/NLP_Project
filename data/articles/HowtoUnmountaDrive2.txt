 This app, which resembles a blue and gray face, is usually found in the Dock at the bottom-left., It will be on the left-hand side of the Finder window below the "Devices" heading.

This must be a removable drive (e.g., a flash drive, external hard drive, or a virtual mounted drive).
 It's to the right of your drive's name. Doing so will "eject" the drive, which removes it from your Mac's available drives., Once the drive have been safely unmounted, you can remove the physical drive from your Mac computer.

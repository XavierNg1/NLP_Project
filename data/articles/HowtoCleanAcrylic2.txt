 When you’re prepping the surface of your acrylic furniture, avoid using a dusting cloth to remove dirt and dust. These types of cloths can trap particles that won’t seem big to the naked eye, but will scratch your furniture., Even though acrylic furniture is clear, you shouldn’t use the same cleaners that you do on glass windows to clean it. Cleaners specifically made for plastics, like Brillianize cleaner, is the best option for cleaning your acrylic furniture. It prevents scratches and won’t break down the acrylic, giving it a cloudy appearance., Squirt a small amount of cleaner onto the piece of furniture you’re cleaning and then polish that area with your cloth. Once you’re done with that small area, move on to the next. Don’t spray the whole piece of furniture and then wipe it down.

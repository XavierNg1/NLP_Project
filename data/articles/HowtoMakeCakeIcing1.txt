 You can make this recipe within ten minutes even if you have no measuring cups; it's that easy. The result is sweeter and more liquid than most frostings, so it is ideal on the top of cakes, or in the center of a cake cut into layers. It pairs especially well with light, fruit-flavored cakes, but might be overpowered by rich, thick cakes such as chocolate.;
, You may measure out 2 cups of powdered sugar, or simply pour the amount you think will suit your needs. It is extremely easy to adjust this recipe or make more, so do not feel pressured to keep your measurements exact.Confectioner's sugar or icing sugar are simply other names for powdered sugar.
 Depending on the flavor you want to add, you may use milk, lemon juice, or any other juice. Measure out 4 tablespoons of the liquid, or simply pour in a small amount, much less than the amount of sugar used. It's better to add too little and add more later than to add too much and have to add a lot more sugar than you intended to use.


If your cake contains fruit, consider adding juice made from that type of fruit.
Consider picking a juice based on the color you want your cake to be.
 Stir gently at first, or the sugar will get knocked over the edge of the bowl and make a mess. Stir until a paste is formed, or until all the liquid has been absorbed by the sugar.
 Keep adding a little milk or juice at a time and stirring it in. When the mixture reaches an even consistency with no dry sugar on top of the paste, it is ready. Optionally, you may add a little more liquid to make the mixture thinner or to add more of the liquid's flavor. If the mixture becomes runny, however, stir in a little more sugar to compensate.
 Carefully add a couple drops to your icing, or measure out 1 teaspoon (5mL). Stir it in thoroughly. You are now ready to spread your icing onto the cake with a knife or spoon!

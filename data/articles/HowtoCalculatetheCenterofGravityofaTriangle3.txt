 This method only works if you are working with a coordinate plane. The coordinates may already be given, or you may have a triangle drawn on a graph without the coordinates labeled. Remember that coordinates should be listed (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}.

For example, you might be given triangle PQR, and you need to find and label point P (3, 5), point Q (4, 1), and R (1, 0).
 Remember to add all three coordinates. You will not calculate the correct center of gravity if you only use two coordinates.

For example, if your three x-coordinates are 3, 4, and 1, add these three values together: 3+4+1=8{\displaystyle 3+4+1=8}. 


, Remember to add all three coordinates.

For example, if your three y-coordinates are 5, 1, and 0, add these three values together: 5+1+0=6{\displaystyle 5+1+0=6}.
 These coordinates will correspond to the triangleâ€™s center of gravity, also known as the centroid or center of mass.To find the average, divide the sum of the coordinates by 3.

For example, if the sum of your x-coordinates is 8, the average x-coordinate is 8/3{\displaystyle 8/3}. If the sum of your y-coordinates is 6, the average y-coordinate is 6/3{\displaystyle 6/3}, or 2{\displaystyle 2}.
 The center of gravity, or centroid, is the average of the x- and y-coordinates.

In the example problem, the center of gravity is the point (8/3,2){\displaystyle (8/3,2)}.

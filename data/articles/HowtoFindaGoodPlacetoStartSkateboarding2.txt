 This is the best way to find interesting skate spots.Look for concrete areas with stairs, handrails, and ramps. When you find a good spot, take a picture with your phone and record the address. You’ll be able to easily find the spot again.


Drive around at different times of the week to see what times your favorite spots are empty.
 Join a skating group or try to make friends with skaters you meet around town. If you’re of legal drinking age, find out what bars in your area are “skater bars.” These skaters will have valuable information on where to find skate spots. However, if you’re not friends, they may not want to share with you.


Watch videos of local skaters doing tricks on the internet.. Keep an eye out for familiar landmarks to help you figure out where they are., Apps such as WeRide Skate Spots allow skaters to bookmark great skate locations in their cities and share them with the skating community. These apps are free to use. However, use your best judgement when choosing a skate spot. Not all skaters are concerned about breaking laws.


If you don’t have a smartphone, many of these apps also have websites that you can use.

 Oftentimes, people avoid dieting because they “don’t have the time” to measure out portions or to “count calories.” If you’re serious about dieting and sticking to a 1,500 calorie diet, you need to justify this time expense to yourself. Your diet won’t be as effective without it. Not only will it help you keep up with how many calories you’ve eaten in a day, but it will force you to really evaluate your food choices and your daily routine.
 Using a food tracking tool can be a very useful to help track your daily caloric intake. There are a variety of free smartphone apps available to use such as My Fitness Pal. These apps take the hassle out counting calories. Simply enter your food and let them do the rest.Many apps can also scan products you buy at the store. For example MyNetDiary’s Calorie Counter Pro app can scan barcodes while tracking up to 45 different nutrients. This app also has the ability to track your exercise.Try a couple of different apps to find the one with the easiest interface for you. If the app is easy to use, it should be easier for you to keep up with.
 You should record everything you eat for several weeks. Some people eat without realizing it or thinking about what they are eating. Many people underestimate how many calories they are actually consuming.


You can purchase a food diary from any diet supplement store, online, or simply make your own. Be sure to use columns to keep track of the day, times when you consume food, a brief description of your food/beverages, and the number of calories consumed. It is also a good idea to note how much physical activity you complete each day. Ideally, you should complete 60-90 minutes of moderate activity daily. Since the key to a successful diet is eating healthy and exercising regularly, recording both food and exercise in the same place will help reinforce both.

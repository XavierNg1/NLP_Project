 This kind of egg cutter has scissor-like handles, but ends in a loop. The loop resembles a circle.It's important to place it around the narrow end of the egg instead of the wide, as it will cut into the egg rather than the shell if you use it on the wide end.
 Twist the loop (round part) of the topper slightly around the egg as you do so. Metal teeth will slide out from the loop, and twisting the loop around the egg helps the blades cut the shell cleanly. Or, you can hold the topper steady, and twist the egg slightly in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction as you squeeze the blades. Either method will help to cut the shell all the way through.
 The topper cuts off approximately the top 1/2 inch of the egg. At this point, the shell may naturally come off with the instrument, or it may remain on the egg. If it remains on the egg, simply use a spoon or your fingers to lift it off.

 One thing that might cause irritability and aggression in your aging dog is being startled. When dogs age, their senses weaken. They can’t see, hear, or smell as well as they used to. This can cause them to get scared or startled easier than they used to.You may try always approaching your dog from the front instead of behind. This helps them see your before you touch them.
Try speaking and stopping right in front of them before touching them if that causes them to be irritable.
 Senior dogs get set in their ways and react negatively to stress. To help reduce your dog’s stress and irritability, try to keep their routine as close to normal as possible. Try to do things around the same time each day, and don’t try too many new things with your senior dog.For example, keep feeding times and walks as consistent as possible. Each day should be around the same as before.
Try not to take your dog to unfamiliar places because it could upset them or confuse them.
 If your older dog’s irritability leads to aggressive behavior, such as snapping or biting at others, consult a behavioral expert on the proper use of a head halter. Head halters and leashes can help you maintain some control over your dog and let them stay with you. Note that this will not prevent the dog from biting, but it can give you more control over the dog's actions.Never leave a dog wearing a head halter alone. This can be dangerous for your dog.

 If this is the case, let your job or school know in advance that you will be absent as you will be spending most of Yom Kippur in the synagogue.;
, They are as follows (in no particular order):


No eating or drinking
No bathing or washing
No wearing leather shoes
No anointing (i.e. applying creams, lotion, makeup)
No engaging in marital relations

, For this reason, eat a very filling pre-fast meal and drink plenty of fluids (ideally water) before the holiday starts.
 The service lasts about an hour and a half altogether. Wear white if possible.
 Depending on your level of observance, many people stay in the synagogue for the whole day, only leaving for a short break in the afternoon.

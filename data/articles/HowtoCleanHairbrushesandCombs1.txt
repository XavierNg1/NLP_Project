 Get as much hair out of the brush or comb first by simply picking it out with your fingers. Hair should come out fairly easily, so try to be as thorough as possible. If you encounter any hair that's stuck on, use a toothpick to loosen it and then remove it with your fingers., You do not need to use strong cleaners on a hair or brush. A mild cleaner, such as dish soap or shampoo, works great. Add a small dab of your cleaner to a small bowl of warm water. There are no precise amounts that are recommended, but you usually do not need an excessive amount of cleaner to clean a brush or comb., Get an unused toothbrush damp with your chosen cleaner. Then, gently swab down the brush or comb between the bristles. You should also swab down the sides of the brush, as these make contact with your hair and build up residue over time.If you have a brush with a wooden handle, avoid getting the sides wet, however. Water can damage wood.
 Once you've given the brush or comb a good scrubbing, you should rinse out your cleaner. Rinse out the brush under the faucet using hot water until the water runs clean.Let the brush or comb air dry after cleaning it. If you're in a hurry, you can also pat it dry with a paper towel or rag.

 Mail website. You can either create a new email account or use an existing Facebook or Google account to create a Yahoo! address.
 This will open the “Create a new Yahoo! Account” page. Here you will need to enter your personal information.


Make sure to enter your real first and last name if you are using the email address to correspond with people you know or with businesses. The name will appear in emails that you send.
Enter a Yahoo! ID that you will remember. Your Yahoo! ID is your email address. Make sure that it is appropriate if you are going to be giving it to people who might take offense.

Create a good password. Make sure that it is strong but easy to remember so that you won’t have problems reentering it.
 This will create your new Yahoo! account, and you will be taken to the Yahoo! Mail interface.

 Brush your teeth twice a day. Furry or yellowing teeth are a turnoff, and bad breath is even worse.


Flossing is important. Remember, you canâ€™t brush between your teeth! Floss at least once a day.
You can also get breath mints or mouthwash for the middle of the day.
 Even if you are wearing clean clothes, piles of dirty clothes in your bedroom will create a musty smell. You should wash your clothes and sheets once a week.


Outerwear absorbs sweat as well. Jackets and sweaters also need to be washed.
 If you are trying to be intimate at the end of the day, you may have gotten used to the smell of your sweat and grime while you were out and about. Make sure to bathe before instigating any intimate contact.


Do not overdo aftershave or perfume. Some women like the smell of perfume and cologne, but all women react to the natural scent of a body.

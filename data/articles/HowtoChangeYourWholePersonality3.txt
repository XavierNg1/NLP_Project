 There's a saying in Zen Buddhism that the way out is through the door. If you want to become less shy, practice going up to people and talking to them. If you admire those who read a lot, start reading. Just jump in. People fall into bad habits, and there are ways to change them.No one has to know that deep inside you feel like your death is imminent. You know why? Because soon enough that'll go away. The mind has an extraordinary ability to adapt. What once sends a shiver down your spine, with enough time, will become old hat in time.
 Alright, so method acting gets a bad rap, but if Dustin Hoffman did it, might as well give 'er a go.With this method, you completely immerse yourself in someone else. It's not you out there; it's this new creature you're trying to be.


This is 24/7. You must adopt the habits of this new character in every situation. How do they sit? What's the resting position of their face? What are their concerns? How do they kill time? Who do they associate with?

, Alright, so telling you to completely abandon who you are and adopt a new persona by the simple power of thought and habit is ridiculous. There's no way you can keep it up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Therefore, give yourself a scheduled time to feel how you want.


If you have a party on Friday that you are absolutely dreading, tell yourself on Friday night or Saturday morning you can take 20 minutes just to freak out completely about it. 20 minutes of absolutely illogical, non-productivity. But beyond that, nothing. Stick to it. You know what'll happen? You'll find that you don't need to take the time after all.

 Older dogs, especially those with dementia, do not always adjust well to change. A new routine can be disorienting and stressful, which could lead to howling. Keep your dog’s daily routine the same by performing activities (feeding, walking, playing) at the same time each day.Having a consistent routine will help your dog feel relaxed and confident with what will happen each day.
 A comfortable physical environment will also help your older dog feel at ease and less likely to howl. Give your dog its ‘creature comforts,’ such as favorite toys and comfortable bedding. If your dog has trouble getting around, place its food and water bowls near its bed so it doesn’t have to walk so far to eat and drink.

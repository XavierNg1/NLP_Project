 Most laptop cases are made of hard plastic. You should remove the cover when painting to avoid painting the laptop itself.


Use painter’s or masking tape to protect any parts of the cover that you don’t want to paint.

If you do not have any old newspaper lying around, any kind of paper or an old tablecloth will work.
Make sure the area is well ventilated and consider using a mask to prevent inhaling any fumes while spray painting. Inhaling fumes from spray paint can be dangerous.Avoid areas with any open flame or extreme heat. Spray paint is flammable!, This will give you a better surface for painting. It will also reduce the likelihood of the paint flaking off. Don’t sand too hard. Your goal is to create a slightly rough surface that will better hold paint, but not scratch the surface up completely.


Use 100-180 grit sandpaper to prepare plastic for paint. Optionally, coat the case in primer. Primer can help prepare the surface for painting, but is not always necessarily with plastics., Spray paints for plastics are available in a variety of colors at most craft stores. Use the area you have set up previously. Again, be sure that it is well ventilated and away from any open flame.

Apply two to three coats, letting the cover dry in between coats. Using several coats will help ensure complete coverage.

 Simply take a piece of paper and a pen and write out the entire speech. If the speech is relatively short, consider writing it out multiple times. Many people memorize information better when they are actively recording it. Copying the speech on another piece of paper can help to commit that information to memory., Much like writing the speech out on paper, typing the speech can also help commit the information to memory through visual learning. Since typing is generally faster than handwriting, you may have more time to type the speech several times in one night.There is no need to print the typed speech each time that you type it.
However, you may be more likely to remember things that are handwritten rather than typed., Sometimes you may think that you know your speech well, but you freeze up when you perform it in front of people. It is important to practice the speech in front of someone to ensure that you really know the information. Request that your friend give you some tips. They may be able to tell you if you are not speaking loud enough or if you are talking too quickly., If you donâ€™t have anyone to practice with, try recording yourself while you rehearse your speech. Video recording is the best because you will be able to watch the recording and critique your speech and body language. You can also listen to the recording while you are doing other things to help remember the information., Normally, it is not necessary to recite a speech word for word. It is more important to remember all of the topics that you need to cover during the speech. Spend time memorizing the bullet points, important facts and statistics, and the layout of your speech in order to guarantee that you cover all of the information that needs to be covered.

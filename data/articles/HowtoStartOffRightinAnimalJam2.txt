 If you want, you can yell at Peck to stop talking. Just find something to do while you wait for the intro to be over. When she says "blah blah blah change your look" change it into whatever you want, be creative.
 You'll need to buy some decent clothing, some good den items, all that stuff. Don't waste all your gems on a junky clothing item, unless it's pretty expensive and people trade good for it. Use a Striped Couch as a bed, and put a Cleverclaw's Dresser next to it. These den items are good for starters.
 Doing this can sometimes get you good items. New Jammers are good for trading, because they just aren't that smart. But of course, you're not really a New Jammer, you're making a backup. Also look out for people that say "TRADE ME I WILL SAY YES" because, well... they say yes! Even if the items are junk, you should trade them.
 Such as trust trading and flash trading. When you see someone that is yelling "QUICK TRADE ME" or "TRUE ME" or something related, report and block them. And let's not forget about "TELL ME YOUR PASSWORD AND I WILL GIVE U MEMBERSHIP", because it is obviously a scam.

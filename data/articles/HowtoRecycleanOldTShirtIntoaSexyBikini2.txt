 Go all the way around the bikini bottom and fold in by a half-inch (1.7 cm) or inch (2.5 cm). Pin into place.;
, Because the bikini bottom isn't a huge garment, you can sew it by hand in a reasonable amount of time, if you want to. However, for a straighter and swifter stitch, use a sewing machine. Remove the pins as you go.
 That is, you should be able to see the folds and seams you just did.
 Where the bikini bottom would sit around your waist, sew the two sides above the leg holes together. Turn the garment inside out and try it on to check the fit.

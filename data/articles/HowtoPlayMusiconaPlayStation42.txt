 On the home screen of your PlayStation 4, access the “PlayStation Music” icon on your content launcher.


Sony PlayStation Music has collaborated with Spotify to bring streaming music support to PlayStation 4 users. You can now stream music while gaming through your Spotify Free, as well as a Spotify Premium account on your PlayStation 4 console.
 Once you have opened the PlayStation Music icon, the system will prompt you to download the Spotify app for PlayStation 4.


Open the Spotify app on the PS4 once the download has been completed.
Follow the prompts to either add your existing Spotify account to the PlayStation Network or create a new account.
You can create a new Spotify account directly from the PlayStation 4 console itself. You can also sign up for Spotify online and link it to your PlayStation Network account from the official website.
 Once you have created your Spotify account and linked it to your PlayStation Network account, you can listen to millions of music tracks that are available on Spotify.


You can listen to music from Spotify in the background while gaming, and can also control the tracks through your Spotify mobile app.
 To control the music playback during a game, long-press the “PS” button to bring up the Quick Menu.


You can use the “L1” button to move the track backwards, and the “R1” button to move the music track forward.
You can also control the volume of the music with the directional buttons on the controller.
 When you use Spotify Connect to play music on your PlayStation 4, you can control the playback and volume from your smartphone.


Whether you skip a track on your Spotify mobile app, pause the current track or increase the volume, all of the actions are mirrored to the music playback on your PlayStation 4.

 This step seems kind of obvious-you're going for a preppy image but a little bit "bad" since Slytherin is "evil" (but awesome).;
, It's quite easy to find one of these--ask any guy you know or just go and buy one. Just don't make it a purposely-Halloween-Slytherin one with the snake on it--that just screams amateur. You could also go with a scarf if it's cold.
 You can just wear the standard shirt with a collar over a tank top or find something at a vintage store. Get creative!


Some people will also want to have a sort of deconstructed blazer over their top. This is cool, but don't get overly preppy--try and destroy it a little bit (this is always fun).
 Make sure they're comfortable!

For this costume, costume jewelry is your friend--Slytherins are supposed to be more well off and sophisticated so feel free to load up on fake pearl necklaces and giant cocktail rings.






Horcruxes--make sure you get a Slytherin locket (like the one in the 6th and 7th book) and for your costume jewelry ring--see if it has a family crest on it and you can pass it off as a Marvolo Gaunt ring. If you want, you can also carry around a beat-up old book and say its Tom Riddle's diary.






Slytherin robe--if you buy one from one of those online costume retailers, it will look amateur (of course, you can buy one as a last resort). If you have a black sheet, try to sew it together. Add a green ribbon lining and get creative in leaving a snake emblem on the robe. Make sure it doesn't drag on the ground--that would be rather disgusting.






Dark Mark--every good Death Eater and Slytherin has one of these. Draw it in Sharpie (just make sure it doesn't smudge) or get a temporary tattoo.






Wand--obviously this is necessary or you'll be a Muggle wannabe.

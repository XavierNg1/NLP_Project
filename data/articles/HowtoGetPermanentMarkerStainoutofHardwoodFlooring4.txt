 Remove the cap from a dry erase marker. Carefully color over the permanent marker stain with the dry erase marker. Let it sit for 1 minute., Use a dry, clean rag to wipe the stained area. As you wipe off the dry erase marker, the permanent marker stain should come off too., If the dry erase marker only removed part of the stain or caused the permanent marker stan to fade, repeat the process. If this did not work, try a different method.

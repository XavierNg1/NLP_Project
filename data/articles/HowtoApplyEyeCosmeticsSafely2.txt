 Poorly maintained eye makeup can harbor bacteria and fungi. If shared, it may also be a source of transferring viruses and other infections. Good care for your eye makeup includes:

Keep all brushes and applicators cleaned on a regular basis.
Replace eye makeup that hasn't been used every three to six months.
Avoid trying to make eye makeup go further by the addition of other substances––you risk creating unknown reactions, such as allergies or rashes.
Close make-up containers tightly after using them each day. This keeps the product in a good, safe condition for a longer period of time.
Keep eyeliner pencils sharp; this helps to avoid digging into or scratching at your eyes., Store in a cool, dry and dark place away from direct sunlight. Keep your cosmetics away from extreme heat or cold, as these extremes tend to break down the preservatives and can speed up bacterial growth. Keep eye cosmetics out of your hot steamy bathroom and other humid areas––the damp heat breaks down the preservatives and the moisture provides a happy place for bacteria to live., It is recommended that you replace these items every two to three months. This vigilance will help to thwart the spread of infections like ringworm, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and sties.
 You can never be sure what infections might be transferred this way––the person sharing with you may not even be aware that she or he has an infection. It is not an indication of lacking trust––it's common sense and good precaution.

 Doctor Who was very different from 1963 to 1989 than it is today. New series fans have scrutinized it for its bad visuals and special effects, weird planets, and low production values. Take all this into account when you're deciding. Also remember that classic Who also ran in a serialized format, with stories ranging anywhere from 1 to 12 episodes to complete one story arc.
 There were eight classic Doctors so you have some options. Here is a list of good starting points and the year in which they were broadcast:


An Unearthly Child (1963)
The War Games (1969)
Spearhead from Space (1970)
Terror of the Autons (1971)
The Three Doctors (1972-73)
The Time Warrior (1973-74)
The Ribos Operation (1978)
The Keeper of Traken (1981)
Kinda (1982)
The Five Doctors (1983), There is no reason to watch the series chronologically, if you don’t find it interesting. Track recurring characters and monsters that you’re interested in. If you like the Master or Cybermen, track down all the episodes they appear on by using the internet. There are several fan websites that track characters and monsters and present a full list of episodes they appear in., In the late 1960s and the 1970s the BBC wanted to reuse videotape so they wouldn't have to keep buying more, and as a result, multiple episodes from the first three Doctors' eras were "lost to time." Thankfully though, all of the Third Doctor's era has been recovered and missing episodes are starting to turn up in unexpected places. So there is hope yet., Let the cliffhanger hang and leave it there. Either watch the next episode the night after or the next week, or you can watch an episode from a different story and then come back.

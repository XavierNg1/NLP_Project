 Rarity pays attention to her looks and image. Speak politely and call friends "Darling". Don't get down and dirty like a tomboy, but don't be stuck up. Girls such as Rarity like to become popular, and that is where you will find fashionable friends who are like you, but do not ever abandon others.
 Wear lots of mascara and maybe even falsies! Blue eyeshadow is nice, but only if it looks good on you. Curl your hair, but not crazy Pinkie curls! Find your style and accessorize it with lots of jewelry, but don't overdo it. Keep up with the latest trends and gossip mags as well.
 Give friends makeovers and tips. It's hard to be a fashion loving elegant girl and not selfish, but learn to give more than you receive and you will be fine.
 Romance and drama will make the world seem glamorous for you to be the spotlight. If you are sad, be in despair! If you are happy, you are splendid! If you have a crush, it might be love!

, Unless you are from Britain, don't speak like you are. Don't be too snobby. It's hard to get Rarity right without being a little too stuck up. Find a balance.

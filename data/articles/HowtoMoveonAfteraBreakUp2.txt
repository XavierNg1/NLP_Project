 This will be uncomfortable for the both of you and it will not help you move on after your break up.


Make it clear to your ex that you wish to put some distance between the two of you. Sometimes, former partners think they can stay friends. While this might be possible down the road, the weeks and months immediately following your break up are not good times to keep in touch.
 If Sunday brunch with your ex-girlfriend's mom was on your schedule permanently, you will have to cancel and fill that time slot with something else.
 It is over, so it was not the perfect fairy tale you might be imagining now.
 If you really want to move on, you cannot be Facebook friends.

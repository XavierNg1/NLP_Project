 The best way to identify a Dalmatian is by looking at the dog’s markings. Dalmatians are white dogs that have round black or reddish brown spots. Ideally the spots should be distributed across the entire body and there should be no large patches.Spots are usually smaller on the head, legs, and tail.When Dalmatians are born they are completely white in colour and develop spots as they age.;
, Some Dalmatians may have dark blue or tricoloured spots. These colour variations are not accepted as the breed standard for dog shows, but they can still be found on some Dalmatians. Typically tricoloured Dalmatians will be white with dark spots, as well as a few brown patches located on the head, legs, chest, and tail.Some Dalmatians may have large black patches on their coat.
 The Dalmatian has a short, smooth, and silky coat. When you pet a Dalmatian, the top of their head feels velvety., Dalmatians shed considerably throughout the year. Brush the dog’s hair frequently in order to manage the shedding.

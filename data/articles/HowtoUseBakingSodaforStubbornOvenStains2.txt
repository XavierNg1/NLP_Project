 After at least 12 hours, wipe away the baking soda paste and grime from your oven surfaces. Use a damp dish cloth to remove this solid residue as best as possible.


You can use a plastic or silicone spatula to gently remove paste that may have become hardened or stuck in a hard-to-reach place.Donâ€™t worry about getting oven surfaces completely clean and dry in this step. Focus on removing the built-up food and residue and most of the baking soda paste.
 Spray down the oven surfaces with water and wipe away any remaining residue of food stains or baking soda with a damp or dry cloth. You can also spray white vinegar for this step before wiping down.


If using vinegar, spray it lightly onto any areas that have some remaining baking soda. The mixture will foam slightly from the resulting chemical reaction.
Make sure to remove all signs of baking soda as best as possible before using your oven again. Baking soda left in contact with a heating element tends to smoke badly when the oven is turned on., Apply more baking soda and water/vinegar to let sit if stubborn stains still persist after the first application. You can apply baking soda to just the location of the stain if necessary.


You can try applying baking soda directly to a wet sponge or other scrubbing material to rub right on the stain for removal. If scrubbing is unsuccessful, re-treat with the baking soda paste overnight.
Use another oven cleaning product if you wish, but the combination of baking soda, water, and 12+ hours to sit is typically effective for nearly all stubborn oven stains.

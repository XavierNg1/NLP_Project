 Unlike the other methods that require leaving the tree standing, this method involves cutting the tree down, making it the best method for trees blocking a view or any other reason where you want the tree gone immediately. Since you will have to cut the tree down, start by taking every precaution involved with operating the chainsaw and keeping the area where the tree will fall secured.
 As with the other herbicidal methods, you will need to coat the cuts with glyphosate or triclopyr as soon as the tree has been cut down. You should mix the herbicide in a spray bottle prior to cutting down the tree.
 For smaller trees, the tree’s drop zone is much shallower and easier to work with, but if you’re dealing with a larger tree, you will need to take more precautions in cutting it down. For a full explanation of how to cut down the tree safely, check How to Fell a Tree.


For large trees, consider hiring a professional to cut down the tree for you.
 Many people don’t realize that cutting down a tree alone does not kill the root system. Often, the root system will send up new sprouts instead. By applying a coating of herbicide to the exposed sapwood in the trunk, you can treat the root system and keep it as well.For smaller trees, you can simply coat the entire cross section of the trunk. For large trees, the hardened middle section of the tree will not absorb any herbicide, so you can simply coat a band of the herbicide around the outermost ring where you can still see the lighter-colored sapwood.

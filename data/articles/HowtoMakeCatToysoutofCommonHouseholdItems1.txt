 As an alternative, you can simply use an empty cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper.;
, Thread the string so that you will be able to dangle the cardboard securely from the end. The toy should begin to look like a pendulum that you will swing in front of your cat.
 This will keep the cardboard sitting on the string and hold the toy together while you move it around.
 The goal is to make the toy agile and maneuverable so that when you move it, it will look as much as possible like a living thing. This allows your pet to feel like it is catching prey.

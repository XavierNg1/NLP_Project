Purchase and use a dehumidifier if your humidity levels are too high. Remember to regularly empty the water it collects from your house.
 Stagnant air can be harmful to breathe as it may have accumulated allergens, microbes, or other irritants. Create airflow in your house to let fresh air enter your space and allow stale air an exit.Opening a few windows is the easiest way to create airflow in your house.
You may also try to place a fan, either pulling air in or pushing air out, to help increase airflow.
HVAC systems may be installed in your home to greatly improve air quality.

Finally, scrub for another five minutes and rinse clean., Slowly pour one cup (240 mL) muriatic acid into one gallon (7.57 L) of water in a bucket. Next, apply the water and acid to the grout with a paint brush and wait a few minutes. Rinse the acid completely off the grout and then neutralize any remaining acid by applying a solution of one cup (240 mL) ammonia and one gallon (7.57 L) of water.

Don’t add water to the acid or you might cause a dangerous reaction.

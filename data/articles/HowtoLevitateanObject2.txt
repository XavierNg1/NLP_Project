 You can also use any thin elastic string and make it into a loop yourself. You can purchase pre-made loops or create your own. It’s essentially an elastic band. If you make your own, simply tie two ends together into a small knot to form a loop.
Start with your loop around your wrist like a bracelet. Or, if it feels more comfortable to you, position your loop around your index finger and the outside of your thumb.
This is a great method for doing up-close street magic on the spot.
 You can ask a spectator for a dollar and levitate it without much prep.


Because your loop is so thin and light, you will need a light object that won’t break the thread.
 This will allow you to hook the loop with your other hand while you wave it over the object, preparing it to levitate. Begin explaining that you’re going to levitate the object using the energy created from your hands.
 You can begin to rub your hands together around the object, and while you do so, get your finger under your loop.


You want to grab the loop with your other hand and begin to stretch it.
With the loop going around both hands you now have a small platform to balance the object on.
 As you hook your loop around your other finger, slide it forward so it’s stretching across your palm. Use your fingers from both hands to get the object on top of the string.


This will allow you to quickly balance the object on top of your loop, making it look like it's levitating.
 Begin to slowly move your hands apart. You can show the object levitating in the space between your hands.


Be careful to move your hands slowly so as not to break the loop or cause your object to fall.
 You don’t want to levitate the object for too long and give the audience a chance to see the loop. So as you grab the object, release the loop from your hand. It will snap back to the hand you had it wrapped it around. You can now let your audience inspect the object to see that it is ordinary.

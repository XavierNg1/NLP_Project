 It's the black, apple-shaped icon in the upper-left of your screen.;
,, It's in the center of the preferences window.


If you don't see all of the System Preferences icons, click on the "Show All" button -- three rows of four dots -- in the top bar of the dialog box.
 It's near the top of the dialog box.
 If it's available, it will be in the lower left of the dialog box.


If you don't see a "Silent Clicking" checkbox, use "Tap to Click" to silence your Mac's trackpad.
When Tap to Click is enabled, you merely tap the trackpad with one finger -- like on an iPhone or iPad -- instead of depressing it. Thus, the trackpad will no longer "click" when you click on something.
 Make sure the box is blue and contains a checkmark. You have now enabled silent clicking on your Mac.

 If you have multiple optical drives, make sure that you insert it in one that can burn discs. The AutoPlay window will appear with a list of options.


You do not need to format the disc if you are burning an audio CD.
You cannot format a burned CD-R, but you can format a burned CD-RW.
If the AutoPlay notification doesn't appear, or you accidentally closed it, open Windows Explorer by pressing ⊞ Win+E. Double-click on your drive with the blank disc in it.;
, This will open a new window with your disc formatting options.
 By default, Windows will display today's date. You can change the title of the disc to whatever you'd like.
 There are two different options available, depending on how you plan to use your disk. Click Next once you've chosen your option. Formatting your disc will take up a slight amount of storage space."Like a USB flash drive" - This uses the Live File System, and allows you to continue to add files later, as well as edit and rewrite existing files. This format can only be read by Windows computers. This is the best option for CD-RW discs, as it allows them to easily be rewritten.
"With a CD/DVD player" - When the files are burned, the disc is "Mastered", which finalizes the contents of the disc. This is best for large amounts of files, or when you need to use the CD on another operating system. This is the best option for CD-R discs.
 Once your disc is formatted, you can start adding your files to be burnt. See this guide for more details.


If you are using Windows XP, see this guide.
 If you want to quickly erase the data of a CD-RW file so that you can add new data to it, you can use the Format tool to do so.

Right-click on the CD-RW on your drive list.
Select Format...

Leave all the options at their defaults.
Enter in a new name for the disc if you wish.
Click Start. All of the data on the CD-RW will be deleted. The formatting process will take a few moments.

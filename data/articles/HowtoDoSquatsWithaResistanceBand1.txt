 Resistance bands vary in tension (how much force they can resist when pulled). Usually, you will want to choose a medium-moderate tension band. If you have little to no experience doing squats or using resistance bands, try a lower tension band, which is more elastic. A high tension band is for very fit, experienced users and is more difficult to stretch.;
, This means ensuring the right and left sides of the resistance band are equal in length. To do this, grab the handles of the resistance band and dangle the elastic portion in front of you, on the floor.Place the arches of both feet firmly in the center of the band and stand up straight with your feet hip width apart.
 Make sure you have an equal length of each band on each side. To do this, keep your feet on the band and bring the handles together in front of you without stretching the band. If the handles meet in a symmetrical “kiss,” your bands are balanced.









If they are unbalanced, step off the band try to balance the resistance band again. You may need to step onto the band more than once to find its center. As you get more familiar with the resistance band, you’ll learn to more intuitively find the band’s center.
 While standing straight up, lift the handles of the resistance band above your shoulders. Keep the bands behind your arms and keep your elbows down to keep the band in place. Your hands, gripping the handles of the resistance band, should have their backs facing directly behind you and palms forward.

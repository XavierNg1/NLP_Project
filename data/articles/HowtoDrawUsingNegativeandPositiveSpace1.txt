 The design doesn't have to be overly complicated; when working with negative and positive space, simplicity often works best.;
, The background is the negative space, and the subject is the positive space. By colouring just one, you'll create stark contrast between the two, and change the effect of your piece.
 Observe how the switched colors can change the overall impression of the drawing; to get the full effect, you can make two identical images with different colouring choices and display them together.

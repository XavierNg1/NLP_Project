 You can draw a lot of inspiration from your pup’s coat color. For instance, if you have a puppy with a brown coat, you could name him “Rolo”, “Chocolate”, or “Brownie”. Or, if your dog has a curly coat, you might consider naming her “Curls”., Look at your puppy’s paws, ears, face, tail--anywhere. Are there any unique markings or other special identifiers that other dogs don’t commonly have?


For instance, if your puppy has two white front paws, you might think about naming her “Mittens” or something like that.
 If you have an especially tiny pup, or a huge dog, you could use that characteristic to help guide your name choice. You could even play off his size by naming him something opposite to what he actually is.For example, you could name your tiny dog “Sampson” and your large dog “Tiny”.
 Given a couple of days, your new dog’s personality will really shine through. Try “Cuddles" for the sweet little guy who loves to get cozy or “Puddles" for the pooch who can’t seem to find the doggie door. Watch how he interacts with your family, or pay attention to any silly habits you might have.

Research which licenses and permits you need to open a tea room in your chosen area.
Calculate how much you will need to pay employees, accountants, and other supporting staff.
Reserve a portion of your budget for marketing and advertising, as this is key to making your tea room more visible to customers.
 Unless you have the money yourself, you will need to get a loan from the bank, or have investors put up the funding you need for your tea room.
 You can either open a tea room at a new location, or buy an existing tea room. Whatever you choose, make sure you have enough traffic to attract customers.
 Make sure to give it a unique but pleasant style that will set it apart while still inviting customers in.
 Remember to make up a menu that offers something to please both conservative and adventurous palates in order to maximize your customer base.
 The success of your tea room will depend in large part on how your staff treats customers, as well as how proficient they are at preparing tea, so make sure to hire people who are polite, friendly, and efficient.

 Raise the temperature of the kiln to 850°F (455°C) for 12 hours. This will produce "bisque" or "unglazed pottery." This initial firing removes the physical and chemical water so that the piece can be glazed without returning to mud and breaking. Ranges of temperature are referred to as "cones" in the ceramics world.Allow the temperature to drop and remove the pottery 48 hours later after the temperature has completely cooled.
 Keep in mind that glaze will run. Cover the bottom of your pottery with wax to shield it from sticking to the kiln shelf itself. If you want more precise lines, paint with "bisque stain" and then cover with a clear glaze.


If your surface isn't smooth, use a 100 grit sandpaper or a kitchen paring knife edge to make it so. Then sponge the entire surface of the pot to remove any dust left from sanding to provide a clean surface for the glaze to adhere to.Glazing takes on a number of forms. You can dip, brush, sponge, or etch -- just to get the list started. Use wax to keep the bottom from getting glaze on it during firing. You can also buy glazes in liquid or dry form. If you want to be a real pro, eventually you can make your own.
 Depending on your clay, the size of the object, and the glaze, you may need a kiln that hits 2500° Fahrenheit (1148° C).


Overnight, warm up your kiln at very low heat. Spend two hours at low heat (an increase in temperature of no more than 200°F per hour) and then two hours at medium heat (an increase in temperature of no more than 300°F per hour). Finally, finish at high heat (an increase in temperature of 300 to 400°F per hour) until the required temperature has been reached.
 It may have rested on the bottom of the kiln in an awkward position, forcing it to lose its flat bottom. Smooth it so that it sits without wobbling on a surface such as a table or shelf.


Add felt onto the bottom of your object if you so desire. Then, admire your finished product!

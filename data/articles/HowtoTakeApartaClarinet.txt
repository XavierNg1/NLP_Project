 First, loosen the screws so taking if off would require little to no pressure to the reed, as it is very delicate. Keep it aside; unpacking the full clarinet might require to use the ligature again.;
, If played for a long time, the reed would most likely stick on due to the moisture in the reed. Take it off gently and remove excess moisture. Put it in its reed case and put it away.
 Most people take the mouthpiece off first. Unlike the rest of the clarinet, do not run a swab through the mouthpiece. Instead, clean it separately about once every one or two weeks.
, Sometimes the barrel can get a bit stuck, so carefully grip the clarinet in a way that does not bend the keys when you pull on the barrel. A good method for doing so is to grip the top of the first section with one hand, and to twist the barrel while pulling upwards with the other hand. Usually the barrel collects the most spit out of all the parts of the clarinet, so taking the swab and dabbing out excess water inside of it is usually a good idea.
 These can sometimes be hard to remove as well, so like with the barrel, take care not to damage any keys when pulling them apart. A good method for doing this is to grip each joint with one hand, and to twist slightly back and forth while pressing down on the bridge key as you pull them out.
 Simply grip the bell with one hand and the lower half of the bottom joint with the other. Carefully pull the bell off.
 Put the parts in their proper spots. If you have trouble closing the case, one or more parts have been put in wrong.

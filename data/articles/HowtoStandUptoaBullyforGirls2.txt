 Don't suffer silently. Talk to a friend about what you're experiencing. Sharing your pain will help you feel better, and create an opportunity for your friend to offer additional emotional support.


Telling a friend about being bullied will also establish an ally who can help you avoid the bully and create a buffer when avoidance isn't possible.
 Talking to an adult doesn't mean she will intervene. If you would prefer she didn't intervene, you might tell her you'd like guidance, but you want to try handling the situation yourself before adults get involved.She could be a family member, school counselor, family friend, or a coach.


This will put the bullying behavior on an adult's radar, so she can intervene in the event you are in over your head and establishes evidence should you need to file a formal complaint in the future.

The adult can help you decide when it is time to formally report bullying behavior.
 Online forums are a good way to share your experience, if you are too embarrassed to talk to people you know.Many forums have experienced members who may be able to offer encouragement and suggestions to help you manage your situation.


This also creates an opportunity for you to support others who are victims of bullies and may be a source of new friendships.

 The flowers on your orchid should be dead before you prune the spike. To cause as little potential damage as possible, you should also wait until the top of the spike shows signs of yellowing.


Note that this type of pruning should only be done to mature orchids that have reached a minimum foliage height of 12 inches (30.5 cm).
 Look at the bracts or beige bands running down the spike, each positioned roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart. The inactive bud should be located just below the widest bract.


This bottom bract should widen into the shape of a shield.
When you prune the orchid just above this bud, you cut away a portion of the spike containing hormones that prevent the bud from growing. In doing so, you allow the bud to begin growing again, and you may see a new spike growing within a few weeks. This spike has the potential to flower again.
 Grab the spike with your non-dominant hand and keep it upright and steady. With your dominant hand and a sharp cutting tool, cut the spike 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the wide, shield-shaped bract.

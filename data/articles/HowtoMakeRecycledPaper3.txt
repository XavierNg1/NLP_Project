 After an hour has passed, lay a piece of sheet or another thin fabric on top of the pulp on the screen. Then, press down firmly on the sheet with a dry sponge to squeeze out all the excess water from the paper pulp. The goal is to transfer the paper from the screen to this sheet. The sheet should be flat, clean, dry, and unwrinkled so that it is a suitable mold for your paper., The paper should release onto the sheet. Lay it on a flat surface to dry overnight, or for a few hours at minimum. Keep it in a warm, dry place.


Try not to place the drying paper under direct heat, or very close to a powerful heating source. This might cause the paper to crinkle and dry unevenly.
 When the paper pulp is dry, carefully peel it away from the cloth. You should now have a sheet of dry, firmly-pressed, functional paper! If it works, you can use the same equipment to produce as much recycled paper as you like., Write on the paper with pencil and pen to gauge its quality. Figure out whether it is absorbent enough; whether it is clear enough to see the words; and whether it will hold up as a durable and passable sheet of paper. If you plan to make more paper, take notes on this batch so that you can improve your product next time.


If the paper grit is too rough, it's probably because you didn't grind up the pulp finely enough. If it's falling apart, then you may not have used enough water to bind the paper fibers together.
If the paper is too colorful (to the point that it's difficult to see the words that you write,) then you may need to use more consistently-colored source paper. Try using all white paper next time.

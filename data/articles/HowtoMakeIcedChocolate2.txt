 This part is a bit tricky, so there's no shame in starting with store-bought sauce instead. If you're up for making it yourself, browse your options here or try this simple recipe:



Make a double boiler and pour a little water into the lower section.
Combine 7 oz (200g) finely chopped chocolate (any type) and ½ cup (120mL) heavy cream in the top of the double boiler. This is enough to make plenty of leftovers.
Bring to a simmer and stir constantly, until ingredients are mixed. If the chocolate loses its shine, reduce heat. If the sauce turns grainy, it's been overheated and is no longer usable.
 Blend 1 tbsp (15mL) chocolate sauce, 1½ cups (360mL) milk, ¾ cup (180mL) vanilla or chocolate ice cream, and a generous scoop of crushed ice. To make an ice cream float instead of a thick, sludgy drink, add the ice cream after blending instead.


If you don't have a blender, whisk the chocolate sauce into the milk and top with ice cream and crushed ice.
Adjust the amounts however you like. Depending on the type and brand of chocolate, you may need to add more chocolate sauce.
 Serve in a long glass with a straw and spoon. Optionally, add a drizzle of chocolate sauce on top, chopped nuts, or other ice cream toppings.

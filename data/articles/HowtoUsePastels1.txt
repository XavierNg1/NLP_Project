 Pour uncooked rice or sawdust in a box. Put your pastels inside. Close the box and shake it up.Pastels can get mixed colors on them from rubbing together, making them difficult to tell apart.;
, Experiment with different strokes on a scrap piece of paper first. Hold the pastel at the back end and color with the point or the edge of the tip to make thin, even lines. Press the stick down on the surface lengthwise and move it sideways to create thick, abstract lines. Hold the stick vertically near the tip and you can make thick, rounded markings.Thin lines are useful for linear objects like grass.
Thick abstract lines are good for making a textured background.
Big, round strokes can make cobblestones or bricks.
 Use a brush to move and blend color evenly. Try a tortillon (blending stump) for more linear blending. Try a lint-free rag for large areas. Use a paintbrush and water to blend a watercolor effect.You can also use your fingers, which can push the pastel further into the grip of the paper.
 Brush away excess color with a stiff-bristled brush. Rub a kneaded eraser gently over any mistakes. Try carefully scraping off pigment with a craft knife.You may want to practice this first on a scrap sheet.
 Cut out cardboard shapes. Trace around them with pastels on your drawing surface. Smudge the borders to achieve a “glowing” effect.For example, trace the shapes of Christmas lights or hearts.
This is a great project to do with kids.
 Color a landscape background with your chalk pastels. Dip a finger into tempera paint and rub it over your chalk drawing. Change fingers for different colors.For example, make a sunset or ocean scene with pastels. Then use white paint over it.
This technique is fun for children as well as adults, since it combines finger painting with drawing.

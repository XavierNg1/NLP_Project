 If you’re trying to remove a sticker from a light appliance, you can hold it over the flame, point the sticker at it. If you’re using this method on something you can’t easily lift, you’ll need to bring your flame to the sticker. Run the flame over the sticker for about 30 seconds, making sure to heat up the whole sticker evenly.You can use a lighter, candle or match as your open flame.
Don’t worry if you see black marks show up on your surface. As long as you haven’t kept the flame in one place for too long, these should wipe away easily.
 After running the flame over the sticker, the tenacious glue should have melted and burned. You should now be able to peel the sticker off with your fingers without too much trouble.If you’re still having trouble, you might need to heat up the sticker some more.
 You only need a few drops of coconut oil, which you can spread onto the sticker residue with your finger. You can then use a paper towel or a soft cloth to wipe away the sticker gunk. It should come off easily.You can also use the coconut oil to wipe the black marks caused by the flame.

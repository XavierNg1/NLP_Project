 Movies like Psycho are fiction. Keep in mind that it is statistically speaking, mentally ill people are no more violent than the average person.


Do not be wary of people with mental illness. Sometimes people can be wary and unsure how to act around a person with mental illness because they don't understand them. Treat them how you would treat yourself or a normal person.;
, Questions that seem harmless, like "Did you take your pills today?" can be very hurtful.  Often people with mental illness feel different from other people. If you are concerned that  something is wrong, try asking "Is everything okay?"

, They get sad, they fall in love, they get angry, etc. Don't treat them any differently to anyone else.
 It can be very upsetting for a person with mental illness if you ask them if they are mentally ill. Wait until they are ready to tell you.
 People with mental illnesses are human and complex like everyone else. Don't patronize them or be thoughtless just because they are different from other people. Treat them like you would a normal person.
 Some people feel more comfortable disclosing information than others. Wait until they are ready to tell you personal things.
 Try to increase your awareness and knowledge and educate yourself. With knowledge comes understanding.
 Anyone of any age, race, sexual orientation, gender, economic background and education level can have a mental illness.
 Look out for the person with mental illness and treat them as you would a friend.

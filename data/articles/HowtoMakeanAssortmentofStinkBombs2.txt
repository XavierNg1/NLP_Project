 You will need one plastic container, such as a water bottle, with a lid (do not use glass or anything that will break). Additionally you will need ammonia, a pair of scissors and one book of matches.Ammonia is a cleaning solution. Be careful with it.
 Toss the wooden sticks and empty matchbook away – you will only need the match heads. Put the match heads inside your plastic bottle.


The match heads contain the sulfur you need to create this bomb.
You could go out and buy the chemical sulfur in a powdered form, but this is generally hard to find and expensive.
Match heads are much easier to find and safer to use.
 Pour the ammonia over the match heads that you’ve already placed in the container. Fill up the container about halfway and then tightly screw the lid or cap back onto your container.Once you’ve put the lid on your stink bomb, allow it to sit for about 3-4 days. The chemicals inside will react and brew up the stench.
Be careful not to spill the ammonia and be sure to recap it tightly and put it away after you use it.
Never mix ammonia with bleach – it will create a highly toxic gas that can be lethal.
 Don’t take the lid off until you’re ready! Hide the stink bomb near whoever it is you’re pranking (such as in your sibling’s room, under the kitchen table, etc.).


This bomb will smell terrible, like rotten eggs.Be careful not to spill any of it on yourself!

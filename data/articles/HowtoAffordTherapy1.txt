 The easiest way to afford therapy is to find a therapist that is covered by your insurance plan. This will help cut down on your out of pocket cost because you just have to pay the copayment. Make sure you ask your therapist if your insurance covers her services.


If you aren't sure, contact your insurance company or look on their website.;
, Although it may seem like a taboo subject, most therapists understand that monetary issues are a fact of life. Do not be scared to talk to your therapist about how much sessions are going to cost or if you can get a lower rate negotiated with them for your services.If you are unsure if your therapist will offer payment options, ask for a short consultation with your therapist to ask about insurance and price issues.In these consultations, it may be difficult to bring it up. Start with phrases such as, "I would like to discuss payment options for my therapy." or "Can we discuss how to make your services more affordable?"

, Some therapists offer payment options, such as sliding scale payments, for those who do not have the money to pay for over priced therapy sessions. Sliding scale payment plans will shift the price of your therapy based on your income level.


These plans are often offered to those who have no insurance assistance so they can afford therapy.
Your therapist may not know about the billing options for the services, so ask the person in charge of billing about these types of payments., In addition to insurance plans, many employers offer employee assistance plans that include therapy. These plans offer counseling to employees at no additional costs.


These sessions are typically meant to be short term and will only consist of a limited number of sessions, typically between eight and 12. You would be responsible for the costs after this period.

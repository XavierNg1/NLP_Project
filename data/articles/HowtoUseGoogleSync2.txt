 On the menu of your phone, search for the Settings app. Tap it to open the Settings menu of your device.
 Scroll down the Settings menu and tap the “Accounts” option. A list of all linked accounts will be displayed. You will now need to add a new account.
 The “Add account” button is at the bottom of the listed accounts. A list of applications will pop up; select “Google” from here. A new page will open where you will be prompted to choose an existing account or create a new one.
 This option means you already have a Google account. You will be prompted to enter your email in the first text box and password in the second textbox. Then tap the “Next” button to go to the next screen that contains a list of Google services.
 Tap the small checkbox at the right-hand side of the services you want to include in the sync. Google services here include mail, contacts, and calendar. A green checkmark will appear, showing that it has been selected. Tap “Next” to finish the setup, and then go back to the Settings menu of the phone by tapping its Back button.
 Go back to Accounts screen (where you added an account). Select Google from the options that appears then click the email account you added. This will open another screen showing you the services you selected for syncing.
 Tap the “Sync” button at the bottom left of the screen to have the services synchronized from Google servers to your Android device. Wait for a few minutes for the process to complete.
 Now open the individual apps to view the information that was synchronized.

To view Google Calendar, open the Calendar app on your phone. All of your calendar data (events, tasks, etc.) will be visible on the app. Tap the calendar to view it.

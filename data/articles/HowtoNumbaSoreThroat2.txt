 Although viral throat infections are far more common (and resolve on their own within a few days), if you have any symptoms suggesting something more serious, such as strep throat, it is important to be evaluated by a physician.If you have two or more of the following symptoms, it is important to see your doctor to be tested for strep throat:Fever (in particular a temperature above 100.4ºF or 38ºC)
White "exudate" (visible white patches) on your tonsils or the back of your throat
Enlarged lymph nodes in your neck
Absence of cough (people rarely cough when they have strep throat)
Absence of runny nose (common cold symptoms such as runny nose do not occur with strep throat)

, If it turns out you do have strep throat, this will need to be treated promptly with a course of antibiotics., If you have a severe sore throat and a fever greater than 101°F or 38.3°C that is not improving after 24 – 48 hours (and if anything only getting worse), it is best to see your physician sooner rather than later.Also, if you have swollen glands in your neck or the back of your throat that make it difficult to swallow or breathe, you should definitely see your physician right away (or, if you can't make a same-day appointment, be seen in urgent care or the emergency department of your local hospital).This could be a sign that something more serious is going on, like a mononucleosis (mono) infection or tonsillitis, both of which need medical evaluation and treatment., If you have a very serious sore throat, whether it's strep throat or otherwise, you can see your physician for prescription pain medication.Medications such as naproxen can be given to you to help you cope with the pain until your sore throat resolves.

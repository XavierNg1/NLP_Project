 Before you can use this method, you need to terminate your employment with the employer who sponsors your retirement plan. (However, you do not have to retire altogether).You must also turn at least 55 in the year when you terminate employment.For example, if your birthday is in December, you can stop working at any point in that calendar year provided you turn 55 in December.
 You cannot use this method with an IRA. Instead, you can only use it with an employer-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k).If you are unsure about what kinds of accounts you have, then talk to your companyâ€™s employee benefits counselor. Set up a time to schedule a discussion.
 You will still need to pay taxes. You will, however, be able to avoid paying the 10% early distribution penalty.

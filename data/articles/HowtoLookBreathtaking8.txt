 Pretend there is an invisible string gently pulling you upwards from the top of your head.


Shoulders back, chest out, tummy in, head held high and smile. Don't overdo it or you will just look arrogant.
Good posture does more for you than you will ever know. It shows confidence, and gives your body a more beautiful and natural shape.

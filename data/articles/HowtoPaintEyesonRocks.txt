 Look in places such as your garden or a local park to find the right rock to paint. It is recommended to use a small round or oval shaped rock with a rough texture.;
, Pick the color that you will use for the iris. You can use popular eye colors such as brown or blue or make it stand out by using multiple colors or making it rainbow. You can even use glow in the dark paints. Also, you will need to use the colors red or pink, black and white or light grey.
 Paint the top half of the rock white/light grey and let it sit and dry. If needed, apply a second coat of paint. Repeat on bottom half of rock.
 Once you have found the place you are happy with you can paint a circle in black to be the pupil. If you are afraid of making a mistake you may want to start by drawing the shape lightly in pencil first. Once you have done that let it dry.
 Using the color or colors you have chosen for the iris paint it as a circle around the pupil and the carefully fill it in. When this has dried you may want to paint lines of the color in different shades to create a more realistic look.
 These could be outlining the iris in a dark color or adding a highlight to the pupil.
 Start by turning the rock over to the other side and choose where you want the veins to come from. Using red/pink paint and a small brush paint squiggly lines coming from the point where you want your veins to start. For a more realistic effect try painting the start of the vein darker and make it go lighter until it fades. This can be achieved by adding water to the paint.
 Once you have let the all the paint dry you can now put them anywhere to add a decorative touch. Perhaps you can put them in your backyard or up on a shelf.

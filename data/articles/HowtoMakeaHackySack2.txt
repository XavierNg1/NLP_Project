 Balloon sacks are super quick and easy to make. They won't last as long as other hacky sacks, but a replacement will only cost you a few minutes and a dip in the change jar.
 Get a round, uninflated balloon. Stretch the opening wide and push in the end of a funnel.


If you don't have a funnel, make one out of paper.
 Sand-filled sacks are easy to "stall" on the foot, useful for beginners or people learning tricks.Birdseed, dried beans or lentils, uncooked rice, or small beads are other fine alternatives. Fill the balloon to the neck.
 Remove any dangling rubber, to make the sack spherical.


If using fine sand, you may want to tie a knot instead. This helps stop sand leaking out, but the knot will make the ball bumpy.
 Pull another balloon over the exposed hole and around the whole ball. Cut off the neck. Repeat with at least two more balloons, covering each previous hole.For a stronger sack, use up to ten balloons.


For decoration, you can cut small holes in the balloons so the different color shows through.

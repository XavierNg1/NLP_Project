, Include the shape of the garden bed plus landmarks like trees, bushes, fences, and walls.



Vary the color of the flowers and foliage. Plan to put the same kind of plant in several places so the colors will repeat. This creates more visual appeal.
Place plants according to height. The tallest plants should go in the back or center of the garden and the shortest in the front or around the edges.
Plant perennials with varied blooming schedules so your garden will display colorful flowers throughout the year.
Consider the light requirements of the plants. You may be able to arrange your plants so the tallest receive full sun while the shortest plants are shaded. Generally, however, you will have to limit your choices according to how much sun the garden gets.
 Show each plant in the cluster.


Clusters consisting of odd numbers of plants arranged in triangular patterns are the most visually appealing.



Small plants need 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) between them
Medium-sized plants need 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) between them.
Tall plants need 18 to 36 inches (45 to 90 cm) between them.

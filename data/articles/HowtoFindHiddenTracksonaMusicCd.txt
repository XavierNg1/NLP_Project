 Search engines will come in useful for this. Simply put in the artist, the title of the CD, and the words "hidden track.";
, Make sure what you have is an original copy of the CD and not a burned copy, because the hidden track might not always be available on a home-burned version of the CD. (See next step for explanation.)

, Most of the time hidden tracks are either at the very end of the CD or even hidden at the beginning. Home-burned CDs probably will contain the track at the end, but if the track happens to be hidden at the beginning, causing you to have to rewind backwards, it probably won't be there on a home-burned CD.
 Start playing the first track of the CD and then press the rewind button on your player. If there is a hidden track at the beginning of the CD, pressing rewind will cause it to back up into the hidden track. If you find that there is a hidden track, press rewind until you get the beginning of the hidden track, and then listen to it as normal.
 Play the last track on the CD, and then fast forward until you hear sound playing. It can be hidden behind as little as a couple of minutes of silence or as much as twenty minutes. Just keep fast forwarding the CD until you hear the song, or if you're patient enough, simply wait out the silence.
 You've just listened to the hidden track on your CD!

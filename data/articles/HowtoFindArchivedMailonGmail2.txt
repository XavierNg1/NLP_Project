 Ensure that you are logged in with your Google account.
 Archived messages will still appear as search results, so if you know the sender, subject, part of the body, or any other part of the message, search for it by tapping the magnifying glass at the top of the screen.
 If a label was applied to a message that was archived, it can still be found sorted by that label. Tap the Menu button in the upper-left corner of the screen and scroll down to browse through your labels.
 This will display all of the mail in your Gmail account, regardless of its label or whether or not it's archived.


Archived messages are not indicated by any label or other indicator. An archived message simply has the "Inbox" label removed so that it no longer appears in your inbox.
 Tap "Move to Inbox" to return the archived message back to the inbox.

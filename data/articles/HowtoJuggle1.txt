 Beanbags are good for beginners. Basically, find balls that will not bounce a lot, or roll away when they're dropped––this will save a fair bit of running initially! A set of beanbags can be bought for a very low price or made by hand. Tennis balls filled with sand or a few pennies and covered with a round balloon also work well. They don't bounce and they provide a slip-free grip.


While you're at it, choose a suitable place to work in. At the very beginning, balls will end up flying everywhere, so it's best not to stand near granny's precious oil lamp or dad's collection of ceramic cows.;
, Start passing one ball from one hand to the other. Also practice "selfies" –– these are throws you catch with the throwing hand. The ball should come to eye-height or higher. Your hands should not move very much, so aim to keep your elbows at your hips.
 This is a technique to make juggling smooth. Simply scoop, or dip, your hand before tossing the ball. Keep the dip shallow though; it isn't going to work if you scoop too deeply. Practice scooping and tossing from one hand to another, so that arc does not rise above eye level.









Simply mimic the movements of jugglers. If you were to "air juggle," do you find yourself moving your hands in small circles? You're already scooping!

, Toss ball A, and when it reaches the top of its arc, toss ball B. Practice until this simple exchange becomes comfortable.










At the top is key here. This will give you the most time for your next catch. When you start working with 3, 4, and 5, this becomes especially important.

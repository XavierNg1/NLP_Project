 Choose a 'family genre' that they can relate to, for example - sports. That particular family could be keen sports players, or they could just share a love of sports.;
, If your family loves sports, dress them in shorts and t-shirts. Call your family names according to the genre as well. For example, our sport-crazy family could be called the 'Wimbledon' family, and they could each be named after famous tennis players - Rafael, Roger, Serena and Venus.
 For the Wimbledon family, they would be born under Aries, Sagittarius or Cancer, the active star signs, and their aspiration would be either popularity or fortune.
 Roger and Serena, the parents, for example, would have turn-ons and offs to match each others looks and current fitness level - high, in this case.
 The Wimbledon family would be moved into a house with a large garden and a home-gym.
 Feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner, and an extra snack, if they get hungry. Remember that your Sims will have to work off those extra snacks! Direct your family to have baths or showers every morning and night, to keep them smelling fresh. If they have just exercised, an extra shower can be added. Make your child and teenage Sims to do their homework, and don't let them be late for school! Make sure one of your adult Sims has a job, to keep the money rolling in. Make friends, direct your Sims on dates and treat them by fulfilling their Wants.

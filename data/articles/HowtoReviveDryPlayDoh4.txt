 Sometimes dried out Play-Doh is too far gone to rehydrate, but making your own is a fun and inexpensive way to replace it, and it’s so easy that even the kids can help. To make playdough, you will need:


2 ½ cups of water
1 ¼ cups of salt
1 ½ tablespoons of cream of tartar
5 tablespoons of vegetable oil
2 ½ cups of flour
Food coloring

, Cook over low heat and stir frequently. Continue stirring and cooking until the ingredients come together to form a ball of dough in the center of the pan. You’ll know it’s ready when it has the consistency of regular playdough., If the dough is too warm to handle, set it aside and let it cool. In the meantime, decide how you want to divide your dough and what colors you want to make.
 Form as many smaller balls as you need depending on how many different colors of playdough you want to make.
 On a cutting board or non-porous counter, knead each ball of dough and work in a single color at a time. Add food coloring until the desired intensity is achieved. Repeat for every playdough color you want to make.
 Keep playdough in an air-tight container, and don’t leave it out if it’s not in use. If you don't do this, it will solidify and become impossible to use.

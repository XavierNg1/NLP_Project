 Chemical burns are generally best cared for by removing the victim from the contaminated area and removing contaminated clothing. From there, dilute the chemical on the skin by washing it consistently with fresh, running water. Wash the affected area for at least 20 minutes.Chemical burns can be caused by a number of products, including household cleaners such as drain cleaners which contain sulphuric acid, refrigerant which contains hydrofluoric acid, and bleach.If available, use a chemical shower or eye rinse station to rinse the burn. Use copious amounts of water to dilute the chemical burn.
Even if the burn is small or isolated, contact a doctor immediately to assess whether the victim should come in for care and to discuss treatment.
 Unplug the source of the electrical shock if possible, or stand on a rubber mat in a dry area and use a dry wooden object to push the person away from the electrical source. Once contact with the electrical source has been broken, check for a heartbeat and see if the individual responds to talk or touch.After the individual has been safely removed from the electrical source, call emergency services immediately. Major electrical burns may come with other complications that need immediate medical treatment.
Even minor electrical burns should be examined by a doctor as soon as possible.
Never directly touch a live electrical source or a person caught in such a source yourself.
 If a burn results from molten plastic or tar, immediately cool the plastic or tar by running it under cool water. Do not peel off the plastic or tar. Instead, use mineral oil to see if you can remove it. Then, treat the burned skin by washing it with cool water and loosely bandaging it in a clean dressing.Contact your doctor if you cannot gently remove the plastic or tar from your skin, or if you experience excess pain from the burn.
Do not dress the exposed burn with any ointments, as these may cause infection.

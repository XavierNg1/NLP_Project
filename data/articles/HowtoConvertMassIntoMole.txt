 The equation you'll need is n=mM{\displaystyle n={\frac {m}{M}}}, or the numbers of moles n{\displaystyle n} is equal to the mass m{\displaystyle m} divided by the molar mass M{\displaystyle M}.
 For example, if you have to calculate how many moles go into 74 g of hydrogen peroxide, you'll get n=74g37gmol{\displaystyle n={\frac {74g}{37{\frac {g}{mol}}}}}, since you have 74 g of hydrogen peroxide, and the molar mass is 37 gmol{\displaystyle {\frac {g}{mol}}}.
 Gram is both in the numerator and denominator, so that cancels out. Mole is in a denominator in a denominator, which leaves you with mole in the numerator. The final answer is n=7437mol=2mol{\displaystyle n={\frac {74}{37}}mol=2mol}.

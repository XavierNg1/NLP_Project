 Within Super Smash Bros., the goal is to eliminate all of your opponents stocks in order to win the game. This is done by using attacks to raise your opponent's percentage. Once they are at a high percentage, around 100%, you will want to seal the kill. Although the down smash is not the best option for this for many characters, it can be effective in certain situations.
 You can seal a kill with a down smash in multiple ways. These ways include reading a roll in from an opponent and punishing with a down smash to kill, as well as two-framing an opponent at the ledge to effectively put them in a position where they cannot recover. Lastly, you can convert to a down smash after an attack which puts the opponent on the ground.

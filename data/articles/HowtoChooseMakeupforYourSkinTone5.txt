People with warm skin tones can wear eye shadow with a golden hue, such as greens, browns, gold or pinks.
If you are a cool skin type, pick eye shadows in blues, grays, silver, pinks, and plums. Choose an eye shadow that is right for your eye color and skin color as well as your skin tone.
For darker skin types and eye colors, darker, bolder eye-shadow is easier to wear.

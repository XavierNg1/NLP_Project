 Walk up to the place where you’re going to sit, whether it’s a dining room chair, a stool, or a car. Turn around, so that your back is facing the chair. Back up so that the backs of your legs are touching the chair (they can also be a couple inches away).;
, Using both hands, smooth the pleats of your kilt against your body. They should lie flat against your body, so that you sit on your pleats.If you do not sit on your pleats, they will become wrinkled.
 Once you’ve smoothed out your kilt, you should feel free to sit down. Make sure that you’re sitting on your kilt, not directly on the chair.

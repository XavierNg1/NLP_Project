 This is a very important step, so do it thoroughly, especially underneath the nails, and use plenty of soap and warm water. You'll want to avoid touching the pimple with your finger nails, but just in case you do, having them clean will reduce the likelihood of irritation and infection.Consider using a fingernail brush to get dirt out from under your fingernails.
 Put on disposable gloves just before you're ready to pop the pimple. Not only will this put a barrier between any remaining bacteria on your fingers (and in your fingernails) and your skin, but it will also prevent the sharp edges of your nails from impacting the pimple.


If you don't have disposable gloves, you can cover your fingers with clean tissues., Apply cleanser to a cotton ball and spread it. When you pop the pimple, you'll be opening the skin, creating a way for bacteria to enter. The pimple will heal faster if you don't give bacteria a chance to settle in and create an infection.


Don't scrub the area too hard, or you'll irritate it further. Gently cleanse the area, rinse it with warm water, and pat it dry with a towel.

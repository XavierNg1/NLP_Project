 From your perspective facing the other person, the wide end of the tie should hang on your left, and the narrow end on your right. Adjust the tie until the tip of the wide end is roughly 12 inches (30 cm) below the narrow end., The wide end should now be on your right (over the wearer's left side)., Cross the wide end under the narrow end and back over to your left., Bring the wide end back over the narrow end as before., Fold the wide tip under itself and pull it up through the loop at the wearer's collar., The wearer should now have a horizontal loop at the front of his tie. Insert the wide end through this loop and pull through., A dimple is fairly easy to create with the four-in-hand knot, and improves the appearance of the tie. Here's how to make one:Pinch the sides of the tie just below the front knot. The sides should curl upward and a dimple should appear in the center.
Pull the wide end to tighten the tie.
Give the knot a final pinch to help the dimple stay in place.

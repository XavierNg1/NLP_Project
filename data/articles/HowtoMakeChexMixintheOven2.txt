 First, set your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius). Place your butter in a large, ungreased roasting pan. When the oven’s ready, put the pan in. Keep an eye on it and remove it once the butter melts. Then stir in your Worcestershire sauce, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and any other seasonings., If needed, break your pretzels and bagel chips (and any other large ingredients) into bite-size pieces. Place those in the pan along your Chex, nuts, and any other dry ingredients that you’re adding. Stir them around in the melted butter until they are evenly coated., Put the pan in the oven once it has reached 250 degrees F. Set a timer for 15 minutes. When it goes off, remove the mix, stir it up, and put it back in the oven. Repeat for a total bake of one hour., Lay out some paper towels. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the mix to the towels. Spread the mix out so it can cool while the towels soak up any excess liquid. Serve once it has cooled, or seal it in an airtight container.

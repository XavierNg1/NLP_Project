, They are always televised locally and occasionally on national TV. Tickets to home games are not cheap and can be hard to get. But if you are able to attend a game personally, it is fun and exciting. That's why the tickets aren't cheap.
 The field where the team plays all their home games. It is a large stadium, seating more than 79,000 people. It is known as one of the league's loudest stadiums because of the Chiefs' enthusiastic fans.
KC Wolf. The mascot for the Chiefs. He is a wolf, possibly best known for tackling a drunk fan who jumped onto the field during a 2007 regular-season game. It has become an internet phenomenon on YouTube.

, Dallas could not support two teams (the other being the Cowboys), so the Texans moved to Kansas City and were renamed. The Chiefs appeared in the first Super Bowl (1966-1967), but lost 35-10 to the Green Bay Packers. They returned to the Super Bowl in 1969-1970. Led by Hall of Fame QB Len Dawson, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7. They soon developed a heated rivalry with the Oakland Raiders that is still alive today.
The 1970s and 1980s: During the 1970s the aging Super Bowl team did not perform as well and were replaced with a new generation of players. The Chiefs became one of the worst NFL teams until 1986 when they made the playoffs for the first time since 1969. They returned to mediocrity for the remainder of the 1980s.
The 1990s: In 1989, Lamar Hunt hired GM Carl Peterson to try to turn the team around. In turn, coach Marty Schottenheimer was hired. New high-profile players were brought in, including Hall of Fame QB Joe Montana in the early 1990s. The Chiefs developed a dangerous "Marty-ball" defense. They were the winningest team in the 1990s. Despite this, they won only one playoff game (1993). Schottenheimer was fired after the 1998 season when the Chiefs went 7-9. He was replaced by Gunther Cunningham.
The 2000s: A few years later, Cunningham was replaced by legendary coach Dick Vermeil who had won a Super Bowl with the Rams a few years earlier. Vermeil brought in high-profile players and developed one of the most powerful offenses in NFL history. The Chiefs were number one in scoring from 2002 to 2004. Vermeil retired after the 2005 season. In 2006, the remnants of Vermeil's high-powered offense managed to put together a 9-7 season. They made the playoffs as a wild card team, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Colts in the first round. In 2007, the Chiefs were a mix of Edwards's new young players and Vermeil's aging veterans, finishing with a disappointing 4-12 record. Things did not improve in 2008, as the Chiefs fell to 2-14. Edwards was fired after 2008 and was replaced by Todd Haley as head coach. Peterson stepped down as GM and was replaced by Scott Pioli. The Chiefs won only four of their 16 games in 2009.

 Outlook has replaced Hotmail and Windows Live mail. In order to use it, you will need to create a Microsoft account. You can use your Microsoft account to log into other Microsoft services, such as Office, SkyDrive, and Xbox LIVE.
 This will take you to the Microsoft account creation page. Here you will need to enter your personal information.


Make sure to enter your real first and last name if you are using the email address to correspond with people you know or with businesses. The name will appear in emails that you send.
Enter a Microsoft account name that you will remember. Your username is your email address. Make sure that it is appropriate if you are going to be giving it to people who might take offense.
You can choose to have your email end with @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com. The choice you make will not affect your email services.

Create a good password. Make sure that it is strong but easy to remember so that you won’t have problems reentering it.
 The Captcha is what the system uses to make sure that you are an actual person and not an automated program.
 Clicking this button signifies that you accept Microsoft’s service agreement.

 When your operating system loads (Windows or Linux), double click to open an internet window. Stop the stopwatch when the internet window is showing your home page. Note the time it took. This is your load time. (The time can be a rough estimation if you want, i.e. : 1 min or 50 s.)

,, Start the test in the “Benchmark” tab. The running time may take up to 5 minutes depending on your hard drive speed. Once the program is done note the seek time and average transfer rate.
, To do so, simply touch the screw on a wall outlet. This will remove all static electricity built up in your body that could damage the fragile computer parts.
 If there is more than one cover you can open, the one for the HDD is marked with 2 arrows pointing towards a circle in the middle. A little force may be required, sometimes a lot, be careful not to snap anything.
 (If you are not sure you can take it apart and put it back together I suggest you take a picture before every step you do so you will have a visual aid to re-do what you did backwards.) Sometimes a metal encasing can be holding the HDD, like in my case, make sure to remove it also.
 Re-assemble everything. Make sure not to forget any screws or not to tight them too much. (If the metal starts bending, it might be a sign that it is too tight.)

, Insert your Operating system DVD.
 By default the computer is looking at the HDD for instructions on what to do but since your HDD is empty, we need to tell it to look at the DVD instead. Once in the BIOS, look for an option called Booting, Boot sequence, Boot, Startup or something similar. Make sure the DVD reader is selected as your primary boot device. Exit and save BIOS.
 Exit and save BIOS. Unplug DVD reader, you are done with it.;
,, Once again, your numbers will be much faster.

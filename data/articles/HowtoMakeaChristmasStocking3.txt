, Cut two stocking shapes out of the paper with one being the reverse of the other. One stocking should have the toe pointing to the right and the other should have the toe pointing to the left. The two stockings shapes should be identical except for the way the toe points., Put glue around the edges of one side of the stocking on the non printed side, or what will be the inside of the stocking. Line up the other side of the stocking and press them together to adhere them to each other. Make sure you keep the printed side out and glue the two non printed sides together. Let the glue dry 10 minutes before moving on., Use the hole puncher to punch holes around the edge of the stocking. The holes should be about ½ inch from the edge. Try to get the holes to be lined up with each other., Weave the yarn or string through the holes to give the stocking a sewn look. Start at the top above the heel of the stocking, and tie a small knot in the yarn around the first hole to get started. Once you’ve weaved the yarn all the way around the stocking, tie off the yarn leaving some out to make a loop., Use crayons, markers, glitter, craft foam, or whatever else you have to embellish your paper stocking and make it yours.

 It is recommended you search a complete version with all the plugins.;
,, I.e. Resident Evil, Ape Escape, Silent Hill, etc. Just Google the game and type "ISO", "BIN", or "BIOS" at the end.
 If you don't have one available, upload the files to an allowed file sharing site and reclaim them at school.
 If it's not labeled H:\, there should be a network drive you can access from any computer in the school that is labeled otherwise. If there's enough memory, copy your games as well.

 Check the instruction manual of your shower if you do not know how to do this. Many showers will simply twist off from the neck of the shower, but some are different. If you have recently installed a new shower head, and it has a warranty, make sure you handle it according to package instructions.
 Scrub your shower head with the toothbrush. Pay special attention to the small holes that water flows through. You can also use a rag to clean the shower head.
 After youâ€™re done cleaning, douse the shower head in water to get rid of excess vinegar and minerals. Do not worry too much about the vinegar smell. It will go away with time.
 Run the shower for a few minutes. Make sure that the shower head is reattached correctly. Run it until the water coming out of the shower does not smell like vinegar anymore.

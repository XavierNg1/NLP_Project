 This method is when you have a sized object, and you want to make another object to be the same length/size/proportion as the first one. For this method you need two objects to work with. One could be a line/object/block/image/group and the other could be different (eg. one line and one image, or one block and one image). Or they could both be the same thing (eg. two lines or two images).
 Choose which object is the correct size for you, and leave it alone. Choose the thing you want to scale and click on it.
 Or choose the Scale button from the modify tab in the ribbon.
 So select your base point (could be the point where the two objects line up).
 You can click on "reference" / or just type "r" and ↵ Enter.
, You can select a midpoint of the object, or select the end, depending on how much you want to scale it. According to what you want, click on a point anywhere the object you want to scale. (Don't click on the objects base point again.)

, Now you can click on how long you want the object to be. It could be to the midpoint of the first object, or it could be the full length of the first object. If you put the Object Snap (OSnap) off now, you can click anywhere in the workspace and your object will scale to that size.

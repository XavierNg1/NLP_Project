 Toss the peels with a small pinch of cinnamon and sugar, adding a few drops of water to help the spices stick. Spread out the peels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 120ºC (250ºF) for about 2 ½ hours, or until the apple peels are crisp and curled.
 Dry the apple peels for several hours in a dehydrator, or in an oven on the minimum setting. Mix them with spices, perfume, or other scented ingredients to create potpourri mixes.Place these in bowls around your home to cover unpleasant odors or add your own scent to a room.
 Cut the peels into small pieces and add them to other fruit while making jam. If you have enough peels, apple cores, or other waste fruit, you may not need to add pectin, or reduce the amount of pectin you need to form jam.
 If your cooking creates a fair amount of waste ingredients, consider starting a compost. This can create high-quality soil for your garden, and reduce your impact on the environment. If you do not have a use for the compost yourself, ask your city government whether curbside compost pickup services are available.

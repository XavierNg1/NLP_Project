 A wild Abra's only move is Teleport, so you have to catch it on your first try or it will Teleport out of the battle.
 It will then evolve into Kadabra.
 This can be your friend's, another one of yours, or someone else's (that you trust). After Kadabra is traded, it will evolve into Alakazam. Trade it back to your game cartridge.

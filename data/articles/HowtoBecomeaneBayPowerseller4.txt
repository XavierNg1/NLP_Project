, PowerSellers delegate because they have to! Your volume may require you hire an assistant to do some of the more repetitive tasks that don't require the your expertise attention.

A PowerSeller uses Dutch auctions often because it is a huge time-saver. This is a true "assembly line" auction from start to finish.
Packing and shipping goes a lot faster when the same item is being packed and shipped over and over again.
In the same period of time that it takes to list one item, you are listing dozens, or even hundreds of items!

 On the Internet, business conditions can change literally from quarter to quarter! Because of the transient and high-speed nature of change in Internet business, a PowerSeller realizes the value of having their own storefront on the Web. Most have either built a website themselves or have had someone build a site for them. They have developed a following and a customer base through their eBay auctions that can help sustain them even if dramatic changes come about on their main selling venue. As eBay continues to evolve and change - applying restrictive and invasive policies - this will become more of a priority for all eBay sellers, not just PowerSellers. Having your own Web site is also an excellent marketing tactic for PowerSellers.
 You may be legally required or may prefer to create an actual small business if you are running the typical PowerSeller operation. Having your own business has advantages and disadvantages. For example, you may qualify for special bank loans for capital investments or you may get certain tax privileges. The disadvantages include extra record keeping and all the work involved in creating and maintaining a small business. The eBay PowerSeller program includes some benefits designed especially for small business owners including:


Health insurance solutions for PowerSellers and their employees
Special invitations to participate in eBay events
Additional special values from eBay service providers

, Whether it means investing in a high-speed cable modem or DSL connection, high-quality computer components, digital cameras and lights, monitors, keyboards, or anything else investing in the tools that make running a PowerSeller program easier is always a good idea, so long as your business will scale to support such capital expenditures.


Use a tool to automate shipping. ShipRush is a good tool for this.

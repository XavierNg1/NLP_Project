Duct tape the paper clip to the bottom of your boat, just below the plastic tube. Make sure that the bent part is flat against the bottom of your carton.You will attach the rudder to this, which will help make you boat go straight., Cut a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) square out of the plastic panel you cut out earlier. Place it against the paper clip, just below the bottom edge of the carton. Make sure that it is perpendicular to the bottom of the carton, then wrap a piece of duct tape around the paper clip and the plastic square.If there is ay paper clip sticking out from under the rudder, you can cut it off with a pair of wire cutters.

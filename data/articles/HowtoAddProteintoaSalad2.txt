 There are a number of options for vegetarians and vegans when it comes to protein sources as well. Choose from some of the following options:


Tofu (8 grams of protein in three ounces) is probably one of the most well-known meat substitutes. Tofu is made of condensed soy milk and is an excellent source of nutrients, including all the essential amino acids our bodies need to function.Tempeh (16 grams of protein in three ounces) is a cake of partially cooked soybeans. It is a nutty, mushroom  plant protein that is still fairly unknown to most people.Seitan (36 grams of protein per half cup) is made from vital wheat gluten. It is often referred to as “the vegetarian wheat meat” because of its “meaty” texture., Chickpeas are low in calories, high in fiber, and a great source of protein, containing about 7.3 grams per half cup. They provide a nice crunch to your salad. (Try using them instead of croutons!), Adding nuts and seeds gives your salad a nice texture and some extra crunch. You have quite a variety to choose from as well:


Almonds (approximately 5 to 6 grams of protein per ounce)
Chia seeds (4.7 grams of protein per ounce)
Sunflower seeds (7.3 grams of protein per quarter cup)
Sesame and poppy seeds (5.4 grams of protein per quarter cup), Beans are an often over-looked option for salads. However, adding beans can give your salad a heartier and more filling texture in addition to adding protein. Don’t be afraid to experiment with this flavorful option!

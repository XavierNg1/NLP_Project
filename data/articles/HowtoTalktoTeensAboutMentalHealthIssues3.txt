 Bring up the subject of mental health frequently to dispel any sense of awkwardness or stigma. Look for teachable moments in your day-to-day life, and encourage teens to be active participants in the discussion.You can find teachable moments in the news, popular media, and the lives of other people you know. For instance, you might use a moment in a TV show to demonstrate the benefit of going to therapy.
 Talk in a private, comfortable place. Think about whether your teen would be most comfortable talking face-to-face, or whether they might prefer to talk while doing something else. Some teens may feel more comfortable discussing these issues over text message or email. In any case, don’t try to start a conversation about mental health when you or your teen are busy, tired, or upset.Keep your conversations brief, as this has shown to make them more constructive. The longer it goes on, the more uncomfortable your teen is likely to get. It's better to have many short conversations than a long, scary one.
If you get anxious or frustrated, wrap up the conversation. Compose yourself and pick back up when you’re feeling better.
 An 18-year-old will probably be able to handle more detailed information than a 13-year-old will. If your teen is sensitive, be careful not to present information in a way that might scare them., If your teen clams up when you bring up the subject of mental health, don’t try to force a conversation. Instead, encourage them to come to you if they ever do want to talk about anything. Your teen will be more likely to open up to you if it’s their own idea.Say something like, “It’s okay if you don’t want to talk about this right now. If you ever do want to discuss it, though, I’m always here to listen.”
Be sure to talk to your teen about other, less serious issues as well. Spend quality time in which you do fun things together. If you work on creating a good relationship you will have an easier time talking to your teen about difficult issues.

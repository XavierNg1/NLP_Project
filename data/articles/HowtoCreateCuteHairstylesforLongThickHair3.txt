 Straighten your hair with a straightening iron for a temporary look or with a chemical relaxer for a longer-term treatment. Make your hair look even longer than it does usually with this sleek look, especially if you have very curly or kinky hair.


Make even a curly or wavy ponytail appear longer by creating two ponytails, one right underneath the other at the back of your head for an illusion of extra length.Quickly accentuate the length of hair by creating a straight center part, which instantly appears to narrow and lengthen a hairstyle., Accentuate the volume you already have or create the illusion of more by teasing sections of your hair or parting it on one side.


Try out products meant for volumizing, or tools like curlers or blow dryers, but use them with caution and sparingly, as heat and products will have cumulative negative effects on your hair over time.
Wear your hair up overnight and/or while wet to achieve greater volume when you let it down.Switch up your part from where you normally wear it to get more volume from the roots., Go for extensions in the closest possible shade to your own to add both volume and length to your hair.


Find clip-in, tape, or weave varieties of extensions, depending on how youâ€™ll use them and how permanent they will be.
Try gently teasing the hair above where you apply extensions to help hide them. Also avoid sleeping with wet hair to prevent tangling.

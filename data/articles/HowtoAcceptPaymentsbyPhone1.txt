, This may vary slightly depending on your terminal, but most have a similar process. Push the "sale" button on your terminal. The first prompt usually offers two options: card present or sale by phone. You will choose "sale by phone." Then follow the prompts, filling in the customer information and confirming the sale amount.
 Confirm the information and push "enter" for the last prompt. Terminal will display "transaction complete" or similar notification. If there is an option to "print receipt," push "yes." Some terminals will automatically print out two receipts when the transaction is complete. Just be sure you have a merchant copy and a customer copy. The customer receipt may display a sentence that says, "phone order" or similar, instead of a signature line. If the customer receipt does not say "phone order," write this on the receipt.
 Scan and email the phone payment receipt or send it through the post to your customer. It is best practice to take the opportunity to thank the client for their business every time you send a correspondence.

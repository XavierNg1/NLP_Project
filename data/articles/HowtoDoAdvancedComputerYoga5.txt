 Say to yourself: "I take things as they are. I flow positive with my life." Feel the inner peace.
 Move your thumbs. Visualize yourself as a Buddha (Shiva, Enlightened) and a Goddess of Love. Think or speak the mantra: "I am a Buddha (Shiva). I am a Goddess of Love (Mother of all beings)."

, Say "I send light to... (name). May all people be happy. May the world be happy."

, Think on the enlightened masters and say, "Om all enlightened masters. Om God. Please help me on my way."

, Make your mind calm and think the mantra "Om" in your head, your thorax, your belly, your legs, feet and in the earth. Think in the whole cosmos: "Om Shanti. Om Peace. Om Peace. Om Shanti. Om Peace ..."

, Simply sit there. Don't think. Relax.
 For example, "I am optimistic. I go my way with optimism."

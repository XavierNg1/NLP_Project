 Pulse the blender until the mixture is nice and smooth. Keep going until it's rich and creamy.
 Pulse again to blend the mixture together until it has a smoothie-like texture., Since this banana pi√±a colada is almost like a smoothie, you could pour it into two tall glasses. Add a couple of straws to make it easier to drink.
 The drink will look more festive if you place a few pineapple rings on the edge of the glasses.

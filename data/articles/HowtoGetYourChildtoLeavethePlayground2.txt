 "Let's go to the park, but let's not argue about having to leave when it's time to leave.  How do you think we can do that?" Chances are your child might not know or might say that you should stay all day and all night! That's okay. You are going to explain that you have an idea -- you will approach him or her to privately speak with him or her before it's time to go. You will not speak loudly across the park in front of their friends because this sets up a power struggle. You will quietly remind your child that it will be time to leave soon and ask him or her how much time he or she needs. He or she is allowed to ask for up to ten minutes more. You agree to give that much more time, and then you can add some reflection from step one while nicely leaving with your child once the time is up. Get your child to agree to cooperate before you go to the park. They can pick how much "extra" time they get to play for up to ten minutes, but then they must cooperate and leave with you.
 When you are in the playground, and you want to leave in fifteen minutes, approach your child, and without speaking loud enough for others to hear, tell your child that it's almost time to leave and ask him or her how much more time he or she needs. If your child says more than ten minutes, remind him or her that you agreed on ten minutes or less. "Please pick a number between one and ten." Once they have chosen a number, say, "in that many minutes, we will leave. I will come and remind you." Then do that. If they protest, reflect how hard it is, how sad they feel or angry or disappointed or frustrated or whatever you think they feel at that moment -- it is okay if they correct you with a different feeling. Take the corrected feeling they provide and reflect that feeling to them. It helps if you show it on your face as well.

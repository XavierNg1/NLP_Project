 Once you’ve established how difficult it is to lift the person, it’s time to employ some simple "mind over matter" tricks to increase your strength- or at least, increase the mystical nature of the game! This is also a good time for the leader to explain the concept behind the game.


The leader can be creative with the explanation. For example, the leader can explain that the person’s body will be overtaken by the spirit of a deceased person, turning corpse-like and levitating.Make it as creepy or funny as you’d like!
Dimming the lights and adding candles can add to the supernatural quality of the trick.
 Hands should alternate so that each persons hands are separated by another persons. Press down on the liftee’s head- lightly, of course! The leader should tell the group that they are opening the liftee's body to supernatural influences with this step, and at this time the outside spirits are entering the body and making it light.Remove your hands from the stack and place them again under the liftee.
 The liftee should be perfectly still, with their eyes closed. As you chant, slowly start to lift.
 This time around, they should lift with ease. Then, slowly lower them back to the ground as you continue to recite the words. The leader should command the “spirits” to exit their body and voila- you’ve completed the trick!

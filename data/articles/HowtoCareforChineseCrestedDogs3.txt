 New clothing, bedding, and home furnishings often contain harmful chemicals, like formaldehyde, that can irritate your Chinese Crested’s skin. Therefore, always wash new clothing and bedding, which will be used by your dog, before use.When washing clothing and bedding, use a pet-friendly, non-toxic detergent, like Soap Nuts Laundry Liquid or Nellie’s All-Natural Laundry Detergent.
 Buy chew toys for your Chinese Crested dog that are the right size. Your dog should not be able to fit the whole toy in its mouth. If it can, then it is too small.Do not buy toys with small parts that your dog can choke on, or toys with foam stuffing.
Buy chew toys made with softer materials, like soft rubber, since the Chinese Crested’s teeth are so fragile.
 Since Chinese Crested dogs are small and low to the ground, store your common household cleaners in high places, i.e., at or above eye level. Common household cleaners, like all-purpose cleaners, detergents, and glass and wood cleaners, emit harmful vapors that your dog can breathe in.


You can also store these cleaners in the garage.

 Press the Power button found on the front right side of the device., Press the Home button on your gamepad. It is just below the touchscreen.
 Tap the second (green) icon from the left, right next to the Friends List icon.
 Miiverse will list several members of the Nintendo Network. Just search for a person you’d like to add to your Friends List.
 Once you find someone you’d like to befriend, tap on their picture to view their profile.
 At the top-right corner of the profile is a “Friend Request” button; tap on this.


That particular person will get a notification. If he or she accepts, you will be able to view him or her in your Friends List.

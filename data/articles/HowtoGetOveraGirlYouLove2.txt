 If you can't help being around the girl you love (because of a job, for instance), use structure to your advantage. Formal group settings such as the workplace and the classroom are the ideal environment for establishing emotional boundaries with yourself. Simply interact the same way with the girl in question as you do with everyone else. Make it clear to yourself and her that there is no special relationship; that you are simply colleagues doing work side by side.


Don't go out of your way to choose her for a partner when partners are required. When you do work together, keep the conversation focused on the task at-hand.
 Outside of structured environments, there will still be times when you'll have to be near your love. You can keep yourself from getting shaken or upset by choosing to interact with groups of people rather than individuals, thus minimizing the chances that you'll end up alone together at any point.


For example, when the two of you are sitting together on a couch at a friend's house, it will be hard not to focus on her. Change that to four people stuffed onto a couch playing a game together, and it becomes much easier to spread your attention around.
Treat her the same way you treat your other friends, and the pressure will be off before you know it. The key is to try to see her as just another girl.

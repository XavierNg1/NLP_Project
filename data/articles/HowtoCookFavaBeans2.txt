 Pry open each bean pod and pluck all of the individual beans out of the shell.

Snap the tip of the bean near the string/stem end, then peel the string down the entire length of the pod.
Use your fingers to pry the pod open along the exposed seam and pick out the individual beans inside. Most pods will contain four to eight beans.
 Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat.

Meanwhile, fill a medium mixing bowl with 1 cup (250 ml) of ice and 3 cups (750 ml) of cold water.
 Toss the individual fava beans into the boiling water and blanch/parboil them for 30 seconds, or until the skins begin to shrivel.Use a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched beans to your bowl of ice water. Keep them submerged for at least 30 seconds to stop the cooking process.
 Pinch the tip of each bean. Squeeze down on the loosened skin and push the inner bean forward until it completely pops out.

Keep the inner beans and discard the skins.
 Place the butter into a small to medium skillet and set it on the stove over medium heat.

Melt the butter completely and turn the pan to coat it.
If using olive oil instead of butter, heat the oil for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it becomes glossy and easy to move around the pan.
 Add the minced garlic to the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, for approximately 60 seconds.

Cook the garlic until it produces a stronger odor.
Minced garlic can burn quickly and will ruin the taste of the dish if it does, so you'll need to stir it continuously during this time.
 Toss the fava beans into the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes or until the beans become crisp-tender.You can Saut√© the beans for more or less time depending on your desired level of doneness. Test for doneness by simply piercing one bean with a fork.
 Dump the contents of the skillet into a serving bowl, then toss with salt and pepper as desired. Enjoy warm.

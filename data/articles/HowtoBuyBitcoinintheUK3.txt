 Some exchanges like CoinCorner and Coinfloor allow you to deposit directly in Pounds. You may find a much better rate on an exchange that does not, like Kraken and Bitstamp but these will require conversion of Pounds to Euros and a SEPA transfer, which usually results in additional fees.


This is your probably your best option if you intend on buying Bitcoin regularly or in large quantities, because the exchange rates are usually the most competitive. However it will initially take longer than other methods so if you're just getting started with Bitcoin you may preferÂ to use a different option.

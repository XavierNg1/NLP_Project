 When you play your pan flute, some moisture can build up inside the tubes. After you have finished playing, swab the inside of each tube with a damp soft cloth. Allow the flute to dry before putting it away., Once the flute is dried after playing, store it in a cloth padded case. The cloth should be decently breathable so that any residual moisture can escape. Storing the pan flute in a case will keep it from being exposed to dust and potential damage., Wood instruments are highly susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity. Try to keep your pan flute in a consistent temperature environment. Donâ€™t leave it in a hot car, for example.
 Periodically, the mouthpieces of the pan flute might become rough from frequent playing. Use a tuning rod to smooth down the mouthpieces. Rub a tuning rod across the top of the tubes; this will help smooth down any fibers that are standing up., Cracks and hairline fractures can alter or compromise the sound of a pan flute. Check your flute periodically for cracks or fractures. Patch them up with adhesive tape for a quick fix. Use beeswax to seal up the crack for a long-term repair.Alternately, take the pan flute to a musical instrument repair shop for professional repair.

 Use a fruit wash if you have one, or rinse the watermelon under the faucet to remove dirt, germs, and pesticides from the watermelon rind. It’s important to wash the rind because everything the knife touches on the outside of the melon will end up in contact with the watermelon flesh as it slices through.;
, A serrated knife works best for items that have a softer interior and tougher exterior like melons, tomatoes, and breads. Knives must be longer than the fruit you're going to cut.
 Stand the melon on end before slicing through the middle.









Note that if you cut along the dark stripes on the outside of the watermelon, then the watermelon seeds will end up on the outside of the pieces of watermelon, making them easier to remove.
 You can cut each half into two, three, or four sections, depending on how small you’d like your pieces to be.
 Hold the section in one hand while you slowly cut the flesh away from the rind.
 You’ll want to cut even slices through the fruit, about 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) apart. Repeat to remove the fruit from each section.

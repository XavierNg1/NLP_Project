  Chances are when you're doing all those sports, you'll sweat.  This means taking a shower everyday using a body wash.  Wash your hair every other day with shampoo and if you want conditioner on the ends.  Brush your teeth twice a day and floss once at night.  Use deodorant and a sweet smelling body lotion or body spray.;
,  Sporty girls almost wear a pair of high quality runners 24/7.  That means you must own at least 1 pair of super reliable runners.  Sketchers and Nike are good brands.  In the winter, wear Uggs.  Also wear flip flops, heels, and flats from time to time.  Buy tons of tank tops and graphic tees.  Try to get tight fitting ones.  Also buy comfy clothes too.  Wear oversized tees and sweaters.  Wear lots of shorts, jeans, leggings, and capris.  Also make them tight fitting and own sweatpants, skirts, and 1 or 2 dresses for special occasions.
  Wash it every other day using a good smelling shampoo and optional, a smooth conditioner.  Only apply conditioner to your ends as it will dry out your roots. When you get out of the shower, put your hair in a towel.  After 5 minutes or so, take it out.  Then let the rest air dry.  Brush your hair everyday in the morning, if you're going out.  Headbands and hair ties are your best friends.  Wear tons of them.  The basic high pony, left down, pinned up bangs, side braid, and curls are great styles.

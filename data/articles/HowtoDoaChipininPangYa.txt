 This is a red number indicated directly above the hole, such as 228y.;
, This is a white number next to the distance to the hole, mentioned in step one. Add this to the hole's distance, unless it's negative, then you subtract it.
 With the optimal spin stat, 7 spin, these will be: 1W - 3y, 2W - 5y, 3W - 7y, and all irons, about 9y. Subtract this from the number you got in step 2.
 For every 1m of vertical wind, the effect will be about .6 tiles on the green for 1w, .8 for 2w, and .95 tile for 3w. After you add or subtract the correct number here, you have the power you must use.
 Take the club's maximum power and divide it by 10. Each notch/small line on the power bar is this number, 10% of the maximum power. For example, a 240y club would be 24y per notch. This means every 5% is 12y, every 2.5% is 6y, 1.25% is 3y, etc.
, For every 1m of wind horizontally (left and right), you need to adjust this many green tiles (approximately): 1W - .6, 2W - .8, 3W - .95

, Start the power meter and look at the model ball in the lower left corner. If your ball is on a slope, black "steps" should show around the green horizontal line. Count these steps and multiply by two. This is how many tenths of a tile you must move (count 4 steps and move .8 tiles).

 If your cat sees you eating, it might get hungry and beg for food from you. In order to eat without a cat begging, give it food of its own and eat when your cat does. This will distract your cat and discourage it from begging as you dine.Additionally, develop a regular feeding schedule. Feeding your cat at the same time each day will, over time, ensure that your cat will get hungry at predictable times.
Space your cat’s meals out over a reasonable period of time. Provide at least three meals each day, with about five or six hours between meals., Your cat should have its own water bowl and food dish. It should never be fed from regular plates and tableware. Doing so could lead your cat to believe that when you are dining, you’re eating the cat’s food (or food the cat will like). This will make it hard to eat without a cat begging., It is possible that your cat is begging because you are not feeding it enough. Talk to your vet to find out how many calories your cat needs each day. Then, check the nutrition label on your cat’s food to find out how many calories you’re actually providing. You may be able to eat without a cat begging by meeting its caloric needs.Caloric needs vary according to breed, weight, and age. Your vet will be able to determine what your cat’s caloric needs are.
 If you have more than one cat, it is possible that one cat is eating the other’s food. The cat whose food is being eaten might then beg for food as you eat because it is still hungry. If one of your cats begs while you eat, monitor your feline friends the next time you feed them. If you see one cat taking the other’s food, start feeding your cats in separate areas of the house so that the cat whose food is being pilfered can get enough to eat.

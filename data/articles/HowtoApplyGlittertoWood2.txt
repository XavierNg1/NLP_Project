 For this method, you will need to purchase a spray adhesive. Make sure to find a spray adhesive that dries clear. You will want to work with spray adhesive outdoors, since it can contain chemicals that are harmful to breathe.


You can find spray adhesive at any craft store or major retailer.
If you are unable to work outside, work in a well-ventilated area.
 Be sure to follow any special directions from the manufacturer, if applicable. Hold the spray adhesive can a few inches away from the wood and press down on the top of the can to spray the wood.
 While the adhesive spray is still wet on the wood, sprinkle your glitter over the area. The amount of glitter that you use will determine how sparkly the wood is.


You can either sprinkle the glitter onto the area with your hands, or use a foam wedge or paintbrush to apply the glitter.
 The drying time will depend upon the specific adhesive spray that you use, but it should only take a few minutes for the area to completely dry.
 If you’d like, you can apply a sealant, like decoupage, to the area. The sealant will add smoothness and will help to prevent the glitter from falling off. Choose a sealant that has a glossy finish, not matte, so your glitter doesn’t lose any of its sparkle.Once the adhesive spray is dry, you can shake off any excess glitter into your cardboard box.

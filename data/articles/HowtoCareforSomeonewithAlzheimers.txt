 You are likely one caregiver who is part of a larger team working to keep the person happy and healthy. Because of this, it’s important to coordinate your care with any medical professionals or other caregivers in your efforts. Doctors, nurses, social workers, and case managers can provide important information about individual’s case and proper care strategies. This can help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s and boost the person’s health.Ask other caregivers questions you may have about providing care. Consider factors such as knowing when and how much medication to give, promoting overall health, and reducing potential frustrations for the person and you.
Inform the rest of the care team if you notice any changes in the health or behavior of the person. Because the disease affects the memory and thinking, you may notice potential problems or changes that the person can’t recognize. This could be vital information for doctors about the person’s health, including the progression of the disease.
Medical professionals to consider for the person's health team (beyond their physician) include a therapist, social worker, or psychologist to support mental health; an occupational therapist who can evaluate the safety of the person's home and provide tips for transport, driving, and self-care.;
, Make sure you have the person with Alzheimer’s permission to coordinate care and treatment with the health care team members. This helps the individual feel more independent and that any decisions you make are in their best interest.Be aware that in some cases, you may need written permission to legally make decisions on the person’s health and treatment. If this is the case, explain to the person that you would like their signature to be a member of the health care team. The Alzheimer's Association is a great resource for how to handle the legal and financial aspects of caregiving. Check out their free pamphlets here: http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_publications_financial_legal.asp

Ask at a time when the person is most alert. Speak clearly to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications. For example, “Hi Sam, I would really like to help care for you. I need legal permission, though. Please sign this form so that I can be a caretaker. Do you have any questions?”

, Many people with Alzheimer’s are on a regimen of medication to slow the disease’s progression and related symptoms such as anxiety or sleep changes.Make sure the person takes medication daily and gets prescription refills on time. This can help the person maintain brain health for a longer period of time.


Read the dosing instructions for every medication the individual takes. Keep a notebook of medications to ensure the person takes the daily doses. Note the times the person takes the medication and any problems that may arise. This can also be vital information for other members of the care team.
 If you are giving the person medication, you may want to learn more about the treatment regimen. This can ensure that you are providing the best care and disease management options. Some of the most common medications and treatments for Alzheimer’s disease are:Cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine. These slow the process that breaks down one of the brain’s key neurotransmitters.
Memantine, an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist, that slows down neural cell damage.
Sleep medications such as zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta)Anti-anxiety medications such as clonazepam, lorazepam

, Routine is a key component of caring for a person with Alzheimer’s. It supports the person’s sense of wellbeing and continued ability to function. One way to support that is by scheduling the person’s regular appointment with care team medical professionals at the same time on the same day as much as possible. Speak to the doctors’ offices about the need to maintain this routine for the person and ask if they can accommodate you., As Alzheimer’s progresses, a person with the disease may become easily frustrated as once easy tasks become increasingly difficult. Limiting challenges and managing situations can reduce potential frustration.For example, you could:


Pre-select a couple of dishes for the person to eat at a restaurant so they don't get overwhelmed and/ or frustrated with an entire menu.
Have a tailor replace buttonholes with snaps.
Give the person a comfortable spot away from the action at family gatherings.
 A person with Alzheimer’s can still learn and follow routines. Set a regular daily routine for the person that varies only as necessary. This can make situations less agitating and confusing for the individual.Schedule tasks such as bathing and medical appointments when the person is most alert.
Incorporate some flexibility in the schedule for spontaneous activities the person would like to do.
 Even with a routine, a person with Alzheimer’s may need more time to do once easy tasks. Take your time with care and allow the person to take breaks as necessary. This can keep the person from feeling hurried, which may increase anxiety and agitation.Incorporate cushions of time for each task. For example, if the person has a doctor’s appointment at 9 a.m., start getting ready at 8:45 to give the individual time to put on a coat, walk to the car, and arrive on time.
 Involve your Alzheimer’s patient to continue doing tasks with as little assistance as possible. This can boost the person’s wellbeing and help stimulate the brain, which is important in slowing the disease’s progression.Keep the tasks as simple as possible so that the person isn’t overwhelmed. This can lead to anxiety and agitation. For example, let the person set the table with the help of visual cues. You can also lay out the person’s clothes and allow the individual to dress independently.
 Although a person with Alzheimer’s can get frustrated with variety, it’s still important to provide the person different choices every day. This can help the individual feel like they still have control over their life and also helps stimulate brain cells. This may slow the disease’s progression.Recognize that fewer options are better, but that giving the person a choice is important to health and wellbeing. For example, you can let the person choose between two outfits, what type of meal to eat, or if a movie or walk is a preferable activity.
 Confusion is a typical symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.Giving the person simple and clear instructions can help minimize confusion and may prevent anxiety or agitation.Use clear, one-step instructions. For example, “Dad, please grab the water glasses,” or, “Sara, put on your shirt.” If the task requires multiple steps, break it up into several steps and give the person breaks as necessary.
 Distractions can impair a person with Alzheimer’s ability to focus. Reducing the number of ambient distractions, such as the TV, helps a person with Alzheimer’s focus. This can minimize confusion, frustration, anxiety, and/ or agitation.Turn off TVs, stereos, or other media during mealtimes, conversations, or activities such as reading. Allow one person to speak at a time during conversations so the person can follow along.
 Alzheimer’s destroys brain cells and impairs a person’s judgment and problem-solving skills. This increases the risk of injury, including from falls. Avoiding clutter, area rugs around the house and installing grab bars can minimize the risk of the person falling.Remove extension cords, excess furniture or other clutter on which the person may trip.Make sure the person’s shoes and slippers have good traction and are comfortable.
Take away area rugs or secure them with anti-slide material. This can keep the person from slipping and hitting their head.
Clean up spills as soon as possible.Install sturdy handrails or bars in potentially dangerous areas such as stairways and bathrooms.
You can employ and occupational therapist to come in and evaluate the home for safety concerns and advice on how to make the home safe and efficient for the person.
 As the person’s Alzheimer’s progresses, use locks on cabinets that contain potentially dangerous items. This can keep the person from accidentally ingesting chemicals or exposing themselves to other hazards. Some items to lock include:Medicine
Alcohol
Guns
Toxic chemicals, including cleaning substances
Knives or other sharp kitchen implements
Tools
Scissors
Gasoline

, A hot water heater set to higher temperatures may accidentally burn a person with Alzheimer’s. Setting the thermostat lower or placing a water temperature controller in showers and kitchen sinks can minimize the risk of burns., Fires may also occur if a person with Alzheimer’s gets confused about matches or lighters. Placing fire implements out of reach and having alarms and extinguishers easily accessible can minimize the risk of injury or property destruction by fire.Make sure you have a full and easily accessible fire extinguisher. Check the date of the last fill and replace it if it’s older than one year.
Check smoke detectors to ensure the batteries are full and working properly.
Light cigarettes and supervise smoking if the person does it.
 A person with Alzheimer’s may place items such as keys, wallets, mobile phones and jewelry in unusual places if they are confused. Keeping these items in one secure place can minimize the risk of them getting lost.Consider having an area in an entry way the person can set items. Place a dish or basket in a prominent spot for things such as keys, wallets, and phones.
 A person with Alzheimer's may begin to wander around the house. Keep detailed notes about wandering patterns — when they occur, how often they occur, and how long the wandering lasts. This can help you determine the cause of the wandering. For instance, if the person wanders first thing in the morning, it may be because they are hungry. Ensure the person is fed, hydrated, and going to the bathroom regularly, as these impulses may cause wandering. It is also important to take steps to prevent the person from wandering out of the house and to protect them should this happen.Give the person an ID bracelet with contact information or fit them with a wristband transmitter. You may want to slip a card with this information into their jackets, wallet, etc.
Make sure you have a current photo of the person. Ask the police department about keeping one on file, should the person wander off.
Consider installing an electronic chime that will sound when someone enters or exits the home to notify you if the person attempts to exit.
Post signs that read "DO NOT ENTER" or "STOP" on exits. Placing a black mat in front of exits may also prevent the person from leaving — the mat may appear to be a hole in the floor to someone with dementia.
 Alzheimer’s destroys a person’s ability to remember things. Setting photographs and other meaningful objects around the person’s house and those of loved ones can help the person recall family, friends, and special events such as weddings or births., Limit the number of mirrors the person can access. This minimizes the risk of the person finding images in the mirror frightening, which can also decrease anxiety and/or frustration. For example, if the individual has a beloved antique mirror, consider displaying that and removing other options such as entry way or decorative mirrors that have no purpose.

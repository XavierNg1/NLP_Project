 You'll want your cake to be somewhere around 6 inches (15.2Â cm) in diameter. Cut out five 4-inch in diameter cake circles, and three 3-inch diameter cake circles.
 In other words, group your 3 3-inch circles and wrap them, and do the same for the 4-inch circles., Then, roll out some fondant (yellow would be the best option for the head) to about 1/4 of an inch thick and cover the foil circles. Before you cover the circles, reserve one 4-inch circle and set it aside. Try to smooth it down as best as you can., An easy alternative is to buy alphabet cookie cutters (or fondant cutters) and cut them out, but you could also stencil them and cut them out by hand. Once you have your LEGO letters, stick them with piping gel on the 3-inch circles., Bake two cakes in 6-inch pans. Make them about three or four inches high. Then, cut off the dome. Using a serrated knife, create rounded edges for the head., Turn the cake over and place the reserved 4-inch circle on the bottom. Then, frost as normal. Flip the cake over, frost the rest, and place the other cake on top. Repeat Step 6 for the second cake. Frost the entire cake, making it as smooth as possible., Smooth it out with a fondant smoother., Remember not to put on too much! Grab your 3-inch circle board with the LEGO lettering and stick it on the top of the tall cake., This is the time to be extra creative!, Serve and enjoy.

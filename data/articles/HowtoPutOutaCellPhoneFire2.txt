 If your cell phone catches fire and there’s not a C02 extinguisher around, you’ll need to act fast to contain the flames before they get out of hand. Your initial reaction should be to get the phone away from any nearby flammable materials.Keep a safe distance between yourself and the flames to prevent injury.
Clear the area of items like paper and fabrics that may ignite in the event of an unchecked fire.
 Grab whatever you happen to find around you. Anything will work—a glass, pitcher, bowl, bucket, etc.—as long as it can hold a few ounces of water at a time. It’s crucial that the water be as cold as possible to neutralize the fire quickly and completely.Cold water will lower the temperature of the combustible chemicals in the battery cells, halting thermal runaway.
While lithium does react mildly with water, the cooling effect of the water outweighs the chances of a harmful reaction, making it an effective solution in emergency situations.
 Aim the flow of water directly over the battery. Pour slowly and steadily to maximize the contact time between the water and the phone. If the flames have begun spreading to the surrounding area, be sure to address them as well.Place the phone in a sink and leave the faucet running to expose it to a continuous stream.
 Refill the container with fresh water and continue dousing the phone. Keep in mind that the thermal reaction may restart itself if any other intact battery cell grows hot enough to ignite. Once you’ve successfully dealt with the fire, call the fire department and have them dispose of the phone.To be on the safe side, you should saturate the phone a few more times even after the fire has been suppressed.

 Throw a party for a group of your favorite book-loving friends. After an hour or two have passed and a few drinks have been consumed, place a box of your old books in the middle of the room and tell your friends your books are up for grabs. Your friends will rush toward the box and will furiously select a few of your books. You'll be surprised by how quickly the box of books will be empty.
 Go through your books and put post-its on the cover that mark the person who would most appreciate them. Then distribute the books to the few friends you thought of. This will look like a thoughtful gift instead of an attempt to get rid of something. Just tell your friends something like, "This made me think of you" or "I know you'll love this book," and they'll gladly take the books off your hands.
 If your book is so old and worn that you and anyone else can have no use for it, have fun by hollowing out the book and using it as a treasure chest to hide your secret things. Here's how you can hollow a book:


Find an old book with a relatively sturdy cover and glue the pages together with Elmer's glue. Wait for them to dry for at least 15 minutes.
Use a pencil to mark the rectangular area at least 1/2 an inch (1.2 cm) within the perimeter of the book.
Use an Exacto knife or a box cutter to cut through a chunk of pages at a time.
Continue to cut through chunks of pages until you've hollowed out the book.
Enjoy storing your favorite items in the book.
 If your books are so decrepit that no one can have a good use for them, it may be time to throw them away. If you do want to throw your books away, recycling is the best and most environmentally-friendly option. Some city recycling programs allow you to put paperbacks into your single-stream recycling bins, and other municipalities will recycle books if brought to a solid waste deposit. Check with your local council website to find out if your books can be recycled.

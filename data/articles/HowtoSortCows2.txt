 This step is so that you can check and process animals for various things like body condition score, ear or brisket tags, vaccinations, preg-checking, dehorning, castration, etc. From there, cattle released are directed to go into a particular pen you wish them to be in via gates opened or closed in the working alley.,, You could go behind and guide the animal where to go, but generally this isn't necessary because once the cow has escaped from the squeeze, she'll go to where she can escape to without any assistance., Repeat until you've sorted each animal into the groups you've planned for.

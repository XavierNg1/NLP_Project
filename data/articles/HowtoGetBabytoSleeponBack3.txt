 Back sleeping is safer for your baby, but there may be other hazards in your baby’s crib that you will want to remove before you lay her down. Remove any soft, fluffy toys, pillows, or other objects in the crib. When using a blanket, make sure that all of the edges of the blanket are tucked under the mattress. Other things to remove from the crib include:Ties
Bands
Headbands
Toys
Rings
Decorations
Any objects that may get tangled around your baby and/or pose a choking hazard

, A musical mobile may help to make your baby more interested in staying on his back and help to soothe him to sleep as well. Find a musical mobile that plays music and has some interesting objects or lights for him to look at as well. This should help to soothe your baby so that he will fall asleep on his back.
 Darkness is ideal, but you can turn on a night light or a small table lamp that is placed on the opposite side of your baby’s room.


Make sure that there are no TV or computer screens on in your baby’s room. These screens produce “blue” light that interferes with sleep., A temperature of about 65°C (18.3°C) is ideal for sleeping.Check the thermostat in your house and try adjusting it to about 65°F (18.3°C). This temperature may help to create a better environment for your baby to fall asleep even if the position is bothering him.


Make sure that there are no drafts that might make your baby too cold.

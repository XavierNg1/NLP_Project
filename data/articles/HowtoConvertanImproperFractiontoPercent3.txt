 Since a percent is equal to a certain number of hundredths, you are going to convert the fraction to an equivalent one with 100 in the denominator.

For example, if you have 85{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}}, you want to find x{\displaystyle x} in the equation 85=x100{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}={\frac {x}{100}}}.
 Remember that the denominator is the bottom number. This calculation will give you a factor of change telling you how much bigger 100 is than the denominator. Note that this method only works if the denominator divides evenly into 100.

For example, if you are converting 85{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}}, you would calculate 100÷5=20{\displaystyle 100\div 5=20}. So, a denominator of 100 is 20 times bigger than a denominator of 5.
 To maintain an equivalent fraction, whatever you do to the original denominator, you must also do the the numerator. For example, 85=8×205×20=160100{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}={\frac {8\times 20}{5\times 20}}={\frac {160}{100}}}.
 Remember that a percent is simply a number out of 100, or hundredths. Since your fraction is now shown as x100{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{100}}}, the numerator of your fraction is now the percent. Note that, since you are working with an improper fraction, your numerator is larger than your denominator. This means that your fraction represents more than 100 percent.

Don’t forget to include the percent sign after the number.

For example, 160100=160%{\displaystyle {\frac {160}{100}}=160\%}

You will see various options, among which is "Block." WhatsApp will ask you to confirm that you want to block the contact, and you should confirm.
Once you have blocked the contact, the other person won't be able to see your profile photo, send you messages, or see the last time that you were connected to WhatsApp.
The good thing about this method is that you can delete your contact from WhatsApp without having to delete the phone number from your phone's contact list.

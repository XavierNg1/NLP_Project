 Make sure you hide somewhere that the tagger would most likely miss, or somewhere SO obvious that the tagger wouldn't even think to look there.
 Stay calm and quiet so they move forward to another place.
 This has to do with trust. If you completely trust someone, go ahead and hide with them. But, if you don't trust them and you believe that they will laugh or make a loud noise to give you away, don't hide near them.

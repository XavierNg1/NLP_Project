 Get pumped. Have a plan 3 months ahead of the big day of how you're going to practice for it and special dates (such as sports information, whether you need a sports physical or not, and more).
 Have confidence. Middle School teams aren't that competitive, so they aren't looking for a team of mini professionals. Have a good mind set, it will take you far., You'd be surprised by how much better you can get in just a month or even a few weeks. For softball you should get in shape for tryouts, and you should not go in rusty., You will need bat bags, a helmet, a bat, a glove, a water bottle, batting gloves, a face guard, a mouth guard to start with., Short and a t-shirt is all you need, but sliders and long socks are good to have too. If you make the school team you will need these too. Sometimes it is good to have knee pads for sliding. In softball, the players wear cleats but for tryouts you might be able to wear tennis shoes., You could be surprised because if you drink a lot of water and eat a balanced meal before tryouts, you may have a whole lot more energy. It would be smart to bring a snack for right after school for that extra boost of energy., The night before if you barely sleep, you may be tired the next day at tryout., Have a bunch of fun Don't get discouraged; have a positive attitude and show a lot of hustle. Coaches notice that in players. Even if you don't know how to play, hustle the whole time. It will show that you are teachable and want to play! Try hard, really really try. Be serious about it. Sometimes when it comes down to the last few girls that could make the difference. Also don't worry than that cause more stress witch can make your tryouts bad.

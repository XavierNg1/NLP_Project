, Add in the herbs. Coat the meat in the herbed butter. Sprinkle with salt if desired., Heat a small amount of oil or lard in a large pan. When it is hot, sear every side long enough for it to brown and begin to release from the pan before turning it. This locks in the juices. At this point, you can lower the heat and cook the meat until it is done to your liking. (If you want well done, you may want to cover the pan while it cooks.), One suggestion is a fresh mixed salad with a dressing of oil, orange juice and salt. Another side dish this would go well with is steamed mashed cauliflower (which tastes quite similar to mashed potatoes).

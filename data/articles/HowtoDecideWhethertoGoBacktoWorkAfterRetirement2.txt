 If you have retired before being eligible for Medicare (at age 65), you may still be paying for healthcare. If you are paying for yourself and an spouse and are not covered through an employer, these costs could be substantial. Going back to work can be especially helpful in covering these costs, as you may have access to an employer based healthcare program.You may even be able to work a part-time job that qualifies you for access to your employer’s group health care plan.
You will be penalized by a excise tax every year you do not have health insurance. As of 2016, these penalties are increasing annually. Make sure you are always insured.
Even with Medicare, having additional coverage through an employer will help cover expenses that Medicare does not cover.
 If you’re receiving a pension from your career before retirement, that plan may be reduced if you go back to work and retire again down the line. This is because pension plans are often based on your salary in the years preceding your retirement.For instance, if you have been well-paid previously, but decide to go back to work on a part-time basis, for instance, this may significantly diminish what you will receive from your pension.
To avoid this from occurring, speak directly with whomever oversees pensions for your employer, and ask about how coming back to work may change your future pension.
 Though relatively minor, it’s important to factor in the costs associated with going to work. For instance, will you have transportation costs? You may also need to buy new clothes or equipment. Finally, eating lunch out or even packing a lunch can wind up being surprisingly costly.Further, are there any other people or pets that depend on your care during the day? Might you have to pay for pet boarding or a day nurse for your spouse?

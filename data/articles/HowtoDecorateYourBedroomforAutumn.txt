 Strings of leaves or single leaves are available at Michael's or other craft stores at very cheap prices during fall. String the leaves around your bookshelf or window, or maybe scatter some on your desk. This is a cheap and easy way to bring some fall festivity to your own room. If you don't want to purchase leaves, print some templates out and make your own!;
, Spooky Halloween theme lights are available at Target or Walmart for around $7-20 dollars. They can look beautiful at night around your headboard or door. They can be a little expensive, but look into thrift stores for bargains. Make sure you have your parents' permission.
 Jack-be-littles are small, miniature pumpkins. They are extremely cheap at a farmer's market. They come to around 50 cents each. They look really cute just randomly placed around your room, or on a night stand. Squeeze some lemon juice on them so they don't rot.
 They are dirt cheap in the dollar bins at Target, usually around $1 for a pack of gel clings. Put some on your window or on your mirror. They add some festivity to your room - easy as pie!

, Roll up paper and glue it so it comes together as a little tube. Then use Elmer's glue to attach some tissues or crepe paper to make it look ghostly. Draw on a face and you're all set! Even add some glitter if you want. Put these on a desk or nightstand for some ghastly fall d√©cor!

, Fun colored tiny candles can add some spooky lighting to your room. A.C Moore or Michael's offer colored, unscented candles for very low prices. If you want something to scent your room, try Bath And Body Works candles or Yankee Candle. Though they are pretty costly, they smell delightful and offer warm pumpkin or fall time smells.
 Using autumn colors like orange, yellow, red, purple and green makes a huge difference and adds a cozy feel to your room!

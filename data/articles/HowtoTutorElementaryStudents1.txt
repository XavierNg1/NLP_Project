 Do this whether the child is coming to your home, you are going to theirs, or you're meeting at an outside location. Make sure that distractions like loud music or a TV aren't anywhere close by. Some smart places to tutor are:


A library
A classroom
A coffee shop or cafe
An office;
, Make sure you bring any necessary materials for the job. If you're just helping with homework, bring a pencil and calculator. If you are proofreading a paper, bring a red pen. If you are teaching a new subject, bring some paper. If you are studying for a test, bring some cards. Make sure you have the necessary materials for the job.
 Try to be friendly and funny, but don't act creepy or as if you're just there to hang out. Make sure that the student knows you're only there to help tutor him or her, not be a friend.


Be on time and be prepared. Listen to anything that the child or parent tells you they want to work on. Listening and meeting their needs is your only job, so make sure that you do it.

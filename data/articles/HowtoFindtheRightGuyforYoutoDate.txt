 Would he be funny? Hot? Nerdy? Humorous? Cute? Gamer? Go figure. He's your guy, so go ahead, start planning. What really helps some people is to write down the character traits you want your guy to have.;
, If you are already fit, go to the next step. Eat healthy foods and exercise. Make a plan for how long and what days you'll exercise. Maybe run/walk for a mile on Monday, and 2 miles (3.2 km) for Tuesday? Keep thinking. Remember you don't need to RUN the whole time. Take some breaks. Don't start off fast because you'll get tired. Lay off those junky foods. When your on the couch, you could be getting fit!

, Maybe some non-scented lip gloss? Wear nice and comfy clothes.
 But maybe not shorty shorts. Guys don't wanna see your whole leg. When you're 9 or 10, start wearing a training bra. When your boobs start getting bigger, ask your parents for a real bra. Don't get overwhelmed by if your butt is "small" or your boobs are "small". There is no such thing. Some people say guys like HUGE butts and HUGE boobs. Not true. Just think. Maybe lay it off.
 Be casual, when doing this, maybe sit on a bench and do it. DON'T POINT. Guys may see you and think your insulting them. Be careful!

, If you have, it's time. Ask them out. You can wait for them to make the move, or you. I usually like to meet them (if i haven't already) and then get their phone number, or text email, and once i get that, i will say, "Wanna go to ______ (wherever) ? BOOM! Got it? Don't be discouraged it you didn't. Keep trying! NEVER GIVE UP!

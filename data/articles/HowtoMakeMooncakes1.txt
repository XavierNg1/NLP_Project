 Stir together the alkaline water, golden syrup, and vegetable oil, and sift in the flour more slowly. When mixed together, these ingredients should form a dough.Cover the dough with saran wrap and set it aside for at least 3 hours., Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Put the yolks in a pan and steam them for about 10 minutes on a low to medium heat. Salt the yolks. Set them aside to cool down. Make sure that they have cooled off before you proceed in making the mooncakes.Cut each egg in half.


Once they have dried, you should put them in a bowl and mix them with the cooking wine. Take them out and let them dry. You can also dry them with a paper towel., While the oven is preheating, separate the lotus or red bean paste into 12 equal parts. Roll each of these into a ball., Roll each of those into a ball, as well. Flatten each piece of dough into a small disk., Each mooncake consists of a ball of dough, one ball of lotus or red bean paste, and one half of a salted egg yolk. Make a hole in a ball of lotus or bean paste, and put the egg yolk inside. Make the lotus or red bean paste into a ball that covers the egg yolk entirely.Repeat this process, covering the lotus or red bean paste ball (with the egg yolk inside) with the dough.
Repeat this entire process for each mooncake. You should have 12 mooncakes.
 Press each mooncake lightly into the mold. Take the mooncake out of the mold, and put it onto a baking sheet. Put all 12 mooncakes into the oven, and wait 10-12 minutes.


While the mooncakes are baking, make the egg wash. Mix together the egg whites and the egg yolk, and then sift them through a sieve.
Take the mooncakes out of the oven after about 5 minutes and brush them with the egg wash. Put them back in the oven until they become golden brown.

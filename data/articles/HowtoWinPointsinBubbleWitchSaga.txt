, Get to know the current level and get an idea how deep or how many bubbles you need to go through to clear the level. Know also the points needed to get at least one star. If you don’t get at least one star even if you clear the level, you will lose.
 Start playing the game by shooting the colored bubbles. Bubbles are cleared when you hit your bubbles to the same-colored bubbles at the top., The bubbles you shoot follow the path indicated by the dotted line. You will know where your bubble will land by observing the direction of the dotted line. You can also bounce the bubble off the walls to reach those hard-to-reach spaces.
 If you can, go for the gaps between bubbles and aim higher. If you’re able to clear out higher bubbles, the lower bubbles attached to them will fall off and bounce towards the jars at the bottom, giving you extra points.
 For each turn, you have two bubbles to choose from. You can swap these bubbles if you prefer to use the other one, especially if the two bubbles are of different colors.


Analyze which colored bubble you need before you shoot. Swap the bubbles by clicking or tapping the current bubble being aimed. It will be swapped with the other bubble in the cauldron.
 Do not settle with just clearing out a few bubbles. Go for huge combos by clearing out a huge collection of same-colored bubbles with one shot. You can also get some chain reactions, and you will be able to clear out the level faster and get huge points with that.
 These are the game boosters. Use these sparingly as they can cost you real money. Use these only as a last resort and when you’re confident that you can complete the level. Otherwise, it will be wiser to just restart the game.


The Magic Potions and Magic Scrolls can be equipped for use pre-game. On the pre-game window, click or tap on the Magic Potions and Magic Scrolls you want to use for your game. The costs are indicated on each of the items. Click or tap the items to purchase and equip them.
 The bubbles you shoot are limited. When the bubbles run out and you haven’t reached the goal, you will lose the game. The bubble count is clearly indicated on the middle cauldron where you get your bubbles from.
 Towards the bottom, right on top of the jars, you can find some colored spiders. These spiders give you score multipliers. If you have some bubbles that can fall off, get them to hit these spiders to give you more points.

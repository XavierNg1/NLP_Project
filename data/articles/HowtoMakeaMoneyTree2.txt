 Consider the guest of honor and what materials you have at your disposal.









If using a branch from a living tree, make sure to wash and dry out the branch before potting. Leave the branch in your garage and give bugs time to escape.
 It should be deep enough for the branch to stay upright.









Feel free to decorate the base yourself. Spray paint the base before you insert the branch and allow time for it to dry.
 Coordinate with the occasion and the recipient. Some possibilities:









Ribbons
Lights
Tulle
Pictures
Glitter

, Using $1 bills will give the tree a fuller, more eye-catching look.









Fold the bills in any shape. One-quarter inch folds are typical, but this is a case where you could let your origami skills shine!
As an alternative, roll up the bills and tie them to the branches with ribbon or floral wire., Your tree is ready!

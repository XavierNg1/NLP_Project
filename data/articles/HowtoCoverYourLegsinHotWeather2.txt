 Always opt for light colored pants or long skirts in hot weather. Dark colors absorb heat while light colors reflect heat, keeping your legs cooler. Choose whites, tans, or pastel colors when buying summer bottoms., If you want to keep your legs covered in the heat, opt for a looser fit of pants or long skirt to keep cool. Slightly baggier bottoms will allow for better air circulation, allowing your legs to breathe. Looser fitting linen or cotton items will be comfortable in the heat and still look stylish., When choosing pants or long skirts to wear in hot weather, avoid synthetic fabrics altogether. Synthetic fabrics do not absorb sweat like natural fabrics (e.g. cotton) and are not breathable. They also retain heat, raising your overall body temperature.

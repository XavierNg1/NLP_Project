 The crown is the visible part of a tooth. Damage to crowns on the canine teeth can be painful and possibly damage the roof of the mouth.Crown reduction is useful for different types of malocclusion, such as base narrow canine teeth., Crown reduction is a surgical procedure. Your vet will remove a section of the crown. This will expose the pulp, the sensitive material inside the tooth. Your vet will remove some of this pulp and apply some medication to the remaining pulp to promote healing and prevent infection. Finally, your vet will cover the pulp with a protective barrier (like filling a human cavity).If your dog’s lower canine teeth are misaligned, your vet will remove enough of the crown so the teeth no longer touch the roof of your dog’s mouth.Removing some of the exposed pulp and applying the medication and protective barrier is called vital pulp therapy., About 6–9 months after the crown reduction and vital pulp therapy, your vet will want to take dental radiographs. This is because vital pulp therapy is not always successful. The dental radiographs will help your vet determine whether the entire procedure was successful.If the vital pulp therapy was not successful, your vet may need to perform the procedure again.

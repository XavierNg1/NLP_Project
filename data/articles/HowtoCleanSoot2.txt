 Sprinkle a bit of baking soda on the soot stain on your upholstery or carpet. The baking soda will work to absorb some of the excess soot on the surface of the stain. Be sure that you completely cover the stain with the baking soda. Let the baking soda sit for fifteen minutes and then vacuum it up.You can also use cornstarch as an alternative for baking soda.
 Hold the nozzle of the vacuum hose attachment just above the surface of the sooty fabric and let the suction of the vacuum cleaner lift the soot off of the fabric for you. Don’t press the vacuum hose nozzle directly up against the soot-stained fabric, as this could cause the soot to fly everywhere and create an even bigger mess.For most fabrics or upholstery, you should try to vacuum up as much of the soot as possible first. This will help prevent the soot from settling onto other surfaces during cleaning and help permanently remove the soot from the area.
 Make a solution of 2  c (470 mL) of cool water and one tablespoon of dishwashing liquid. Dip a clean white rag in the solution and wring out the excess. Then dab the washcloth on the soot stain repeatedly until the stain comes out.Keep blotting the soot stain with the washcloth until it is diminished to your satisfaction, while occasionally rinsing out the cloth with cool water and dipping it back in the cleaning solution.

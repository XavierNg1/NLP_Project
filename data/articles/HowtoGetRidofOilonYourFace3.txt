 If over-the-counter products and home remedies have not controlled your greasy skin and acne, consult a dermatologist, who specializes in treating skin. Greasy skin can lead to acne, which can result in scarring and infection. Many medical conditions can contribute to skin problems.
 Before your dermatologist appointment, write down the names and dosages of any medications you are taking so you can discuss them with your doctor.

Common treatment options include:



Antibiotics (topical or oral) — Antibiotics kill bacteria and reduce inflammation in skin. They are sometimes prescribed in low doses with topical benzoyl peroxide to prevent antibiotic resistance.Retinoids (topical or oral) — Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that are often used in tandem with antibiotics. Retinoids unclog whiteheads and blackheads and prevent new pimples from forming in pores.Combination estrogen/progestin birth control pills — Combination birth control pills can regulate hormones for women and prevent the skin from overproducing oil.Combination birth control pills contain estrogen and a progestin, two female reproductive hormones. Progestin-only pills and implants can worsen acne and should not be used to control oily skin.

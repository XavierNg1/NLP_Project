 By changing the ratio of butter to confectioner's sugar, you can create a buttercream more suitable for filling cakes and cookies. It's a little lighter than buttercream frosting, and can be flavored in any way you like. Here's how to make it:









Beat 1 cup of softened butter until fluffy.
Add 1/2 cup shortening and beat well.
Add 1 pound of confectioner's sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt and keep beating.
Add 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until creamy and spreadable.
, If you're looking for a frosting more stable and sturdy than buttercream, but with the same rich flavor, buttercream fondant is for you. It's made with marshmallows and butter flavoring, so it emulates the flavor of buttercream but won't melt as easily.Here's how to make it:









Microwave 8 cups mini marshmallows, 2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons butter extract until the ingredients are melted together.
In a separate bowl, beat 2 pounds confectioner's sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon white corn syrup.
Combine the marshmallow mixture and the sugar mixture in a mixing bowl, and beat until fluffy.
Turn the dough onto a nonstick surface and knead for 10 minutes. Grease your hands with vegetable shortening to keep the dough from sticking.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for an hour before rolling it out and using it.

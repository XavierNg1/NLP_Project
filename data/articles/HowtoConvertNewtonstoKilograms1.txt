 You can learn from many tables or textbooks that one Newton is equal to 0.10197 kilograms of force.A useful way to write this figure is as a conversion ratio, 0.10197kg1N{\displaystyle {\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}}. By writing the conversion in a fraction that way, it should remind you that the two are equal, and the value of the fraction is 1.

Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has a value of 1. This is important in conversions because you can multiply any number by 1 without changing its value, but you can convert the units.
;
, If you have a number of Newtons that you wish to convert to units of kg-force, you can use the conversion factor to set up a simple equation. As long as the conversion term is equal to 1, the value of the measurement will be the same.

For example, suppose you have a measurement of 5 N that you wish to convert to kg-force. Set it up as a multiplication problem, as follows:


5N=5N∗0.10197kg1N{\displaystyle 5N=5N*{\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}}



In setting up the conversion factor, you need to make sure that you write the conversion fraction so the unit you wish to end up with is in the numerator. If you wrote the conversion fraction as 1N0.10197kg{\displaystyle {\frac {1N}{0.10197kg}}}, your result would be incorrect. This would be the conversion to use for the inverse conversion, from kilograms to Newtons.
 If you set up your conversion factor correctly, the final step should be a simple multiplication. You should see that you begin with the unit of Newtons, and your conversion ratio has Newtons in the denominator. As with any fraction multiplication, something that appears both in the numerator and the denominator can cancel out of the equation. This will leave just the desired unit of kg-force.In this example, the problem is set up and can be completed as follows:


5N=5N∗0.10197kg1N=0.50985kg.{\displaystyle 5N=5N*{\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}=0.50985kg.}

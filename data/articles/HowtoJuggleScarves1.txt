 It is hard to juggle normal scarfs as they are large and not made for that purpose. Instead see if you can get your hands on proper juggling scarfs. You might live close to a physical shop that sells circus equipment, but if not use internet sites like eBay or Amazon. Alternatively, you could try making your own out of an old scarf.
 Every time you throw a scarf make sure that its peak is always at your eye level.

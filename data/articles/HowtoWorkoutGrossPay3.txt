 Simply put, how much money do you want or need to take home each week, month, or year to support your lifestyle? The goal of this exercise is to figure out how much gross pay you need to earn in order to take home your target amount of net pay.


Let’s say, for example, that you have determined that you need to take home $2,100 per month in order to pay your monthly expenses and have a little bit left over to save (or spend). Let’s also assume that your current monthly net pay is $1,800.
 For example, if your weekly paycheck lists your gross pay as $600 (or $2,400 per month), and you take home $450 per week ($1,800 monthly), Your net pay is 75% (.75) of your gross pay.


The calculation: 450 / 600 = .75 (weekly), or 1800 / 2400 = .75 (monthly).
 If you need to bring home $2,100 monthly, and you know you currently bring home 75% of your gross pay (because of taxes and other deductions), you can determine your gross pay target.


The calculation: $2,100 / .75 = $2,800. So, if you want to have $2,100 in take-home pay each month, your target is to earn $2,800 per month ($700 weekly) in gross pay.
Please note that this method only provides an approximation, and works best when your current pay and desired pay amounts are close. Varying tax withholding rates, for instance, will throw off the figures if your current net pay is $1,500 monthly and your desired one is $15,000.
 If you have your target net pay in mind already, there are also numerous online options for determining just how much gross pay you need to reach that target amount.


One benefit of these so-called “reverse tax calculators” is that they are calibrated to the taxation and deduction structures of specific countries, and allow you to tailor your withholding criteria, thus providing a more accurate representation of your target gross income.Note that it is not advisable to change your withholding amounts for the sole purpose of achieving a target net pay. You are obligated to pay a certain amount in federal, state, and city tax (where applicable) based on your taxable income. The fact that you have withheld less will not change the amount of the tax due, and you may end up owing money at tax time.

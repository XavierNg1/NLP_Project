,, Depending upon the material you may want work your way from 150 to 600 grit sandpaper. A light touch is best. Alternate between sanding with the lathe on and then sanding lengthwise while the lathe is off. When sanding acrylics, you will find that a little water will aid in the process - just use care while working with water around electrical devices.

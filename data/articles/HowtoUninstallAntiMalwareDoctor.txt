 Since you can not exit out of the doctor, this finds the process running it, and stops it.

, There may be a couple on there, but look for one with a lot of numbers.
 Example, if it says, "C:/Documents/3443/32455" (It will be a larger path than that) you will open drive C, go to documents, open file 3443, and 32455 will be the program. Do not open the program.
 There should be a notepad file named somewhat similar to "enemy-names" open it. If the file looks like it contains the same fake threats that you were getting, close it. You have found the program.
,, It may still be in your add/remove programs list, but you can get rid of it by clicking remove, and you will get a message telling you that it has already been deleted, would you like to remove it from the list? Click yes.,

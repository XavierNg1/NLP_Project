 If waste water rises into the sink, or wherever your washer is attached, follow these instructions. Because the water is connected to an open channel in your washer, you will need to block this before you plunge.
 This is not usually necessary, as your washing machine should automatically block water from entering. If you want to be extra safe, follow the smooth supply hoses at the back of your washing machine until they reach the plumbing. If valves are present, turn them so they lie across the pipe, blocking water to the hose. If there are no valves, remove the hoses, then plug the hole with a wet, tightly rolled cloth.
 If the waste water is coming out of a sink, look for overflow holes near the top of the sink. Plug these. You should be able to fill the sink at least Â¼ of the way full, to act as a "driving medium" pushing the blockage down.
 When plunging, alternate between fast, repetitive movement (as though thumping a drum), and a steadier pace (as though using a bike tire). The first motion breaks apart the bond between clumped debris. The second drives the chunk of matter away. Continue plunging until the water drains.

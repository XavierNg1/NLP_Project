 You have a higher chance of finding a compatible kidney donor through a family member, especially an immediate family member. You may consider asking your family members first about getting tested to be a kidney donor before you talk to friends or other acquaintances., The kidney donor must be over the age of 18. Though having a donor between the ages of 18 and 70 is ideal, people over 70 years old can donate an organ as long as they have a healthy medical history and are medically sound to withstand the operation., A good donor will also have a medical history free of kidney disease and will not have any major health issues that could lead to kidney problems. Preferably, you want a kidney donor who does not smoke tobacco or drink in excess.You should also try to find a donor who does not have diabetes and has a body weight within their normal range. If the donor is considered medically obese, they may need to try to lose weight in order to be a good donor.

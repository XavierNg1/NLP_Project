 Role models help others to find their passions. If you show your excitement about sports, art, cooking, or something else, you can help others be inspired too. Share your interests with your younger relatives. Find ways for them to be involved.If you love to play basketball, get your younger relatives to join you. They may not able to play at the level you’re at, but you can help to teach them the basics.
If you love to bake, ask your younger relatives to help out. Have patience that it may take them more time to learn, but they will be rewarded by helping.
Take them to events where they can learn about different careers, hobbies, and cultures. Consider things like a local food festival or craft fair in your area.
 Find activities that are fun but challenging. Find things that are age appropriate. Be confident in what you’re doing with them. Make them feel special by including them in something that you both can enjoy.


If they’re under 6, find toys and activities that help them to learn basic problem-solving and creative thinking skills like building something out of wooden blocks or learning how to do basic dance steps.
If they’re under 12, find activities that might involve exploring the outdoors or teaching them how to build or make something using craft supplies.
If they are teenagers, it may involve helping with a class project, taking them to a local art show, or volunteering together with a local non-profit.
 Be a friend to your younger relatives. Don’t act like you’re smarter or better than them. Make them feel at ease.


If they do something childish or mess up in some way, don’t laugh at them or make them feel judged.
It’s better to be laughing together and finding something you both can share. Show them silly cat videos online or other silly, age appropriate things.
Take this time to remember what it was like to be their age.

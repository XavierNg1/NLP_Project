 Weekends or vacation times are probably the best time to hold a spa sleepover. The day everyone wakes up should be a day off school, as everyone will probably be tired.;
, Invite at least three teenager girls to do the nails, make up, and hair, tell them what they will be doing. They could be your sister's friends or just people you know.


Choose first teen to paint nails.
Choose the second to put on makeup.
Choose the third to do hair.
Or, you might prefer to leave this up to deciding at the time of the sleepover.
 Make pretty invitations in interesting shapes. For example, you could design the invitations to look like a flip flop or a bottle of shampoo (add glitter!). The best colors are bright or pastel pinks, blues and yellow.
 You can get makeup anywhere! Give each girl a budget and let them buy their own makeup if needed! Make sure you buy brushes, cotton pads and remover!

, Get the whole rainbow and paint your nails tie die!

, Hair is important too! Hair feathers are really cool and come in a lot of colors! Your guests will LOVE bright colored berets, pins and headbands!

, The party girls will really enjoy having a little something to munch on. For example, chocolate covered strawberries, jellybeans, Haribo gummies.
 When the girls leave, have a bag to give away. This can be filled with makeup, candy and hair accessories plus the perfumes, lip gloss and spa things you used or made during the party (if appropriate and hygienic).
 Don't make them sit and wait for you while it takes you 20 minutes to sort everything out! Have everything go smoothly by preparing the next activity while they're doing one, or ask a parent or older sibling to help out with this.
 Use your bathtub, A bucket or a large container. Remember to change the water for each girl you have.
 You can find these at a crafts store, such as the make-your-own lip gloss or perfume sets.
 For this you will need to draw a face on a paper plate and let them practice on that. It's a lot of fun!

You will need a name for your promotion. Most wrestling federation names are made up of three words; like WWE, TNA, WCW, etc. You can create something like HWF, which stands for Hardcore Wrestling Federation, or if you prefer a more family friendly and traditional approach, use TWE, which means Traditional Wrestling Entertainment.
Create a logo. You need it if you want a professional look to your product. Buy any logo making software or make a custom one in Photoshop.;

You would need gimmicks in order to make your matches life-fully. Nobody wants to see a A wrestler vs B wrestler, but everybody want to see CM Punk vs Steve Austin, because of their gimmicks.
Try mock gimmicks to create comic effects. Turn Hollywood Hogan into Hollywood Hogie.



In this business, there is nothing if there is no investment, and don't expect yourself to earn hundreds of dollars on the first go. TNA still needs to turn a profit.



In Wrestling history, all the success has always came with a golden idea; ECW, nWo, Attitude Era, WrestleMania, etc. If you have that ideal, then you can turn the tables in your favour.



Of course, you need wrestlers, but it is the quality of wrestlers that would make the difference. Lame, Skinny and Untalented wrestlers are the stuff which nobody want to see, so avoid that. If you yourself are muscular, and can wrestler, you might yourself wrestle in the ring, and that would make unique story lines. (Look up the Austin vs McMahon wars)
Hiring announcers and commentators are not necessary, one man could announce the wrestlers name and commentary at the same time.Â

Look up in your provincial laws and you would find something about wrestling federations. Make sure you play be the rules or you might suffer fines and banning.
You could even get in trouble if anyone of your wrestlers got injured and you don't pay the medical fees, so make sure their contracts says you have nothing to do with their injuries, and that is their own troubles.

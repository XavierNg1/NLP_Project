 A little jewelry can go a long way.


Buy a bright, colorful necklace to liven up some of your neutral colored clothing.
Pick out a funky bracelet to spice up your apparel in a subtle way.
Look for bold earrings. Instead of picking out a pair of tiny posts, pick out large, noticeable posts in bright colors.
Add some dangling earrings to your jewelry box.
Purchase a bold, brightly colored ring to pair with an outfit that needs a touch of pizzazz.
 If you've had the same purse for several seasons, it may be time for a change. Try a large shoulder bag in a bright color or bold pattern.
 Belts do not work with every outfit, but you may be surprised to learn just how versatile a belt can be.


Match a simple belt in a neutral color and match it with your patterned blouses.
Pick out a colored belt or patterned sash to pair with neutral tops.
 Look for a trendy design you don't usually try.


Purchase a pair of strappy heels if you are only used to wearing closed-toe shoes.
Select a heel in a bright, bold color that matches to add a pop of color to neutral, dull colored clothing.

 Does the blade or hinge look slightly orange? Or even slightly powdery or white? This could be caused by the metal in the knife oxidizing to the point of the blades adhering to the casing or each other.;
, Then, buff it clean in a day or two. Once you've done this, keep the knife oiled from then on.
 In this case, the metal parts need a good soak without getting the rust removal fluid on the non-metal parts. You can do this by masking the area off with tape, by using tiny brushes or "Q-tips", etc.
 Use a heavy towel or wear gloves to protect your fingers from the blade(s) during this process.

 Although kangaroo paw is drought tolerant once it is established, watering is important after planting and when the flowering stems are elongating during spring. When watering, avoid watering the foliage; focus on the soil.
 While the kangaroo paw does not need fertiliser, giving it some will boost the flower production. Apply in spring and in autumn, using a fertiliser that has controlled release.
 When pruning, prune close to ground level. Do this after flowering has finished for the season.
 Although able to tolerate temperature extremes well, kangaroo paw flowers will not emerge if subjected to more than a very light frost.

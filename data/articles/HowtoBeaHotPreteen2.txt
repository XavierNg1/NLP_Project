  Sports are sexy if you do them without sweating and yelling like crazy.  Try doing dance, tennis/badminton, soccer, or cheerleading.  One of those things, but of course do as many sports as you would like.  They're healthy and good for you.  Stay active and sporty.
  Don't try to be all girly and cute.  Casually smile with your eyebrows raised or give a quick wink to your crush.  Be sort of calm and quiet.  This makes you look mature, hot, and makes people respect you more.  Be easygoing and social though.  Try to make friends.
  Late elementary/middle school is not the time to be kissing and bragging about boyfriends yet.  Give a quick wink, wave, say hi, or do the eyebrow raising smile.  Don't play with your hair or else you'll look sort of cute and girly.  Play a little hard to get and smile at boys.
  Be confident in yourself, your body, your dreams, everything.  Confidence is a really big part of being hot, as you may have guessed.  Hotness isn't just about attracting boys/making girls jealous, it's about feeling good in your own skin and feeling liked and special.
  Last but not least, be really kind and grateful for what you have.  No one likes a spoiled brat who judges everyone by their cover.  Try making as many friends as you can and doing favors for others.  Don't just do it for your reputation, do it because you want to be a good person.  Cheesy, I know, but true.  Always say please and thank you, recycle, and you're hot!

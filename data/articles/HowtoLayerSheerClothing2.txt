 This is a good way to wear clothing suitable for warm weather without showing too much skin. It is also a way to experiment with showing some skin. You could wear a tank top or tight t-shirt as the bottom layer. For the top layer, wear a shirt that is slightly sheer, or wear a shirt that is sheer, but has a pattern that covers up some of the transparency.For example, wear a shirt that is largely covered in opaque lace, but does have some sheer areas.
 There are a few ways that you can wear a sheer skirt. One modest way is to wear a loose and long sheer skirt over a tighter fitting opaque shirt. You can also wear a tight, sheer skirt with another tight opaque skirt that is of the same form and length as the top layer. Wearing a long, sheer skirt is also a way to add some modesty to wearing a short skirt as a bottom layer., You donâ€™t have to wear a lot of sheer clothing to make a statement. It is also an option to wear accents of sheer clothing. You can buy the clothing with small amounts of sheer material, or you can layer your clothing to only show parts of the sheer layer.Wear a long-sleeved sheer shirt and only allow the cuffs to show under the jacket.
Buy a shirt that only has a few parts of sheer fabric, or only has a layer of sheer material attached to the bottom of the shirt or sleeves.
 Sometimes wearing sheer clothing is not entirely intentional. For example, thin linen or other thin fabrics can appear sheer. A way to solve this problem is to wear nude second-skin shorts, or Spanx, underneath.

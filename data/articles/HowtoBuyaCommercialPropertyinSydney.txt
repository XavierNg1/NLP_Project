Consult with your accountant, financial adviser, and lawyer, as well as a dependable commercial realtor while analyzing the costs and benefits.
Make sure your commercial realtor is a member of the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) or the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales (REINSW). These organizations promote an ethical code of conduct for their members, and can provide reliable information about the commercial real estate market in Sydney.
Take into account that buying a commercial property can result in loss of liquidity for your company, and that returns may not be as high as projected due to devaluation or defaulting tenants.
Assess how the costs of renovations, maintenance, and property management will impact your company's revenue.
Estimate the projected revenue in terms of asset building and/or rental income, as well as the deductible you gain on your taxes due to devaluation of the property.
 Keep the purpose of your purchase in mind during your inspections and make a checklist of requirements that the property needs to meet in order to be an option for purchase.
 Research whether it's zoned for commercial use and what, if any, development plans exist for the surrounding area that may impact the value of the property.

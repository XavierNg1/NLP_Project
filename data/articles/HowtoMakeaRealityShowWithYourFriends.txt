 What reality show do you want? Drama, action, or a show where people get voted off of somewhere? Please choose.;
, Say you want a vote-off show, do you want teams. If so, how many teams and how many people on each? Maybe you want partners? Or, do you want a free for all? Decide, and then make the teams.
 Before you make the teams, though, remember to make the character descriptions. You might want a snooty character, a crazy character, things like that.
 Figure out what age group it should target. Put warnings on each episode, telling the age group and or any reason it should be restricted.
 Remember your age groups, and write the script accordingly.You don't want to target 5 year olds and cuss, or target 15 year olds and have bunnies everywhere.
 When you are done with these steps, start shooting your reality show.
 Put your show somewhere where people can view it, or this whole thing is a waste.

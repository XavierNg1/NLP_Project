 Whisk the egg and half the milk in a bowl. Gradually add the flour to make a smooth, thick batter. Beat throughout until there are no more lumps, then add the remaining milk. It's important that your batter is quite thick so that the mixture doesn't run everywhere.;
, A thin coat should suffice, but use more if you like. You may also consider using margarine, olive/vegetable oil, or a non-stick cooking spray.
 The size of the pancake depends on the size of your plate, but be aware that larger pancakes will take longer to cook.
 Adjust the time if you know that your microwave is particularly weak or strong. If the pancake is still runny, heat it for another ten seconds, but don't go overboard. There's no grill involved, so your pancake won't brown. If you do overcook your pancake, it will become dry, not burned.
 Place the cooked pancake onto a clean plate. If the cooking plate is still well-greased with butter, then pour another dollop of pancake batter onto the first plate. If not, then spread more butter as needed to ensure that the next pancake doesn't stick. Cook the second pancake for one minute or until it is no longer runny. Repeat until you have as many pancakes as you want.

 Once you've identified the patient's problem, it'll be easier for you to find a solution to help fulfill the patient's needs.;
, Sometimes, patients have been waiting a long time in the hospital and being ill is unpleasant. They may come to the pharmacy with a gloomy mood and just by smiling, we're showing that we're willing to help them by preparing their medications.
 Most patients want to be heard. By listening to them, it shows that we're willing to help them, and that we understand how they feel. If the patient has been talking for a long time, we gently interrupt him by repeating his problems and how we'll help him solve his problems and then lead him to the waiting room.
 Some patients may be rude or frustrated over something or someone. This is because they're sick, their well being is affected and their needs are not being met. Therefore, we shouldn't take their words or actions personally and we should be more patient and understanding towards them.
 First, greet the patient; gather the required information in order to fill in the prescription; if it's a rarely dispensed medication, verify its availability; lead the patient to the waiting room; prepare the medication for the pharmacist to verify; use the cash register and dispense the medication. Always make sure to notify the patient if there are any third party billing issue to the patient as soon as possible. Always greet the patient and call the patient's name by Mr. or Mrs. X and give the necessary information concerning the medication such as: "This is a last renewal or this is an extension etc..."

 Texture packs for Minecraft 1.5 or earlier are not compatible with newer versions of Minecraft. These packs will need to be converted before they can be used with the newest versions.
 Minecraft 1.5 texture packs are "stitched" together before they can be used, and this process will need to be undone before the pack can be converted. While you can unstitch manually, this can be very time-consuming. Instead, download a program called Unstitcher, which is designed to automate the process.Run Unstitcher and then load the texture pack. The un-stitching process will begin, and may take a few minutes to complete.
 Once you've finished unstitching the pack, download and run Minecraft Texture Ender. This program will convert the unstitched texture pack pack into a resource pack. Run the program and load the unstitched pack to begin the conversion process.
 After the pack has been converted, you can load it into Minecraft just as you would any other resource pack. See the previous section for detailed instructions.

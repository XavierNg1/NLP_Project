 A daily walk will help your dog stay fit and trim. Strap on the leash and take your dog around the block. Or you could head to your local park and give your dog a chance to encounter some new sights and smells.Proceed slowly at first, but don’t let your dog linger or walk lazily.
The more intense your dog’s walk, the better the benefits you will both reap.
Don’t push your elderly dog beyond what it is capable of. If your dog starts to slow down noticeably, reduce your pace and head for home.
 Games and play are great for keeping your elderly dog active. For instance, toss your dog’s favorite toy or ball across the room. Better yet, head outside to a space where your dog has lots of space to run about. After tossing the toy, encourage your dog to bring it back to you. Repeat several times until your dog is tired. This simple game will improve your dog’s circulation and flexibility, leading to less morning stiffness.Playing with your dog is good for its mental and emotional health.
 When your dog is swimming, the water’s buoyancy lifts and supports your dog, allowing it to move about more freely than it would otherwise. Take your doggie to the lake or a slow-moving stream or river for a fun summer outing that can improve your dog’s mobility., Let your dog know before heading out to play or go for a walk. For instance, say “Walk?” repeatedly to your dog in an excited voice before heading out for a walk. Pet your dog lovingly as you say it. Over time, your dog will come to associate this word and the subsequent walk with the good feelings it has due to being paid attention and petted.After your walk is finished, pet your dog several more times and say “Good boy/girl” affectionately.

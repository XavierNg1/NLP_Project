 What is it that attracts you to this person? What might you see yourself doing with them that they would also enjoy? Find out what interests you have in common and where you might collaborate on something fun and creative. Could you offer to teach them how to rock climb or bake a mean pie? Do you want to form an a cappella singing group - and they're a musician? Find ways that you can break new ground together.;
, Now that you've thought of something you would both enjoy doing, invite them to join you with a friendly smile and an enthusiastic, but unattached, spirit.
 Act independent about it: casually mention that you like to go for walks on the beach to decompress after work, or that you like the vibe at a certain cafe. Then tell them you'd love for them to join you sometime because (fill in the blank - they have such an interesting life and you'd like to hear more about their background; you enjoy their company; you want to hear more about that book they're reading; etc.) Be confident and extend a simple, gentle complement. Nothing more is needed.
 If the person says yes, set a date and stick to it. Honoring your word and being punctual show respect for the other person's time, and you let them know you're someone they can depend on.

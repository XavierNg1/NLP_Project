 If you can't see a check coming, you cannot receive it properly. When you have the puck or are going after the puck, look up and see if any players look as if they might check you.;
, Helmet, elbow pads, chest pads, kneepads, ankle braces and leg guards are important to maintain safety during a game. Make sure all of your gear is strapped on tightly before the game.
 Don't tense up right before the hit - stay calm and loose. Staying tense while receiving a hit will transfer the pain throughout your body and cause more injuries.
 If you can, steer yourself into the the boards to help stabilize you. Being hit into the center of the rink proposes the threat of being skated or tripped over.
 Get up one body part at a time, making sure that each of your body parts is intact and you have no broken bones.

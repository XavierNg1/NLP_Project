 There isn’t a snob alive that would be caught shopping locally, in their home town, no matter how high fashion it may be. Instead, take shopping trips. Pour over fashion magazines, websites and blogs for ideas. Pack your bags and jet. Don’t forget to bring along an empty suitcase for all the great finds.
Download a currency conversion app for your trip too. This will help you ensure you stay on budget…if you even have one.
 You MUST have the latest and greatest before anyone else. If you are a tech snob, make sure you pre-order the newest iPad to hit the market. More of a sneaker person? Have your friend who works at the retail store to set a pair (or two) aside before it even hits the shelves.


Be sure to boast to those around you about how sweet the new item is and that you can’t believe they don’t have one and have to wait in line.
 Snobs always look like money from the top to the bottom. Make sure you wear pricey sunglasses, perfume/cologne, shoes, etc. You can still come across as a snob even without the funds. It’s all about how people perceive you. You can accomplish this by leaving tags on a few items in your closet. It will give the illusion that you have cash to blow.
Take tips from those you admire like athletes and musicians and copy their style.
Watch to make sure you don’t see your favorite accessory all over town. If you do, toss it!

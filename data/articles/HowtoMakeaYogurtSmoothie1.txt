 You can use nonfat, low-fat, or regular yogurt. You can even use Greek yogurt, but make sure that it is not flavored; this will allow you to control the flavor of your smoothie.;
, Cut larger types of fruit, such as bananas, strawberries, and peaches into smaller pieces to make them easier to blend. Leave berries as they are. Remember to cut out any leaves, seeds, and pits. You can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit. If you are using fresh fruit, you may need to add some ice later on to make the smoothie thicker. If you are using frozen fruit, you won't need to add any ice.Listed below are popular fruit options:Berries, including: blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries
Tropical fruits, such as: mango, papaya, and pineapple

,,, Yogurt smoothies are pretty healthy by themselves, but you can make them even healthier (or tastier) by adding in some extras. They are not necessary, but they can brink your yogurt smoothie to the next level. Here are some ideas to get you started:1 scoop of protein powder
1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 grams) of wheat germ or flaxseed
1 to 2 pinches of ground cinnamon or nutmeg
½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) grated citrus peel

, For extra flavor, add ½ teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of vanilla extract., This will take about 2 to 3 minutes, depending on what sorts of fruit you are using and whether or not you added ice. From time to time, you will need to open the blender, and push the ingredients down the sides with a spatula; this will help blend things more evenly and prevent any chunks., Use a spatula to help guide the smoothie into the glass. Be sure to scrape the sides of the blender clean so that you don't waste any smoothie goodness.


For a fancy touch, garnish it with a piece of cut fruit (such as a strawberry or banana slice) or a sprinkle of cinnamon. You can also use mint or basil leaves instead.

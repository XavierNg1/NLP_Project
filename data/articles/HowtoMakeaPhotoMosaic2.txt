 For a scrapbook page that is 8.5 by 11 inches (21.25 by 27.5 cm), 4 to 6 photos work best. A 12 by 12-inch (30 by 30 cm) scrapbook page can have 6 to 8 photos.
 Consider any titles or anything else you want to leave room for on the page.
 Make a grid of 1-inch (2.5 cm) squares on the back of the photo with a ruler and pen or pencil. The width of the squares can be adjusted or part of the photo can be cut if the photo's dimensions are not exactly 4 by 6 inches (10 by 15 cm).
 This will help you know which photo square goes where in the whole image. Repeat the gridlines and numbering for the other photos.
 Use a paper trimmer.
 Cut the strips into individual squares with the paper trimmer.
 From 1 corner of the scrapbook page, begin sticking the squares down along the top or side edge of the page. Reposition any crooked squares as you work.
 Try to make the spaces between the photo squares even.

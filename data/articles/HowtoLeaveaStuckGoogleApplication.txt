 When you do almost anything in the latest Google apps, they will say Loading in what appears to be a center-aligned tab on the top of the screen, then they will say what they just did, e.g. 43 conversations have been marked as spam. If you wait a couple minutes, sometimes it will go away and you may proceed.;
, Generally, when it gets stuck, it has processed your request and it's kind of in limbo. Send another, simpler request down the tube and see if that fixes it. Usually it will. In Gmail, just click "Inbox". It should finish the first task (or, more accurately, acknowledge that the first task was completed successfully) and then do the easy task. That should do it. If not, proceed.
 But first, close your browser, and then open it again, to a neutral page with no scripts running (e.g. google.com). Generally, web apps tend to reside in your browser's cache and run from there. If there's a problem, the folks at Google will probably fix it before you can report it. Make sure the one in your cache is gone before heading back to try again.

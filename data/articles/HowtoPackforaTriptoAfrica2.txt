 For most African countries, lightweight clothing that can handle humidity and heat are suitable. But don't forget the right gear for colder climate times too, such as winter in Morocco or climbing into mountain regions.
 The following list is a helpful indicator to guide your packing:


1 long sleeved shirt
2 light long trousers
2 skirts/dresses
3 T-Shirts
2 shorts
1 swimsuit
1 small towel (get the type that is really small and expands with water, or choose camping/bike towels which are small but efficient; great for removing sweat)
1 hat
3 pairs of socks
Cotton underwear and socks
1 pair of walking boots
1 pair of sandals or flippers

, Long trousers also offer good protection against cuts/scratches in the bush and against mosquitoes in the evening.
 Try colours that match the dark earths in many parts of Africa. Brown and Grey are particularly adept at looking cleaner for longer.
 Brilliant white shirts, perfectly ironed are surprisingly common for men.

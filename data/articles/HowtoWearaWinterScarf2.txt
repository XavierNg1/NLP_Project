 This is a common style, likely because of its excellent protection and simple method. Take your scarf around your neck evenly and cross each end over the front of your body. Now you can tighten your scarf to your comfort and allow the excess for each end to hang behind you., Frequently seen on the slopes, this knot offers a buffer from the cold and can be tied in an instant. Halve your scarf so that you hold it by the loop in your right hand, with both ends dangling together loosely. Take the loose ends around your neck, bring these across your chest, and thread both ends through the loop in your right hand., This style has the benefit of being both warm and classy, giving the impression of an elaborate knot across the front of your neck. Leaving the right end of your scarf longer:


Take the short end of your scarf around the back of your neck.
Loop the long end so that it comes back under itself, keeping the loop loose.
Pull the long end under itself to the other side, while preserving your loop.
Gently take the long end through your loop.
Join the short end with the long by taking it through the loop.This particular style may require a little more length on your long end than usual.
After you have taken the short end of your scarf through the loop made by the long end, you can lightly tug on each end until the knot is comfortable and both ends are roughly even.

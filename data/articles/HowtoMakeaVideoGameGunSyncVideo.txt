 Identify the beat, the harmony, the melody, everything. You need to be precise. Match the part with a weapon that closely resembles that harmonic frequency.

 Blast away with each of the weapons. Technically, you only need one shot for each weapon (you can recycle the same shot while editing the video), but if you want to impress your audience, shoot out the whole thing.
 Align the shots in perfect sync with the music. Once you are satisfied, upload it to YouTube.

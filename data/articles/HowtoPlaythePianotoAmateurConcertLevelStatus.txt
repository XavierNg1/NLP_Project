 That way you will always know that you're hitting the correct key. (You don't have time to look at them all when you're playing fast.) It will also ensure that you don't hit the keys too hard, which you should never do.;

 2-3 octaves,) you may need to look at the keys to see where they're at, but still, you must touch the keys first before playing them. This ensures accuracy (very important at high speeds,) a soft touch (very important for expression, and not hammering the keys,) and very little effort or work to do for your fingers, which makes it easy to play long, fast passages without errors, and without fatigue.

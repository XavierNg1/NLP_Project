Unlike when you're working from scratch, eye shadow here is meant to create the illusion of thickness with your natural brow hairs. You will be working with a much lighter shade here. If your skin is pale and your hair is light, use a neutral taupe. If your skin and hair are darker, use a neutral dark brown instead., Use your existing eyebrows as a guide when determining a shape. Fill in your brow using small, light strokes until you're happy with your eyebrows' shape and thickness.









It is very important to match your brow pencil closely with your hair and complexion.Try to find one that is close to your natural hair color but a few shades darker. If you dye your hair, it may look more natural to match the hair on your head rather than your existing brows.
 Hold an eyebrow pencil from your nostril diagonally to your brow. The point where the pencil intersects with your brow ridge is where your eyebrow should end. Extending beyond this spot will make your eyebrows look less natural.

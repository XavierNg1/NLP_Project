 To achieve the Eastern Backhand Grip, use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely. The Eastern Backhand Grip is:









the most common backhand grip.
a versatile, stable grip that can generate a little topspin or hit more directly.
good for hitting low balls, not good for controlling high ones.
 To position your hand for the extreme eastern or semi-western grip, hold your racket pointing away from you with your left hand. Orient the string area so that it is perpendicular to the ground. Put your right hand out as if to shake hands with the grip of the racket, and place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, slanted facet of the grip just to the left of the flat top. Close your hand around the grip so that this same bevel of the grip goes diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. This grip is:









only used by stronger, more advanced players.
good for controlling high balls and generating topspin.
difficult for transitioning closer to the net and bad for hitting low balls.
 The most common way to perform a two-handed backhand is by placing your dominant hand in the Continental Grip (base index knuckle on the top right slanted facet), and then placing your other hand just above it in the Semi-Western Forehand Grip (base index knuckle on the bottom left slanted facet). This grip:









is much more powerful than a one-handed backhand.
makes it difficult to slice, volley, and reach out for wider shots.

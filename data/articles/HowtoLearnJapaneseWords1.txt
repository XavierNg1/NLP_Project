 Making flashcards is a very effective way to learn words. While you are writing down the words you are already learning them. It gives you also a possibility to see how the words are written. For this method you need:


2 pens/pencils in different colours
Flashcards;
, Write the translation with 1 colour on one side of the flashcard. Advantageous a dark colour like blue or black.
 Take a bright colour like red, pink or orange. This will help you to remember the word because the translation will be in a dark colour. With this difference our brain is more likely to remember the word.Write down the word in Hiragana or Katakana. While you write it down you should say it out loud for several times. When you`ve finished, put the card away and try to say it again by heart. Then continue with the next word.
 Go through the flashcard stack. If you know the word, put it on the "I know it" stack. If you got it right but you needed a lot of time, you should put it on the "Still need a bit of practice" stack. If you got it wrong, put it on the "I didn't know" stack.The most effective way to study words with flashcards is to repeat them several times in a day for about 5-10 minutes. You can study when:


You`re waiting for the bus
You`re watching TV and they are showing advertising
You`re having a break at school or work
You`re cooking and waiting for your meal do be done

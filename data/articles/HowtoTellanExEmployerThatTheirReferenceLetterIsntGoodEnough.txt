 You never want to tell someone "that was bad or that was wrong," unless you're training them. (Even then, there are better ways to modify behavior.);
, This is a person who has agreed to help you, as a favor. It doesn't matter how much you worked your butt off for them - technically, they don't owe you anything. So having a confrontation won't be productive. Or, even if it makes you feel better to get it off your chest - you won't win. And your goal is to get a better Letter of Recommendation, not a cranky ex-boss.
 Context means breaking down for them what you need, and why. To do this, you may have to re-imagine for yourself: "What do I need this letter to say, and why?"

, Use an introduction like the following:


"Hey, Mr. Rogers - thanks so much for the letter! It looks great . Tell you what - I just found out that, for the position of Janitor / Software Engineer / Student at Harvard, they're especially going to look at my sources to say: . Is that something you feel comfortable saying?"

, By approaching it this way, you have told your ex-boss that a) they did nothing wrong, and in fact you're grateful they took the time to write a letter, b) that you have specific needs, and c) would they mind filling them for you. Basically, you asked them to do a simple task and you did all the thinking for them, while making their answer ("yes") seem obvious. This is the key to persuasion - recommend a new action and make it seem simple, without assigning blame.


Make sure you give your ex-boss a deadline by which you need the revisions!

, If it doesn't change your ex-boss's approach, then reconsider what you'll do. If you feel like your ex-boss is impervious to suggestions, find someone else. You'd be amazed at the people who can recommend you - a teacher, a business partner, a clergy member, a babysitting client, an employer of any kind, even a volunteer coordinator. Be creative when you think of sources.

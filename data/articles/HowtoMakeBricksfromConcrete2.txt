 This will most likely be the most physically challenging part of making brick from concrete. Using a commercially prepared dry mix of concrete materials is the easiest method. It is often referred to as Sak-crete and normally comes in 40-to-80-pound (18.1-to-36.2 kg) bags, which are then mixed in a wheelbarrow.
 Make a small hole in the middle of the dry mix using a shovel or a common garden hoe.


Begin adding small amounts of water in that small hole, preferably from a bucket rather than a hose for better control of the amount of water that is added at any one time.
Mix the dry material and water together with the hoe or shovel, adding water until you have a concrete consistency that is workable. Too wet and it will want to push up the side and run under the forms. Too dry and it will not want to consolidate, but rather it will leave air voids in your concrete brick.



Tap on the side of the forms with the brick forms filled. Tapping on the top afterward will force any trapped air out from inside of the concrete.
Use a straight edge or 12-inch (30.5 cm) trowel to smooth off the top of the concrete level with the top of the forms. Allow it to dry for 24 hours.
 Stack the bricks in a cool area to cure a suggested 2 weeks. Cover them up with a mover's blanket while they are curing and keep the blanket wet and covered with plastic sheeting. This will keep the bricks from cracking during the curing process. Once they have cured, you are ready to use them.

 Put them in boiling water with salt. Do not let cook for too long, as they should only be parboiled, not mushy. Remove them from the water and let them cool down slightly, enough to handle with ease.;
, Make slices of 1 centimeter (0.4 in) thickness; the slices should not be too thin. Put the onion slices into a pan with some butter. Cook them until the onions form a glaze. The onions should not be overcooked, so do not leave them until they becomes brown; just cook enough until they're soft and transparent.
 Keep cooking but do not let it boil.
 Beat 2 eggs in a small bowl. Add them to the pan with the onions and stir to combine the ingredients.
 Mix well, so as to not form lumps.     

,, Layer the potato slices in the baking dish. Add salt to taste, thyme and a teaspoon of olive oil.
 Spread this over the potato layers.
 Cook at a medium heat for 15-20 minutes. Check from time to time to see if the top layer has thickened.
 When the tart appears ready, sprinkle shredded cheese over the top. Return the dish to the oven for another 5 minutes of cooking, to melt the cheese.
 Add a side salad or steamed vegetables to go with each slice of tart.

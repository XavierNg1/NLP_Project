 Field Spaniels have a thick, water-repellent coat. The hair is moderately long and can be straight or slightly curly. The coat also has a bit of feathering on the chest, underbody, backs of the legs, and rear end., Field Spaniels can come in a variety of different colours including black, reddish brown, golden brown, speckled, or any of these colours with additional tan points. Some Field Spaniels also have a bit of white on the chest and/or throat.
 The Field Spaniel will shed moderately throughout the year. This can be managed with weekly brushing. Unlike other spaniel breeds, the Field Spanielâ€™s coat is much easier to maintain and they do not need to visit the groomer on a regular basis.

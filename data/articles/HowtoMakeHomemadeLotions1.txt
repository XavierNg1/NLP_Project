 Place ½ cup (107 g) of raw shea butter in glass bowl or jar. Fill a medium saucepan with 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm) of water, and set the glass container with the shea butter in the pan. Bring the water to a gentle boil on medium-high heat until the shea butter melts completely, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the shea butter as it’s melting to help it heat evenly.
You can usually purchase raw shea butter at health food and organic grocery stores, as well as beauty supply stores. A variety of online sites also sell it.;
, Once the shea butter has melted, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to the glass container. Stir the mixture well to ensure that the ingredients are thoroughly combined.If you prefer, you can substitute almond or avocado oil for the olive oil.
 When the shea butter and olive oil are fully mixed, pour the mixture into a bowl. Set the bowl in the refrigerator, and allow it cool completely so the mixture starts to harden, which should take approximately 30 to 40 minutes., After the mixture has hardened, remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Use a hand or immersion blender to blend the mixture again until it has a soft, creamy texture, which should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.If you don’t have a hand or immersion blender, you can blend the lotion by hand. Use a whisk to whip the mixture until it has a creamy consistency.
 When the lotion has reached the right texture and consistency, use a spatula to transfer it to a storage container that has a lid. The lotion will usually stay fresh for 3 to 6 months at room temperature.Mason jars make an ideal storage container for the lotion.

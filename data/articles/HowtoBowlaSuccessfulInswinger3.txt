 When bowling an Inswinger, it’s important to make sure you have a good ball.


Shine your ball after every bowl. Use your saliva or sweat on the shiny side of the ball, and then polish it on your clothes. Make sure you don’t get other substances on the ball, like sunscreen, as this can ruin the leather.
Shining the ball helps it to swing effectively because the smoother side lets air flow around it more easily than the rougher side, and so it creates a better swing., It can take time to find the run up that feels the most comfortable for you. Take some time to do drills, and try different techniques.Give yourself time to create a habit.


Enlist the help of a friend or coach. In a field or even in your yard, mark out a starting point for your practice run up. With ball in hand, start at this point.
With your eyes closed, run until it feels right to release the ball, but don’t actually deliver your ball. Have your friend mark where you stop. Repeat this around 15 times until a pattern begins to emerge. Count the number of strides it takes you to get to the point at which you have been stopping.
This exercise will help you determine a run up that is natural for you.
 You don’t need a coach or team to practice your Inswinger technique.


Try setting up a simple stake in the ground, made from a branch, to show you where the batsman would be.
Use a piece of rope or duct tape as the crease, so you know when to deliver the ball and can practice your run up properly.
 Like any sport, being a skilled cricket player requires a level of athleticism.


Work on your arm strength by doing simple weight lifts and push-ups every other day.
Make sure you keep up your cardiovascular strength by running moderate distances. This will help to improve your stamina.
Utilizing a handgrip strengthener can help improve your grip on the ball.
Maintaining your basic fitness will give you greater control over your game.

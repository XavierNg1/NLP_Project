 If your equipment has an option to not make the customary sound, then use it. This is more applicable in a public arena type of photography. Say you're doing some corporate shots in a business office. The constant noises of photography can be quite distracting. While being there is your business, you are at their business. Show them some respect.;
,, Don't bring strobes with all of the attendant power cords and/or battery cells. Obviously, if you are going to be using a dedicated room, this might not apply, but it is a lot of extra work if you carry large lights like that. Try using off camera flashes.
 Some of the things that you need to look into are:


Are there specific areas for event photographers to be at?
Can you photograph from a seat? Basically, a fan with a camera.
Are photographs allowed at all (except for the event photographers)?

, They don't tell you that for your health. Standing in the wrong place, in some sports, can be your last wrong decision.
 At museums and sanctuaries, quite often, flash is not allowed. Be prepared to use your other tools (ISO, Shutter speed) and reflectors.
 Just because you, presumably, have a nicer camera or are there on business, doesn't give you leave to be rude and inconsiderate. Look at it as free advertising (being polite)., Don't get in their way and treat them as you would want to be treated.
 You will want to cover your camera(s), lens, equipment, and any incidents that may occur.
 If you are doing street photography, be respectful.
 No means No. Even if you are in public, and they have no reasonable expectations of privacy, they are still people. Be nice., If you aren't there shooting portraits, but maybe doing some 'drive by' shooting, take the shot and go. Don't make them wait.
 It can result in a lot of embarrassment.

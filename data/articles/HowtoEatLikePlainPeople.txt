 Amish eat a lot of fresh foods in the growing and harvest months. Sweet corn, celery, beets, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, peas, and a wide variety of other vegetables are grown in the typical Amish garden. Amish may have fruit trees or grapevines on their property as well.;
,, Depending on the level of technology permitted in a congregation, Amish may freeze large quantities of food, particularly meat.
 Many Amish have laying hens which produce a steady stream of eggs. Chickens may be slaughtered for meat. Some Amish will raise pigs for the same purpose. Amish dairies provide farm families a steady supply of milk and dairy goods. Families without a dairy may have a “family cow”. Amish often drink milk raw, and claim that it has health benefits, though selling raw milk to the public is not permitted in some states.
 Deer and other wild animals killed while hunting serve as food sources for the family as well.

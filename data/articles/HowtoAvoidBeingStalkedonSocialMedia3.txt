 Don't tag others, and don't allow others to tag you. Once you link to someone else's profile through tagging, big privacy holes open up. A person can see any other pictures of you or your family and friends, and they'll also see the comments you left (and the comments people left about you). Their photo privacy settings could affect your safety.Make sure your photos are not geotagged.
Turn on a feature on some social media sites to approve tags before they appear on your profile. That way, you can not approve and they will not show up.
 Make any online photo albums private, too, especially if you embed pictures from those albums onto your social media profiles. For example, if you use a cloud or photo sharing platform, make all of your albums private or shareable only by you.

For example, if you use photos from your Google account on your blogger account, check the settings to make sure the content you want private is private.
 Even if your profiles are private, people can find the original version of your profile picture or avatar (the high resolution one) and download it. Upload pictures in low resolution. This way, they cannot zoom in on you or your features.If your profile picture is public, consider using a picture that is not a close-up of you. You might want to post a picture of something that is not you, like phrase or a saying, or anything that won’t fuel a creep’s obsession.

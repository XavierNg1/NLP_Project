 Tell them exactly what happened. Be straightforward and just state the facts. Show that you are mature enough to tell them about the ticket without making excuses.


Speaking to your parents in a grown-up way about the ticket can also show them that you are mature enough for the responsibility of driving.
Start by saying: “I have to tell you that I got a ticket.” Then tell them what the ticket is for.
Share some facts, like where you got pulled over and when.
Tell them: “I understand what I did was wrong.”
Ask them if they have any questions.
 Your parents will respond better to you if you speak calmly. Don’t get defensive. It’s hard to have a conversation with someone on the defensive. And acting defensive, especially when you are wrong, is childish.Don't say: "But it wasn't my fault!" or "Don't blame me!"

, You might be embarrassed or afraid of disappointing your parents. Sharing how you feel can make it easier to have your conversation. Let them know how you feel about telling them and how you feel about the ticket. You might say: “I feel like I disappointed you” or “I am embarrassed.”
This is the right time to say: “I am sorry.”

, Tell your parents that you want to avoid tickets in the future. Ask your parents about how they drive and what they do to avoid tickets. This will show that you are serious about being a good driver.


Ask them: “How do you avoid tickets?” or “Do you have any advice to make me a better driver?”
Be sure to tell them: “I don’t want to get a ticket again.”

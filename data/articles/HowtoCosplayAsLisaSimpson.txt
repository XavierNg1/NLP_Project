 Even though Lisa is only 8 she reads a lot of 'classic literature' like The Bronte sisters, or Jane Austen. Lisa idolizes famous women like Rosa Parks or Mother Theresa. If you hear of a name try find out about the person.;
, It can be whatever you want, it doesn't have to be a 'nerdy' club, though if that's the sort of impression you want to give off then by all means go to one!

, Lisa plays the saxophone because she likes Jazz. If you don't like Jazz feel free to learn anything, like the piano or violin and play Mozart.
 Lisa is usually kind and helpful to everyone around her. The only time you can let loose is when somebody is being immoral. She is quite wise and has a lot of common sense. If you are in a tricky situation no matter what you choose the option that makes you a better person, e.g. if you fight with a friend talk to a parent about it and then you should start to realize that if you say sorry everything would be better.
 Lisa supports various causes for example an anti-cruelty to animals cause. Try raising money for a cause of your choice, cake sales normally make quite a lot. Give all the money to your chosen charity.
 Lisa also consumes a lot of soy. Sometimes being a vegetarian might not be the healthiest option but if you just eat healthy then you should have no problem.
 Lisa is a Buddhist, and although you don't need to be religious you could have a spiritual side to you.
 Run around or ride your bike.
 You hardly ever see Lisa without a book in her hand, so try to read as much as possible.
 As sensible as Lisa is, she's not the one to miss out on experiences involving family fun

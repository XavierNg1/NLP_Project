 For the sake of the "ritual," make sure that everyone drops the shot in at the same time, and that everyone is ready to drink their Jager Bomb. Try making a toast or counting down (3.. 2... 1!) so that all of your friends are on the same page. Drop the shot in immediately before you drink.


Drop the shot into the glass from directly above the rim of the glass. If you drop the shot glass from too high up, you will increase the risk of breaking the glass or spilling the drink.
 Once you've dropped the shot into the Red Bull, raise the highball glass to your lips and drain the mixture. Drink all of the Red Bull and Jägermeister to complete the Jager Bomb. Put the highball glass back onto the table or counter to show that you're done., Once you drink your Jager Bomb, sit back and wait for the effects to hit your body. The alcohol and the caffeine should produce a unique stimulating effect that many people quite enjoy. That said: it is dangerous to consume excessive amounts of caffeine and alcohol – especially when you are combining the two. The caffeine rush can mask the depressant effects of alcohol, making it seem like a great idea to drink more than you can safely handle.If you are a teenager, try to limit yourself to 100mg of caffeine per day. Avoid drinking more than one or two Jager Bombs in a night.Know the signs of caffeine overdose. Mild symptoms include jitters, restlessness, nervousness, rapid heart rate, nausea, and anxiety. You may experience heart palpitations, insomnia, and sweating. Severe overdose can result in dizziness, vomiting, and even cardiac arrest.

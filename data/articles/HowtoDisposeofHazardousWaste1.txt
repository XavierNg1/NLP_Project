 Hazardous waste cannot be disposed like normal trash in landfills. Instead it must be disposed through the proper networks to prevent human and environmental harm. Look at the four characteristics of hazardous waste:


Ignitability means that the waste can easily catch on fire. It is considered flammable if the flash point is less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
Corrosive wastes are acids/bases that are capable of corroding metal containers.
Reactive wastes are unstable under normal conditions. They can cause explosions, toxic fumes, gases or vapors when heated.
Toxic types of wastes are potentially fatal or harmful when absorbed or ingested. They can pollute groundwater if not disposed of properly.;
, Responsibility in disposing these types of wastes isn’t just for your carbon footprint. Many counties and states attach legal responsibility towards disposing hazardous waste.


Companies who don’t adhere to the laws are subject to fines and other legal action.
 Many counties across the U.S. have specific protocol for disposing hazardous waste. Each county can have different steps and regulations for disposing hazardous waste. The actual disposal of hazardous waste on the local level is enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
 It is common to come into contact with hazardous waste without ever knowing it. Take a look at the following list of common products that shouldn’t be thrown away normally:


Automotive products. This includes antifreeze, fluids, motor oils, and gasoline.
Batteries
Fluorescent light bulbs. Many of the older models contain mercury.
Household cleaners. This includes ammonia, drain cleaner, and rust remover.
Paint products.
Garden chemicals.

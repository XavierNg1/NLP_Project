 Assembly directions will differ depending on what model of automated aerator you select. Generally, you’ll have to insert batteries and attach an aeration tube (a long, straw-like object) to the aerator head (the main portion of the automated aerator out of which the wine will actually come out)., Slip the long tube extending away from the head of the automated aerator into the wine bottle. Once the tube is completely inside the bottle, gently press down on the aerator head. The aerator head should be pushed down far enough that it is stable within the bottle.Some automated wine aerators might have a rubber seal attached to the inside of the area where the tube and the head meet. This seal will ensure that the aerator head remains firmly in place during use.
 The spout of the automated aerator is the portion that extends horizontally away from the aerator head. Bring your glass up toward the spout with one hand. Hold the glass at a slight angle so that the top tilts slightly toward the wine bottle. Position the spout just slightly below the rim of the glass.Do not place your wine glass beneath the spout on a flat surface. This could cause you to miss the glass or cause the wine to splash when dispensed from the automated wine aerator.
 When your glass is positioned properly, use your free hand to press the dispense button on the automated wine aerator. This button might be located on top or on the side of the automated aerator head. Release the button after the wine glass contains the volume of wine you wish to consume., Recork your wine. Without detaching it, rinse the automated wine aerator’s tube off at the sink under running water. Then, fill an empty wine bottle with water and place the aerator in it. Dispense water from the automated wine aerator for about three seconds.Remove the aerator from the bottle and wipe the tube off with a clean cloth.
Do not submerge your wine aerator in water or it will be ruined.

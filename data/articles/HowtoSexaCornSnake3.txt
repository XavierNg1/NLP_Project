 The cloaca opening or vent is near the end of the tail. Find the opening to help identify where to look., In a female snake, the body of the snake will immediately taper after the vent, going towards the tip of the tail. In a male snake, generally the tail will stay the same girth for an inch or two before tapering.Males will also be longer from the cloaca to the tip, but that is difficult to distinguish if you don't have another snake for a comparison., Another method to visually determine the sex of the snake is to count the scales from the cloaca to the tip of the tale on the underside of the belly. It's easiest to do this process on a shed skin, as you will have a hard time keeping a snake still for the process. In an adult, males usually have more than 140 scales, while females usually have less than 130 scales. Between 130 and 140, it is difficult to tell the sex.If you can't see it very well, try taking a picture and zooming in.

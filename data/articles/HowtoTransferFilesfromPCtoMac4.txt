 In order to burn a CD or DVD you need a drive capable of burning. Most current drives have this capability. In addition to hardware, you will need to have the proper software. Windows Vista and later come with DVD burning support natively built-in to the OS. Windows XP can burn CD's but not DVDs; you will need third-party software to burn data DVDs in Windows XP.
 Autoplay should open, giving you the option to add files to the disc to be burnt. If Autoplay does not start, open Computer and then open the disc drive. You can drag and drop files here, and click the Burn button when you are ready.


CDs typically hold around 750MBs, while DVDs typically hold around 4.7GB.
 Depending on the amount you are burning and the speed of your drive, this could take up to several minutes.
 The disc will appear on the desktop, allowing you to open it and copy files to your computer.

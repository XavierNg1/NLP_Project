 Open up the drop-down Tools menu in the top toolbar of Google Earth.


If you have an earlier version than v4.3, access the flight simulator by pressing Control+Alt+A, Control+A, or Command+Option+A then pressing enter. After this feature has been activated at least once, it appears under the tools menu.;
, A small window should now open up. There are three parts to this: aircraft, start position and joystick.


Aircraft - Choose the airplane you would like to fly. The SR22 is a slower plane and easier for beginners while the F-16 is for more intermediate to expert users. In this guide, we are using the F-16 as an example.
Start Position - You can either your current view, starting off from an airport of a major city or your last position on the flight simulator. Beginners should use the New York airport.
Joystick - Check the box if you are using a joystick to control your airplane.
,, Since it is almost impossible to see the runways without aids, take every runway you might land at, and draw a path along the length of the runway. Make the runways of different colours and set the width to 5mm. The runways are very clearly visible in mid-air now.
 Turn on Borders/Labels and Transportation. Again, this is to help you navigate.

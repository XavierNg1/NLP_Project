 Flirting often involves long eye contact, smiles, lots of compliments, excuses to touch each other, et cetera. Avoid flirting with other people, and respond with disinterest if someone tries to flirt with you., If you suspect someone is crushing on them, tell them that they're a good friend. If you want to invite them somewhere, mention that you'd love to take a friend to that place, and that it made you think of them.

If someone doesn't take the hint after you do this, gently take them aside and say that you value their friendship and aren't looking for a date right now.
 Be honest, clear, and compassionate. Don't suggest that you would be open to dating them in the future, because then they might cling to shreds of possibility instead of moving on and finding happiness, and that isn't healthy.

"I'm flattered, but not interested."
"I'm not ready to date at this point in my life."
"I see you as a friend."
Avoid long or complicated explanations. Simplicity is best.

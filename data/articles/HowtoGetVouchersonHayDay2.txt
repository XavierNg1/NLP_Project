 Just like boat orders, vouchers can be acquired by completing truck orders. Truck orders are item requests sent to you by your Hay Day friends. Tap the red truck found in front of the farmhouse and the “Order” menu will show.
 The Order menu contains the item requests sent out by other players. Item requests are usually farm produces like fruits and dairies. To send out produces to your friends, tap any of the open order list with a picture of an item requested. Tap it as many times as needed (depending on the number of requested items) until a “check mark” appears on the item.
 Once you’ve filled up the items requested, tap the “truck” icon on the lower right-hand corner of the Order menu and the Truck order will be sent out. You’ll see the truck roll out of your farm to deliver the goods requested.


After sending the truck orders, you’ll instantly get vouchers as a reward for your help. The amount of vouchers you can get depends on the amount and quality of items you send out.

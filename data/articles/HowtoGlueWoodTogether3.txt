 If so, you will need to use resorcinol formaldehyde glue to ensure adhesion. It can be used on doors, windows and even aquatic equipment.


Keep in mind that waterproof wood glue is significantly more expensive that yellow or white glue.
 You will need bar clamps, screw clamps and cauls to ensure good adhesion.
 The glue needs a warm environment to activate.
 Blend the resin and the catalyst according to package directions.
 Then leave it to dry for 10 hours.
 It dries a deep maroon color. Sand off the remainder of the glue after it has set.

 Tracksuits are great (monogrammed with your initials for an extra preppy look) - but a cute blouse with trousers and a skinny belt will work just fine. Don't wear dresses or skirts. No make-up!

, No fried eggs or sausage - that might make you feel queasy! Eat some fruit and then whole-grain cereal or toast with jam. Scrambled eggs could work, just don't use too much fat (butter, oil...) when making them.
 Organize all your things and keep your rucksack visible.
 If there's enough space, consider stretching your legs.
 It'll make them less annoying. Bring out coloring books and help them, if needed.
 Eat daintily.
, Use a moisturizer every thirty minutes and clean your face to get rid of any excess oil.
 Who said car rides couldn't be relaxing? Plus, you'll be keeping your skin pretty as well as enjoying the movie!

, Even if it's a magazine, it'll keep you busy. Catch up on some school reading assignments too, if you don't get nauseous or carsick.
 Go for a restroom break and buy some more food if you need it. If though they might be tempting, don't get any sweets or greasy foods. Instead, get a bottle of water and' maybe some hard, sucky candy to keep your mouth sweet.
 Say "Please" and "Thank You". Be kind to everyone in your family, even if your siblings are particularly irritating.
 Preps are neat freaks and super clean! Make sure the entire car is organized before you arrive.
 Don't be selfish and strut out of the car like a model, that's not what being preppy is.

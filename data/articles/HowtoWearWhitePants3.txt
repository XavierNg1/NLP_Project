 White underwear might show through even the thicker materials, but flesh-toned undies will provide coverage and invisibility. It’s still a good idea to check out your backside in a full-length mirror before you head out the door, though. Confirm there aren’t any panty lines, bulges, or other unflattering issues., If done right, white on white can actually create a long and lean look. Go with a pair of skinny jeans in white and pair them with a fitted white tank top and white blazer for a super crisp look. Finish the look off with white shoes, or silver metallic shoes and matching silver jewelry., Try wearing a classic pattern, like polka dots, with your white jeans. A blue chiffon polka dot top and matching polka dot shoes can create a fun, summery look. Add a pop of color and texture by adding a red leather handbag and red sunglasses.Stripes also look great with white pants. Try a navy and white striped top with a pair of fitted capris. Add a cropped denim jacket for a versatile look.
 If you’re on the short side, try heels or flats in white, nude, or metallic shades. A bright-colored shoe with white pants breaks up the illusion of a long, lean line, making your legs look shorter. Light or metallic shoes have the opposite effect. Opt for a pointed toe, which creates more length than a rounded toe.

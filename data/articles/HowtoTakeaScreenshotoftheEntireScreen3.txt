 GIMP is a free and open-source photo editor, and it has a built in screenshot function. There are two ways to take a screenshot while in GIMP.


Click "File," → "Create" → "Screenshot.
Press the Shift and F12 keys simultaneously.
 While the "Prt Sc" method discussed in the Windows section usually works on Linux, the OS has a few other ways to take screenshots with more options:


Click on "Applications"
Click on "Accessories" and find "Take Screenshot."
You will have a variety of options, from screen size to setting up a delay.
 If you press the two buttons simultaneously you'll see a bright flash and your picture will be saved in your Photos, where you can access it anytime.
 Many Android phones also offer a "Screenshot" option when you click the Power button as well.


Android phones running the Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 Operating System can do this, but not anything older.
Phones without this capability can download an app from the Google Play Store. Search for "Screenshot" and download your favorite free app.

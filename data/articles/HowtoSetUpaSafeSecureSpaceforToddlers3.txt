 Safety plugs are little plastic pieces with prongs that slide safely into outlets. They work to keep your child from sticking his or her fingers into the outlet and getting electrocuted.These safety plugs should fit rather snugly so they are difficult for little hands to pry out.
 Where electrical outlets are in use, parents can try to rearrange the room so that there are heavy pieces of furniture in front of the outlets. This will prevent the toddlers from getting to the outlets, pulling the cords out, and inserting something else into the outlet, like their fingers.
 One strangulation hazard that isnâ€™t often considered is electrical cords. They should always be kept out of a toddlers reach by tucking them in behind furniture as much as possible. These cords can also cause other harm if the toddler pulls the cord hard enough to make the attached device fall onto them.

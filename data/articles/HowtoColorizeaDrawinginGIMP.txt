Fill it by brushing in the color
Fill it by selecting the area and filling it. To make a selection, be sure you are on the lineart layer, make your selection then go back to the middle layer.
 A suggested workflow would be:


Go to the lineart layer.
Select the magic wand.
Select the area you want to color.
Go back to the transparent layer.
Fill in the selection. It's a good idea to grow the selection by a couple of pixels to make sure there are no areas of white showing.
Keep repeating until you are done.

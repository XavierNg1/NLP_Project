 Canine diabetes can start when a dog is heavier than average. The best way to see if this could be an issue for your dog is by checking your dog's rib cage. Run your hand along your dog's rib cage. You should be able to feel the ribs easily. If not, your dog may be overweight. Some dogs have incredibly long and thick coats which may make it more difficult to feel their ribs. Another good test is to feel for their back hip bones. If you can feel them by pressing down lightly, then your dog is probably not overweight.


If your pet is overweight, talk to your veterinarian about safely decreasing calories and increasing exercise. There are special diets that may be appropriate or you may achieve success with your dog by cutting down on treats and snacks and adding in a few more walks per week.;
, Diabetes usually develops in dogs between the ages of seven and nine. As your dog gets older, decreased exercise can lead to weight gain. This usually indicates increased levels of glucose and an insufficient level of insulin, which leads to diabetes. , Some breeds of dogs are more commonly affected with diabetes, although any dog can develop the disease. Miniature Poodles, Mini Schnauzers, Dachshunds, Beagles and Cairn Terriers are well represented on this list. Mixed breed dogs are not immune to developing diabetes.Intact females (unspayed) are more prone to diabetes. A high-risk dog is an overweight, intact female from an predisposed breed such as a Dachshund or Beagle.

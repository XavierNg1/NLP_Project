 This is especially important if you plan on doing anything that might damage the wall or your bed, like installing shelves, hanging hooks, or even painting. Making big changes without permission could get you in trouble.


Tell your parents you want to make your top bunk cool by saying something like, "Mom and dad, my bunk's great but it's a little plain. I was thinking maybe we could make some improvements?";
, You might not be able to make all of your improvements at once. Having a general plan for how you want to make your bed cool will help make sure you get everything done. A plan is also helpful in case you need to purchase supplies. For example, you might need things like:


Hooks for hanging things (either adhesive or screw-in).
Tacky putty or poster adhesive, for putting up pictures without damaging walls.
A shelf to improve your storage space.
String lights, to create a cozy space in your bunk.
 Once you've made a plan and know roughly what you'll need to improve your top bunk, you can go shopping. You might want to check prices online first, so your parents aren't surprised by the cost of the items you want.


Many bunk improving supplies can be found at home centers, hardware stores, and big box stores, like Walmart and Target.

 Hold open your hand, palm facing up, and position the middle of the stick horizontally in the middle of your hand.Spinning the drumstick from its middle will allow the stick to be balanced as you spin it.Once you have the positioning down, close your hand loosely to grip the drumstick.
 Bring your wrist back, as if you are going to throw the drumstick away from you. As you “throw” the stick, open your hand all the way, really wide, so your fingers are almost pointing downward. This will allow the jointed part of your hand (where your fingers connect to the palm of your hand) to be the highest point on your hand.The highest point is where you want the stick to spin, so it doesn’t hit any of your fingers as it rotates.


Spin the drumstick with enough force so that it can make at least one full rotation spinning. If you don’t spin the drumstick with enough force, it will stop spinning on your hand.
 When the drumstick starts to slow down on the palm of your hand, clench your hand to catch the stick. It will be easier to catch the stick if one of the ends are in between (or near) the space between your thumb and pointer finger.

 Each day you should gently wipe your cat’s paws with a damp washcloth. As you wipe, keep an eye out for debris that might be stuck in the paw. You should also watch out for debris that is caught in the hair between the paw pads., Litter is a common type of debris that can get stuck in your cat’s paws. One way to minimize the chance of this happening is to use a litter mat. Choose a litter mat that has angled ridges that are engineered to pull litter out of a cat’s paw. Place the litter mat outside of the litter box so that your cat will have to walk across it when they exit the litter box., Some longhaired cats have excessive hair that grows on their paws and between their toes. This can create an environment for unwanted debris. If your cat has long hair sprouting in between its toes, gently trim it with a small pair of rounded scissors.

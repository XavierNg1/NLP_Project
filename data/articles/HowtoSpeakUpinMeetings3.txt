 Taking notes during a meeting can help you to come up with ideas for how to chime in and it may also help you to feel more confident. Taking notes will also show that you are engaged even if you are not speaking. You will also find it easier to remember what was said during the meeting.
 If you want to speak up but never seem to get a word in, set a goal to speak. For example, try to speak up at least once at each meeting, or make a comment once each week. Wait for a pause and then jump in. It may feel weird at first, but give yourself time to adjust. Soon, you’ll feel more comfortable making your voice heard., If you’re looking down and not making eye contact, turning away, fumbling with your notes, or appear nervous, people may not take you seriously. Use your hands to gesture, instead of keeping them in your pockets or crossed in front of you. If you’re standing, point your feet straight ahead and lean slightly forward with your feet hip-width apart. This shows that you’re confident and engaged.Even if you don’t feel confident, your body can fake it and command attention in the room.
 Raising your hand is the easiest way to join a conversation no matter what the format is. If you struggle to know when to speak up, raise your hand. This indicates to others that you’d like to speak and want to go next. Especially if someone is currently speaking and you want to add or comment on it, briefly raise your hand to indicate you’d like to go next or add something to the discussion.Raise your hand and make eye contact with someone to make sure you’ve been seen.
 If someone brings up a point that needs further research or action, speak up and offer to follow-up on it. If a topic needs to be furthered for the next meeting, be the one to take it on. This can give you some time to prepare and also nudges you to participate in the next meeting.Offer to do some follow-up work and present it in the next meeting. This way, you can be prepared and have a slideshow or handouts.

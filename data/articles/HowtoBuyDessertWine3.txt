 The temperature of the wine influences how the wine tastes. People tend to drink red wines too warm and white wines too cold. If the white wine is too cold, you will not taste much flavor. If the red wine is too warm, the taste of alcohol will be stronger than usual.Store white wines between 40째F and 55째F. If you store them in a temperature controlled wine cellar, place them in the refrigerator for one hour before you plan to drink them.
Store red wines between 55째F and 70째F. If you store them in a temperature controlled cellar, remove them from the storage 30 minutes before you plan to drink them.
If you do not have temperature controlled cellar, store your reds at room temperature and your whites in the refrigerator. Put the reds in the refrigerator 30 minutes before you plan to drink them, and take your whites out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you plan to drink them.
 Dessert wine can be served alone or with a dessert.It's a good idea to try it alone first and see how you like it, then to pair it with a dessert another time. There is no wrong way to drink dessert wine.Brandy, port, and grappa are usually served after you eat your dessert.
You can also serve the dessert wine after your main meal and before you eat your dessert.
 Dessert wines should be served in a 3 oz. glass.Sip your wine in a relaxed fashion. It is meant to be savored and enjoyed.The small glass directs the wine to the back of your mouth so that you are not overcome by the sweetness of the wine.Dessert wines typically have a higher alcohol content than other wines. The small glass is helpful for this as well.

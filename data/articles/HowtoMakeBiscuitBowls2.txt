 To ensure that the oven is hot enough when the biscuit bowls are ready, you must preheat the oven. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and let the oven heat fully., For the biscuit bowls, you’ll need 8 6-ounce (170 g) ramekins. Turn them over on a large baking sheet, and use nonstick cooking spray to grease the backs and sides of the ramekins.If you prefer, you can use butter to grease the ramekins.
If you prefer, you can use a muffin tin and grease the backside of it.
 Open a 16.3 ounce (462 g) can of refrigerated biscuit dough according to the package instructions. Use clean fingers to separate the dough into 8 individual biscuits.If the dough is sticking to your hands, dust them lightly with flour to make it easier to handle the biscuits.
 With the dough separated into 8 pieces, use a rolling pin to roll each one out on a lightly floured surface. Work each piece of dough into a 5-inch (13-cm) circle.It helps to lightly dust your rolling pin with flour before rolling out the dough.
 After you’ve rolled out the biscuit dough, lift each circle and place it on the back of one of the ramekins. Use your fingers to gently press the dough all around the ramekin to create a bowl shape.Be careful not to tear any holes in the dough as you shape it around the ramekins. If any occur, use your fingers to gently seal them closed so the bowl will remain in tact.
 After you’ve molded all of the biscuit dough onto the backs of the ramekins, place the cookie sheet that they’re on in the preheated oven. Allow the biscuits to bake for approximately 14 minutes, or until they are lightly browned.If you’re using frozen biscuit dough, make sure to allow it to thaw for at least 30 minutes at room temperature and bake them for 16 to 18 minutes.

 Mixtapes (in this sense) are albums that remix songs from other artists and/or the artist who makes the tape. Online mixtape communities adhere to standards that keep their mixes above-board, so you can download without fear of legal retribution.


The largest site for directly downloading free mixtapes is DatPiff, which features mostly underground hip-hop and up-and-coming DJs.
Other popular sites include That Mixtape, LiveMixtapes, and MonsterMixtapes.
 Find the area of the page where you can log in to the site. (On DatPiff, it's on the right side of the main page, a little ways from the top.) Click the text that says “Register” and fill in the required information.


These sites make a lot of their money from advertising, and will probably try to get you to sign up for advertising offers during the registration process. Always look for the link that says “no thanks” or something similar to skip these. (On DatPiff.com, it's typically red text in the lower right corner.)

, Read user ratings and comments to find highly-rated ones, or take a gamble on new tapes.
 When you find a mixtape you're interested in, click on “Listen” or “Play” to preview the tape. If you like it, click the “Download” link instead to download it to your computer.


Some mixtape communities set a limit on daily downloads (which you can lift by paying money), but will offer other mixtapes for “free” (which means they don't count against your limit). Browse these first to ensure that you can get as much new music as you want each day.

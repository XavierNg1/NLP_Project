 One common taxi scam occurs when the driver pretends that the meter is not working and attempts to charge an extremely high price. In order to avoid this scam, you should discuss the rate with the taxi driver ahead of time and ask the driver about the meter prior to departing.If your driver refuses to use the meter or tries to say that it is cheaper without the meter, do not get in the cab and find a different taxi.
 Some taxi scams involve giving incorrect change, switching bills, or shortchanging customers. As a result, you should always pay for cabs with small bills. Also, when you give the driver money, count out loud the amount you are giving them. This will help prevent the driver from switching out a $50 bill for a $20 bill.For example, if the taxi ride cost $12 you can say “Here is a $20 bill, can I get $5 back?”

, Although rare, some drivers have been known to drive away with your luggage or personal belongings in the cab. As a result you should never pay the fare until after all your belongings have been unloaded from the vehicle.
 It is a good idea to always write down the name and license number of the taxi you are taking. This way if you ever feel threatened, lose an item, or get scammed you can report the driver and vehicle to the taxi company.


If you ever feel unsafe or uncomfortable while taking a taxi, ask the driver to stop the car and exit the vehicle as soon as possible.

 For example, do you like the RPGs that make you take turns, or are you more of real time attack kind of person?





 

First Hand Shooters are awesome. A good first hand shooter to play is Metroid Prime: Hunters on the Nintendo DS. In fact that's is another thing to consider...






Console or Portable? This question will be a big help. Are you of the on-the-run kind of gamer, or are you more of a must-concentrate kind.






Grid based RPGs can get pretty boring, but if you like this type, by all means get it.






Adventure RPGs always get a lot of rave, so you might also consider getting this one.;

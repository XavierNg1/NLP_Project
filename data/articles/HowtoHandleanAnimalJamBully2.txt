 What better way to stop a bully than by being nice to them? This is usually something difficult for angry people to do, but it works marvelously.
 If the bully makes it obvious that he dislikes your style, simply compliment his. Doing such will confuse or aggravate the bully, and might even make them happy again!

, If a bully is calling someone stupid, and you call them smart, it would really sound like you're siding with her. Instead, try complimenting both of them!

, Usually bullies take humor in hurting the feelings of fellow players, but there may be a chance that they're actually upset deep down. By asking them "what's wrong", or asking if they are okay, they may admit that something bad had happened to them. If they do this, be supportive, but be sure to tell them it is no excuse for hurting others.
 It is practically just restarting them. If someone is continuing to fight the bully, tell them off politely.

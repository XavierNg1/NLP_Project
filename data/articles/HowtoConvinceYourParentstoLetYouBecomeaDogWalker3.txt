 If your parents say no at first, it is not the end of the world. Instead of becoming angry or frustrated, figure out the reasons for why they decided no. Then, ask them what you can do to make it a yes.For example, “How can I change your decision?” or, “What do I need to do to change your mind?”

, If your parents are undecided, offer to make a compromise. Perhaps your parents are worried that you won’t have time for your schoolwork if you have a job. Or, maybe they are worried about your general safety. Instead of arguing with them, negotiate with them.If they are worried about school, tell them, “If my grades start to drop, I will quit dog walking.”
If they are worried about your safety, tell them, “I will only walk dogs of owners who you and I know and trust.”
If they are just generally unhappy with you, tell them, “If you guys allow me to dog walk, I will take more responsibility around the house. I know you want me to be more responsible and mature, but so do I. How can I show you that?”

, Remember to remain calm if your parents decide on a definitive no. Do not get angry and start yelling, whining, or crying. This will only prove their point—that you are not mature enough to have a job. You want to leave a good impression for the next time you ask them.In the meantime, take more responsibility around the house. Help your parents by doing more chores, taking care of siblings, and by listening and abiding by their rules. If they see an improvement, perhaps they will change their mind about their decision.

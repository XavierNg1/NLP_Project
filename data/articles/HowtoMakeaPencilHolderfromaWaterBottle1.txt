 The bottle can be any size, shape, or color you want. If you can't find a plastic water bottle, use a plastic soda bottle instead.;
, Use a dish scrubbing brush to scrub any leftover glue off. Once the bottle is clean, lightly pat it dry with a towel.


If there is any glue left from the label, wipe it off using a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol.
 It might be a good idea to cut it a little bit taller than you think you might need it.


If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.
 Try to make the bottle no shorter than half the height of a standard pen or pencil.

If your water bottle has "ribs," use the grooves as a guideline.
 Aim to make them about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Don't cut the tissue paper, however. The jagged edges will give you a smoother finish. They will also make the papers easier to apply., You can use a flat paintbrush or a foam brush. Keep the bottle steady by sticking your hand inside of it. This way, your hands won't get messy., Overlap the papers slightly so that there are no gaps, and smooth them down using your fingers or a paintbrush to get rid of any bubbles.


When you get to the top, fold the papers over the rim and onto the inside of the bottle. This will give you a neater finish.
 Once the bottle is dry, you can continue decorating it, or you can add a second layer of tissue paper. This second layer can be the same color, or it can be a different color to create a tie-dye effect.


After you have applied your second layer and let it dry, you can "seal" your work by painting another layer of glue on top of it.
 Once the bottle is completely dry, add some more color to it using some stickers, markers, or paint. You can even decorate it with glitter glue pens!


If you want to use lighter colors, try paint pens. They will show up much better than regular markers, which are translucent.

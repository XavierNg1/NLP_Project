 This pina colada-esque smoothie is an incredibly delicious summer treat. You'll need a total of a cup of your favorite tropical fruits. Buy them frozen or fresh, then cut them into 1/2-inch chunks. Consider these excellent options:


Pineapple
Mango
Papaya
Guava
Passion fruit
Kiwi

, The thick texture of Greek yogurt offsets the juicy quality of the tropical fruits, and its tangy flavor pairs perfectly with their bursting sweetness. Get full fat or low fat Greek yogurt. You'll need one cup.
 Sweeten this smoothie with 1/4 cup orange juice, pineapple juice, lime juice, or mango juice.
 Place the fruit, yogurt, and juice in the blender. Blend the ingredients until they are completely smooth. Add more juice if you want to thin the smoothie, or more yogurt to make it thicker.
 Pour it into a glass for your self and drink immediately. This treat may also be served in dessert glasses with a fancy straw for a refreshing summertime dessert.

 Realize that your having such a serious illness might be overwhelming for your loved ones. Not everyone knows what to say. Some might be afraid and some might be too simplistic.


In the beginning of the illness everyone might be visiting and everyone might be wanting to help. Some might tell the stories and some might offer ideas of treatments. Some might not even show up.
 Figure out when you will draw the line.


Remember it is your illness and it is up to you to listen and accept certain advice. You can set your limits and say things like:

"Considering my condition I would like not..."
"At the current time, I have no energy/mental capacity to..."



, If you belong to a place of worship, call your priest, minister, or rabbi. If you do not do not feel guilty about not doing so.

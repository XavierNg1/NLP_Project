 Aluminum foil is a good scrubber for a hot glue gun. Rip of a square of a aluminum foil and wad it up in a ball. A big piece is a necessity because it will help keep you from burning your fingers., With the glue gun warm, push the tip into the ball of foil, making sure you don't burn your fingers by touching the tip. Rotate the tip or the ball to scrub it, taking off glue and other debris., Once you're done with the tip, rub the rest of the gun down with the foil. The gun should be warm so that the glue is easy to remove. It should scrape off most of the glue., Set the glue gun on its side, preferably on a silicone mat. Lay a single piece of foil on top of the glue. Rub the foil in, using protection on your hands so you don't burn your fingers. Go over it with the heat gun or blow dryer. The glue should stick more to the aluminum foil than the glue gun, so you can easily peel it off. Repeat the process as needed.You may need to remove parts, like the kickstand, to help clean the whole gun.

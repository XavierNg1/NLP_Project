 Organization is an important management quality because keeping track of clients, projects and your own team members is necessary.
 Whether the business is medicine, real estate, advertising or truck driving, a good manager will understand the industry and stay current in the field.
 In the professional workplace, a manager must know when to delegate. Otherwise, he or she will become overwhelmed with work and employees will feel like they are not trusted.
 An essential management quality is the ability to communicate with people at all levels.


Note the ability to communicate verbally and in writing. Good managers often do better with one form of communication over the other, but they must be able to write a clear email as well as they can hold an in-person meeting.
Remember that giving and receiving constructive criticism is part of communication, and a necessary management quality. Criticism should be delivered in a helpful, non-threatening way.
 A good manager will be able to initiate and maintain relationships with customers, superiors, team members and people at all different levels.


Look for a team player. The willingness to pitch in is a great management quality. Collaboration is essential to success.
Identify the ability to value others. Good managers are not threatened by people who are smarter or better at something. They will value the contributions of every team member.

 Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of water and 2 cups (473 ml) of skim milk into a large saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and bring the liquids to a boil. Stir the liquids occasionally., Once the liquids come to a boil, stir the liquids while you slowly pour in 1 cup (170 g) of hominy grits and 1 pinch of salt. Reduce the heat to low. Stir and cook the grits for 5 minutes, so they thicken., Put the lid on the pot and let the grits continue to cook. Let them cook for one hour, so they become completely tender. You can stir in 2 teaspoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of chopped pecans, and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar right before you're ready to serve the Yankee grits.If the grits seem too thick to you, you can stir in a little water to make them runnier.

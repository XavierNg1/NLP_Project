 If you haven’t yet made a call, you’ll be asked if Viber can access your microphone. Select “OK” to proceed with the call.
 Viber isn’t able to make phone calls to non-Viber users and if it’s not able to find a Viber account with the entered number, you’ll be prompted to make the call using your regular carrier.

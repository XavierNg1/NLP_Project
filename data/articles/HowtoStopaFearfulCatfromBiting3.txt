 Many cats that have a strong fear response bite when they are surprised. If you know your cat does this, or you are in a house that you know has a cat that does this, then you should try to avoid surprising the cat. Make noise as you move through the house so that the cat knows you are coming and can flee as you approach.


Also, don't pet the cat if it is sleeping and does not know you are approaching it. This is a great way to get bitten.
 If the cat is about to bite you because it is scared of you, then you should remove yourself from its area. In order to avoid getting bitten you should just leave it alone. Walk away and let the cat calm down on its own.


Trying to win a skittish cat over with attention will only backfire. Cornering a cat that is fearful invites a fear response and will make their anxiety even worse.
While exposure therapy can be used to get a fearful cat used to certain situations, this needs to be done with care and repetition. A one time visit with a scared cat where you will not leave the cat alone will not make the cat's behavior any better., A cat that responds to fear with biting should be allowed to flee situations that it finds stressful or scary. Don't try and keep a cat in an unpleasant situation to try and acclimate the cat to it. This will only heighten the cat's anxiety.Instead, put the cat in a room by itself. Provide food, water, and a litter box. Allow the cat to stay here until it wants to leave on its own.

 The hard thing about having a haunting for a long period of time is that you begin to lose your line between imagination and reality. Even in genuine haunting there can be normal explanations for the activities.;
, A demon likes to play with its target(s). It doesn't manifest itself easily until it knows that everyone is vulnerable. So if a calm peaceful house suddenly turns into a really depressive one or if someone specifically is heading a really dark road in life, you need to pay attention to that.
 Demons are powerful spirits. Unlike human spirits that need to absorb a large amount of energy, these require a lot less or even none to produce terrifying phenomenons such as movements, teleportation, throwing and even levitation of objects. In extreme cases they were able to manifest as dark misty figures or produce spontaneous combustion.
 Often demons can be caught on digital tape recorders (EVP) as someone speaking, laughing and even growling. They can also leave behind a terrible smell that smells like rotten flesh or sulfur.

 The Kangal dog has a large, but well-proportioned skull. Its skull is broad and slightly rounded with a slight furrow in its forehead. A distinctive dark “mask” covers the Kangal’s face. It generally covers its nose and muzzle, but can extend beyond its eyes.The Kangal’s muzzle tapers toward a large black nose with open nostrils.;
, The Kangal has medium-sized eyes that may be almond or oval in shape. The color of its eyes can range from light amber to dark brown in color. The rims of its eyes are well-pigmented and will be either black or brown.Eye-rims that sag or have incomplete pigment are a disqualification.
Having eyes that are of two different colors or blue eyes is a disqualification, as well.
 The Kangal’s ears are dark in color and complement the color of the distinctive, dark mask on its face. It has triangular-shaped ears with rounded tips. Its ears are also medium-sized where the length of its ears is about six inches and the base about four inches in width.Its ears are set no higher than the top of the skull, i.e., slightly below the skull. They lay flat against the side of the Kangal’s face. When alert, the ears are slightly higher.
Kangals do not have erect ears.

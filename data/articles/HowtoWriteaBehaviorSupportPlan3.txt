 Whenever possible, antecedent procedures are preferable, because they can help to keep this behavior from re-occurring.


For example, if the student is seeking sensory input, you can implement sensory diet activities like compression vests, weighted blankets, vestibular seats or balls, and proprioceptive activities like jumping on a trampoline or playing with putty.






If the child is seeking to escape or avoid overstimulating activities, you can provide ear plugs or headphones during loud activities or give the child access to a quiet space.
If the child is seeking to escape difficult works tasks, you can implement procedures for asking for breaks or help.
 Relaxation methods like yoga and counting may help.
 Teach the child to use communication skills to verbalize wants and needs appropriately.
 Use social stories to teach clear expectations and involve peers to model appropriate behaviors.



At school, the child will be assigned a case manager, and the school team and parents may convene for a meeting to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help support the child's behavior in the school setting.






Parents of children who are not school aged may also wish to consult Early Intervention (EI) services.
 Do not get discouraged if you try a behavior plan that is not successful, or if you find that a behavior plan stops working after two weeks.
 It is recommended that behavior plans are constantly assessed and updated to reflect preferences, motivation, and maturity. Think of a behavior plan like your favorite dessert-- No matter how much you enjoy it, you may eventually satiate on it and want something else. This is natural. Give it time, and stay positive.
 Children with challenging behavior need our love, positive attention, guidance, and support. It is already apparent that you are willing to provide those, as you have already begun to seek out resources to help your child.

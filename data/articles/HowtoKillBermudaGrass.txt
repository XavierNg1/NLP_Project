 A popular option is to use glyphosate to impede the spread of Bermuda grass and eventually kill off the grass in patches. The product is available in a spray, making it easy to coat an entire section of the lawn with relative ease. Available in many home and garden shops, the process will likely require several treatments, removing portions of the dying grass between each treatment.;
, Apply a layer or 2 of mulch on top of the cardboard. This helps to prevent the root system for the grass from regenerating and will over a period of a few months kill any remaining roots.
 After stripping the Bermuda grass from the area, put down the fabric and cut small holes to allow planting of shrubs or other plants. The fabric is dense enough to prevent any remaining roots from receiving sunlight and nutrients while also making it possible to go ahead with the permanent landscaping.
 After trimming the grass as close to the soil as possible, cover with clear plastic. The intense heat will kill the remaining grass and part of the root system. This approach is particularly effective in areas that experience high temperatures for extended periods of time, and the patch of grass is not covered with shade during the hottest part of the day.
 While labor intensive, this approach minimizes the amount of roots left in the soil. Water the area to loosen the soil, then pull the grass out by the roots. After cleaning a patch, turn 1 or 2 layers of soil over and use the hands to filter the loose dirt and capture any remaining root fragments.

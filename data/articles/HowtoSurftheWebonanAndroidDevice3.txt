 Look for the yellow, green, and red circle icon on your home screen or app drawer. Tap it to open a Google Chrome browser.
 You’ll find the address bar at the top of the browser. When you’ve entered the URL or search terms, tap “Go” on the keypad.
 There will be many web pages resulting from the keywords you entered; scroll through the list to find the web page you want to browse.
 The link will be in blue. Tapping it will redirect you to the web page.


The loading time of the page will depend on your Internet speed and connectivity.
Wait until the web page loads completely before browsing the page.
 If you know the web address, or URL, of the website you would like to browse, tap the address bar and enter the address of the website (e.g., www.wikihow.com). Tap “Go” to be redirected to the address you entered.
 Open more tabs if you want to browse multiple web pages simultaneously.


Tap the menu option at the top right, and the select “New Tab.” You can add as many tabs as you want, but it is recommended to use only a few to avoid slowing down your browsing experience.
Search for web pages or visit the page directly as described in Steps 2 to 5.
To swap between tabs, tab the box icon with a number on it at the top right. The number represents the number of tabs currently opened. A list of all tabs will be displayed. Select the tab you want to view to open it on the screen.
 If you don’t want the browser to save cookies or remember your browsing history, use incognito mode when searching for web pages.

Tap the menu option and select “New incognito tab.” A message will appear informing that “You’ve gone incognito.”
You can now search or visit web pages the same way you would with other tabs.

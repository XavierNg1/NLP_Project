 Why? if you act as if you are going to bed, there is a less chance of your parents bothering you, and they won't be in your room for the rest of the night.;
, Put it in the spacing between the bottom of the door and the floor. This will make it so that smoke won't escape from your room into the rest of the house. remember, non smokers will smell the smoke. ALSO- make sure the blanket isn't sticking out under the door into the hall. this makes it obvious you're trying to hide something. DON'T FORGET TO LOCK YOUR DOOR!

, This will allow the smoke to go outside and the room will be refreshed with new air. note that air doesn't escape immediately, so it will take anywhere from 15- an hour to air out depending on how much you open the window.
 This is where you take a spray/ air freshener and spray the room. This just makes it safer that the smoke will get masked in with the spray, and will make it harder to detect there is smoke in the room.
 Sit on the floor. Make sure the blanket is big enough to cover you, a lamp, and reach the floor. Before you do this, turn off the lights (This also makes it more fun)

, Just to make some more noise.
 This is so when you inhale, and exhale, you exhale into the fabric to help absorb the smoke. (This fabric can be a shirt, towel, or stuffed animal.), Don't put this in your dresser or desk. it is so obvious. The moment your parents get a hint you're smoking, these will be the first places to search. Instead cut a slit into an old stuffed animal and put it in there, or you could put it in your bed frame.
 Spray your blanket you sat under. Spray where you hid your smoking device. Spray all the corners of your room. Spray yourself. Spray the center of the room. Spray by the door. Spray the fabric you breathed into.
 This will help mask the smell AND the smoke from the incense will blend with the smoke that slipped out when you exhaled, just in case your parentsÂ want in, they can blame the smell and smoke on the incense.

 For example, the living room or a playroom. Choose an area with a soft floor such as carpet or rug, as everyone will be on their knees.;
, In this example, the rug serves as the court area. There is no net required, but have a line dividing the teams.
 This is the "ball".


It is a good idea to have some spare balloons too, in case the one in play pops.
 Decide which team is going to serve first.
 They must be on their knees.
 After the balloon is served, pass the balloon back and forth using your hands either setting or bumping until the balloon falls to the ground or goes out of bounds.


Whatever team's side it fell on, the other team gets a point.






If it goes out of bounds, the team that touched it last doesn't get the point or the next serve. The other team does.
 The first and second set are 25 points. Whoever gets to 25 points that team wins the set. If each team has won one set, play a third set worth 15 points. You don't have to win by 2 points as in real volleyball though.
 You could even organize regular games at regular meet-ups in each other's houses.

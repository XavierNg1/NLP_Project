 Throughout the day you have to make your symptoms obvious, but not too bad; complain -- verbally and with body language -- but don't whine or cry. Mention to your teacher that you're not feeling too great and that you may be hitting the restroom more often than normal. That way, you can get up and leave without asking.


And take those bathroom breaks. If you're lucky enough to have a concerned teacher, they'll suggest you going to the nurse instead of you having to ask.
 Faking a sickness isn't just about temperature and bathroom habits, it's about the look too. It's imperative that you seem fairly miserable quite consistently. Act like it takes serious effort to move your muscles, including the ones in your face.


When it comes to your eyes, don't look alert. You should have a vague look of being somewhere else mentally. After all, you're in your body right now and can't be bothered to appreciate your teacher's lecture on the beauty of the electoral college. All in all, act the part.
 During your frequent bathroom breaks, drink hot water. It'll make you looked flushed, it'll bring your temperature up, and it'll make you sweaty. When you return, decide whether or not you want to report that you vomited. If you do, you'll probably go to the nurse's immediately.


Make sure no one from your class was in the bathroom at the time! Otherwise they'll know you're lying.
 This part is inevitable, unfortunately (unless she's not in -- in which case, go home!). When you get there, she'll probably have you lie down for 15 minutes or so to see if it goes away. Keep it up. You're almost home free. Mention a brother or sister having an illness, if feasible. Ask for an extra blanket. If she has any heart, she'll send you home.


If she hands you the thermometer, consider if any of the above tactics can be applied to this situation.

 Hard, very hard and semi-hard cheese will freeze, although some cheeses will be crumbly after freezing (but will still taste good). On the other hand, soft cheese does not freeze well, such as cottage cheese, ricotta cheese and cream cheese, so don't freeze these varieties. Varieties include:Very hard cheese: Pecorino, Romano Parmesan
Hard cheese: Cheddar, Swiss, Edam, Gouda and Colby
Semi-hard/soft cheese: Havarti, Monterey Jack, Mozzarella, Provolone, Brick, Camembert, Brie
Soft cheese: Ricotta, feta, cottage cheese, cream cheese.

 It is important to choose the right location for a group photo so that you have the best chance of getting a good view of all the people. For example, if there is a light source behind the photo’s subjects, the people will appear darker and less visible than if you position the picture so that the light is behind the camera instead.You also want to make sure that there is something you want to commemorate in the background of the photo, rather than something unappealing.;
, Different angles can make for a completely different picture. In general, if you hold the camera at a slight elevation and angle it down toward you, this will make for a more flattering picture., Use a front-facing camera (if possible) to make sure everyone fits in the screen. Rearrange people as needed to ensure everyone is visible in the picture. Make sure you can see everyone’s faces and that there aren’t any unwanted items in the background.


If you’re having trouble fitting everyone in the screen, it might be a good idea to try using a selfie stick.
 Selfie sticks allow you to capture more in the screen of the camera because it helps you hold the camera further away from your body. This means that you can fit more people into a group shot, or you can capture some cool scenery in the background behind your group shot. Either way, if you are having trouble fitting everything in because your arm just isn’t long enough, try using a selfie stick.


With most selfie sticks, your phone fits into a slot on the end and connects wirelessly (usually through Bluetooth) to the selfie stick. This allows you to use a button on the end of the selfie stick that you hold to take the photo, while your phone is too far away to physically reach the button.

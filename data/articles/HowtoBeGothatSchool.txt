 No Goth will ever be taken seriously if he or she does not know what she is talking about. You must understand the development of the Gothic subculture and Gothic music.;
, Goths should never afraid to be themselves. If you happen to like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Soulja Boy, say so with pride. Nothing is more goth then being honest about your interests.
 If you followed step one already you should know very well how much you can work with while still appearing gothic. Try to find clothes that you like and that express your interests. For example, many of the more energetic goths go for the cyber-goth look, emphasizing on black but with bright neon colors. If you're more quiet and reclusive, perhaps a more Victorian or Romantic-goth look is for you. If you like to look like a zombified nut then go for the Deathrock look. And if none of these suit you, and nothing else suits you, make something that does! DIY (Do it yourself) was huge when punk started, and goth grew out of punk with the same DIY approach.
 Obviously goths tend to garner a lot of attention for various reasons. Depending on your personality this may or may not be enjoyable, but no matter what you will get picked on every now and then. Depending on how extreme the teasing goes, react accordingly to what you feel is appropriate (within reasonable boundaries of course).
 Some schools require uniforms or have certain dress codes that must be met. Find out what these are and work around them as much as you can. Remember this: They can take your clothes, but they can't take your identity(and trust me, they really want to). Wear the clothes you want to wear outside of school if it's that bad, or consider transferring to a school that isn't so restricting. However, this should only be a last resort.

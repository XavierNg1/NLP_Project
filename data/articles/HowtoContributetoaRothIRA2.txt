 If you are a widow, widower, or you file jointly with your spouse and your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $183,000 but is less than $193,000, your Roth IRA contribution will be reduced by a margin proportional to your earnings. If your MAGI exceeds $193,000, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. If your MAGI is below $183,000, you can contribute up to $5,500 or your total taxable income, assuming it is less than $5,500 for that year.For example, if your MAGI is $225,000 in a given year, and you file jointly, you will not be able to contribute to a Roth IRA.
If your MAGI is $85,000 in a given year, and you are a widow, you can contribute the $5,500 ($6,500 if you are 50 or older).
If your MAGI is $190,000, you file jointly, and you are under 50 years old, your contribution limit will be reduced as follows. You will first subtract $183,000 from your MAGI. In this example, the calculation will equal $7,000 ($190,000 - $183,000). You will then divide that number by $10,000, which will equal .700. Make sure you round this decimal to at least three places. If the number you get is 1 or more, simply enter "1". Next, multiply your decimal by $5,500, which will equal $3,850. Next you will subtract $3,850 from $5,500, which will equal $1,650. Make sure you round this number to the nearest $10. In addition, if the number you get is less than $200, simply enter $200. Assuming you did not contribute to any other IRAs, your reduced contribution limit for the present year would be $1,650.
Keep in mind that limits may change from year to year. Check with the IRS in order to obtain the most up-to-date information.
 This applies even when you lived together at any point during the year. If you file taxes in this way and your MAGI is zero, you can contribute no more than $5,500 or your total taxable income (if it is less than $5,500 for that year).


At this level, individuals 50 or older can contribute a maximum of $6,500 to the IRA. If you fall under this tax bracket and earn $10,000 or more, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA.
If your MAGI falls anywhere between zero and $10,000, your maximum contribution will be reduced from $5,500 (or $6,500, depending on your age) by a margin determined by your MAGI., This is true when filing taxes as a single person, as head of household, or as a married person who did not live with your spouse at all during the year. If you filed taxes in this way, you can contribute up to $5,500 -- or $6,500 if you’re aged 50 or older -- if your MAGI is less than $116,000 per year. If your MAGI surpasses $131,000, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. If you’re in the $161,000-$131,000 zone, your maximum contribution is reduced using a reduction calculation.

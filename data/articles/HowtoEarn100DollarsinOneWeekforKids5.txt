 Does Mom need the house vacuumed? Does Dad need the lawn watered? Create a list of chores you could do for the week and put a price next to each one.


Chores that take more time and energy should have a heftier fee. At the bottom of the paper write a short paragraph stating the date that all of the chores need to be done and how much money you would make if they were all completed on time.
Then have your parents sign the paper in agreement. If they don't agree with your prices, negotiate. When you both sign, you agree to do all of them -- no backing out!

, It is good for the environment and for your wallet! Find empty cans and bottles, and exchange them for cash. Remember - some states do not do this. But if yours does, take advantage of it! It may not be wads and wads of cash, but it'll slowly add up over time.


Go around to the neighbors you know and ask if you can have some of their cans and bottles. Explain that you're trying to make $100 in a week and you need their help to meet your goal. They may even have more ideas!

, Chores don't have to be the only way your parents reward you. They may be willing to offer you some money for good grades or other things you do well. Talk about it! Ask them what they want you to do on your end that they'd be willing to hand over some dollar bills for.


Some parents pay for exceptionally good grades, some pay if you hand over candy, some pay if you throw out your old toys -- so ask! They may have a few ideas, too.

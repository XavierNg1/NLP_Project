 Draw two long and pointy ovals above the head for the ears, and another set inside each ear. You might also want to cock one of the ears slightly, so it looks like Bugs is listening in on a conversation, or droop them down if you want him to appear sad.;
, Draw a small oval for the neck and an overlapping circle and oval for the body. These shapes are technically round, but Bugs Bunny is fairly wiry, so make them vertical and oblong as depicted here.
 Add a circle for each of his hands.
 They should be a bit thicker than you’d expect, because Bugs wears gloves that cover up his fingers (you’ll add on that part later).
 Draw an oblong oval for the feet.
 (This step can be difficult to get right, but they don’t have to be perfect, and you can always go back and try to fix them.)

, Draw an upside-down triangle in the middle of the oval for the nose, and a curvy "w" for the mouth with a small line at each corner, so it looks like a smirk. Under that, draw a square with a half line in the middle for the teeth.
 Draw small circles for the pupils, and fill them in.
 The gloves should have indentations on them and end roundly around his wrists.
 Then outline your drawing more darkly.
 The traditional Bugs Bunny is mostly gray and white, but you can use whatever colors you’d like for your drawing.

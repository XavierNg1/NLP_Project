It is recommended that you use an ink bottle and wooden pen with metallic point instead of normal ball-point pen because sometimes in order to get thicker lines you might want to use a brush dipped in ink instead of a pen.
 There are several methods of doing that. The easiest one is getting gray shades is mixing the ink with water. However, it is recommended that you make different shades of gray using dots. Just plot random dots where you are going to begin shading (depends on virtual point of light, or sun). Dots should be little far apart so you get lighter gray. As you move towards the darker side, decrease the distance between the dots until you get a solid black color. You can also dip the brush in ink and shade darkest sides with it.

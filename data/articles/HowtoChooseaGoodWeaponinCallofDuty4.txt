 Ask players of higher rank or who tend to rack up the kills about which gun combos they use.


Assault Rifles: M16A4, AK-47, M4 Carbine, G3, G36C, M14, MP44
Submachine Guns: MP5, Skorpion, Mini-Uzi, AK-74u, P90
Light Machine Guns: M249 SAW, RPD, M60E4
Shotguns: W1200, M1014
Sniper Rifles: M40A3, M21, Dragonvue, R700, Barrett .50 cal
Pistols: M9, USP .45, M1911, Desert Eagle;
, This means don't limit yourself to only using assault rifles. Try the SMG's, LMG's, Shotguns and Sniper Rifles. You may find something the works for you.
 Don't just limit yourself to one playstyle your entire career either.


Example: If you want to be a rusher, you'll need a submachine gun that kills fast. A more conservative player would be more successful with a gun such as the G3, since the slow draw time doesn't impair their playstyle.

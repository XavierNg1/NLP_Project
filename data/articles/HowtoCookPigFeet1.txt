 Rinse the pig feet under cool, running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub away any dirt and debris.


Dry the clean pig feet with paper towels before continuing.
 Carefully hold each pig foot over the flame of the candle, rotating it periodically, to burn off as many hairs as possible.


If you have a gas stove, you can turn on one stove eye to low heat and use the stove flame instead of a candle.
It's important to use relatively low heat regardless of the method you choose. Using high heat or a large flame can result in accidental burns. To the same end, you should also avoid holding your hand too close to the flame while removing the hairs.
 Examine the pig feet. Use a new, disposable razor or clean pair of tweezers to remove any hairs you couldn't burn off.


The razor will be quicker but will only remove hair from the surface of the foot. The tweezers will be able to remove the entire hair, however, even the portion sitting beneath the skin.
Once you finish removing the hairs, the pig feet should be ready to use in any recipe.

 If you've caught the stain at an early point, you're in luck. Paint stains become much harder to clean if they're allowed to dry. Water-based paints like spray paint may be reduced considerable by putting it in the sink and blotting up the paint with a paper towel. When one area of paper towel has been blotted up quickly move to a new area of towel to keep the blotting going.


Blotting is important to do before you get to any rubbing. If you rub before you blot, the paint will just get pushed deeper into the fabric, spreading it around.;
, The type of stain remover you use will depend on the type of spray paint it is. Consult the can and check if you're still unsure.


Water-based paint can be eased out with a dab of dish soap and some committed scrubbing.
Turpentine, WD-40 or even hairspray can be used to treat oil-based stains.However, spray paint tends to be acrylic, so it should be approached as a water-based paint while it's still wet.
 With the right spray in place, the chemicals can do their work. It's up to you to make sure they get around. Rubbing a dry cloth up against the affected area will give the paint somewhere to soak up into. Continue rubbing the area, and don't be afraid to get rough with your rubbing.If one area of your cloth gets too saturated, move onto the next.


It is obviously preferable that the dry cloth in question isn't one that you would care much if it got discoloured.
Repeat the process until you've removed as much paint as you're reasonably going to. Don't be surprised if you're not able to get all of it out. Every smidgen of paint soaked out makes the existing stain less apparent.

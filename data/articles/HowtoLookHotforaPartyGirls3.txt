 You'd also like a bit of a teasing outfit to get that hot, desirable look. From low cut top with a push-up bra and skinny jeans, to a form fitting sleek dress, to a cute top you like matched with a short pencil skirt, you need something you like that you also hope will be a hit. You should top your outfit off with a couple accessories-bracelets, rings, hair clips- whatever fits your own sense of style. Add cute yet comfortable shoes and your ready to party.

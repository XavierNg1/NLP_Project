 It can be as simple as a knotted handkerchief or scrunched up aluminum foil. Or, you can use a children's toy potato. There are also vegetable scrubbing brushes shaped like potatoes or even soap. Use your imagination!;
,, The one in the center throws the "potato" to anyone in the circle. This one must throw it to another player and so on, tossing it from one to another, and never allowing it to rest.
 If he succeeds, the one who last tossed it exchanges places with him, and the game goes on as before.

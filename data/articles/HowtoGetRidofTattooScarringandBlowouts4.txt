 The best way to prevent tattoo scarring and blowouts is by using an experienced tattoo artist. Make sure that you do your research before you get a tattoo. Search through the portfolio of potential tattoo artists, or ask a friend for a referral., Even experienced tattoo artists can cause blowouts when they are working on thin skin. If you are worried about tattoo blowout, do not get a tattoo on your ankle or chest. This skin is close to the bone and makes a blowout more likely., Blowouts can also be worsened, if you stretch, twist, or pull your skin immediately following a tattoo. For instance, you may unintentionally cause the ink to disperse into the wrong layers of skin. Do not make any sudden twists or pulls until the tattoo is completely healed.

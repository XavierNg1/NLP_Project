 There are many factors that can contribute to a slippery jar lid, including condensation and moisturized hands. Fortunately, these jar lids can be easily unstuck by adding friction. This technique may not work on especially stubborn jars.;
, Drape a dish towel, sheet of plastic wrap, or a rubber glove over the lid. Alternatively, wrap the sides with a thick rubber band.These materials will improve your grip on the lid and help you pry the jar open.


If the glass sides of the jar are slick as well, use another dish towel to help grip the jar.
 Grip the sides of the jar tightly with your non-dominant hand. Twist the lid in a counter-clockwise direction with your dominant hand. The jar should open easily. If not, the airtight seal on the jar will need to be broken with another method.


If you canâ€™t open the jar alone, have a friend hold the sides while you twist the lid.

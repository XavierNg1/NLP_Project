 This lamp is great for patios, but it requires a little bit more work. The ending result, however, is worth it. Here's a list of what you will need:


Mason jar
100% cotton cord or lamp wick
Olive oil
Hammer
Screwdriver or nail
Pliers (optional)
Two blocks of wood
Tape (optional)
Metal washer or nut

, If your lid comes apart, set the ring part aside and use the disk part for now. The two blocks of wood should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. The gap should be right in the middle of the jar.
 Position your nail or screwdriver right over the middle of the middle. Use your hammer to force the nail or screwdriver into the lid. Once you have poked the hole, set the hammer aside, and wiggle the nail or screwdriver out.
 The hole needs to be wide enough so that you can slide your cord or wick through. It needs to be tight enough so that it can support the cord or wick and hold it up over the jar. If your hole needs to be widened, you can use a pair of pliers to peel the edges of the hole towards you.
 The tip of the wick should be now sticking up through the top of the lid. If you want, you can wrap the tip with some tape first; this will prevent the wick from unraveling as you work it through the hole.


You can also use a 100% cotton cord.
 This will hide the hole in the jar, and make your lamp look neater. The tip of the wick should be sticking no more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the top of the nut. Make sure that the inside diameter of the nut is the same as your wick.


If you used tape, be sure to snip the taped part off once you have the wick through the nut and hole.
 You can also use other types of oil as well, such as citronella or lamp oil. Olive oil, however, is the safest because it does not contain any harmful chemicals.
 This will allow the cord or wick to soak up enough oil so that you can light it.

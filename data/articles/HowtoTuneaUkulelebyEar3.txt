 Not everybody can start off by using their ears alone. Once you have trained your ears, tuning by ear is faster than using a tuner, but you need to work your way there. Use a chromatic tuner to tune the ukulele to the standard tuning.
 Attempt to play the ukulele everyday for at least 15 minutes. You don’t need to spend an hour everyday, but it will help you out if you do. Once you commit yourself to playing the ukulele regularly, you’ll develop a keener sense of what the ukulele ‘’should’’ sound like.


Use a chromatic tuner before practicing.
 The ability to sing a melody or rhythm will help your mind be able to play an instrument better. Listen to the notes of your ukulele on a tuner, or tone generator, and try to sing them. Spend a couple minutes everyday matching your voice to the pitch until it sounds perfect. This type of practice will improve your ears over time., Once you get into the habit of playing with other musicians, you’ll be forced to stay in tune. You can even tune to the other musicians instruments by asking them to play a note, and then tuning to their instrument. Playing with others increases your ears ability to hear out of tune notes.


Start a jam session by tuning to your chromatic tuner and see if you can tell, after thirty minutes of jamming, if you are still in tune.

 Shampoodle returns in Animal Crossing: City Folk, but this time Harriet has her own building, as opposed to being attached to other structures as in a New Leaf and Wild World. Shampoodle is located in the city, and to reach the city you must take a bus.


To board the bus, simply run to center point of the north end of town. The bus will then drop you off in the city, where many shops are located.
 Harriet offers the same hair package as in the other titles for the same price of 3,000 bells.
 City Folk is the first time that Harriet offers the makeover, in which she makes you a Mii Mask based on any Miis created on your Wii.

 Make sure that the baking rack is in the bottom third of the oven.
 Begin by piercing the knife through the top of the squash until you reach the hallow part inside. Then, using a sawing motion, cut downwards. Continue cutting all the way around the squash until you reach the other side.
 Make sure that you get all of the stringy bits out. Discard the pulp when you are done. You can throw the seeds away too, or you can save them for another recipe.
 Make sure that the squash is facing cut-side-up. To prevent the squash from burning or drying out, consider filling the pan with Â¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) of water., Rub the flat side and hallow of each squash with butter first, then add the brown sugar and maple syrup. Sprinkle each half with some salt and pepper, if desired.
 The squash is ready when the top is browned and the flesh is soft. You can test it for doneness by poking it with a fork or knife. If you can pierce the squash all the way through, it's ready.
 If some of the maple-butter did not get absorbed, scoop it up with a spoon, and drizzle it over any dry patches.You can serve it right in the skin, or you can scoop the fleshy bits out with a knife, and serve it in a bowl.

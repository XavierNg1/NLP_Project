 Candy Crush starts you off with five lives every day. Once those are exhausted, they will replenish at the rate of one per half hour.Hard as it may be, you can also just turn the game off and wait until tomorrow for five fresh lives.;
, Because Candy Crush provides five lives every day, you can get five more lives by changing the date on your mobile device and tricking the game into thinking it’s time to replenish your lives. When you’ve exhausted your five lives for the day, you can:


On an iOS device, go to Settings > General > Date and Time. On an Android, go to Settings > Date And Time.Go to Set Automatically (iOS) or Automatic Date and Time (Android) and turn this function off. Click on the date and time bar and manually set the date ahead to tomorrow. Launch Candy Crush and check that your five lives have been replenished. Return to the Date and Time setting and turn Set Automatically back on., By doing this, you’ll trick the game into thinking you are a new user and gain five new lives. To save your previous progress, make sure you sign in through Facebook in the app.Be warned that deleting the app will permanently delete your boosters.
 When you run out of lives on your mobile device, log in to the game through Facebook and you’ll have five new lives waiting for you to use them up., Before you start playing, open Candy Crush in multiple tabs. Once you’ve worked your way through the five lives in the first tab, you will still have an extra life available to play in each other tab you opened., Click on the blue and white cross in the top navigation bar. Click Ask Friends. Click the friends you want to ask or type in specific names into the search bar. Select Send Request and wait for the love to come pouring in!Don’t accept bonus lives when you already have five lives (if you can avoid it), because those lives can’t be banked away and you’ll lose them.

 One way that works extremely well to is to hold the heart under running water while squeezing it. The squeezes will perform the heart's original function, but this time to remove any blood and gunk that may be in it.;
, From there you can cook the slices whole, or cut them into smaller chunks or dices. If you still aren't sure about eating heart, it may help to dice it so it looks less like heart, and more like normal, yummy venison.
 You want the meat to look as nice as you can get it.


If you find any rough fibers near the larger end of the heart, cut those out.
 Add the salt and pepper, and any other seasonings, into the mass of yummy saute.
, The water will not only make the hand-dish much easier, but also extract the flavor out of the pan and back into the meat.
 There shouldn't be any blood, and there shouldn't be very much reddish shade, either. Some tint of pink will remain even when fully cooked.
 Serve by itself or with a side of mashed potatoes or potato fries. For extra fanciness, garnish with freshly chopped chives.

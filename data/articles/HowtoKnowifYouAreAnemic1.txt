 This is the most common symptom of all types of anemia. To figure out whether your fatigue may be related to anemia, rather than being the result of a few nights with too little sleep, think about the following questions. If your answer is yes, you might have anemia.Do you feel tired when you wake up in the morning, and throughout the rest of the day?
Do you have trouble concentrating and doing well at work or school, because you are so tired?
Do you lack the energy to accomplish basic tasks and chores, or does doing these activities seem to wipe you out?;
, Fatigue can be related to a lot of different conditions, but when it comes along with weakness and dizziness, anemia is certainly something to consider. If you often have to take a seat because you feel too weak or dizzy to stand, you should get tested for anemia., Left untreated, anemia can lead to life-threatening conditions.It's important to make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any of these less common symptoms:


Numbness or coldness in your feet
Pale skin
Rapid or irregular heartbeat

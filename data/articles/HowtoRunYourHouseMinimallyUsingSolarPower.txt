 This is a good first step in the right direction; as long as the PV panel is 20 watts or less, there is little danger in over-charging the battery (and the resultant boil-off of the electrolyte) even without a charge controller.;
, For example:


Many "boom boxes" accept 8 cells, which means 12V; you can make battery eliminators and run these directly off your car battery.
Linksys WRT54G and WRT54GS routers all accept anywhere from about 5V upwards to 30V or more, and use a size M coaxial connector (5.5mm x 2.1mm), center positive, which has become a de facto standard for 12V low-wattage devices. With one of these, you can extend your range of wifi access significantly, so you don't have to go without WikiHow as you learn energy independence.
Many devices and tools that nominally run off 6V to 24V will run off 12V, although it can be very risky to run a 6V device at double its rated voltage. One item that seems to work is the Panasonic RP-SPT70 active speaker system, shown in the battery eliminators article. An 18V device that works off 12V is this Ryobi reciprocating saw.
, Realize in this case you aren't getting something for nothing; the 12V side of the circuit will be drawing over 10 times the current that the AC device uses. Unfortunately, most laptops will need to be run this way unless you purchase a special power adapter, sometimes called an "Auto/Air Adapter", that directly converts 12V to the 18-24V required by the computer.

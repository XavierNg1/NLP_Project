 In order to use your computer’s power button to shut it down, you will need to change the settings. To access the settings, you will need to open the Control Panel. To open the Control Panel, either search for it on your Start screen by typing “control panel”, or Press the Windows key + X and select it from the menu that appears.
 You can find this by typing “power” into the Control Panel search, or you can find it in the Hardware and Sound section of the Control Panel.
 This will open a new page where you can designate what should happen when you press your computer’s physical power button. Click the drop-down menu next to “When I press the power button:”. Select “Shut down” from the list of options.
 Your computer will automatically begin shutting down when you press the power button on the computer. This is a perfectly safe way to power down, as it acts just as if you had selected “Shut down” from the Power menu in Windows.

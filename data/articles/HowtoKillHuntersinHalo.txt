 Run to the side and try to get behind the Hunter. If you go up close to it (be careful!) and run around it fast, you should be able to get to its back.;
, Try to keep your distance and time it for when they are not shooting, as their fuel rod cannons shake your screen.
 This a good tactic to buy you some time, not to kill them.
 If you can do this, well... you're good. If you fail, it is your fault. You can practice this in multiplayer by letting people charge you and then sidestep while turning around and meleeing them. If they hit you, you did it wrong. Try again. It's useful in multiplayer as well.
 When you come close enough, they will try to melee (Again, don't get hit!). At this moment, they will lift an arm, exposing the belly, which is uncovered like the back. Fire the pistol as many times as possible into the uncovered region to ensure that enough bullets actually strike it.
 they will hit you with their shield, but you won't die. Instead you'll fly into the air, while up there throw a plasma grenade ( the sticky ones) onto the orange part of its body.
 Then, DO NOT MOVE. The hunter almost never hits you, unless you move. This is because the kickback of his weapon severely damages his accuracy. Then finish him off by throwing a grenade behind him, and let him walk away from it. Then shoot him in the back

, When he charges back at you, walk back and wait for his stomach to be unprotected. Then, empty your assault rifle. Like crazy.
 This causes them to spin around following you, but not actually meleeing you as you need to be standing still for them to melee you. Note: Not tested on 2 Hunters. MAY be effective on them, though. -300spartans

, After that, just run and come back for seconds.

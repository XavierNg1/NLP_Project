 Once you have decided on the card colors, you'll be able to choose the color of the handbag or handbags that you're planning on adding to the card.
 You have various options here, either the suggested ones, or your own design. The important thing is to not overdo it, or the card will look crowded. Some suggested designs include:


One single handbag centered on the card front.
A pair of handbags side by side on the card front.
A handbag in each corner of the card front.
A trio of handbags, overlapping each other on the card front.
 This might include a ribbon, a border, a simple line in another color, etc.
 This might be plain cardstock, colored cardstock, patterned cardstock, corrugated card, etc. Or, you could layer different colors of paper.


This is a simple version; you can vary the shapes and make it fancier, as preferred.
 Start with a very simple design consisting of a rectangle. Draw the rectangle on the chosen cardstock or paper, then cut it out.
 Cut out a small length of twine, cord or other item. Glue this in an arch format the what you choose as the top end of the handbag.
 This step is optional, but you can improve the look with all sort of things, including stick-on gems, glitter, drawings, a hand-drawn pattern, ribbon, bows, etc.
 Use the design formation you've already chosen and glue in place. Add associated decorations at the same time.


Allow to dry before writing in the card.
 Either write a message in it and send it to a friend, add to a gift or give a box of your homemade handbag cards to a friend who loves handbags.

 Catching the ball is the primary responsibility of a Wide Receiver. Practicing alone is fine, but you will get the most out of it if you practice in a group.;
, After you catch the ball, you need to run with it. You can build up your speed by running around the block, using an exercise bike or treadmill, etc.
 Juking, spinning around, or jumping over a defender may be necessary at some point. Agility training is something that primarily is taught in practice, but there are ways to improve your agility at home. You could create a homemade obstacle course or just practice some basic moves in your yard.
 A good Wide Receiver can catch and be tackled, but a great Wide Receiver can catch and break a tackle. Breaking tackles is something that can really only be taught in practice, since there are many ways and scenarios in which you could break a tackle.
 This will happen nearly every time you catch the ball. The best way to avoid injury from a tackle is to build up your muscles, primarily in your shoulders. Tackling is also something that is best taught in practice, since you have pads and experienced personal available.

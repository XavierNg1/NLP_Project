 The Settings app resembles a grey gear. If you don't want Facebook accessing any of your data, deleting your account from your iPhone is a sure way to prevent future issues.









Deleting your Facebook data only revokes the app's access to your contacts, location data, calendar, and similar programs on your phone. It doesn't delete the Facebook app itself, nor does it delete your Facebook account from Facebook.
You can re-establish your Facebook account in this menu at any time by re-entering your Facebook credentials.
 You'll find Facebook in a cluster of related apps including Flickr, Twitter, and Vimeo.
 You can delete your account within this menu.
 This will take you to your personal account settings.
 Facebook will ask you to confirm this step.
 This deletes all Facebook account information from your iPhone.
 You shouldn't see any Facebook contacts!

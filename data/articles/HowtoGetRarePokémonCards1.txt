 Individual packs of cards have a random assortment of card varieties, and typically include a few rare cards. Every booster pack is guaranteed 1 rare card, but may also include more. This includes particularly rare cards, such as holofoil, and “star” rare.


The rares you get from booster packs are completely random. You may have to open many, many booster packs to find the one particular rare you want.;
, Promo tins typically come with a few booster packs, as well as a selection of specific rare cards. This can be a great way of achieving a particular rare (along with a few random ones), assuming it’s a rare that you want.New Pokémon tins are regularly released as new sets of cards come out. Older tins are not always kept in stock however, so make sure you take advantage of tin releases.
 A booster box contains 36 booster packs, though it does not typically come with a specific rare, like the tins. Buying a box is the most efficient way of obtaining a large amount of cards, and many retailers will offer a small discount for purchasing a box.


Note that you will at least receive 36 rare cards by purchasing a box, and usually more than that. However, like buying individual packs, there is no guarantee of receiving a specific card that you desire.

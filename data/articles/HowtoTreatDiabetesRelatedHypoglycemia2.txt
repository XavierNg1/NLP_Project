 Unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia requires immediate medical intervention as sugar levels are continuing to decrease.


If sugar levels drop too low, coma can occur.
This can lead to brain damage and other long term side effects.
 This is the first step in prepping the patient for “recovery mode,” which helps to ease the breathing.Kneeling gives you good leverage from which to maneuver the person without abrupt motions.
 Place the arm nearest you at a right angle to the person's body.


The hand should point upwards towards their head.
Place the other hand on the side of the head.
This leaves the back of the hand touching the cheek.
Bend the right knee at a right angle. Do this gently with both hands.
Roll the patient gently onto his side.
This is done by gently pulling on the bent knee.
The top arm is left to support the head and the bottom arm will stop the person from rolling too far.
 Open the person's airway by tilting their head back gently and lifting the chin.


The person should not have anything blocking their airway.
When the person is unconscious, don't give them any fluids or foods, as this can cause the patient to choke.
The patient should not be given any insulin as this will lower the sugar levels even more.
 Ensure the person is still breathing and that nothing is obstructing his airway.


This is a critical time, as the person is not aware of their surroundings and is susceptible to further harm.
Make sure that they are being cared for properly.

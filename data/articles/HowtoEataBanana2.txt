 Slicing the banana up first will make it easier to blend and give you a smoother drink in the end. For an extra-thick smoothie, use a frozen banana.
 For a thicker smoothie, omit the milk and use â…” cup (165 grams) yogurt.
 If you don't like peanut butter, you can use another type of nut butter, such as almond. You can also use some chocolate sauce instead (start with 2 tablespoons, then add more if needed).
 If the smoothie is not thick enough for you, toss in 5 to 7 ice cubes.
 You can garnish each glass with some whipped cream, or a swirl of chocolate and/or caramel sauce.

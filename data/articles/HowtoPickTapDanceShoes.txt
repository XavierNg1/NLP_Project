 If you're in kid's sizes, you'll want the shinier tap shoes. If you're in adult sizes or if you're in a more advanced class, you'll need leather tap shoes. Unfortunately, these are a lot more expensive than the shiny kid's ones. However, they last longer and make a better sound. Plus, they look a lot more professional.;
, What brands have good reviews? What brands have bad? Bloch is a great idea, for instance, because this brand makes more durable and well-working shoes.


Do not choose shoes who secure the metal on the bottom with just one screw. If that one screw comes even the least bit loose, you're in big trouble. Shoot for the ones with three screws, as these are better-suited in case the worst happens.
 If you order your shoes online and don't know the exact size you want, then there's a very high chance you're about to waste a lot of money. Remember that your street shoe size may not be the same as your tap shoe size.


Try for a local shoe store, especially a dance store. Try several different shoes, even if you feel that one pair is perfect, because there may be an even more perfect one on a shelf.
 The average price of a leather tap shoe is about $75, so don't go for something that's $20 or $30. Don't spend hundreds of dollars on tap shoes, either. Kid's tap shoes are typically $20 to $25, so compare that accordingly as well.
 Once you've found the right pair at the right price, hand over the cash and bring home your new pair of tappers. Congratulations!

 While not absolutely necessary to preparing the dish, blanching your green beans will help maintain a vibrant green color, especially if you’re refrigerating them overnight. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add half of the green beans, and cook for about four minutes, until they’re tender-crisp.While they cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water and place a colander in it. When the green beans are finished boiling, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the ice bath.
 Place kitchen towels on a baking sheet. Lift the colander to drain the beans, and use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the baking sheet. Use another towel to blot them dry.Repeat the boiling and blanching process with the remaining green beans.
 You can boil and blanch the green beans the day before your holiday meal, or in the morning before your guests arrived. Transfer them to an airtight container after you've blanched and towel dried them. Store them in the refrigerator until 15 or 20 minutes before you're ready to serve them., When you're ready to reheat them, get a large skillet hot over medium heat. Add the olive oil, and when it’s hot, add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Stir in the green beans, parsley, and tarragon and cook everything for a couple minutes, stirring frequently.Season to taste with salt and pepper, place on a platter or in a serving dish, and enjoy.

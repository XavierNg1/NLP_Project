 Unlike full shots that have to do with the air, putting is all about the contour of the ground. Look at all your putts from behind the hole and from a 90-degree angle. This will give you a clear idea of the distance and elevation of the ground before you putt. , The ball should be square to the line of target and your eyes should be over the ball. Let your arms hang loosely and hold the putter lightly. Make sure to keep your hands level or ahead of the ball through the stroke. , Move the putter backward smoothly. Use your shoulders to hinge your arms, not your elbows or wrist. Keep your putter in line with the target as your swing it backward and then forward. Maintain your tempo through the swing. , The putter head should strike the back of the ball during the upswing. It should feel like the palm of your right hand is striking towards the target. The best strokes look very smooth because the club is being swung backward and forward at the same speed. The strike should feel more like a “roll” rather than a “hit.” This will give you better distance control and keep the ball from rolling too far past the hole. , Don’t follow through with your eyes. Keep eye contact on the spot where the ball was, not where it is going. Don’t allow yourself to look up right away, count for two second before you look to see how well you did. Many golfers make the mistake of having a short follow through and not paying attention to the force of their follow through. Make a long follow through to the hole, it should not be shorter than the takeaway.

 A fraction is a comparison between two numbers, usually representing the size of a part of something to the size of the whole thing. The classic example is a pie that is cut into eight, for example, equal portions. The top of the fraction, called the numerator, represents the number of pieces you select. The bottom of the fraction, called the denominator, represents the total number of pieces in the pie - in this case, 8.


For example, the fraction 1/8 represents one piece of the pie that has been cut in eight pieces.
The fraction 7/8 represents 7 pieces, almost the full pie.;
, A percentage is a special kind of fraction in which the denominator is always set at 100. While this is not practical when cutting slices of an actual pie, the concept of percentages is much more useful because it is standard.


For example, with fractions, the size of “half” of something will depend on the number of pieces. If your “pie” is cut into eight pieces, then half would be four. But if your “pie” is in 22 pieces, then half would be eleven. The target always changes. But with percentages, one-half is always the same - 50%.
 If you are presented with any fraction, you can very easily convert it to a decimal number using any calculator. Just recognize that a fraction represents a division problem, and use your calculator to divide the numerator by the denominator. Your calculator will give you the decimal equivalent of the fraction.


For example, suppose you have the fraction 1/2. On your calculator, perform the operation 1 ÷ 2, and the calculator will show the result 0.5.
As another example, convert the fraction 1/4 into a decimal by performing the operation 1 ÷ 4. The result is 0.25.
For a more complicated example, you can convert the fraction 274/312 into a decimal with the operation 274 ÷ 312. The result will be 0.878. (There are more digits, but for our purposes we can stop at three.)

, If you have a number that is already represented by a decimal, converting that to a percentage is easy. Because the decimal numbering system is based on factors of 10, you can transform a decimal number into a percentage by simply shifting the decimal point by two spaces to the right and then adding a % sign. If your decimal number consists of only one digit, you can add 0’s on the right of the number, such as turning 0.5 into 0.50 or even 0.500. These all have the same numerical value.


For example, consider the example above of 1/2, which we converted to the decimal of 0.5. To change this decimal to a percentage, shift the decimal point two spaces to the right. First rewrite 0.5 as 0.50. Then when you shift the decimal point two spaces, you turn 0.50 into the number 50%.
The example of 1/4, which has a decimal equivalent of 0.25, can be turned into the percentage 25%.
 It is useful if you can memorize the percentage representations of certain basic fractions. Because the denominator for a percentage is always 100, certain values are constant. For example, you should know the following conversions:


3/4 = 75%
1/2 = 50%
1/3 = 33 1/3%
1/4 = 25%
1/5 = 20%
1/8 = 12.5% (this is often used in banking)

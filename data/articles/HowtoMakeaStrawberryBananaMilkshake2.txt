 Milkshakes typically contain ice cream, but this does not make them very healthy. If you are looking for a healthier option (or if you are vegan), you will need something thick to replace the ice cream. The answer to this is: a frozen banana.
 If you have not yet done so, rinse the strawberries, then chop off the stems, and cut them in half. Put them into a blender or food processor. Hold off on the bananas for now.
 You can use any type of milk you want for this. If you want a more traditional milkshake, use 2% or whole milk. If you are looking for a vegan option, you could try almond milk or even fat-free coconut milk!

,, From time to time, you may need to pause your blender or food processor, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any unmixed milkshake towards the bottom. Keep blending until everything is smooth.
 Because this recipe lacks ice cream, it may not be sweet or flavorful enough for you. Give the milkshake a test, then consider adding some extras, such as:For a chocolate milkshake, add 2 tablespoons (15 grams) of powdered chocolate drink mix or cocoa powder.
For a vanilla milkshake, add Â½ teaspoon of vanilla extract.
For a thicker milkshake, add some more frozen bananas, some frozen strawberries, or a few ice cubes.
 You can serve them as they are, or garnish them with some whipped cream or colorful sprinkles. If you are looking for a healthier garnish, try a banana slice or strawberry slice on the rim of the glass.

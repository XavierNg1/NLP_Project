 If the strange cat is your friend’s cat, or looks like they have a good home, then you don’t necessarily need to do this. However, if the cat looks like they are a stray, giving them food will help gain their trust. Leave a bowl of dry food near the cat and step far away from them. When the cat is finished eating it, don’t move toward them right away., Without approaching the cat, talk to them quietly and calmly. You can sit at a distance and do this while the cat is eating. If you are visiting the cat and feeding them daily, sit a little closer to the cat each day., You don’t want to scare the cat away by coming toward them and overwhelming them. Stick your knuckle toward the cat. Let it come to you and rub itself against your hand and smell you. Let the cat sniff you and decide if they want to befriend you back., Give the cat a long pet from the top of their head all the way to the end of their tail. Instead of immediately petting the cat again, stop. Wait a few minutes so the cat wants to be pet again. After a few minutes stroke the cat along their body again. Do this two or three times., Once the cat is across the room from you, look at the cat with “soft eyes.” When the cat looks at you, begin a long and slow blink. Keep your eyes shut longer than a normal blink but not too long where it looks like you are falling asleep. If your cat sees you are a friend, they will long bling back at you.

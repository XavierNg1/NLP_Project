 If you "prime" your skin before it accepts the final layer of makeup, that makeup will tend to look smoother and more even. As many makeup artists are won't to say: "Not to prime is a crime." Be sure you incorporate this into your morning routine for visibly smaller-looking pores.









If you're already applied makeup but have forgotten the primer, don't fret. You can apply certain primers on top of makeup while still staying at the height of classy. Make sure the primer you're applying on top of your makeup is specifically designed to do so.
 Concealers are used to make skin a more uniform color, hiding blemishes and deeper pockets of pores. Go for concealers that last for 12+ hours.
 What good is your makeup if using it is what's causing your clogged, larger-looking pores? Not very much good, is it? Be sure to wash your makeup off before you go to sleep. Incorporate this into your regular skin-care routine. Remember that clogged pores appear bigger than unclogged pores.









If you're the type who sometimes skips washing right before bed, grab yourself some makeup remover wipes — or better yet, make yourself some — and stash them close to your bed so that you can use them in a pinch.

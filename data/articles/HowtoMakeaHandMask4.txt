 Place 2 tablespoon (11 g) of oats in the bowl of your food processor. Process the oats until they have a powdery texture, which should take 10 to 15 seconds.


If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle.
 Once the oats are ground, mix them with 1 tablespoon (5.5 g) of honey. Stir well until the ingredients are fully combined.


Raw honey typically works best, but you can also use processed honey.
 When the oats and honey are fully blended, start adding in 1 to 2 tablespoons (18 to 36 g) of yogurt. Stir in just enough yogurt to create a thick paste.


For best results, use plain yogurt for the mask.
 When all of the ingredients are fully mixed, carefully apply the mask to your hands. Cover both the front and back of your hands, and let the mask sit for 10 to 20 minutes.
 When you’re ready to rinse off the mask, wet a clean washcloth with warm water. Gently run it over your hands to take off the mask. Rinse your hands under the water, and pat dry with a clean towel.


To keep your hands soft and smooth, apply a hand cream after you rinse it off.

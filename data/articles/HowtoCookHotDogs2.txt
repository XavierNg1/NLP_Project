 For 4 hot dogs, 4 cups (about 1 liter) of water should be more than enough. Be sure to use a pan large enough so that the water falls at least a few inches below the rim.
 Place the pan on a burner and turn the heat to high. Let the water come to a full boil before proceeding.
 Once the water is boiling, slip in the hot dogs one by one with tongs.
 Turn the burner down to its low setting and simmer hot dogs for anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes, depending on how you like your hot dogs cooked.


For a moister, softer hot dog, simmer them for less time, around 3 to 4 minutes.
For a crispier hot dog, simmer them for more time, around 5 to 6 minutes.
 After the hot dogs are finished boiling, remove them from water and dry them off carefully with a paper towel before placing them in a bun. Serve the hot dogs with any combination of mustard, ketchup, relish, onion, tomato, cheese, or sauerkraut.

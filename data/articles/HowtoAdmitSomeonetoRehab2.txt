 Your loved one may need a sense of self-efficacy and control over his choice in treatment in order to be successful.This can help increase motivation and reduce the likelihood of relapse. While you are aiming toward rehabilitation treatment, your loved one may want to explore other options. The more you know about the available treatments the better prepared you will be to help him see their advantages.


Self-help groups, for example, can be very helpful in treating substance use and maintaining sobriety., Individuals who are drug-addicted can often go through mood swings that make them indecisive. Once your loved one has agreed to go to a rehab center, you should be able to admit him there as soon as possible.


Help your loved one discuss the requirements of the rehab (rules, regulations), as well as schedules (therapy, exercise, leisure time, etc).
Ask about evidence-based practices. EBPs are therapy interventions that have research which shows they are helpful for a particular disorder., The longer you stay in a secure or supervised location, the more likely you may be to recover and maintain sobriety.However, this can be costly. Thus, it may be important to first make sure the person can fully afford rehabilitation treatment.You can help your loved once communicate with his medical insurance company about treatment options.

Ask a friend to help you carefully put the shirt, dress, etc. over your head. This will minimize the chances for squashing or losing the bacon strips.
Re-attach any bacon pieces that fall off during the transition from the flat surface to your body.
 If needed, follow up with more duct tape rolls and add safety pins to each piece of bacon.
 It's a greasy costume, so take along a tarp if you're sitting in a car or on anyone's sofa. And be careful not to brush up against anyone else's costume in case you transfer bacon fat and spoil the fabric of their outfit. Most of all, be prepared to be the center of conversation because everyone will want to know why, how and what next.


It's a good idea to have a friend accompany you when wearing this costume. They can help restore missing bacon pieces you've dropped and can alert people to give you wide berth as you're approaching them or when you're squeezing into the drinks line.
Be aware that your costume may be seen as offensive by some people. Be prepared for some grossed out reactions by having a funny remark up your sleeve to lessen the tension. And last but not least, don't get into an argument over what is basically a one-off, never-to-be-repeated costume; just respect their distaste, agree it's not to everyone's liking and promise not to sit too close.

 Say ‘walk on’.
 Put gently pressure on the lead rope and walk forward.
 When he learns that ‘walk on’ means you about to ask him to step forward, he will step forward sooner. Give him lots of praise when he does this. Eventually he will step forward when you just say ‘walk on’.
 Give the new command (leg) and then the old command (walk on).

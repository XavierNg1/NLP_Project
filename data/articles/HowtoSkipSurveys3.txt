 You can use any of the major web browsers to access the Inspect Element function. This will allow you to disable certain elements of a website, potentially including the survey.
 Choose "Inspect Element" from the drop down menu. This will open a developer window at the bottom of the browser. As you move the mouse over different parts of the website, you will see different objects highlighted on the screen.
 As you highlight different parts, look for the words “survey” and “overlay” in code. These are the elements that are blocking you from the content on the page.
 You will need to right-click the entries in the code, as opposed to right-clicking on the objects in the website. Select “Disable element” or “Delete node” to remove that object from the website.
 Besides removing the survey itself, you’ll have to remove the overlay which prevents you from interacting with the content underneath. Removing the overlay will “lighten” the page, allowing you to click objects underneath the overlay.Deleting the overlay can cause your scroll bars to be removed. You can work around this by using a mouse with a scrolling function.

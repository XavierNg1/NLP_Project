 At one store, drum heads could be £90. Note the store and price but look around at other stores to see if you can find them cheaper. Chances are, you'll find them cheapest online. That being said, don't jump on the internet every time you need something. By the time your stuff is shipped out to you, it's probably already been bashed and smashed around. Most of the time, you can't return once you've bought online.


Bring the online price in to the retailer and ask them to match it. If they really want your business, they may try. However, be understanding that in many cases, this cuts right into their bottom line, so don't be pushy.
 Before you buy a t-shirt, you try it on in the store to see if it fits and if it's of good quality, right? Why not do the same with your equipment? You could spend £400 on your new guitar but by the time you bring it home and try it out, you could hate it. You may not be able to return in to the store once you've opened it and used it.


Always try everything in the store, from straps to amps. If you're buying a mic, ask to test that out in store too.
Ask the people in the store if you can refund after. If you can't, this gives you even more reason to ask them for testing time.

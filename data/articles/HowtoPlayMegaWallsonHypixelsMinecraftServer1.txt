 You should have a pickaxe at least. Hit the dig pit, all the maps have them. If you are good and can get a lot of coins (as of EULA), you should have an advantage with the pickaxe.;
, You'll also want cobblestone (for a furnace) and coal (for furnace fuel), so don't neglect these.
 While you wait for it to smelt, find a good hiding place for your chest. Note: If you are VIP or higher, your first three chests will receive a protection. Ditto for furnaces.
 You should also get spare for your chest. That means when you die, you can go, get gear and go rush/kill farm again with full gear!

 Wrap the sarong around your waist, as you would a towel.


If the material is too long, fold the sarong in half horizontally before you begin.
 Then pinch the corners until you have enough material to form a knot.
 Gather the material in front of your body and make a simple knot. Then knot a second time to secure.
 If you like, you can twist the material to one side. This way, you will expose one leg as you walk.

, Fluff out the corners of the knot, making sure that the patterned side of the material is facing outwards.

, If you would prefer not to wear your sarong with a slit in front or to the side, you can tie it using an alternative method:

Hold the sarong horizontally and wrap around your waist (like a towel). Then keep pulling both corners all the way around your body until you can tie them at the small of your back.
If done correctly, there should be no slit in the material, and the sarong should almost look like a normal skirt from the front.

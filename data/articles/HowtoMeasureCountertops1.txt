 Prior to measuring your countertops, create a rough diagram of your kitchen or bathroom. The drawing provides a visual to potential contractors and serves as a convenient place to record your measurements. It does not need to be to scale.Retrieve a piece of graph paper and a pencil. Draw a model of your space—sketch the walls and mark the doorways., The location of appliances, sinks, and fixtures must be added to your diagram.If you are you keeping your current appliances and fixtures, roughly draw your existing appliances, sinks, and faucets on the diagram.
If you are you replacing your existing appliances or altering the layout of your space, sketch the location of your new appliances, sinks, and or faucets on the diagram.It is also helpful to note the type of sink, refrigerator, stove, and range found in your space.
 Sketch the layout of your cabinets on your diagram. Again, the dimensions do not need to be precise or to scale.


If you intend to keep your existing cabinetry, draw the current layout of your cabinets on your diagram.
If you intend to alter the layout of your space and or replace your cabinets, sketch the new cabinetry layout., Countertops are highly customizable. The unique touches you select may alter your quote and therefore should be noted in your diagram.


Choose an edge type for your countertops: 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) rounded solid surface, eased stone, bevel stone, ogee stone, or bevel solid surface.Mark any sweeps, or rounded overhangs.

 Ultraviolet light is invisible to the human eye, but a UV lens filter can access this light, which will eliminate some haziness.
 When using filters in photography, the UV lens will protect the surface of your lenses from scratches.
 The UV lens filter provides another layer of protection between your camera and your lens.

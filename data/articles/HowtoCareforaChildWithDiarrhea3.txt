 One of the larger concerns of infants who have diarrhea is dehydration. Nursing your baby more often than usual will supply them with the fluids, calories, and nutrients they will need to get healthy and stay hydrated.Offer each breast to your baby for at least one to two minutes every ten to fifteen minutes until symptoms have reduced, or, if you aren’t breast feeding, use formula and a bottle., Increase the amount of bottle feedings to make up for lost nutrients and liquids in both newborns and infants. The amount of nutritional supplementation a baby might need depends on their size and age, for example, 1 fl oz. for newborns and 3 fl oz. for 12-month olds at each extra feeding.If you are uncertain of the extra amount your baby needs consult your healthcare professional.
 Introduce semi-solid foods back into your child’s diet if they have eaten them in the past. Foods like mashed bananas or potatoes are high in nutrients and can help resupply infants who have diarrhea.Cereal with milk is another way to introduce nutrients and liquids back into your baby’s diet., Ask your doctor or healthcare professional about an ORS if you are concerned your baby is not getting enough liquids from breastfeeding or formula. ORS is a special rehydration solution and is offered at many drug stores and pharmacies (most of them end in “lyte”).Most ORS do not give babies the amount of nutrients they need and are therefore not meant as a dietary replacement, simply a hydration supplement. Be sure to return to formula, breastfeeding, or semi-solid foods once you see improvement.
 Diaper rashes are common with babies who have diarrhea. Wash your baby’s bottom after each bowel movement, pat dry with a towel, and apply an ointment or zinc oxide paste to avoid skin irritation.

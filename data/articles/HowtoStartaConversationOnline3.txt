 Perhaps you've genuinely run out of conversation topics, or perhaps you need to be somewhere. Either way, you will want to bid your conversation partner goodbye.


Say something along the lines of, "Alright, I need to go to practice. Nice talking to you! Have a great day".
Consider saying that you have to go, even if you don't actually have to go. This is an easy way to get out of a conversation without feeling rude.
 Online conversations follow a slightly different protocol than offline conversations. They're not so formal. Unless your conversation partner is subject to limited internet access, you don't need to arrange a "second date". At the most, you might say, "we should talk again sometime!"


If the conversation went well, simply message the person again in a day or two when you are both online. This time, you should be more familiar with each other. Build upon the information and the jokes that the two of you shared in your first conversation.
If your conversation partner can only access the internet at certain times or in certain places (say, for three hours each afternoon, or only at the public library), then feel free to make a formal plan. Type something like, "I really enjoyed talking to you. I know that you aren't online all the time- can I plan to talk to you again on Tuesday?"


, If you make plans to meet up offline, exercise your best judgment about the situation. One conversation can only tell you so much, and people are not always who they say they are on the Internet.Consider talking with the person more online before you make the leap to meeting in person.
If you are using an online dating site like OKCupid or Tinder, then you may very well decide to meet up with the person soon--or immediately. Again, exercise your best judgment. If you meet up with a stranger, tell a friend where you are going, and with whom. Bring your phone with you and, if possible, meet in a public place (such as a coffee shop) during the daytime.

 You can use plain chips with no added flavoring, or choose your favorite flavoring for something unusual, such as chili or sour cream and chives.


Potato chips aren't the only choice––you might also like to try sweet potato, cassava, beetroot, etc. chips.
Whether the chips are smooth or ridged is up to you. Both types work fine.;
, Milk, dark or white chocolate are all appropriate for covering the chips. Select the one you like the most.
 Or, use foil. This is where the dipped chips will rest to set.
 Before dipping, the melted chocolate should appear glossy (tempered).



Half the chip: Dip halfway to cover one half in chocolate. Lift it up and allow excess chocolate to drip back (if it's really excessive, scrape against the side of the melted chocolate bowl).
All of the chip: Hold the chip with a pair of tongs and dip the entire chip into the melted chocolate. Lift it up and allow excess chocolate to drip back (if it's really excessive, scrape against the side of the melted chocolate bowl).
 Repeat with as many chips as you want to cover in chocolate.
 Before the chocolate sets, you can sprinkle on flavoring. Suggestions include smoky paprika, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, superfine sugar, ground ginger, chocolate sprinkles, desiccated coconut, chopped dried fruit, etc. You could even drizzle over zigzag lines of melted chocolate in a lighter or darker shade.
 Let sit for 10-15 minutes to set the chocolate. Remove after this time has passed, to avoid making the chips soggy.
 Place in a lined basket or on a plate and set out for people to help themselves to.

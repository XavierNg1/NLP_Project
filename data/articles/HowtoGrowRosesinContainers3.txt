 Many garden supply stores sell special blends, and you may have more success with a potting mix designed to promote rose growth than with a generic soil.



A simple blend includes a sterile non-soil potting medium, like fine bark, mixed in equal parts with perlite to lighten the mixture.
Another common blend includes 40 percent topsoil mixed with 30 percent perlite and 30 percent screened compost.

 When your business is facing a financial setback, it can be difficult to know what to cut. Although you need to make them, some cuts can cause more harm than good. Look to make cuts in non-essential areas that will not compound your difficulties.For example, making substantial cuts to your accounting department will eliminate the people most capable of helping your business navigate your setback.
 A major financial setback can be an opportunity to reevaluate your business plan. Think about what aspects of your business are working well and what parts are struggling. You may find that some tweaks to your business plan can help you eliminate or reform problematic aspects of your business and avoid issues in the future.For example, you may find that the brick-and-mortar store is losing money while your online sales are doing well. This might lead you to scale back on the store while expanding your online presence.
 If your business is struggling, continue building towards your future. Although you need to address your immediate financial problems, you should not sacrifice your vision of your businessâ€™ future. Make plans for five and ten years down the road. This will keep you and your business moving forward while you deal with your current setbacks.To boost motivation, consider creating some company-wide benchmarks. For example, you might challenge your employees to double sales by a certain date and incentivize them with bonuses or other perks.
 In the face of a financial setback, your connections may provide you with some opportunities for growth. Pursue any leads that may expand your business or lead to new opportunities. Do not be afraid to go outside your comfort zone and look for opportunities that may lie in unique locations.For example, you might approach a local nonprofit about developing a partnership that allows them to use some of your resources while providing you with some discounted marketing.

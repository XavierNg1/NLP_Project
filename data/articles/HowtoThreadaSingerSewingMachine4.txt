 Pull the end of the thread through the needle so that the tail is a couple of inches long. Turn the hand wheel toward you until the needle is no longer visible and goes into the bobbin case.
 Move the hand wheel slowly until the needle reaches its high point again. Continue to hold the thread that came through the needle during this process. When the needle comes up, the bobbin thread loop will also rise.
 Pull the thread toward you until the loop is brought further out of the bobbin case. Pull both of the pieces of thread until they are under the presser foot. Drape the tail of the thread to the back and the right of the sewing machine.

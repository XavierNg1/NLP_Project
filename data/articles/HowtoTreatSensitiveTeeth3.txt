 The most common way to treat teeth with spots bare of enamel is the application of a sealant, which coats the tooth and serves the same purpose as the enamel. Once the sealant is applied, the sensitivity and pain will go away and the occlusal surface of your back teeth will be easier to brush, making bacteria go away faster. Talk with your dentist about whether this treatment option is a good choice for you.
 Many people grind their teeth in their sleep without even knowing it. If you grind your teeth you could be wearing away your enamel bit by bit. A dentist will be able to tell whether you grind at night by examining your teeth with a magnifying tool. If you do grind your teeth, it is likely that your dentist will recommend that you wear a mouthguard at night to prevent further damage from occurring.
 If your teeth are extremely sensitive as the result of a deep cavity, you might be in need of a root canal to fix the problem. A root canal fixes issues with the tooth's soft core, which can become very sensitive. Your dentist will assess whether getting a root canal is necessary.

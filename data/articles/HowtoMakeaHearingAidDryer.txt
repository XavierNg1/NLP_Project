 The container shown is a Glad 1/2C leftover cup.;
, These are usually small (1/2" cylinders) or packets that look like large sugar packets (sugar does not work, neither will salt or pepper). The number required is hard to state -- more is better but leave room for the hearing aids.
 Add hearing aids (you can add a layer of paper towel or something over the silica gel to keep the aids from mixing with the silica gel). Cover the container. Do this each evening when you remove the aids. Take the (dry) aids out of the container in the morning. Repeat daily.
 The easiest way to refresh is to stick the capsules into a microwave and "nuke" for a minute or so. Just the capsules; no hearing aids in the microwave, please! The water in the silica gel will be driven out of the silica gel by the heat. (You can put the silica gel packets into an oven on its lowest setting for an hour or so, too.)

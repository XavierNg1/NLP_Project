 You might need a little more or less time––that depends on the question, the context and the children involved.
 The first time you perform a SOLE investigation, you'll need to chat a little about the process and what it means. In your own way, make it clear that this is fun, not a chore.


If working with more than one child, delegate a "helper" child. This child is responsible for delegating within the group, such as resolving issues, problem-solving, etc. This, in itself, is an important learning process in helping others to get along. For one to two children, this role is not needed, although you may wish to provide question-driven guidance on occasion.
, If you are working with only one child, have him or her set off online to find the answers to the question. If you have several children, have them work together.


Ask the children to keep records of their investigation. This can be notes, photos, quotes, audio recordings, drawings, diagrams, print-outs, etc.––basically, whatever they feel documents the investigation in the way that explains their findings.
 After the 40 minutes are up, ask the children to come back to you. Choose a comfortable place to sit down together and talk about the investigation. Your role is to facilitate the discussion. Ask more questions and listen actively:


Ask the participants what they felt about the experience.
Ask the participants what they felt they did well during the investigation, including noting what others did well. And ask them what they'd do differently the next time––it's as important to learn about what doesn't work as much as what does.

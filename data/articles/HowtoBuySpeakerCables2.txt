Allow a little extra slack in your speaker wire in case you measure wrong or if you ever need to move your speakers in the future.
If you plan to run your speaker wire behind your walls or ceiling, safety code requires you to use CL2 or CL3 UL-rated speaker wire. The Underwriters Laboratory (UL) examines the heat generated from the wire, how quickly the speaker wire might catch fire when exposed to a flame and how prone the wire is to damage if it encounters external stresses to set this rating.
If you plan to run speaker wire outdoors, you’ll need speaker wire that’s rated for direct burial.
 The AWG (American Wire Gauge) number identifies the gauge, or the thickness, of a speaker wire.


Use 16 gauge if you need fewer than 80 feet (24 meters) of speaker wire.
Use 14 gauge if you need 80 feet to 200 feet (61 meters) of speaker wire.
Use 12 gauge if you need more than 200 feet of speaker wire.



You might connect with bare wires, pin connectors, banana plugs, spade connectors or dual banana plugs.
Some high-end brands of speakers, like Bose, do not have standard connectors for speaker wire or audio cables. Contact the company to find speaker wire or audio cabling that’s compatible with those speakers.

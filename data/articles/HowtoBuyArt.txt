 If you begin at art fairs, you will learn to what you are drawn and the galleries that carry those artists. Art fairs will give you a starting point so that you can narrow your gallery search down and save a lot of time visiting ones that don't feature what you want;
, Shopping for art can be compared to shopping for any other large purchase. Go back to the galleries that have the pieces that interest you and take note of the prices they want because, if you are visiting local art galleries, they will most likely carry the similar pieces by the same artist and you can get the best deal.
 Once you've pared the list of galleries down to a few ones that you like, don't be afraid to talk to the dealers and ask others about them. This will give you an idea of who you like and who is most trusted by getting opinions and learning of past experiences.
 There is immense value in being a valued customer. When shopping for art, nurse a rapport with gallery owners so that they will make you aware of the best values and the newest pieces coming into the gallery before other buyers.
 Artwork can be expensive, and the prices are very often negotiable. After you have compared values at a few art galleries, you will have a good idea what a piece is worth and can make an offer that you and the dealer will both feel is fair.
 Inexperienced buyers often believe that they have to walk in and pay for the piece in full, up front. This isn't the case, and you should find out what your payment options are as well as the dealer's return and exchange policies.

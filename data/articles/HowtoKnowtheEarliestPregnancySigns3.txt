 If you suspect you are pregnant, pick up a home pregnancy test at a drug store. Follow the directions on the package and take the test at home. Usually, you pee on the stick or gather your urine in a cup and dip the stick in the test.Most pregnancies tests can be taken a few days after your missed period. However, there are some tests on the market designed for early detection you can try. Refer to the package's instructions for precise directions on when to take the test.Tests are more accurate after your missed period. If you suspect you are pregnant before missing your period, go to the doctor instead of taking an at home test.
 If you suspect you are pregnant, or have a positive pregnancy test, make an appointment with your doctor.During your first visit, your doctor will run tests to confirm your pregnancy. A doctor may perform a urine test in the office or they may order blood work.Your doctor will also ask you about your medical history, past pregnancies, your general lifestyle, and any medications you're currently taking.
Your doctor will perform a basic physical exam to make sure you're in good health.
 If you are pregnant, it can be an emotional experience. If you're waiting on the results of a test can be stressful, so talk to friends, family members, and the other parent about your emotions. You can also talk to a therapist if you have one.

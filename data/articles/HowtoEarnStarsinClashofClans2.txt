 Select your Barracks from the Map (the main game screen you see once the game launches), and tap the soldiers you want to produce.


The kind of soldiers you can produce will depend mainly on the level of Barracks you have. If you’re just starting out in the game, you can start by producing Barbarians, which costs around 25 Elixirs to train.
 Once you’ve created a sufficient number of troops, you can now start raiding other villages. Tap the “Attack” button you see on the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and select “Find a Match.”


The server will start looking for village that you can attack. Once an opponent has been found, you will be taken immediately to its village.
 Deploy your troops by tapping anywhere on the ground outside the walls of the village you’re going to attack. Your soldiers will begin advancing and raiding the village. You’ll get a certain number of War/Raid Stars depending on the degree of damage you do to a village you attacked:


One star – If you destroy at least 50% of the village.
Two stars – If you destroy the enemy’s Town Hall.
Three stars – If you get to totally destroy the entire village (100%).
 If you earn at least one War/Raid star, you’ll instantly win the fight and will be awarded Gold and Elixir bonuses, which will be saved on your Gold and Elixir Storages.

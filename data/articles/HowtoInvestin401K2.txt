 Some 401K plans are managed by third parties through your employer, and they may offer management services for a small fee (usually around one percent of your earnings).


Work with your own financial planner if you have one. A professional can incorporate your 401K investments into your overall retirement portfolio. Hire a financial advisor only if s/he is fee-based rather than commission-based.
 You can invest your 401K contributions in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities and cash equivalents.


Establish the amount of risk you can handle. For example, stocks offer investors the best shot at long-term earnings, but they are riskier. Typically, the more time you have until retirement, the more risk you can tolerate. Risk and reward usually go hand-in-hand.
 Look for consistently high returns, good fund management and a low expense ratio to maximize your investment.


Read the prospectus for every fund available through your plan in order to get an idea of whether it is a good fit for your risk level and investment goals.
 Spread your money across many different stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities and money-market instruments. This is the best way to avoid losing money when a single investment drops in value.

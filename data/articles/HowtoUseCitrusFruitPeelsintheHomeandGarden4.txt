Grapefruit peel can be used as you would lemon or orange peel, and it also has great uses of its own:


Use grapefruit peels to cut into shapes to brighten up your salad. All you have to do is sprinkle them over the salad. It will make the salad smell great too.
Make grapefruit marmalade or candy it as with other peels.
Use the oil distilled from the peel for perfume.

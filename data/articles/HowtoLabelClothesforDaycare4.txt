 Sewn labels can either be purchased from online companies like It’s Mine Labels or Label Land or made on your own by cutting out small pieces of fabric and using a permanent marker, laundry pen, or hand stitching to label each square.
 To attach the label to the clothing, simply stitch around the edge of the label using a sewing machine, or hand sew it. Sewn labels don’t have the risk of getting lost because they are so firmly put on your child’s clothes. They also don’t leave as permanent a mark as writing straight on the fabric with a laundry pen.


However, they are hard to remove to pass the clothing down to other children and will show a visible stitch on the opposite side.
 A slightly less permanent, but still effective, approach to fabric labels is to use an iron-on version. These labels are also available from a variety of online companies or at a sewing or baby store.


To apply to clothing, follow the directions on the package and use an iron to cover the label completely for a few minutes.
 You can create homemade iron-on labels by cutting fabric squares and placing a piece of fusible, iron-on material (available at sewing stores) between the label and the clothing. Then simply follow the instructions on the iron-on material package to attach it to the clothing.


Iron-on labels are still sturdy and durable, but don’t show the seam that comes with sewing on the fabric labels. Because fabric labels are so sturdy, they tend to perform well at daycare, even during the most active activities.

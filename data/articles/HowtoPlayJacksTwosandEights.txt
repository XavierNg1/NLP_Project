Lay down a card that is either the same suite or same value as the face up card. Recognize special cards:

Two. If player1 plays a 2, player2 must pick up 2 cards and cannot play a card in that turn. If, however, player2 also has a 2, he/she can immediately play that card (without having to pick up 2 additional cards) and player1 must pick up 4 cards. However, if player1 has another 2 and plays it, player2 must pick up 6 cards. Finally, if player2 has the fourth and final 2 and plays that card, player1 must pick up 8 cards.
Eight. Causes the next person to lose their turn.
Jack. Allows the player to change to the suite of their choice. When playing, the jack does not need to match the suite currently showing.


If you can't lay a card, then take a card off the top of the pile. If you can play it, lay it down immediately. If you place it in your hand, play proceeds to the next player.
Announce if your turn leaves you with one card by either saying "last card" or by knocking on the table. If you fail to do this, you will need to pick up an extra card on your next turn.
, If you play more than one round, incorporate scoring. Any player who has cards left in hand when someone goes out tallies the point values of the cards in hand, as follows: Ace = 1; denominations 2-10 at face value; King, Queen 10 each; Jack = 20. First player to reach 101 points loses the game.

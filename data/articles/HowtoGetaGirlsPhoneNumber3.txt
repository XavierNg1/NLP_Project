 Though the two-minute drill can be effective, the ten-second drill won't charm any girl no matter how slick you think you are. You should take enough time to introduce yourself to the girl, to ask her name, and to let her quickly see that you're a cool guy she'd like to see again.


Don't just walk up to a girl and say, "Hey, I want to hang out with you later. Can I get your number?"
Don't ask for her number without telling her your name.
 If you feel a lag in the conversation, or the girl keeps looking around the room, checking her phone, or trying to make eye contact with her friends so they save her from you, then you've missed your chance. Sorry, buddy. Better luck next time.


If both of you are struggling to find something to say, then don't ask for her number. Why would she want to give it to you â€” so you can sit in awkward silence some more another time?
If she says goodbye to you and starts walking away, don't ask for her number. If she wanted you to ask, she would have lingered.
 This is a no-brainer. Unless you're in middle school, you have to put on your big boy pants and ask her yourself. If your friends ask for you, you will look shy, insecure, and not like a real man.


If a girl thinks you're not assertive enough to ask for her phone number, how can she expect you to impress her when you hang out?

, Some people may think it's a good idea for you to go up to the girl and to say, "Oh, shoot, I can't find my phone, do you mind if I give it a call from your phone?" Then, the girl will technically give you her number and you will "discover" that your phone is in your pocket. She'll see what you're up to and will think you're pretty lame, unless you can be really suave about it and laugh and say, "I bet you never thought I could get your number." You may get some cleverness points for this one, but it's more likely that the girl will think you were too cowardly to ask for her number the normal way. There are better ways to go about it.

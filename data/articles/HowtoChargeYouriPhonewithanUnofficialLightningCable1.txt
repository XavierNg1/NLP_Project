 MFi (Made For iDevices) cables are certified by Apple to work with your iOS device, even if they aren't made by Apple itself. MFi-certified cables will not cause your iOS device to stop charging when you use them.


While MFi cables are cheaper than Apple cables, they still aren't inexpensive.;
, This box will be somewhere on the packaging of the cable you're trying to purchase; it will say "Made for" followed by the iOS devices it supports (e.g., iPhone, iPad, iPod) and their respective silhouettes. If you don't see "MFi" in the title of the cable and the "Made for" certification somewhere in the packaging, the cable won't work with your iPhone.


If you're shopping online and can't see the packaging, consider emailing the provider for more information.
 If recent reviews mention that the cable stopped working for a new release of iOS, the cable probably won't work.


In a traditional retail store, simply ask to talk to the tech department or customer service.
 If you see positive reviews outside of the site or store in which you found the cable, you should go ahead and purchase it. Otherwise, keep looking for an MFi-certified cable.


Some MFi cables that worked with one version of iOS cease working when your iPhone updates. For this reason, try to purchase a cable manufactured recently.

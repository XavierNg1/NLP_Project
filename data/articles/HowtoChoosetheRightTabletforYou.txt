   It's super helpful to know how much you want to spend when buying a tablet or frankly, anything. This way it narrows the selection down a bit. Be warned: Just because it's expensive  does not mean that it's higher quality!;
, Are you the heavy gamer? Or the casual  dude that sits on his/her porch drinking coffee and reading a newspaper and surfing the web on a Saturday morning? If your the gamer, your going to want more ram than the casual dude.  It also helps to do your research(see step 3)Go to  a store's websites and look at the "spec's" button. This will help you compare different tablets all at once!  

,  Find out things like the camera quality and if you can add memory to the tablets GB storage. Find out it's pixel count. Ask yourself: am i buying this tablet because it's trendy or will it suit my needs? Ask your friends! Do they like their tablet? How was their last tablet?

, Apple's Tablets are alright. But if you really do research, then you would find that the Samsung Galaxy Tablet is $100 cheaper, it has the same quality(if not better.) Really think about what your buying and what makes it so special.
 You have gone through all the steps and your ready  to make your purchase. Great Job!

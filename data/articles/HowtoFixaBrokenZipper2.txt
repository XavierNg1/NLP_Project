 When substances build up around the teeth of your zipper, it can prevent the zipper from staying closed. As a result, you’ll need to clean the teeth and remove stuff that could be preventing the zipper from closing.









Combine water and soap in a small dish, and stir until suds form.
Dip a clean rag in the soapy water and wipe down the zipper’s teeth.
Grab a fresh rag and run it under the tap.
Wipe the soapy mixture off the teeth with the damp rag.
Attempt to zip and unzip as normal., If all else fails, you may need to fix bent teeth to get your zipper to close. To do this, use your tool of choice (perhaps pliers) to pull the tooth straight.









Repeat as needed.
Be careful not to pull the tooth out of the tape.
Test the repair by opening and closing the zipper as normal., Move the slider towards the bottom of the zipper without pulling it off. Straighten and align the zipper’s teeth with your fingers. Slowly feed the zipper into the slider. You may need to apply a little force. Make sure the side of the zipper moves down all the way into the bottom stopper.









You may need to repeat this several times.

 Measure a piece of regular sewing thread to the be about the length of your forearm. Tie the two loose ends in a knot, creating a loop.


Avoid threads that are highly synthetic. Cotton thread works best for threading.
If the thread is too long or short for your liking, feel free to cut a new piece of thread to meet your personal preference.
 To keep from trapping hairs that are too long, brush brows up and then trim any that stick out over the top of your natural brow line.
 Presently, your thread should be in an oblong shape. Twist one hand, so that the strings cross in the middle, forming an “X” shape.
 Using the same process as you did to form the "X” in the string, twist one end of the thread between 10-15 more times, as you like.









To remove hairs, you will catch them in the twists you’ve created in the thread. Having been caught, you will pull up to remove them.
If you feel that your hands are too wide apart or close together when you place them near your eyebrows, cut a new piece of thread and start these steps over.
 Holding your hands with the thread above your eyebrows, place the “<” shape created at the end of the twists near the hair you want to remove.









If you are using the “<” next to your right hand, increase and decrease the distance between you thumb and forefinger of your left hand.
Moving your finger and thumb closer and further apart with the string moves the twists in the center, trapping the hairs.
Moving your finger and thumb further apart moves the twist closer to your right hand, while pushing them closer together moves the twist away from your right hand.
Pull upwards at the same time as you open your thumb and finger. This will pull out the hair.
Work as quickly as you can to aid in pulling the hairs out from the roots and not breaking them in their middles.
 Threading pulls out several hairs at once, making the process a bit faster than tweezing.

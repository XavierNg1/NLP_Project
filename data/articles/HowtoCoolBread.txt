 The recipe may make a certain cooling method apparent and this should be followed to ensure the outcome promised by the recipe. If not, follow the method outlined here.;
, Use oven mitts to protect your hands from both the hot pan and oven. When handling the hot bread, consider leaving the mitts on initially.
 This is important because bread left in the pan outside of the oven will become moist, soggy, and sponge-like very quickly as the moisture in the pan condenses onto the bread.
 Leave to cool, or you can take slices of the bread when warm for a "hot bread" treat.
 This will ensure that it stays crisp around the crust.

  Use the adjustable wrench (or socket set) to bolt the seat to the mounting plate.  The bolts should be provided with the mounting plate. You will want to tighten this fairly tight (hand tightened).
  Most new pedestals will have between a 4 and 6 bolt pattern.  Place the pedestal so the holes match your existing holes, or, place the pedestal where you want it, and take a marker to trace inside the holes.  Once you have your new holes traced you will need to drill through them with a drill bit that is the same size as the pedestal bolts.  Securely fasten the pedestal bolts through the floorboard and make sure it is tight.,  Keep the seat facing the front of the boat (the direction you will be sitting once it is completed).  You will now need to screw the mounting bolts through the mounting holes of the pedestal and the universal mounting plate.  Then thread the nuts onto the bolts and hand tighten.,

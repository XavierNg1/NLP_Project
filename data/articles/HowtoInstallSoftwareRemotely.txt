 In order to act as an administrator on a second machine, it’s important that both computers have a remote control program allowing this to take place.  There are many different programs available on the market that allow remote control, including both paid and free options. A simple search engine query should pull up plenty of different options available. Once you have found a suitable program, you will want to install that program on both the first and second machine.;
, Depending on the remote control program being used, you will need to determine how to take control of the other machine. In most remote control programs, you will use one login for both machines, and specify which computer is intended to serve as the host and which is the administrative machine.
, Once the administrator has taken control of the machine, installing the necessary software is an easy process. Much like using any other computer, the administrator can use his keyboard and mouse to navigate to the web browser and download and install the necessary software. It is important to remember that if there are passwords in place on the host machine, the administrator will need to possess those passwords in order to install a new application.
  Once the application has been installed and all of the necessary information has been transmitted between the two computers, the host machine no longer needs to remain under remote control. Most software programs have a simple disconnect option that allows the connection to be broken. This will return the first computer to the control of its owner, or in the case of a secondary computer, will simply break the remote connection.

 If you're listening to a country song currently and can't figure out what it is or who it is by, open up one of these apps on your phone, activate it, and hold it up to the sound source.These apps are very effective at recognizing songs and giving you the name of the artist and the name of the tune.;
, This free app analyzes the melody and presents you with a list of possible options. Midomi is another program that works in a similar way. Even if you're not a great singer, the program can recognize the intervals that you're singing. Hum along as much of the melody as you can remember.


NameMyTune and WatZatSong present your singing sample to people online, making it somewhat more reliable than a computer. People usually get back to you pretty quick with a list of options.
 If you don't have any of these options available to you, try to record as much of the song as you can on your phone. It doesn't have to be a great-quality sound file, just good enough for someone to recognize it. When you're back at your computer, you can upload it to AudioTag. This is a bot program that analyzes the music much like Shazam, but on the computer.


Recording the track, if you can, is a great way of learning what it is later. Play the track around to other people, to see if you get any hits.
 While these methods are traditionally reserved for classical music, Musipedia or MelodyCatcher allow you to play the melody of a song on an online keyboard, which it then analyzes.There are a variety of pop, rock, and country songs as well.

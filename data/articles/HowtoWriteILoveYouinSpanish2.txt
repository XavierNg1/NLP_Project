 Yo means "I" in Spanish. However, in Spanish you should avoid using subject pronouns when they are unnecessary. In this context, the yo is unnecessary as it is implied by the context, so you can leave it out if you wish.
 In this context, the word te means "you".
 In this context, the word quiero means love. Now you have written yo te quiero or te quiero, which both mean "I love you".
 Te quiero is the most common way of saying "I love you" in Spanish, and can be used when speaking to parents, siblings and friends, as well as lovers and spouses. Te quiero implies affectionate and caring love. It is not used romantically.

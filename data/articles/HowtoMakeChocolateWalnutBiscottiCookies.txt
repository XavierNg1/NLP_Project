 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 C, Gas Mark 4).;
, Stir flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl to combine.
 In another bowl, mix eggs, egg whites, and vanilla extract, then add your flour mixture. If you're using a mixer, use a low setting and add flour slowly. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into the combined mixture by hand.
 Divide your dough into two equal pieces, and roll each one into a snake until they're each about two inches in diameter. Dusting your board with flour will help prevent sticking.
 Put your dough snakes onto a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet, press them down a touch to flatten the top, and then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the tops are golden brown. Remove the biscotti rolls from your baking sheet and put them in a rack to cool.
 When your biscotti snakes are cool enough to handle, slice them on an angle into 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) slices, like you're slicing bread. Put the slices back onto the cookie sheet and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes on each side, until both sides of the biscotti are lightly toasted. This recipe makes 3-4 dozen biscotti.

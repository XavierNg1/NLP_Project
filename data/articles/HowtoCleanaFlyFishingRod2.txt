 You can use the same cleaner you used for the cork grip or soapy water. Apply it with a soft cloth.
 As you do this, look for dirt at the feet of the rod guides and remove any you find with a cotton swab.
 Nicks and grooves in the guides can cause similar nicks in the line as it rubs over them, possibly causing it to break when you've hooked and are trying to land a fish. You can inspect the rods under bright light with a magnifying glass, or you can run a strip of nylon hosiery through the guide to see if it gets snagged.


In most cases, when 1 guide is nicked, they all are and should be replaced together. In a pinch, you can sand out nicks with 600 or 1000-grit sandpaper.
 Using a polish on the rod blank not only preserves its finish, it also helps keep dirt off the rod. Depending on the kind of polish you use, you can spray it on or apply it with a soft cloth.


You can also simplify the cleaning process by using a spray-on furniture polish containing a cleaning agent instead of using a separate cleaner and polish. This is particularly effective on older fly rods made of bamboo.

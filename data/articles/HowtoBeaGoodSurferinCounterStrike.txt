If there is a big jump in front of you, at the last second, move up the ramp and look up then look back at the next ramp.
When landing onto a ramp, make sure you don't miss, or hit the point in the middle, otherwise you will die.
Also when you land on a ramp make sure you are facing the direction that the ramp is moving in, not backwards surfing.

If you are in a map where there are ramps directly below you, try to land on them (unless it is a map whereas you fall, you go to the jail).
 You actually go FASTER with a Scout. You go 4% faster. With knife you go 250 units/sec but with Scout, 260 units/sec.


If you are stuck, or have slowed to a stop, move to the direction of where there is a surface to get on top of the ramp, then move to the beginning of the ramp to start over.

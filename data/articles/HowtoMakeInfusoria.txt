 Fill your bottles halfway with tap water treated with a water conditioner that removes chlorine. You must use treated tap water as regular tap water kills infusoria. You may also use water sucked out of a planted tank.;
, Place one lettuce leaf in each bottle.
 Place one algae wafer in each bottle, you can also try some liquid fry food.
 Let both cultures sit under bright light for a week or more.
 When the water is cloudy you have bacteria but wait a little longer.
 When one culture starts clearing up or turns pink you will have infusoria. The reason it clears up is because infusoria eats bacteria.
 Pour your good culture into the other culture.
 Feed your fry a few drops at a time so the tank stays clean. Don't overfeed, it will make the water green.

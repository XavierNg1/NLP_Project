 Leave enough space around it, but not so much that you chop off parts of other transfers. This can be done either with a normal pair of scissors, or, for more accurate cutting, one can use a hobby or craft knife to leave as little excess backing paper as possible.;
, You should see the decal or transfer starting to curl up and separate from it's backing paper. That is when you know you should take the decal out of the water.
, This will allow the decal to dry off unnecessary water. Leave it for a minute., Then use a paintbrush to slide the decal off it's oil based backing paper and onto the model. Use the paintbrush lightly to position the decal to where you want it, and in the right orientation.
 Although new modelers can leave it at that, modelers looking for a high quality finish will apply some decal solution onto the decal afterwards. The main manufacturers of the decal solution are Humbrol, Revell, Tamiya and Vallejo. The point of a decal softener is to 'melt' the decal and help it conform to the contours of your model to make the decal look like it has been painted on.This can help the decal mould to panel lines or recesses and even the wingtips and nose of aircrafts. Now, you will have a decal that looks supreme on your next model!

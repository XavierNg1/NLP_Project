 Women who have previously had miscarriages in the second trimester (between weeks 14 and 27) are the most likely to have a cervical insufficiency, so it is important to disclose any prior pregnancy complications or miscarriages to your doctor. Women are not diagnosed with an incompetent cervix until they have suffered one or more late miscarriages. Knowing about this condition in advance will allow your doctor to monitor your condition more closely from the beginning. This can result in earlier detection of a weak cervix, which leads to an increased chance of prolonging the delivery. Any surgery on the cervix also puts women at risk, including a D&C, cervical cone, or LEEP., Although it is possible for an incompetent cervix to be present without any outward symptoms, in some cases there may be warning signs. These would typically occur between 14 and 22 weeks of pregnancy and include backache, discharge or warm liquid felt within the vagina, and pelvic pressure., Although they may be completely unrelated to an incompetent cervix, it is always best to err on the side of caution and let the doctor do a complete exam to rule it out. This might include an ultrasound. Keep in mind that diagnoses of cervical insufficiency are based on a womanâ€™s past medical history of miscarriage during the second trimester. If you do have a cervical insufficiency, you have some medical options.

 If you can, apply moisturizer on your skin to keep itching and dryness away. Invest in good ski-mask or hoodie that will protect your neck, head and face from bitter wind. Pull a knit or fleece cap over your ears and wrap a scarf around your neck and mouth if you don't have a ski mask. Find a lightweight but warm winter jacket for you to wear. These are usually fleece. Gear up under it with a t shirt (long sleeved or short sleeved) and a sweatshirt. Too warm will cause you to sweat after a few seconds of running. Wear leggings and sweatpants, or long underwear and sweatpants.;
, The inside layer can be a thin tight cotton sock, and the outside layer should be warm, luxurious fleece or cotton sock.
 Trail-running shoes work very well. If there is too much snow, try lightweight boots that bend with you but wick off snow and moisture.
, Before jogging, jump up and down or run in place. Stretch out tired muscles. Break a sweat.
 Walk for 5 minutes to loosen your muscles. Then stop to take another stretch if you'd like.
 Avoid snowy clumps or jog very slowly over them. Thick areas of snow are maneuverable if boots are worn, but ice should be carefully and slowly walked over. Safety is number one. Your biggest danger when jogging in cold weather is water or ice on the ground. Slipping and falling onto ice hurts. No matter how you want to burn those calories, do NOT run over these patches! Feel the cool wind on your face and breathe in the fresh air. Keep your breathing even.
 Doesn't jogging in the winter feel good?

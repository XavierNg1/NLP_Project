 Fill a sink with water and get a towel.
 Take care not to get it caught. Do not force it if this happens; lift it out carefully and reapply.
 Brush the wet mane out with the clean toothbrush. This will smooth the pony's mane.
 Rinse out.
 Rinse out thoroughly.
 Again, this will make it smooth.
 Run the towel up and down the mane.


You can also simply squeeze out the excess water with the towel and just leave it to air dry.
 It will smell great now and should be much easier to handle for a wash and conditioning.

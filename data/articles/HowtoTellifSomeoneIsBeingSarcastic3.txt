 If you hear something that seems completely contrary in the context of the conversation, you might be hearing sarcasm.


Example: If you spend most of a conversation talking about how terrible your wife's cooking is, and then end with, "She made the best chicken casserole last night that I just had to bring some for lunch," listeners will probably know that you didn't care for it at all.
Example: If you hear someone say "I'm glad I brought my suntan lotion," on a miserably wet day, they're almost certainly being sarcastic.
 Most sarcastic comments concern the speaker's emotions, offer judgments, or criticize something.For example, if the speaker is describing how to get to the airport, the remark is probably not going to be sarcastic, but if the speaker is talking about how he hates flying, there's a much better chance that the remark will contain sarcasm.

 The smaller the glass, the less you pour. Therefore, having smaller glasses can help curb your alcohol consumption., Try to drink in moderation. For women, that means one drink a day. For men, that means two drinks a day until age 65, then you should switch to a single drink a day., Some people use alcohol to slow down after a day's work. Instead, try finding other ways to wash away the day. For instance, consider doing some exercise, like taking a walk around the park. Another alternative is meditation or deep breathing techniques.Yet another option is spending time with your family and friends or going and doing something you enjoy., Give yourself at least one alcohol-free day a week. Even skipping one day can help you lower your overall intake. Once you skip a single day a week, try moving towards two days a week.This also gives your body the time it needs to repair any damage caused by the alcohol.
 For instance, if you only have one bottle of your favorite alcohol on hand, when it's finished, it takes much more of an effort to go to the store and buy another bottle than if you were to just grab your back-up bottle from the pantry. This can help limit how much you consume.Similarly, try buying other non-alcoholic drinks that you like and have them on hand instead.

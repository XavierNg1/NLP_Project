 Some of them have led to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Remember to be considerate of the following:


Some parents have silenced autistic people, or attempted to control them. A few autistic people have become wary of "autism parents" as a result of this.
They may be used to hearing that their pain isn't real.
Their therapists may have abused them.They may have been told that they are "too high-functioning" to need accommodations or understand "real autism,"or that they are "too low-functioning" to amount to anything.They may have been called strange, needy, or embarrassing by their loved ones.
 Gaslighting means stating that others' experiences aren't real or that their feelings are overreactions,and it has happened to many autistic people.Here are some examples of helpful things to say and hurtful things not to say:



Helpful:

"I'm really sorry to hear that this happened to you. That sounds terrible."
"Thanks for writing about the dangers of ABA therapy. I haven't personally encountered anything like this, but I'll make sure to be careful when choosing therapists for my son."
"Reading this article made me realize that these things do happen to my daughter in therapy, and it's probably why she's been so tearful and anxious lately. I'll start searching for a new therapist for her right away. Thank you for the wake-up call."



Hurtful/Gaslighting:

"Autistic people aren't actually excluded from the autism discourse.""Stop complaining already. Nobody is trying to hurt you.""Autistic people never get abused by their therapists. Stop whining!""Well, this therapy worked for ME" (implying that it must work for everyone, and that the person's horrible experience isn't significant or worth considering)



, If you treat them with compassion and respect, presuming competence and listening to them, they will respond well to you. If you are kind, it's hard to go wrong.

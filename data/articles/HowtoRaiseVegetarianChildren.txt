Before you alter your child's diet in any way, consult with their pediatrician. Your pediatrician can give you specific information such as how many calories they should consume on a daily basis as well as which foods may be best at various ages.;

Even vegetarian children can be notoriously picky eaters. In order to ensure that they consume a well balanced diet you'll need to slowly introduce new foods into their meals. These foods don't need to be exotic, but they do need to be healthy.



Vegetarian children need protein in their diet but the most common protein sources are from animal products. Investigate vegetarian foods such as quinoa, legumes, tofu and other products that are high in protein and incorporate these into their diet. Ensure that each meal is nutritionally well balanced.



It is just as easy to eat poorly on a vegetarian diet as it is on a regular diet. Supermarkets offer plenty of processed vegetarian options from substitute bacon to meatless hamburgers. These products are often filled with chemicals, fillers and empty calories. Teach your children to make wise choices with you at the grocery store.



Get the kids involved with you in the kitchen as you explore new vegetarian recipes. There's no reason to buy the ultra-processed vegetarian hamburger patties when there are myriad black bean or grain patty recipes available. Encouraging the children to help you cook will only foster their interest in staying on a vegetarian diet.



There may come a time in the life of your children when they express a desire to explore a traditional diet including animal products. If this happens explain to them your reason behind being vegetarians but respect their decision to experiment. If you forbid them foods then they may become sneaky and begin lying about their food choices.

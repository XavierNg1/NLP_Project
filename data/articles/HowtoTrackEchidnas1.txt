 Obviously, echidnas aren't strolling down the streets of suburbia. They're shy and quiet animals, and their preferred habitat ranges from rainforest, alpine to semi-desert, away from built-up areas. In general, where there are ants and termites in abundance, echidnas may be present too. There are four known species of echidnas:


The short-beaked echidna (found in Australia and New Guinea); in Australia, they are very adaptable, living from the Simpson Desert through to the Alpine snow.
The Western long-beaked echidna, Sir David's long-beaked echidna and the Eastern long-beaked echidna (all in New Guinea). (No images at present.);
, These are usually posted on the roadside, to warn drivers to slow down and avoid hitting them when crossing the road. This is a good indicator that you're in an area where echidnas might be spotted.

 In strict, traditional terms, a semi-formal dress code requires men to wear black tie (that is, a tuxedo, or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom). The term "semi-formal" arose to distinguish black tie from white tie, which is worn only to the most formal of events. However, it is worth bearing in mind that many people are unaware of the distinctions between "formal", "semi-formal" or "casual" dress codes, and interpret them in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to find out what is meant by a particular dress code before choosing what to wear.
 Traditional semi-formal attire consists of a dress shirt, tuxedo (or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom), a black tie or bowtie, and black shoes. The dress shirt will typically have a winged, detachable collar (though standard collars are becoming more prevalent), and studs will be used instead of buttons. The black shoes can be plain oxfords or, more traditionally, opera pumps.
 Ensure that the cloth of your bowtie, cummerbund and jacket collar match. Wear a well-pressed shirt, wear black socks and never wear black tie during the day.

 College students as a whole are generally more liberal, but that doesn’t mean there are no other conservative college students even on your liberal campus. This can be an opportunity to be a leader and organize like-minded students.


Post flyers around your school or use social media to look for people to join a conservative student group.
If there isn’t a chapter of such a group on your campus, start one! The College Republicans, for example, offer some start-up advice: http://www.crnc.org/chapters/start/


, Broaden your search for fellow conservatives to include your local community, houses of worship, local government, and political parties. As a bonus, getting connected at the local level can give you a real opportunity to affect political change.
 Just because someone identifies as liberal doesn’t mean they don’t have some conservative opinions. In spite of increasing polarization, it doesn’t mean that you will not be able to find some common, middle ground.Take the time to learn about your classmates’ beliefs, and you may be surprised at what you have in common.


Your fellow students will not be as liberal as their professors. Incoming freshmen across all universities are more likely to identify as politically moderate.Therefore, you may find some unexpected allies in class discussions.
 The internet is full of a wide range of political beliefs. If you are unsuccessful in finding people on your campus or in your community to talk to, you will find them online.
 If all else fails, and you do not feel a part of your campus community, look into changing schools. Look for a school that is more in line with your conservative beliefs.


While it is important to stand up for what you believe in, arguing all the time and feeling like you are all alone can be harmful to your mental health. There is no shame in finding a place where you don’t feel like you are constantly fighting a battle!

 Go to the chaos dwarf battlefield and kill cannoneers or dwogres. They drop the Dragon Pickaxe, which is estimated at 12.5 million GP right now. I got a drop very early in. It is extremely rare so I suggest bringing a ring of wealth to help a bit. Also pick up any seeds in the following list: Limpwurt, Watermelon, Ranarr, Torstol. And make sure to grab runes and muddy keys. Make sure to bring prayer armour and a lot of prayer pots as the cannoneers hit up to 38 and the dwogres hit very often.

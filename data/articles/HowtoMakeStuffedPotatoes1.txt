 Use a teaspoon to scoop out the potato flesh about two-thirds of the way down. Always leave enough potato to form a solid base and avoid taking so much out that the sides collapse.


Depending on the recipe, the scooped out flesh is often needed to form part of the stuffing, or it may be discarded if the stuffing is too filling already. If discarding the leftover potato, try to use it in another dish or as leftovers, so as not to waste it.
 Follow the recipe you've chosen to add stuffing in the right order. Most of the time you will be asked to reheat the entire potato so that it cooks completely and the stuffing is also properly cooked.

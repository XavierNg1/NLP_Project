 Track them down on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and through their website. Become a fan of their social media pages and sign up for their mailing lists.


Do a web search for your favorite artists to find all the different social platforms that they have a presence on. This will ensure that you have the most comprehensive coverage of the artist.
 Many bands and artists have a presence online that you can follow via social networking sites like Facebook, or by joining a mailing list at the artist's personal site. People who show their allegiance to their favorite artists are often rewarded with free downloads of new radio singles, demo versions of songs, rarities, and live session recordings.
 Periodically, the bands you like will let you and other fans know about free sample tracks to download. If you're a fan of enough artists, you might be able to get a new track from a great act each week, completely above board.

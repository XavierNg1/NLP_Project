 Get scissors, preferably sewing scissors, and some thread and a needle. The less matched the thread is, the more fun and funky the final product looks! You'll also need stuffing, just enough to puff up your toy, and a bunch of catnip. Pins are useful, but not a necessity. Lay it all out so nothing is hiding anything else, you'll need everything in turn.;
, If there is no such place, trim around edges so they line up nicely. If you have pins, insert them now. If you have a sewing machine, sew around the edges of your fabric. It's great to have a machine, simply because they are fast and the stitches hold strong against the tearing teeth and claws of your cat. If not, or you don't know how to use one, a simple needle and thread will work. If you do use the basic needle and thread, take lots of time making small, even stitches. This will make your toy a little more durable! Leave a two-inch opening somewhere along the seam of your toy. You'll sew this up after you're finished stuffing.
 If you don't care (your cat won't) just leave it the way it is. Before you add any stuffing, put a big pinch of catnip into your toy. Shake it around. Then, add a pinch of stuffing, alternating until all your stuffing is in the toy. Don't hesitate and go easy on the catnip! It's a more the merrier situation here.
 You can use either a machine or hand sewing here.
 When you are done, give the toy to your kitty, and watch them rip and tear and have a good time trying to get at the catnip inside!

 Use a laundry spray to pretreat any stains on the hat. You can also spray this on the headband of the hat. If your hat has colored stitching or graphics, make sure your laundry spray is color-safe.
 If you have a laundry bag that is designed for washing delicate items, such as lingerie, you can use it to wash your hat. Washing your hat in a lingerie or laundry can add a degree of protection from the washing machine.
 After pretreating any stains, choose the appropriate cycle on your washing machine. For most hats, you will want to set it to a delicate or gentle cycle with cool or cold water. Wash the hat in the machine and remove once the cycle ends., You should never place your white hat in the dryer. Instead allow the hat to air dry outside. You can also allow the hat to dry in a well-ventilated area.

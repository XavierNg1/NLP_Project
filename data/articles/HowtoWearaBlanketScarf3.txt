 Chunky knits and soft fleece materials will keep you the warmest. Tie the scarf into your favorite configuration and fluff it up around your neck, right up to your jawbone, to bundle up. If you’re more concerned about keeping your entire top half warm, rather than just your neck, arrange your scarf into the poncho/cape style.
 Plaids and other patterns are great, but you’ll get the most use out of a scarf in a solid, neutral color because it will match a large portion of your winter wardrobe. Good choices are black, white, gray, navy and camel. Since your scarf can be worn often, consider buying a high quality one in a plush material like cashmere or soft wool. It will cost a little more, but you’ll be able to wear it for several seasons.
 If you tend to wear clothing in neutral colors, buy a few scarfs in fun colors and patterns. Add a pop of color to an all-black outfit by looping a bright green blanket scarf around your neck. Choose plaids with neutral, understated color palettes and you can pair them with almost anything in your wardrobe.
 If you have a large piece of fabric or a fuzzy throw at home that you think would work as a scarf, go for it! Any large, square or rectangular piece of material can be repurposed as a blanket scarf. Tie it in your favorite configuration and no one will ever know it’s not meant to be a scarf.

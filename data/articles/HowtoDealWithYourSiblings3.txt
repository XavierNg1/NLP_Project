 Sometimes, when siblings act out, all they want is time and attention. This may be true especially if your sibling is younger than you. They may want you to read to them, play with them, or just spend more time around them., When a sibling is annoying you, simply telling them that you need a break from the annoyance can work, as long as you tell them respectfully. Simply telling them to stop will give you better control of the situation and empower you to stand your ground even more next time. They'll also learn that you will only take so much., Whether it’s studying, hanging out with friends or working on projects, help your sibling to understand that they need to respect your time.
 You don’t need to schedule hour-long blocks of sibling-only time: you can space a couple of 15 minute breaks to spend with them throughout your day. Throw a football, talk to them about their day, cook a meal with them, or play with toys.
 Ask your brother or sister what they’d like to do, and spend a whole day on an adventure.Take them to a museum and explore the exhibits
Go to a sporting event
Go shopping and buy them something nice
Go to the movies and then out to eat

, If talking alone doesn’t keep your sibling at bay, strike a bargain. Giving them something they want can help maintain peace in your house! Consider compromises, such as:


"If you can go a week without bothering me, I'll do your chores for the whole week."
"If you leave me alone while I do my homework, I'll take you to get ice cream later."
"If you stop messing with me, I'll let you have the house to yourself when you hang out with friends on Friday."

, Consider whether you've been rude, irritating or needy towards them lately. It might be possible that you're doing the same things to them that they've done to you. Ask them what bothers them about your behavior, and promise to stop your bad habits if they stop theirs.

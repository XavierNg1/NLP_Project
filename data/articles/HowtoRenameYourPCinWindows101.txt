 In Windows 10, there is a simplified Settings menu that is very easy to understand. Click Start >> Settings to open it. You should see a series of 9 different categories available to you.;
, From the list given, click the System option. You should see a new page with a series of 10 different menu options down the left-hand side of the window. Click About. It should be the very last option on the bottom.
 On the new page, you should see the Rename PC button at the very top. Click this button once and a small box should pop up. This box should contain an input box, with the current PC name listed above it. Enter a name that identifies the PC here.


For instance, if the PC you are renaming is being used to stream media, like movies and music, to other devices in your home, something like Home-Media or Media-Server may be a good name.
Note: Your PC name can contain letters, hyphens, and numbers, but no spaces.
 Once you have entered a new name, click the Next button and wait a moment. If the PC name is approved, then you will be asked if you would like to restart your PC in order for the changes to take effect. Click the Restart now button, and after the PC restarts, it will be renamed.


If you want to skip the restart process, click Restart Later instead.

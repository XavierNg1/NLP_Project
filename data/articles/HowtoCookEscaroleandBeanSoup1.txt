Add the chopped garlic cloves and sauté them for 15 seconds., Continue sautéing it until it wilts. This will take about 2 minutes., How much salt you add is entirely up to you; the more you add, the saltier the soup will be., Bring the soup to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. As soon as the soup starts to boil, reduce the soup to low. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let the soup simmer for 5 minutes. It's ready when the beans are heated all the way through., Give the soup a taste, then add some more salt and pepper, if necessary.

Drizzle 1 teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil over each bowl. Serve the soup while it is hot.This soup tastes great with a piece of crusty bread on the side.

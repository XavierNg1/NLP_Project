 Examples of styles; do multiple small(tight) braids on the side of your head for a half shaved look. Tease to add volume. High ponytails, or messy plaits. (TUTORIALS ON YOUTUBE). Don't let your hair get greasy/smell bad(dry shampoo is a good option for lazy people!), or if you have BO use deodorant! This is a reasonably important part (but not everything) since this is the first thing people will see, and through your looks and style you'll get noticed and people will talk.

Express yourself through your clothes, wear things that suit you and that YOU think are pretty.
Make sure to hydrate your hair and style it in a way that flatters you.
Don't forget: concealer, face powder, eyeliner, mascara, a little blush and some lip gloss -(again, tutorials on youtube). If you know how to apply just a bit of them in a way that's soft, natural and cute.

, You have to take the initiative and go talk to people. Meet tons of people and talk to them often.
,, Act happy and show people you're "in the mood" to make friends that are going to make you even more popular.
 It sounds hard, but do what you want to do. If there's a really hot girl/guy you want to know, talk to them. If you want to experiment with a new table, go for it!

, If you want friends or just people's attention, you have to be kind and considerate.
 A very general rule that you just can't brush aside. Make them feel that you are happy to see them (even if you're not).

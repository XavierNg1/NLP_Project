 Finding support from other women who are going through the physical and mental changes can be comforting. Joining a group for menopausal women can also be therapeutic. In these groups women discuss coping strategies and approaches to dealing with menopausal symptoms that have worked for them.
 If your mood changes seem to go beyond the expected mood swings associated with menopause, talk to your doctor about whether you might benefit from an antidepressant. You might have depression, which is a serious condition, along with your menopausal symptoms., Reduce stress in your life as much as possible. Incorporate yoga or meditation into your daily routine. Avoid overextending yourself socially or at work. If you're having an "off" day, take a personal day from work, if you have the leave time available to use.
 Even if you feel depressed or not like your normal self, it's important to do little things to make yourself feel better. Relaxation massages, facials, and manicures or pedicures are great ways to pamper yourself and give yourself a mental boost.
 Quality sleep is important for mental and physical health. Menopause can be exhausting, so it's especially important to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night.


Practicing good sleep hygiene techniques like turning off electronics and keeping your bedroom dark and cool will help you fall asleep more quickly and get better quality sleep. See this article for tips on how to Fall Asleep when You Can't.

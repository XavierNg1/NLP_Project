 If you haven't already, call your bank with the account that you will use to pay you credit card and set up online banking. Usually, this is as simple as just getting an online username and password; your account information will likely already be online and ready for you.
 You will not be able to access your card balance through your personal banking website, so you'll have to have your balance ready beforehand. Also be sure that you have enough in the account to pay the card before inputting the transaction.
 These will vary between banks, but it may take several days for a transfer to be processed between your bank and your Discover card. Make sure that you allow for a delay by paying your Discover card several days before the payment deadline.


The delay might be longer on holidays or weekends, so check with your bank beforehand to ensure that your payment gets processed on time.
This method also allows you to set payment for a future date if, for example, you need time to move money around in your account.
 Log in to your online banking profile and scan the page for a link that you can use to pay bills. There will likely be a tab or section of your online banking website called "bill pay" or "bill pay center" or something similar. Go to this page and enter your Discover card number as the payment recipient. You may be required to put in other information.
 Double check you've entered the date and your card number correctly. Then, enter your balance or the amount that you wish to pay and submit the payment. Your bank website will likely display an estimated transfer date. Be sure to check your Discover balance on this date by phone or online to see if the transfer has gone through.


Some banks may charge transaction fees for credit card payments. Be sure to check with your bank first before proceeding.

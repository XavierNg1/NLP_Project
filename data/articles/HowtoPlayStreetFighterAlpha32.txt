 The unique feature in Street Fighter Alpha 3 is their '-isms' styles. After choosing a character, there are 3 styles to choose from: X-ism, A-ism, V-ism. Each have their weaknesses and strengths.
,, Watch the video to see V-ism.
 Each character has a set of special moves. A set of input directions and an attack button. You should roll one input into another. For example, Ryu's Hadoken inputs are Down, Down+Forward (diagonal direction), Forward with a Punch button. When executing this motion, you should slide your fingers across the inputs, so as you press Down, you should already be sliding into Down+Forward, then finishing with pressing Forward and Punch at the same time. Refer to these 2 webpages for the move list on all characters: / There are another set of characters that are called Charge characters. Charge characters required to hold a direction for a second then press another direction and an attack buttons. Charge characters are harder to understand and get the timing for, so it is suggested to start off with basic characters, such as Ryu or Ken.
The webpages refer the inputs if the player is on the left side. If the player is on the right side, then the inputs are reversed.
 Alpha counters are attacks made while blocking an attack. To Alpha counter, push forward and the same punch and kick buttons (Low Punch+Kick, Medium P+K, High P+K) when you have the resources to execute it.
 To perform ground and air recoveries depends on what buttons you press and where you were hit, air or ground. To recover on the ground, press 2 kick buttons and/or a direction to roll as soon as you hit the ground. To air recover, press 2 punch buttons and/or a direction to change your direction of recovery.
 Throws are unblockable attacks. To throw your opponents, get close and press either forward or back along with 2 punch buttons (some characters can use 2 kick buttons). To minimize damage while being thrown, press back and 2 punch to land on your feet.

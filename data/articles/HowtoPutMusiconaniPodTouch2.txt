This is the application that looks like a musical note. It should already be installed on your iPod Touch. Just remember that you need to have a strong WiFi connection on your iPod in order to download a song without connecting your iPod to your computer.



You can search through the songs and albums by clicking on the different search options: “Genres,” “Featured,” or “Charts,” all of which you can find at the top of the screen. You can also just browse around iTunes until you find something appealing. You can choose to download just one song, a few random songs, or even an entire album.



You can find the price of the album at the top of the screen to the right of the album. To find the individual songs, just scroll down and click on the price to the left of the song you want.
After you click on the price, it will be replaced by a green box that says “Buy Song” or “Buy Album.”







,,, The speed of the download will depend on the size of the files and the speed of your Internet connection.

 Oily skin becomes more oily often for two reasons: you wash your skin too often, or not enough. Washing your face too often dries out your skin, causing your body to try to compensate by creating more oil. Washing your face infrequently causes old oil to build up. Find a happy medium by washing your face twice daily; when you wake up and before you go to bed is the best time.

, Some soaps dry out your skin too much, causing your face to create more oil while others contain ingredients that clog pores and create more oil as well. Find a facial soap - bar or liquid, it doesn’t matter - that is made especially for oily skin. For extremely oily skin, a detergent facial soap may be considered, but this may be too harsh and dry out your skin too much.
 When you’re washing your face, use hot water; this will break down the oil more effectively than cold or warm water is able to. Hot water also opens your pores, making it easier to clear out the excess oil. When you finish washing your face, splash it with ice cold water. This will close up the pores and tighten the skin, keeping it clear of oil and grime for longer.

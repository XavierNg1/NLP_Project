 Your Mac must have available video connectors to attach a second monitor. Each display will need its own video cable. There are several types of connectors that you may come across, depending on the age of your Mac:


VGA - This is the older analog standard, and almost all monitors support being connected via VGA cables.
DVI - This is a step up from VGA in quality, but is being replaced by HDMI and DisplayPort. A very small number of MacBooks use Mini-DVI, which requires an adapter to connect to a standard DVI cable.
DisplayPort/Thunderbolt - This is one of the more common connectors found on newer Macs. Thunderbolt is there newer version of DisplayPort, and can carry audio signal as well as video. If your monitor only supports HDMI, you'll need a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter.
HDMI - This is the standard for all digital display devices. Almost every new display manufactured in the last few years supports HDMI connections. HDMI can carry audio as well as video signal.
 Most displays will be recognized automatically and you will be prompted to choose your preferred settings. If you choose to mirror, the same image will be shown on both monitors. If you choose extend, then your desktop will stretch across both monitors.


If the display is not recognized, open the Displays preferences and click Detect Displays.
 If youâ€™d like to change the settings yourself, you can do so through the Displays preferences menu. To get there, click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. Open the Displays tool.


To extend the desktop, click Arrangement and then follow the instructions on the screen.
To mirror the image, set both displays to the same resolution. Then click Arrangement and then Mirror Displays.

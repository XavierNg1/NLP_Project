 Choose single, no-spaces, easy-to-remember keyword would you like to use in your website address. Click "Next".
Enter your contact information. This step is optional. Go to the next step.
All you have left is to click next and your website will be built. Make sure that all options are correct.
Together, we are going to create a webpage that looks like this above.
Using the information in your "Welcome to Talkspot email", you can either click on the link, or type your website address into your browser window. This will take you to your new website, so you can see what it looks like to the rest of the world. Yes - your website is live now around the world. This tutorial will give you the training you need to customize it.
When your site was built, one or more web pages was created for you. In addition to your "Home" page, you may see a "Contact" page, a "Gallery" page, and/or other web pages.;
, By the end of this tutorial, you will know what this all means and how to customize your website.

Your website has no idea who you are and is unable to differentiate you from other visitors. Because of this, you cannot make a change. If you could, anyone could!
Look for the copyright notice at the bottom of your home page. It will say "Â© 2008 " and then have your website name.
Click on your website's name.
Once you click on it, you will be shown a "log in" page, which will look similar to the following example.
Type in the email address and password you used when you registered for your new website, and then click the button which says "SIGN IN NOW"

, This is the Administrator Tool Bar. It only appears for you. Visitors to your site do not see it.
Click the "Add a New Page" button from your admin bar.
 They are, in essence: variety. Each one is a little different and will allow you some variety in how your various pages are laid out, while still maintaining a consistent coloring and style. You will also notice each page type is labeled. The labels are just suggestions as to the kinds of web pages you can add to your website. In actuality, you can use the page templates for anything. For now, we're only interested on one - the one that says "Universal or Blog." It is usually the last one.


Click on the small circle at the top of the rectangle on the "Universal or Blog" template.
Click the Green button at the bottom of the page that says "ADD A NEW PAGE USING THIS TEMPLATE

, It will have a large open space for adding content to your page.



You have just added a new webpage to your website. Every webpage on your website has a name, which is used by visitors to your site, to navigate the site. For instance, your home page, has the name "Home". The page we just added has the name "Untitled", which isn't very informative. So, we'll change its name to "Tutorial Page".
In your admin bar, you will see a white box with the word "Untitled". Place your cursor over the word, at the end of the "d", then hold your left button down and move the mouse to the left. This will highlight the word "Untitled". Press the "Delete" button on your keyboard, and then type "Tutorial Page" into this white box. Then, just to the right of the new page name is a green circle with a white checkmark inside of it. This is the submit button. Press it to make your new page name permanent! You will see the change immediately, in both the admin bar, as well as the in the menu on the page!

,


In the bottom left corner of your "admin" bar, you will see a button that says "edit this page". Click on the yellow symbol. This puts you into edit mode, so that you can make changes to the website.
You will notice that your webpage now looks slightly different. There will be some red outlined rectangles around the screen, and some little green plus signs. We call the little green plus signs: "Greenies". And, we call the red outlined boxes "Blobs".
 One of the blobs tells the weather, for example. Another one counts how many times someone has been to a page and then reports the overall number. That one is called the "Page Counter" blob. There is another which works like a word processor and yet others that show images, report news, and more!

,, Think of the greenies as "thumbtacks". If you had a large corkboard and wanted to post something to it, you would find a thumbtack and place your image, phone number, or "what have you", into an open space. The very same concept applies here!

, It does not exist on your site. Although, anywhere you see a greenie, is somewhere you can add something to your website.



This is a list of all the different types of blobs (the list varies depending on the TalkSpot system you chose when you built your site) that you can add to your website. The top left most blob type is different, so we'll ignore it for now. The rest of these boxes each represent a different type of blob, each with a specific function.
Before we add a blob, let's a take a look at TalkSpot's integrated help system
In the top-right corner of the screen, you will see a large red question mark. Wave your mouse cursor over this question mark. You will see some helpful information, describing the page! These helpful tidbits of information are spread throughout the entire system, to help you though any troubled times.
Now, if you look at each of the blob boxes, on the left side, you will see a smaller red question mark. Now, wave your mouse over one of those. Now, try another one! This integrated help system consists of hundreds of red questions marks, spread throughout the system, always ready to help, when you need it. No need to pop up another tool, or leave the page you're on. Just wave your mouse over any question mark and help will be on the way!

After a few seconds, you will now see on your screen something that resembles a word processor, like Microsoft Word.

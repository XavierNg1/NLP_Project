 You may be able to stop your dog’s toilet drinking habit by keeping the doors to the bathroom closed at all times. However, in order for this method to work, all of your family members must be on board.Convene your family members and inform them of the agenda. Let them know why you do not want the dog to drink out of the toilet and what the solution is, i.e., keeping bathroom doors closed at all times.
To help your family members (and guests) remember to close the bathroom door, place a sign on the back of the door.
 Another preventative measure is to keep the toilet lid closed. Tell your family members to close the toilet lid once they are finished using the toilet. Place a sign on the toilet saying, “Please close the lid once you are done,” to help them remember.If you have small children in your family who cannot remember to close the toilet lid or the bathroom door, then you might want to install baby gates in your bathroom’s entry way. This will ensure that your dog will not be able to get to the toilet.
 If your dog is pretty savvy, closing the toilet lid might not prevent it from drinking toilet water. These dogs use their paws or their nose to lift the toilet lid. If this applies to you, then you might want to install a toilet lid lock. These locks will prevent your dog from getting into the toilet bowl.You can find toilet lid locks at your local hardware or home improvement store.

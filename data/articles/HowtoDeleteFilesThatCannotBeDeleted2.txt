Type lsof and then drag the file that you're trying to delete into the terminal window. Press Return to see the program that is currently using the file.
Make note of the COMMAND and PID columns. The COMMAND is the name of the program that is locking the file, and the PID can help you force it to close.
 If the program is open and visible, close it using it's normal closing procedure. If the program refuses to close, you can try force-quitting it.

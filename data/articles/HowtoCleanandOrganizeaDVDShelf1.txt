 Separate them into separate piles as you do so, using genres, directors, favorite actors or whatever system you like. A fairly standard approach would be to separate into kids, family, teens, adult, action, rom-coms, sci-fi, thriller, etc. Or, go alphabetical or by color––whatever will help you and other householders find the DVDs they enjoy watching.


Use this opportunity to get rid of DVDs that you know you won't ever watch again. Your local thrift store or Freecycle will appreciate a donation of unwanted movies and TV shows, or you can try selling them in an online auction.;
, Dust and wipe down the shelves. A feather duster and wet cloth will be useful here. When clean, consider using appropriate polish, unless it's a surface that is not suitable.
 After a while, movie jackets can collect a lot of dust. Removing the dust is not only good for appearance but helps to ensure that the DVDs stay in top condition too.


Wipe with a just-dampened cloth. Take care if wiping paper, as it can tear easily when dampened.
 This time, only put them back in the order you've now organized them into. This will require standing back and deciding what sits next to what and where before physically moving the DVDs back onto the shelves.


For example, if you organized by genre, then action might go on one shelf while fantasy goes on another. Placement will be determined by just how many DVDs in any one pile or genre you own.
It can be helpful to get someone to assist you with putting the DVDs back on the shelves. Depending on how many DVDs you own, this can be quite a workout.

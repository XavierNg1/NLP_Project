 Create a color palette based on the base color of the couch or the bed and stick to it. Choose one main shade and then one to two complementary shades for the accent pillows. This way, the accent pillows look cohesive and fit well with the color of the sofa or the bed.For example, letâ€™s say you have a couch that is white. You choose a main shade like cobalt blue for the larger accent pillows. Then, you choose accent pillows in complementary colors like silver, red, peach, yellow, light green, or light pink to go with the main color palette.
 If you want to have accent pillows with a print on them, go for a balance between prints and solids. Start with one solid pillow, one simple print, and one busy print. Have the largest pillow be the busy print and then have the solid pillow be the next largest. Finish with the simple print in the smallest size.For example, you may have one striped accent pillow, one pillow with a woven design, and one solid pillow. Arrange them so the woven design is the largest, followed by the solid pillow, and then the striped pillow.
For a more simplified look, you can try having one bold print and one solid color for the accent pillows. Then, add or remove a less bold print as you see fit.
 When you are choosing the color scheme of the accent pillows, you should think about how the color scheme will complement the room. If you are adding accent pillows with a print to your sofa, think about how the print complements the color of the walls in the room and the other furnishings. Ideally, you want the color scheme of the accent pillows to reflect the color scheme of the room.You may choose accent pillow colors based on the colors already in the room. This way, you know the accent pillows will complement the space well.
You can try taking fabric swatches of the accent pillows and comparing them to the color of the walls in the room and the color of the other furnishings to ensure it all works together.

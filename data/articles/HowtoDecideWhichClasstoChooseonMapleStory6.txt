Pros:

Have both Brawler which in later levels pays off with pretty cool skills such as Transformation. Also the Gunslingers are fast, can jump shot, and have fire or ice bullets/ammunition when lvl. 70
The job doesn't get as boring like most jobs because at the 1st and 2nd job there are pretty cool skills. This also applies to 3rd and 4th job.
As of 2008, there aren't that many of them yet so you have a better chance to be well known.
Gunslingers eventually get a skill that rivals hurricane (rapid fire)
Gunslingers can get onto the haystack at the Henesy's Market Entrance.
Infighters have one of the best survivability rates in the game because of invincibility frames.


Cons:

Pirate can be viewed as a different version of thief. They both have somewhat a same job style consisting of either short range attacker (aka. Brawler/Bandit), or throwing objects such as stars or shooting bullets (aka. Gunslinger/Assassin).
Also, after a while they can get boring and even annoying. Since the release many Pirates have invaded the HPQ (Henesys Party Quest) spots and now it takes even longer to get into a party. Of course, as of 2010, HPQ is pretty empty.
Ask friends for advice. If any of your friends are already playing, ask them for some advice on the class benefits. It might help you to decide.

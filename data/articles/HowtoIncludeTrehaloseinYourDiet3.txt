 Trehalose is a form of n sugar found in nature, mostly in mushrooms. Companies claim trehalose has half the sweetness of sucrose.Trehalose is used in baked goods, drinks, desserts, jams, cereals, and noodles., Much research has been conducted on trehalose recently. Some potentially important research indicates that trehalose can induce certain processes in cells by blocking a cellular transporter for glucose. This may be particularly useful in treating a condition known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disorder that can result in liver failure or liver cancer. One of the effects of trehalose was to decrease the amount of fats in the liver.Other research indicates that trehalose may be useful in breaking up clumps of proteins that are seen in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)., Trehalose appears to be safe for human consumption in doses up to 50 grams a day. No side effects have been reported.A small portion of people lack the enzyme that metabolizes trehalose. About 10 to 15% of Inuits lack the enzyme.
It has been used in Japan as a supplement for decades with no reported significant adverse effects.
 There are some people who report intolerance to trehalose. If an individual exhibits intolerance, they should stop taking supplements or limit foods containing trehalose. The symptoms are intolerance are minor, and include:Gas

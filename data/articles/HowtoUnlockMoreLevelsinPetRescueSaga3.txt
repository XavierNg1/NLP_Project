 Once you’ve reached the gate for the next locked levels, you will need three tickets to move forward. If you don’t want to ask your Facebook friends and don’t want to play the Mystery Quests, you can always shell out $0.99 to move to the next level.


On the “Unlock more levels!” window, click or tap the “Unlock now!” button.
 Click or tap the US$0.99 button. You will be brought to the in-app purchase function. Be sure you have your credit card handy, and input your payment details when prompted.
 Once your payment is successful, the next levels will be unlocked and you will be brought to the next one. Keep on playing; put aside some money if you will be playing Pet Rescue Saga with real money.

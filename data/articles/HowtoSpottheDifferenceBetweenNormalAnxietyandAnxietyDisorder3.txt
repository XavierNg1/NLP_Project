 To help you decide if you have an anxiety disorder or normal anxiety, you can take a self-assessment. There are many self-assessments online that ask a series of questions to help give you an idea of whether you may have more than normal anxiety.For example, a self-assessment may ask how often you feel anxious or how long your anxiety lasts.
It may ask you if you have experienced a panic or anxiety attack, or if you feel fear and apprehension on most days.
A self-assessment is not a proper diagnosis. A self-assessment is a helpful tool that can help you decide if you should go to the doctor due to your anxiety.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessive thoughts or compulsions that interrupt your daily life.

Phobias are when you have intense, unrealistic fears about something. It may be a place, object, or concept. People with phobias avoid the source of the phobia at any cost.

They may then refer you to a psychologist.When you go to the doctor, tell them all your symptoms, even if you donâ€™t think they are important. Being honest can help you get an accurate description.

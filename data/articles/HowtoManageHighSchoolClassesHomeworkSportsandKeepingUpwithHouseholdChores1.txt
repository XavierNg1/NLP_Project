 The reason you are in high school is to learn, so that has to be your primary focus. If you are balancing a full class load as well as a full practice and game schedule, that can be incredibly tricky. Make sure that both you and your coaches know that your schoolwork comes first.If you know you’re going to be missing class because of an away game, talk to your teachers ahead of time to find out what assignments you’ll be missing.
Plan to turn in your assignments early if you’re going to be missing class, or if that’s not possible, ask your teacher for an extension.;
, Student athletes often miss class for games, and this makes it easier for you to fall behind. If you feel that you’re not fully understanding your class work, hire a tutor to help you keep up with the rest of your classmates.If you can’t afford a tutor, ask your teacher if you can come in for extra help after school.
The more you fall behind, the harder it will be to catch up later. You’ll save yourself a lot of time and stress by staying on top of the work.
 If you have a study hall in school, don’t use that time to goof off with friends. Instead, use it to cross a homework assignment off your list. If your teacher gives you time to work on homework in class, take advantage of that time as well.If you’re traveling on the bus to an away game, use the time on the bus to work on assignments or do your class reading.

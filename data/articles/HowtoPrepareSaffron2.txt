 If you’re making a recipe that calls for some type of liquid, such as chicken stock, milk, or white wine, pour enough of the liquid to cover the amount of saffron that you’re using into a pan or pot. Next, heat the liquid on the stove until it’s hot. Be careful not to bring it to a boil, though.If your dish doesn’t necessarily call for liquid, you can use plain water.
 The most effective way to draw the flavor and color out of saffron is to submerge them in a hot liquid, so you want to soak them thoroughly before adding them to your recipe. In most cases, letting it sit in the liquid for 10 to 20 minutes is enough to prepare the saffron.Soaking the saffron before adding it to your recipe is the best way to ensure that it’s distributed evenly throughout the dish.
You can usually tell that your saffron has soaked long enough when the liquid starts to give off a strong aroma.
You can crush the threads by hand or with a mortar and pestle before soaking them, but using the whole strands can add an attractive look to your dish.
If you really want a robust flavor and color from your saffron, try soak the threads in room temperature water overnight. Then you can add them to warm chicken stock, milk, wine, or another liquid before adding them to your dish.
 When it comes time to add the saffron to your recipe, you don’t just want to remove the threads from the liquid and mix them in. Instead, add all of the liquid, so you get a deeper, richer flavor that pervades the entire dish. Typically, the best time to add the saffron liquid is near the end of cooking, but follow the instructions in your recipe.You can strain the threads and add only the liquid to your dish if you prefer, but that’s usually only necessary if you’re making a recipe that should have a clear appearance, such as a jelly.
If you plan to leave the threads in your recipe, there's no need to cut or chop them. The intact threads can add texture and visual interest to your dish.

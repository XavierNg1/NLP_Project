 You'll need a circular saw, a number of basic L brackets, 3" decking screws, some MDF or plywood, and then several cuts of lumber. For lumber, you'll need:


Two pieces of 85" 2x4
Five pieces of 67" 2x4
Eight pieces of 19 3/8 2x4
Two pieces of 75" 2x12
Four pieces of 57" 2x12

, Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 75" 2x12s and two of the 57" 2x12s into a 60"x75" box.
 Slide in the remaining 57" 2x12s, space the box into thirds, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place. Set aside the completed base.
 Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 85" 2x4s and two of the 67" 2x4s into a 70"x85" box.
 Slide in the remaining 67" 2x4s, space the box into 4 sections, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place.
 You will now add the 19 3/8" 2x4s between the bracers, two to a section. Space them evenly but stagger them, so that the leftmost and second right most sections have the supports at the same level and the rightmost and second leftmost have the supports at the same level. Attach these with decking screws as well.
 Reinforce the inside corners of both the base and platform with L brackets. You can also add L brackets around some of the other interior joints as well for added strength.
 Trace and cut plywood to fit the surface of the platform. This will likely take two pieces of plywood to cover. Attach the plywood with decking screws to the inside bracers, such that the screws won't show on the exposed platform.
 Sand the wood and then paint or stain the bed to the desired color.
 Arrange the platform on top of the base in the final location. You can attach the platform to the base with a few strategically placed L brackets if you want to. Just top with your mattress of full or queen size mattress!

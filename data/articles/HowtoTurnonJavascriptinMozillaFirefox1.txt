 Firefox wants to make sure you know that all the settings in the about:config menu are for advanced users only. Changing settings you aren't familiar with could cause Firefox to become unresponsive, so think twice before changing anything.
 All of the settings you can change are displayed alphabetically. Each setting has a row under the headers Preference Name, Status, Type, and Value. Typing a specific term in the search bar clears away all other entries that don't match your target.


Another way to search is by clicking on any of the settings under the Preference Name once, and pressing the j key. You'll automatically jump down the page to the first setting that begins with "j." Continue typing javascript to move further down the list to the option you want.
 JavaScript should be enabled by default. There's no need to do anything if Value is already set to true.
 Refreshing the configurations menu causes all of your changes to take effect. The Refresh button resembles an arrow curled into a circle, and should be located to the right of your address bar.


You can also press F5 on PC and Mac to refresh your browser.

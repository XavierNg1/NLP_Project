 Once you have narrowed down your choices based on time of year, length of trip, traveling companions, important features, and price range, you can compare your choices side by side. Access the official websites of the cruises that you are interested in. Make a list of the pros and cons of each one.
 The same way we use reviews when deciding on a hotel, restaurant, or even a movie, reading reviews of cruises can offer some valuable insight. See what others who have taken the cruise you might be interested in have to say about their experience. Use reviews as an additional insight, not as the ultimate source.


Websites like Cruiseline and Cruise Critic are very useful when searching for cruise reviews. You can search reviews by cruise line or by ship.
 It is always nice to have some recommendations from people with whom you have a personal relationship. Experience often brings valuable tips and lessons. Asking those around you with cruise experience might save you a lot of time and the risk of choosing the wrong cruise.

 You don't want your lips hard or chapped and dry. Use an exfoliating lip scrub or a toothbrush dipped in petroleum jelly to remove any dead, flaky skin and leave your lips smooth and soft.


Make your own lip scrub by combining a pinch of brown sugar and a little honey, olive oil, or coconut oil.Gently rub the exfoliant or toothbrush over your lips using small, circular motions. Don't be too rough.Wipe your lips with a washcloth to remove all the petroleum jelly or lip exfoliator.;
, Instead of a lip gloss or chapstick, which can seal the skin on your lips and keep moisture out, look specifically for a lip moisturizer and apply it right after showering.Look for a lip moisturizer with vitamins A, B, and E which moisturize and help with absorbency.Use a few drops of vitamin-rich sesame seed oil if you are in a pinch., If you're going to use a real piece of candy and not a flavored lip gloss, the minty flavor of the toothpaste may interfere with the sweetness of the candy and create a bad taste. You definitely want to start with a clean mouth, however, so make sure you brush your teeth 30-60 minutes before you think you're going to kiss your partner, so the mint flavor has time to fade.


If you're planning to flavor your lips only, try to brush your teeth right before you meet your partner.

 Lightly crush 6 whole green cardamom pods and put them in a small saucepan with 2 whole cloves and 1 cinnamon stick. Heat the saucepan with the spices over medium-high heat. Toast the spices for 1 to 2 minutes or until you can smell them.Choose cardamom pods that aren't dry, brown, or cracked open.
 Take a 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) piece of fresh ginger and slice it into thin pieces. Add the ginger to the saucepan and pour in 2 1‚ÅÑ2 cups (590 ml) of water. Turn the heat to high so the spiced water boils. Reduce the heat to medium-low so the water simmers. Simmer the spiced water for 2 minutes.Simmering the spices will release some of their flavor. You'll continue to simmer the spices once you add the tea, so avoid boiling them. This will prevent a bitter flavor from developing.
 Open a can of sweetened condensed milk and measure out 1/2 cup (150 g). Scoop this into the spiced water and stir it to help the milk dissolve. Continue to simmer the mixture for 2 minutes. Add 3 black tea bags and simmer the tea for 1 minute. Carefully take the saucepan off of the heat.Avoid putting the sweetened condensed milk and black tea into the pot at the same time. It's best to dissolve the milk while preventing the tea from over steeping.
 Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cardamom and finish steeping the tea for 2 to 3 more minutes. Set a fine sieve over a measuring jug or tea pot and carefully pour the spiced Omani tea through the sieve. Serve the tea while it's hot.You can discard the solids that are left in the sieve.

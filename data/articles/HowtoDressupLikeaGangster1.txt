 Gangsters in the 20s and 30s dressed up rather elegantly. A typical outfit included an all-black, grey, or pinstriped suit with a tie. Keep the color scheme simple; stick to black, white, grey or brown.


If you don't have a suit jacket, then wear a vest and roll up the sleeves of your collared shirt.
Either wear a white collared shirt with a black tie or a black collared shirt with a white tie.
Wear a pair of black or brown dress shoes.;
, Find a black, white, gray, or pinstriped fedora. A popular look among traditional mobsters was to wear a black hat with white trim, or white hat with gray trim.


Be sure that the hat matches your suit. Again, stick with neutral colors like black, white, grey, and brown.
 Toy guns can be purchased from Halloween stores or toy stores. Consider buying a squirt gun and spray-painting it black.
 In old films, criminals, gangsters, and other "bad guys" were often portrayed smoking cigars. While you certainly don't have to smoke it, carrying a cigar around will add an authentic element to your costume.

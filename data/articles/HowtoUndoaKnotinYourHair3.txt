 Gently gathering your hair in a braid or pineapple updo will keep you from sleeping directly on top of it, decreasing friction. You can also try a sleeping bonnet, satin or silk pillow case or a hair net to keep your hair tangle-free at night.








Use soft hair ties, not rubber bands, to pull your hair back.
Remove any bobby pins you may have used to style your hair.
 Many women can't stand to give up even a centimeter of their hard-earned hair length, but avoiding haircuts leads to dead, dry hair and split ends that cause tangles.At the very least, you should get your hair trimmed every three months, and tell your stylist you want the dead hair removed.








Split ends can travel up the hair shaft, damaging living hair and causing major tangles.As much as you may love every inch of your hair, dry, dead hair really doesn't look very good. Remember that your hair will continue to grow, and it will look healthier and stronger if you get a minor cut every season., Don't pile your hair on top of your head and scrub like crazy. Picture the way women shampoo their hair in commercials: focus on the scalp, massaging with your fingers, and allow the product to rinse through your hair., Very long hair is prone to tangling, and can easily snag on the fine chain of a delicate necklace or an elaborate collar on your blouse. If you don't want to give up your necklaces, make sure the chain stays under the collar of your shirt, and try not to wear more than one.Check necklaces and collars often to make sure they aren't catching your hair and forming a knot.

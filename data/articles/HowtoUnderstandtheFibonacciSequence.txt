, It's that simple!
Few examples:

The 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 3rd and 2nd numbers.
i.e. 3 = 2 + 1






The 7th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 6th and 5th numbers.
i.e. 13 = 8 + 5






The 11th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 10th and 9th numbers.
i.e. 89 = 55 + 34







, For example, consider generating first 6 terms of the Fibonacci Sequence. The steps are as follows:

Write the first two terms -> 1, 1






Generate the 3rd term by adding the 2nd and 1st terms
i.e. 3rd term = 1 + 1 = 2






Generate the 4th term by adding the 3rd and 2nd terms
i.e. 4th term = 2 + 1 = 3






Generate the 5th term by adding the 4th and 3rd terms
i.e. 5th term = 3 + 2 = 5






Generate the 6th term by adding the 5th and 4th terms
i.e. 6th term = 5 + 3 = 8

 A Release of Liability is exactly what it sounds like. It releases one person from the liability of the mortgage and hence, removes that person’s name from the mortgage.The person staying on the mortgage will need to demonstrate that he or she can pay the monthly payment.
 Typically, items like pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements are submitted to show a person’s financial situation. The lender will also check the credit history and score for the person staying on the mortgage.
 Read the Release of Liability thoroughly to ensure it releases you from liability for the mortgage. It is advisable to get an attorney to review the document. An attorney can also prepare and file property records transferring the property from you to the other person.

, This is the main pipe coming out of the floor that your toilet will eventually sit on top of.
 Place the flange over the pipe to determine if it will fit in the hole up to the collar. If the fit is too tight, you will need to use a jigsaw to cut the floor around the pipe.
 Remove the soil pipe from the hole, and use a handsaw to cut the pipe to the exact measurement of the gap. File the cut end of the pipe with a PVC file or utility knife.

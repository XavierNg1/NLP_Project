 The enclosure must be waterproof, escape-proof, and non-toxic. A 20 gallon (75.7 L) 'long' aquarium will happily hold four of these frogs, but remember that these frogs can jump quite high and any loose, non-locking lids will need to be taped or weighed down.;
, The temperature in the tank should not drop below 45°F (8°C) and not go above 77°F (25°C). Temperatures are preferred around the middle of this spectrum. These frogs do not need special UVB lighting, but a photo cycle, or night and day, should be provided using regular lighting.
 Remember to change this water often, and even more often if you do not provide a filter. These frogs do not like currents so a strong filter should be avoided. Provide several resting places in the water and a ramp up to the land area of the tank.
 The land area should be well-drained and kept moist. Use a substrate like peat or rain forest bedding to provide a moist land area for your frogs. Remember that frogs like hiding places, so cover the land with small rocks, leaf litter, and logs.
 Provide them with insects dusted with a calcium and D3 mixture. Suitable foods for young frogs include crickets and flies, and should be available at all times. Older frogs have a habit of eating anything they can fit in their mouths, and so should be fed about 15% of their body size in food three times a week. Remember to remove all dead food from the tank!

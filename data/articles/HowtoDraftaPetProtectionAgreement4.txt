 While you are not required to provide funds in a pet care agreement, by doing so you can make sure that you pet is well cared for during the remainder of its life. You can provide funds from a variety of sources including:


A fixed amount or percentage from an insurance policy.
A portion of a bank account.
A portion of a retirement account.
From the sale of other assets in your estate., When calculating the amount of money to set aside for the care of your pet, consider the following:


The current cost of caring for your pet and the animal’s life expectancy.
That pets often become more expensive as they age and may need more costly medical care.
The number of pets included in the pet care agreement or pet trust.
Whether funds will be used to compensate the guardian and if so, the amount you want to set aside for the guardian.
The cost of transportation, if any, for the pets to get to the new guardian., A distribution representative is a person legally responsible for managing the funds that you set aside for your pet. They would make distributions to the pet’s guardian and once the pet is deceased, they would follow your wishes as to what to do with the remainder of your funds. In the case of a trust, this persons is referred to as the trustee.While you could choose the pet guardian as the distribution representative/trustee, it may be better to have a third party in charge of the funds. A distribution representative/trustee can check to make sure that the funds are being used for your pet and not some other purpose., For both a trust and a care agreement, you should choose a beneficiary to receive any funds left after your pet dies.


Pet owners are discouraged from leaving the remaining funds to the guardian. A guardian with a financial stake in your pet’s death may not provide the best care.
You could leave your funds to a charity that works to protect the well-being of animals.

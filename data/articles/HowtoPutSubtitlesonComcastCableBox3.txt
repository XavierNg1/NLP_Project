 Most modern TVs have built-in subtitle readers that are easily accessed. While you should check your owner's manual for the exact path, most people can find these settings through the following menus:


Hit "menu" or "settings" on your TV remote.
Search for "Subtitles" in one of the following general locations.

"Closed Captioning," "Subtitles," "Titling"
"Playback" or "Playback Options."
"Language," or "Language Settings."


Use your remote to either turn on or "Enable" your subtitles.
 This is not a common problem, but it does affect certain users who are baffled why the subtitles are "on" but don't appear. Make sure your Comcast cable box is attached with either an HDMI cable or composite video -- the red, white, and yellow set of connected wires.
 With a CableCARDâ„¢ device (such as a TiVo), you will need to use the CableCARD device to turn closed captioning on or off. Refer to the retail device's user manual for enabling/disabling instructions.

 It may take 2 to 7 weeks for the root system to form. The herbs will begin to produce new leaves when the root system is formed. If you lift up on the stem and the soil comes with the plant, it is ready to be transplanted. Roots also may be visible in the drainage holes.
 Water the herbs daily, or even several times a day, after transplanting. Keep the soil around the plant moist.
 The plant may go into shock when transplanted. Lightly apply a one-quarter diluted 20-20-20 fertilizer to the herb. Fertilize less than the recommended amount for the specific herb, and gradually work up to full amount.

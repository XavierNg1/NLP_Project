 Unconditional love is best exemplified by what we usually feel for our children. There is, perhaps, nothing more wonderful than the love we have for them, especially when they are babies. We expect nothing in return, and delight in just seeing them smile. As they grow, they'll challenge us, make us proud, disappoint us, grow, and make mistakes, but we love them regardless.


Another example of unconditional love is how your dog loves you, engendering the statement, "I strive to be the person my dog thinks I am."

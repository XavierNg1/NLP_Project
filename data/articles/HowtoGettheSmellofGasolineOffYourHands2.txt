 Pour a few drops of vanilla extract into about half a cup (118 mL) of water. You can add a few more drops of the vanilla extract if you don’t smell it in the water., With the mixture on your hands, begin to rub your hands together. Continue for 30 seconds to one minute. You can stop rubbing when you no longer smell gasoline on your hands., Once the smell has been removed, wash your hands with soap and water. You don’t have to scrub them very hard since the smell of vanilla extract is usually pleasant. Dry your hands with a towel when you’re finished washing them.

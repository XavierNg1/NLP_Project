 When you break your femur, the pain will be sharp, pulsating and excruciating. When the femur is broken, the pain receptors send pain signals to the brain and pain is perceived. This is not the type of pain you might not notice, it is extreme and intense.


Especially consider pain that intensifies upon weight bearing activity and exercise and subsides with proper rest.;
, If inflammation or bruising is present at the site of pain, this indicates the possibility of a broken bone.


Inflammation results from the bodyâ€™s immune system releasing inflammatory chemicals in order to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens and begin the healing process. Bruises appear when the blood vessels break because of the force or blow to the skin. Blood leaks out of the blood vessels and results in a red, black or purple skin mark.
 The length could be shorter compared to the other leg, or feature abnormal twisting. The reason why the length of the leg is shorter than the other after the injury is that the injured femur might be out of its bone socket, also called the acetabulum.
 Failure to put any weight on the injured leg can indicate a break. If putting weight on the injured leg leads to sharp, pulsating and excruciating pain, the leg is probably broken.
 This can occur if the broken femur punctured through the skin, also called as an open fracture. During an open fracture, blood vessels are exposed out of the skin. Blood will drain from these areas in large amounts, becoming obvious very quickly.
 When the muscle fibers in the femoral area stretch or tear due to a break, these muscle fibers contract and tighten. This contraction results in insufficient blood flow to the affected area. Reduced blood flow can lead to spasms and a funny feeling or numbness in the affected area.

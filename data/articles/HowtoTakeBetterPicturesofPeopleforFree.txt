 On people, this is usually just their face and part of their upper body. Additional elements will cause more distractions. If their shoes are really that great and important, take a separate picture of them alone.;
, The more the camera is "zoomed in", the more flattering their faces become. Also, the blurrier the background becomes which draws attention to the subjects. The goal is to zoom in a lot, and stand back far enough so that step 1 is still accomplished.
 Unless there is a specific mood or message to the picture, eye level pictures are generally the most pleasing.
 By keeping the sun out of the subjects' eyes, it will minimize their squinting. Eyes are very attractive elements in portraiture.
 Scenes with too much light will show both very bright and very dark areas in the same picture. This often leads to distracting elements and loss of detail on subjects. To remedy, try finding shady areas (trees, umbrellas, etc). Poorly lit areas can cause the background to disappear from pictures and possibly show the subjects moving with blur. To remedy, try to find bright backgrounds while keeping the subjects poorly lit (the flash should light and freeze the subjects well)

, Many have the misconception that flash should only be used for night photography. If possible, set the flash to "slow sync" or "fill light" mode. Flash in the daytime lifts unattractive dark shadows that maybe caused by other sources of light such as the sun. Flash in "slow sync" or "fill light" mode at night will help the background (ambient lighting) show up in the picture while still seeing the subjects.
 A fake smile is easily seen through, so tell a joke, story or recall a memory to stir the appropriate emotion on their faces. There is nothing wrong with taking a picture when they are laughing or even crying as long as it looks natural. In fact, the results can be surprising this way.

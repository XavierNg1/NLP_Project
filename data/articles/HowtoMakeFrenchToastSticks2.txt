, This will help keep the French toast sticks from sticking. Keep the cooking spray on hand; you will be using it later.
 Put the butter into a small, microwave-safe dish. Microwave the butter for about 1 minute, or until it melts. Take it out of the microwave, and set it aside so that it can cool down.


If you don't have a microwave, melt the butter in a small saucepan over the stove.
 Try to use thicker toast slices, as they will give you sturdier French toast sticks. Many people also find that stale, day-old toast works better for this recipe than fresh toast.
 Use a shallow dish, such as a casserole dish. This way, you won't have to worry about dropping and losing any bread sticks in the mixture.


If you are allergic to dairy, try coconut milk or almond milk instead.
If you are vegan, use ½ cup (120 milliliters) of unsweetened almond milk and ½ tablespoon of flax meal (ground flax seeds).
 Rotate it until it is evenly coated. Flick off any excess egg mixture.


If you don't like to get dirty, you can spear the bread stick onto a fork instead.
 Continue dipping the egg sticks into the egg mixture, and placing them on the baking sheet, until you have none left. Make sure that you leave some space between each stick.
 Place the baking sheet into the oven, and let them bake partway.
 After 8 to 9 minutes, pull the baking sheet out of the oven. Spray the tops of the sticks with some cooking spray. Use a fork or spatula to flip the sticks over.
 This will allow the other side to bake and turn crispy as well.
 If you plan on dipping them into maple syrup, you can place them inside a cup or bowl instead.
 Serve them as they are now, or sprinkle some icing/confectioner's sugar on top. You can also pour some maple syrup into a small cup for dipping the sticks into.

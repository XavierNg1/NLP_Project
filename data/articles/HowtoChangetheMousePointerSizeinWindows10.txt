 If you click into the text box (if displayed as a text box and not just as an icon), you can have Cortana look for what is on your computer.
 A menu - Cortana's main window - will pop up on the left side of your screen. Tell Cortana you are not interested in her services. Then confirm that you are not interested so that Cortana hides until you need her again.

If you want Cortana in your life, you can keep Cortana, but these instructions presume Cortana goes away.
 Type "ease of access mouse" in the "Search Windows" text box or the "Ask me anything" Cortana box.
, The mouse pointer size will be the top-most line of this window. By default, Windows selects the smallest mouse cursor possible and the left-most default text cursor so as not to burden most of it's users. You will see the size change immediately. When you're happy or at least tolerant of the pointer size, close the settings window and proceed to the next adaptation to Windows 10 life.
 You can always go back to the last used or default sizes of the three sizes Microsoft provides you with. Move the cursor around the screen, or hover over an open text box or in a software program that allows you to type to see if this size is preferable for you to use.

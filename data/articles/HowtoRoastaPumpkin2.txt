 This will save you time while preparing the food.
 Cut the pumpkin into two inch cubes using a sharp chef's knife. In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, salt, pepper, and cumin.
 Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray or olive oil. Alternatively, cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Place the pieces of pumpkin onto the baking sheet. Try to arrange them so that they are not touching one another. Use a spoon to drizzle the olive oil mixture onto the pumpkin, or use a basting brush to coat each piece.
 The pumpkin should be soft and lightly browned at the edges when it is done.
 Pumpkin can be served warm as a side-dish, or can be stored in the refrigerator and served cold with a salad. Enjoy!

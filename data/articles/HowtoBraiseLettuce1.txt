 First take sweet romaine lettuce and discard any wilting or unhealthy looking leaves. Using a sharp knife, cut Â½ of stem off the lettuce. Then wash the lettuce heads with warm water. If you see any visible dirt between the leaves of the lettuce, remove it by gently scrubbing. When you are done washing the lettuce, pat it dry with a paper towel., Take a deep lidded pan and put it on the stovetop. Allow the pan to heat up, then drop the butter into the pan. Swirl the butter around the pan by taking the handle of the pan and tilting it so that the butter slides around the bottom., Take the lettuce heads and drop them into the pan. Roll the lettuce around in the butter by using a spoon or spatula to turn and move them around the bottom of the pan. Season them with a pinch of salt and pepper., The lettuce heads will start to braise after getting coated in the butter. When you notice that they are shedding their water, put the top on the pan and turn the heat to low. Let the lettuce heads cook for 20 minutes, turning them occasionally., After 20 minutes, take the lettuce heads out of the pan and put them on a heated dish to stay warm. They should be cooked well and slightly crispy. Then turn up the heat under the serving pan that contains the butter and the lettuce juices. Heat the liquid until it has reduced to the consistency of a sauce., Take the pan of juices and pour them over the lettuce heads on the serving plate. Make sure to pour the sauce directly over the lettuce so that it can absorb the juices. Then serve the lettuce while it is still warm.

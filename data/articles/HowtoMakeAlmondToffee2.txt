 Two different ways to melt the chocolate include:

Place the chocolate inside a glass bowl and microwave. Heat in increments of 30 seconds, stirring until the chocolate is almost completely melted. Once the chocolate is totally soft and pliable, stir well until it becomes smooth.






Use a double boiler to melt the chocolate. Allow the water to come to a simmer and place chocolate in upper pan. Stir constantly until the chocolate has melted and is smooth. Remove from heat.

 Keeping your lips moisturized with a good lip balm will help prevent peeling. Go for a lip balm that contains nourishing ingredients like almond oil, Shea butter, coconut oil, or beeswax. Apply a moisturizing lip balm throughout the day and right before bed., Your lip balm could be doing more harm than good for your peeling lips. Ingredients like phenol, menthol, alcohol, salicylic acid, and fragrances can irritate your lips and cause them to peel. For example, cinnamon is a common culprit that can irritate your lips., Scrubs containing irritating ingredients like salt can inflame your peeling lips. Instead of exfoliating your lips with a potentially irritating scrub, try making a sugar-based lip scrub at home to gently slough off peeling skin.Combine one teaspoon brown sugar, one teaspoon white sugar, one teaspoon honey, and 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
Mix the ingredients together and then massage on your lips for about 20 seconds.
 Matte lipsticks are notorious for drying out your lips. They can cause irritation that leads to chapped or peeling lips. Avoid matte lipsticks and instead opt for lipsticks that contain conditioners like shea butter or macadamia oil.

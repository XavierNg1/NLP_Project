  This step is extremely important, because you can't fix a problem if you don't know it's there.  Some signs of tension are:


You or a sibling are raising your voice.
You or a sibling are saying rude things, or becoming frustrated.
You feel your heart start to beat faster, you breathe more quickly, or you start to sweat or shake.
You find that you can't think clearly or are jumping to conclusions.
You or a sibling are becoming upset because of small things that normally wouldn't be a problem.
  You can:


Breathe deeply.
Think about something else.
Close your eyes and silently count to three.
Repeat to yourself, "I will not fight or argue with my siblings.  I promised myself that I wouldn't, so I won't."

,


Speak in calm, even tones.  Don't talk to fast or too loudly, and don't project anger into your tone.
Be careful not to interrupt your sibling.
Think about what your sibling is saying, and try to see it from their point of view.
Make sure there is a pause between what you are saying and what your sibling is saying.
If you find yourself getting too upset, or things don't seem to be calming down, excuse yourself and leave.  Don't run or stomp away, this will make it worse.  Instead, walk calmly and quickly (but not too fast), away from the tension.  If you are in a situation where you cannot leave (driving in a car, for example), explain that you need to stop talking for a little while, and then focus on something else.

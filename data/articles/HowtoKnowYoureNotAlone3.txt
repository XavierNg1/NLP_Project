 It's alright to let someone know how you're feeling. Opening yourself up to someone can help you realize that you're not alone. Remember that you are not alone in feeling alone; we’ve all been there.


When you feel that surge of loneliness or doubt coming on, call upon someone you can trust. It might be your sister, or your best friend, or a teacher, or a professional counselor. Choose someone who is a good listener. Getting your feelings out in the open will make it easier for you to understand and address them effectively.Don’t be afraid to tell the person what you’re feeling. Or, simply ask them “Have you ever felt all alone in the world?” You might start a good and helpful conversation that way.
 If you simply cannot shake your feelings of loneliness, no matter how many discussions and distractions you try, it may be time to seek out the help of a trained professional. Talk to your doctor, or seek out a licensed therapist or counselor. Never feel ashamed. Remember, these people have careers because there are so many people out there who need help dealing with feeling alone.Support groups can also be beneficial. Listening to and interacting with others who struggle with loneliness will help prove that you are in fact not alone, and also might offer you some new coping strategies. You might get a few new friends as part of the bargain as well.
 If your loneliness ever gets to the point where you feel like the only way to end your pain is to end you life, seek immediate help. Don’t ignore these thoughts as just a “one time thing.” Take them as a sign that you need help dealing with your feelings right away.In the U.S., call 1-800-273-TALK.

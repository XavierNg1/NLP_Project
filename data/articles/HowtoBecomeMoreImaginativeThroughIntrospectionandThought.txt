 Say you have decided to apply your imagination to writing. Do what many great writers do: research the topic of the material being written, and write drafts. The key to this method of unlocking your imagination is to think. The more you think of something, and the more ways you approach a subject, the greater your wisdom grows in that area.

 Do you have a friend who speaks random, ridiculous phrases that seem to defy logic and rational thought? Your friend may be more imaginative than you.

 Writer's block is a notorious nemesis to authors, and a creative slump strikes the greatest of artists. This is a form of procrastination, the idea that something could be done later, or that something can't be done because you "don't know the right way to do it." Try a new approach: deliberately apply the above step to the situation. Is your book character not progressing? Introduce a random element, such as a new friend, a death or possibly an alien invasion, and visualize your character's reaction.

 For instance, if your book is about a girl who goes on an adventure in the jungle, you'd probably want to put a picture of the jungle! Make sure it will be a good size and quality, and if you are planning to publish this cover, that you get your image from a public domain site (or your own camera!).;
, Go to a website called www.picmonkey.com to begin designing your cover. Click on Design to start. Click on the butterfly icon (labeled 'overlays') and then 'your own' to select your cover image.
 This can include clicking the magic wand button and adding an effect, resizing your photo or adding more images and overlays.
 Click on the 'T' icon to see your text options. If you see one you like, click it and then click 'add text'. If there is not one you like, save the title for later and add one using your own computer program.
 A prime choice for most novel covers is 600 by 800, but you can choose whatever size will fit your needs.
 If you still haven't added a title, now would be a good time to do it. But first, save your cover. It is helpful to save before adding the text, so that if something goes wrong you won't have to start over.
 You don't want to lose it, do you?

, You need to take enough insulation off to expose the wire completely.


Some crimp tools have a built-in insulation stripper. You can place the coated wire into the stripping hole and pull gently. This should expose the wire for crimping.
 Most crimp tools have 2 different crimp sizes on the tool.


The bigger crimp is for the insulation channel. The smaller crimp is for the stripped wire.



While squeezing the crimping tool, the tabs will bend inward.
Apply light pressure to the crimping tool. The crimp pin will slide easily into the groove holding it in place.
The wire's stripped end goes into the hole created by the crimp and insulation channel.
Make certain the insulation and wire channels cover the appropriate insulation and wire.



Apply firm pressure to the crimp tool. This process will bend the crimp tabs inward, allowing them to bite into the wire and insulation.

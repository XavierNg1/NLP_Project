 You can find these numbers printed on the SIM, on the back of the phone, and on the phone's packaging.
 The phone will need to be compatible with Sprint SIM cards, and unlocked if it was previously used with another carrier. Not all unlocked devices are compatible with Sprint SIM cards.


Sprint requires a specialized SIM for each different device that supports a SIM card. Make sure that you get your replacement SIM directly from Sprint so that you get the correct one.
SIM cards are typically inserted into a tray along the side of the phone, or under the battery if the battery is removable.
 You'll be taken through an automated menu until you are able to talk with a live support agent.
 As long as your device is eligible and unlocked, the Sprint representative should be able to activate your SIM.


Sprint will only activate SIM cards for the following non-Sprint devices: iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s (Verizon only), iPhone 5c (Verizon only), Motorola X Pure Edition (16, 32 & 64 GB – all colors), Nexus 6 (32 & 64 GB – black and white), Nexus 5 (16 & 32 GB – black, white and red), Nexus 5X (all versions), Nexus 6P (all versions), HTC One A9 (Sprint version only), iPad Air 2, iPad Air (Verizon only), iPad mini 4, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2 (Verizon only) and iPad Pro., After the agent activates your SIM, power down your phone and restart it after a few minutes. You should see that it is activated.

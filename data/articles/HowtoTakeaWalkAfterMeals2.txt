 If walking around the same loop is becoming boring, you might plan multiple routes to take for your walk. You can take a new route every week, or you can have a specific morning route that differs from your evening route.
 A pedometer or fitness tracker can help you measure how far you have walked. By keeping track of your progress, you may be more motivated to walk after every meal. Tracking your steps can even encourage you to beat old records or to compete with your friends.These pedometers may clip to your pants, or they might be worn around your wrist.
 Involving your whole body as you walk can burn more calories. Try pumping or swinging your arms as you walk. The more vigorously you do it, the more calories you will burn., If it is raining, you may not want to walk outside, but you can still do an activity after your meal. Walk a few circles around your house or office building. Try doing another low-intensity activity, such as stretching, instead.


Chores are a great low-intensity activity for when you cannot go on a walk. After your meal, wash the dishes and put them away. Scrub the table, and dust the shelves. As long as you are moving and standing on your feet, you can reap some of the same benefits as walking.If you own a treadmill, you can take your walk on the treadmill instead. Adjust the speed to a lower setting, and walk leisurely for fifteen minutes.

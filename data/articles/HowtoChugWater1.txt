 Water that is too cold will cause your throat to contract, making it harder to chug as quickly as you would like. Hot water will burn the lining of your throat, making it painful to go on – and perhaps causing lasting damage.;
, If you want to chug more quickly, drink from a container that has a wide mouth: A glass, a pitcher, a mason jar. Most water bottles feature a very narrow bottleneck, which slows the water as it pours from the container.


Technically speaking, you will be able to chug the most water at once from a bottleneck that most perfectly matches the size of your mouth. Bear in mind that your throat may not be able to keep up with this volume of water.
If you do use a plastic water bottle, you can try scrunching the end of the bottle as you chug. This will force the water out of the bottle more quickly than it would flow otherwise. Again, bear in mind that faster does not mean healthier., If you flood your system with water, you may not be able to keep up with yourself. This could lead to choking, bloating, and water intoxication. If the water source doesn't limit the speed at which the water can pour into your throat, you will need to manually regulate the flow. Don't tip the container on its end – keep the water coming out at a manageable rate.

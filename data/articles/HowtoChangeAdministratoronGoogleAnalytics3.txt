By designating more than one user as an administrator, one of the users can demote, or remove an administrator's profile if that person suddenly leaves the company.



If there is only one user designated as an administrator and they leave the company, there will not be an option to add a new administrator or change an existing profile unless the administrator's profile can be accessed.

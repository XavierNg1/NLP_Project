 Spotlights are great to use judiciously around your yard and house. They can be used to point to things you'd like your guests to see, even at night, such as sculptures and architectural highlights. Of course, these should never be pointed so they'd shine in someone's eyes. Rather, these lights should be pointed upward or downward at an angle, away from where people will be.Try using mini spotlights so you don't overwhelm your yard with lights.
You can even use colorful spotlights on plain walls for a bit of extra pizzazz., Ambient lights can be placed around your yard to provide a soft glow. They are often decorative, such as lights surrounded by colorful glass or small lanterns with LEDs. Keep in mind, these lights will likely not be enough on their own for people to walk around., Solar-powered lights have come a long way as far as brightness goes because of the use of LED bulbs, but they're not as bright as electrical. That makes them a better choice for decorative purposes rather than security purposes.

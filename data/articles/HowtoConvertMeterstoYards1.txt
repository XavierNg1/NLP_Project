 A simple conversion from meters to yards is nothing but a simple multiplication problem. All you need to do is start with your number of meters, then multiply.

Ex. Convert 12 meters into yards.
;
, There are 1.0936 yards in every meter. So if 1 meter is 1.0963 yards, then 2 meters is 2.1872, and so on. The easiest way to add all of this at once is through multiplication:Ex. Convert 12 meters into yards.

Ex. 12m∗1.0936metersyards=13.1234{\displaystyle 12m*1.0936{\frac {meters}{yards}}=13.1234}


, In the example, you determined the answer was "13.1234." But on a test or a project you need to be sure to answer the simple question, "13.1234 of what?" The answer, of course, is 13.1234 yards, but don't forget to add these units to get full credit.

Ex. Convert 12 meters into yards.

Ex. 12m∗1.0936metersyards=13.1234{\displaystyle 12m*1.0936{\frac {meters}{yards}}=13.1234}

Ex. 12meters=13.1234yards{\displaystyle 12meters=13.1234yards}


, The formula "1 meter = 1.0936 yards" is simply an approximation, as the real conversion is an infinite string of decimals. The more decimal points you use, the more precise the conversion will be, though there are only rare cases where four decimal places won't be enough. For example, you could also use the following

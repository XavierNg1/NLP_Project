 The pipe should also be ¾ inches in diameter. You will need to use a handsaw, hacksaw, or miter saw to cut the piece into two parts. The pipe should be hollow inside so the Nunchaku aren’t too heavy or dangerous.
 You should make it so that the length of each pipe is as long as the distance from your wrist to your elbow, which should be about one foot long each. If you’re over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, it may be a little longer.
 If you have PVC cement, then you can use it to secure the end caps on the ends of each length of pipe (you’ll need two end caps for each piece).
, Make sure to screw them in until they’re nice and snug. The screw eyes should be about a ½ inch in diameter.
 Now, take a 12-inch piece of metal chain and use some needle nose pliers to bend open the link at each end of the chain so it opens up enough to put it around the screw eyes. Place each opened link around the screw eye and use the pliers to close the link again, so you’ve made it so that the screw eye is essentially just another link in the chain. Do this to both ends of the chain.
 Now, carefully wrap some black electrical tape around each pipe as much as you want. You can cover the entire pipe, or leave the end caps out to create a pipe with two colors. Either way, the black tape will give your Nunchucks a sleeker, more sophisticated look.
 You’re all done! Now, enjoy training with your home-made weapon!

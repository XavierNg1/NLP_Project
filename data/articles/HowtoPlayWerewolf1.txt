 The most exciting area to play Werewolf is in a large wooded area. This area isn't the safest for a group of kids. Playing around a cul-de-sac could also work for a safer environment.


The most important thing is to have enough places to hide.
The game feels more authentic at night.;
, There is not an age requirement for playing Werewolf. It is usually a kids game, but if there aren't enough kids grab a mom or dad. You'll need to gather at least 10 people.


The more the merrier.
 Designate a place where you meet for each round. This is where the Werewolf will be chosen, and where you meet after the round is over.Somewhere that is slightly closed off tends to work the best. A porch. for example, is a perfect home base for playing Werewolf.

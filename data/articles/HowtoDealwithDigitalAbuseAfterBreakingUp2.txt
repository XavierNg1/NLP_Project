 Though you may want to delete everything your ex has sent you, you should save the abusive texts, e-mails, and other communications. Take a screenshot of things that may be deleted, like social media status updates, chats, pictures, or comments to other people.When taking a screenshot, not the date and time of the message for your records.
These records can serve as evidence of their abusive behavior if they deny everything or try to lie about you.
 Make sure you let the people you trust know about your ex’s behavior. This may include family, friends, or colleagues. Explain to them you don’t want them to post photos with you in them on social media and you don’t want them to tag you in posts when you go out.Tell your friends and family, "My ex has been digitally abusing me. This is very serious, and I would appreciate you not interacting with them online or posting about me when we are out. This is for my safety."
If you feel comfortable doing so, you may want to show you friends or family any of the abusive messages your ex has sent you.
Tell your friends and family not to respond to your ex if they contact them. If your ex sends them threatening messages, tell them to save a record of them.
 Most social media sites have terms of service that cover abusive content online. If your ex is posting abusive content about you, report the abuse to the site. You will have to attach a link or an image of the abusive content.For example, Facebook has guidelines against people threatening, bullying, or harassing members. If your ex sends you threats, compromises your privacy, blackmails you, or harasses you by sending you too many messages, you can report that to Facebook.The website may not remove your ex, but they will be aware of the abusive behavior in case it happens again.

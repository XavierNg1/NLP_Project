 Generously grease an 11 by 17-inch (27.94 by 43.18-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of butter.Set the baking sheet aside when you are done.
 Boil about 4 quarts (4 liters) of salted water in a pot. Add the macaroni and cook it for about 6 minutes. Drain the macaroni when you are done, then put it back into the saucepan.You are intentionally undercooking the pasta.
 Grate 12 ounces (335 grams) each of sharp and extra-sharp cheddar cheese. Set aside 2 cups (200 grams) of the cheeses for later and put everything else into the saucepan with the pasta.You can also try mild yellow Cheddar cheese and American cheese instead., If you have not already, add the cheese into the pasta (sans the cheese you set aside). Add some salt and pepper into the bowl, then toss everything together., Spread the pasta evenly across the prepared baking sheet. Next, pour the milk over the pasta. Try to make sure everything as even as possible, or the macaroni may not bake evenly., Sprinkle the reserved 2 cups (200 grams) of cheese evenly across the top of the pasta. If you want to, you can sprinkle a little bit of extra cayenne pepper on top as well., Carefully place the baking sheet into the oven. Bake it uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the pasta turns golden-brown and crispy.

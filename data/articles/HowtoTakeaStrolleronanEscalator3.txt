 You can't place both sets of wheels on one step. Therefore, make sure you keep the stroller balanced. If you don't pay attention, the stroller could flip on you.
 You are safer in the middle of the escalator and so is your child in the stroller. The middle is safer because hands, shoelaces, and clothing can get caught in the sides of the escalator.
 You can lose control of the stroller if you don't do so. With the escalator, it's easier to keep the stroller still with both hands.
 Little hands can get caught in the side of the escalator, so watch out for your kid's hand reaching out.
 Obviously, you need to hold onto the stroller. Therefore, it's hard for you to also hold on to the rail. Make sure you stay upright, or you could take you and the stroller down the escalator.
 That is, pay attention to what you're doing instead of looking at your phone. In addition, holding your phone ties up one hand you should be using for holding the stroller.

 Build your mental excitement by keeping your body excited. Stay on your feet and move around. Or, if you have to remain seated (like on a bus ride), find other ways to stay physically active. Stave off passivity by:Walking at a brisk pace
Going for a warm-up jog
Doing jumping jacks
Tapping drumbeats
Pumping your fists to music;
, Boost your excitement with positive speeches during practice and warm-ups. Run them silently in your head, or say them out loud to increase your physical activity and kill two birds with one stone. Don’t worry about making them long. Focus on positive phrases or even keywords with verbs that emphasize action, like:“Keep it moving!”
“Shut them out!”
“Charge!”
“Attack!”

, Listen to music. Create a playlist full of songs with lyrics that inspire you (like the classic “Eye of the Tiger”) or infectious upbeat tunes (like “Lust for Life”). Avoid slow music, though. Instead, pump yourself up with songs full of energy, like fast rock, punk, hip-hop, or dance music.For an added boost, favor songs with strong bass lines. Studies have shown that listening to songs heavy with bass inspires a stronger desire to dominate than songs with little or light bass. "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen is a classic example., Remember: as much as you may want to pump yourself up, you still have a game to play. Be sensible about how much you exert yourself beforehand. Avoid overstimulating yourself by:Refraining from drinking too much caffeine or energy drinks.
Warming up as directed by your coach.
Getting plenty of sleep the night before.
Avoiding strenuous activity.

 You can use bases of 10 to find the decimal of a fraction. You find the nearest number that has a 1 with 0s behind it that your denominator can be multiplied into. Decimals have designated with places, such as tenths, hundredths, and thousandths. These numbers as denominators makes is possible to convert your fraction into a decimal.


This does not work on every fraction. The denominator of the fraction has to be able to divide into a base of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and so on., The first step is to find a base of 10 for your fraction. For example, you need to convert 4/5 into a decimal. The denominator is 5. You need to figure out the closest number to 5 that has 1 with 0s. The closest base 10 to 5 is 10., To get 10, you have to multiply 5 by 2. Whatever you do to the denominator, you have to do to the numerator. Multiply the numerator by 2. The fraction you get is 8/10. Since the first place after the decimal is the tenths place, 8/10, which is eight tenths, would be 0.8 as a decimal., You have to practice these to get better at them. The more complicated the denominator, the harder it is to find a base of 10 for it. For example, you need to change 5/16 into a decimal. Take the bases of 10 and start dividing 16 into them. 16 does not divide into 10, 100, or 1,000. It does divide into 10,000 625 times. Since you multiply the denominator by 625, you need to multiply the numerator as well. 5 x 625 is 3125. Your new fraction is 3125/10,000. This becomes 0.3125 as a decimal.

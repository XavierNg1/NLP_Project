 Write out what is bothering you, brainstorm how many different ways you can approach the problem, assess the pros and cons of each approach, implement an approach, and evaluate the outcome.


Writing out your problems then brainstorming solutions, no matter how far-fetched they may seem, is a sound way of taking steps to solve those problems. , Resourcefulness is one of the key factors to overcoming any challenge.


Being resourceful includes asking for help so don’t be afraid to turn to your family, friends, or colleagues for assistance., Whether it be how many sales you close at work or how often you cook dinner at home instead of ordering take-out, tracking and evaluating your activities is the best way to witness progress, see what’s working, and fix what’s not helpful. Once you can track and accomplish your goals, you can self-evaluate.


Be your own critic. Be objective and realistic when you self-evaluate, and remember, “if it is to be, it’s up to me.”, If you find yourself engaging in self-doubt, telling yourself you “can’t do it” or “if only…”, you are buying into an external locus of control and may feel stuck in your present situation. Instead, tell yourself, “I think I can.”Repeat positive mantras such as “I can do this” or “I’m getting better at this.”
Examine your “if only” statements and reword them positively. For example, “if only I had more time” can change to “I can find 10 minutes a day to do yoga.” Believing in yourself is half the battle.

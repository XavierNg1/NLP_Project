, Yes, study. When you get into secondary school, you want to keep your grades high. The only way to do this is to start studying now.

Brush your teeth. Your teeth will look much better if you brush your teeth. Your breath will also smell nice. Don't forget to floss.
Take a shower every day. Wash your hair and body. This will stop you from smelling and will make you feel fresher. If you smell nice, people are more likely to be around you. Don't think that just because you are young that you don't need to keep clean.
 No, drugs and alcohol do not make you cool. Smoking makes you stink and is illegal for anyone under 18. The law is in place for a reason, don't break it to try to act cool or like somebody older than you. People who need alcohol to look cool have some serious issues and need help. Don't be one of those people, they're responsible for all the bad stereotypes about teenagers.

 Habitat for Humanity, Thrift Stores, want ads. All have pianos for free to several hundred dollars. Stick to the free ones. We went to Habitat and said we could take one of their three pianos away and wouldn't charge them. They smiled and asked if we wanted two. Their prices were $200, but they had been there six months.;
, My back porch is on a concrete slab, and I had a small tractor with a bucket to take it off the float. Remember, this thing is heavy! We had to put it on the trailer/float with Habitat's forklift. It usually takes four to six strong people to lift it a couple of feet.
 You can paint, patch, repair cosmetic things later. Don't tip it over. That comes much later. Note that it is several major parts/sections. 1) frame, cover, wheels. 2) keys and hammers. 3) sound/wire frame.
 It will not be a piano unless you put in an electric keyboard. More later.
 Pull out the pins of the hinges or the screws, release the clamps, or press the releases. You want to take these off neatly, because they will go back on.
 Release the hammer assembly. A couple of screws or bolts, and the entire thing should come out.
, All those strings are really, really tight. First loosen or remove all the strings. All of them, and so loose that they start to sag. This is very important.
 Cut some notches out of the frame so it would slide out when the piano was on its back.



The Piano now weighs about 150 pounds and two people can manage it or slide it around.

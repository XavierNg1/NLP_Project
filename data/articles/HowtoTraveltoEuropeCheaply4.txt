 Depending on how you travel, there are different accommodation options that may or may not work for you.


Hostels are a popular option, and are great for solo travelers and platonic couples. Instead of renting a room, you rent a bunk bed. Other than that, hostels typically offer the same amenities as a hotel.
If you are traveling with a large group, book a no-frills guesthouse.
If you prefer to see the countryside instead of the city, there are campgrounds spread throughout Europe. You might want to travel in warmer weather for this option!
As long as you do background checks, interviews, or reference checks, staying in someone's home is a viable option. Couchsurfing, Mennonite Your Way, and Camp in My Garden are just three of the many home stay programs that have European connections.
This shouldn't be an every night option, but take advantage of sleeping in transit. For overnight train trips, you can book a sleeper car. If a train or bus station is open 24 hours, you can probably stay there before your departure or after your arrival.
 Accommodations away from downtown may be cheaper, but it may be more costly for you to get transportation. Consider cost of accommodation versus cost of transportation when considering where you want to stay.

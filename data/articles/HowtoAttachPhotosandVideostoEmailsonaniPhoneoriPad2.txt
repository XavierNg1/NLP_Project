 You can use the Share feature in the Photos app to send an email message with the photos attached.
 You'll be able to attach up to five images.
 This will let you select more than one image.
 Each image you tap will have a checkmark on it. You are limited to five images for a single email message.
 It looks like a box with an arrow coming out of the top. This will open the Share menu.
 This will start a new message in the Mail app with the images attached. If the Mail app isn't an option in the Share menu, you've selected too many images.
 Once you've added the images, you can enter the recipient(s), create a subject, and type the body. When you send the email, you'll be prompted to either compress the images or send them in their original size. If you're worried about your data usage, you may want to pick one of the compressed options.

 Before you toss items into the trash make sure you aren’t using a bag that has a hole. You don’t need to spend a tremendous amount of time inspecting the bag, especially if its new from inside a box, but just a quick once over to ensure it is in tact will save you time and effort should it break.;
, This initial layer of newspaper will provide an additional absorbent layer against liquid mess.
 Push the bag all the way down to the bottom of the can and be sure you carefully secure the sides/edges around the brim of the trash can (so when you place items in the bag it doesn’t collapse).
 Lay at least one thick section of newspaper on the bottom of the trash bag. Be sure the newspaper covers the entire base of the bag so if liquid seeps from a container the newspaper can absorb it no matter the container’s location inside the trash bag.

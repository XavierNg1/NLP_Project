 On a desktop Mac, the ports are typically on the rear of the monitor. The drive will automatically mount to the computer, and once it does, you’ll see a new icon on the desktop that looks like a small white hard drive.
 Double-click the new USB drive icon on your desktop. The contents of the drive will appear in a new window. You can copy files directly to the root (main folder), or to any other folder that appears in the right panel.


The amount of storage space available on the USB drive also appears at the bottom of this window.
You can also access the USB drive by launching Finder, then selecting the USB drive from the “Devices” area on the left side of the screen.
 It may be helpful (though not mandatory) to create a new folder on the USB drive for the files you’ll be copying. Having folders with appropriate names for the types of files they contain can help you stay organized.


With the USB drive window open, press ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command+N to create a new folder.
Type a name for the folder, then press ⏎ Return.
 Open Finder, then navigate to the folder that contains the files you want to copy to the USB drive.
 To copy a file without erasing it from the computer, drag it to the open USB drive folder.


If you created a new folder to which you’d like to copy files, drag the files right to that folder.
To select more than one file at a time, hold the Control key as you click the names of each file to be copied, then drag the highlighted area to the new location.
 This practice helps prevent data corruption. Go to the desktop and drag the USB drive icon to the Trash (the trash icon turns to an “eject” icon as you drag). After that, you can safely remove the USB drive.

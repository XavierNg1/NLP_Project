, 2. The rules are a little different than Chuzzle Deluxe. In this game, just click on any group of three or more blocks you see.

Strategy: This puzzle takes more thinking as you get more levels completed. Be warned, as new blocks rise after every move you make. The good thing is you can take as long as you want to make a move.
Traditional: This game is timed. New blocks rise after a certain period of time. The blocks come up at a faster rate of speed each level, and if they touch the top, they will crack, which means "Game Over".
Relapse: This game is similar to Traditional, except blocks come from both top and bottom, and if they touch each other, they will crack, meaning "Game Over".
Puzzle: This is a puzzle for your mind. You can take as long as you want to correctly complete the puzzle. But you have to get rid of all the blocks in order to proceed to the next level.

 The Japanese word for 'winter' is 'fuyu' (foo-you). Foreigners often struggle with the correct pronunciation of the Japanese 'u'. Practice this until it sounds natural.


The f in 'fuyu' is an approximation. The sound is somewhere between an f and an h, but the difference can be difficult to discern to non-native speakers of Japanese. Saying it as an f will be understood.;
, If you are familiar with written Japanese, you will know that there are three separate writing systems. The word 'fuyu' in hiragana is 'ふゆ'. In katakana, it is 'フユ', and in kanji, '冬'. Memorising the kanji in particular is very important.

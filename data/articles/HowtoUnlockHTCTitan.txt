Once the phone starts up, instead of the usual home screen, another screen will appear asking you to “Enter an unlock code.” This is where you need to enter the unlock code you received.

 If you’ve used the right unlock code, “PIN Accepted” will be displayed on the screen.


Your HTC Titan should now be unlocked and can be used on any mobile network.

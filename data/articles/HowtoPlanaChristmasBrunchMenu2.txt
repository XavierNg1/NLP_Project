 Generally, you'll want something hearty as a main, such as a quiche, bacon and baked eggs, or some other breakfast protein. A fresh-baked side, such as biscuits (that you made and froze unbaked), scones, or quick breads, make a nice addition. It also can be nice to have something fresh, such as a fruit salad or a light green salad, if you're going on the lunch end of things., If you bake a casserole such as a sausage, egg, and potato casserole for the main, you can keep the sides relatively simple, such as some fresh-cut melon or a small bunch of grapes for each person., If you want an egg dish to take center stage, such as baked eggs in spinach, you can round it off with ham, bacon, or sausage. Similarly, if you have a sweet main dish like baked French toast, all you may need is a side of meat to finish the meal off., Make sure to have something everyone on your guest list can eat. If you have vegetarians, an egg main dish may be a good plan (as long as they eat eggs). If you have diabetics on the list, make sure to include a less sugary side, such as fresh fruit. Just keep your guest list in mind as you plan the menu.
 You can keep it simple with coffee, tea, and juice. However, you can also have an alcoholic brunch cocktail, such as a mimosa, to serve. Keep in mind, though, that not everyone will want to drink that early in the morning, so have non-alcoholic drinks on hand, as well., If you want your Christmas brunch to be the main meal of the day, you're going to need a bit more planning. Try using a menu planner or organizer, which you can find online. Basically, it has all the necessities you'll need for the meal, so you can fill in each slot, like meatballs for appetizers, ham for the main course, and so on, along with a place to make notes.

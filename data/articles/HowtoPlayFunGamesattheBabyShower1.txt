 Not just baby showers, mind you. Look back on the parties, slumber parties, housewarming parties, etc. Think about the sentimental and memorable games and activities you did as a guest at those events. Let your party memories guide you on your quest.;
, Think about the parents-to-be. Remember that this is a celebration of the new life about to enter the world. Capture that moment and go forward with the spirit of sentiment, fun and memories to be made.
 You will want to pick about 5 games and activities, in total. I would choose two classic games. Examples would be: baby bingo, baby word jumble, celebrity/baby match up, how big around is mother, or blindfolded diaper changing.
 You may just want to let those inspire you to create your own games. Think "Celebrate Baby". Otherwise, there are some lists given below. Think about how excited you and the guests and the new parents are to see this little one in a few months. Think outside the box.

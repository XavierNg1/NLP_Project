 To make your own wontons, start by combining your liquid ingredients as you would in a baking recipe. Beat 1 egg in a medium bowl, then add 1/3 cup water to the bowl and stir to combine.;
, Next, in a separate bowl, combine your dry ingredients. Stir briefly to combine.
 Create a small "hole" or "well" in the middle of your flour/salt mixture. Slowly pour your egg/water mixture into this well and mix to combine.


This part of the process is somewhat touchy. If your mixture is too dry, add water a teaspoon at a time until you can easily form a ball of dough.
 Dust a cutting board or similar clean surface with flour, then place the dough on this surface. Knead the dough until it is springy and elastic. Cut the dough into 2 equal-sized balls and cover these with a damp towel for at least 10 minutes.
 Cut each ball into 4 equal pieces. Roll these pieces into large, flat ovals. For standard-sized wontons, cut 3 1/2 inch (8.9 cm) squares from these ovals. Use these small squares of dough as your wrappers in your wonton recipe. You may want to dust each square lightly with flour so that they'll become adhesive with the addition of water and/or cool the squares in the refrigerator for firmness.


Use these homemade wrappers the same way as you'd use pre-made wrappers - see How to Wrap Wontons for more information.

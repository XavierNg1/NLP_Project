 Ensure that your goal is to be known for something positive (perhaps being artsy and unique). When in this planning process, do not choose a reputation that doesn't fit your personality. Don't try to come across as a prep if you can't stand being around them, or try to be a well-known athlete when you hate sports. Even though you may not have been known for a particular attribute before, it still must be something that's close to your heart- a reputation should have some truth to it.;
, It's easier to get a reputation if you are already good at what you are working at (like being known as the intelligent kid or the hard-working one).
 Stick to your original goals. Follow through with them, or your reputation will not be consistent. Do not suddenly come to school changed. Confusion would just be triggered and many could ask what's going on. It will only make things harder for you to manage.
 Simply let it be part of you. If others develop positive chatter about you- good! After all, that's what a reputation is; others believing you have certain characteristics.
, This will give you a bigger reputation, and a good one too!

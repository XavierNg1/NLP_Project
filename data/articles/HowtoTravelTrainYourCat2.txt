 Get in the car with your cat and allow him to explore it thoroughly. Remember not to turn on the engine. Do this for at least two consecutive days — longer if he's uncomfortable.
 Let him get used to it. Repeat this step daily until he is fine with it.
 Repeat this step daily until he's fine with it. If your cat is used to carriers, this might not take any time at all. Be sure there's a towel or cloth in the carrier so he has something to grab a hold of with his claws. This will reassure him.
 Limit your trips to approximately 5 minutes or so. Don't do this more than twice a day. The first time or two, he might be scared and vocal — most cats dislike the vibration of a moving vehicle. Try to stick to smooth roads in the beginning. Repeat this step until he is quiet and not afraid to be in the moving car. This is the most important step! Give him lots of praise and treats after the ride, so that he looks forward to it.
 Do this until he is accustomed to being in the car for long periods of time. Take him to a park, put him on his leash and halter, and let him out of the car to sniff around and drink some water. If he goes to the bathroom at the park, reward him profusely. Repeat this step for a while and your cat will love going for rides with you!

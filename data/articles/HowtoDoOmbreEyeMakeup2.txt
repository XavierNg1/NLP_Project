 Use a fluffy blush to apply a cream brown eye shadow to your lids. The shade of brown depends on the color of your skin and how dramatic you want the look to be. Use a fluffy brush to cover your eyelid in the color and intensify the color when you get to the outer corners of your eyes.








Powdered eye shadow can be used, but it will not blend as easily as cream eye shadow will because of the powdery texture.
 Use your fingertip to to apply the bronze cream eye shadow to the center of your eyelids. You will only need a small amount. The bronze eye shadow should only be used in the center of your eye lids and not extend to the sides of your eyelids.
 After the bronze eye shadow is applied, it should look like a bronze circle sitting on top of the brown eye shadow. Use your finger or a small blending brush to blend the bronze eye shadow with the brown eye shadow. Make sure that the bronze eye shadow stays in the center of your eye lid, but blend it until it doesnâ€™t stand out harshly against the base color. 







, You can use any type of brown eyeliner. A softer eyeliner, however, is ideal because it creates and soft and smudged look. Rim your upper and lower lashes with the eyeliner. The thickness of the line is up to you, but it should not cover your eye shadow too much.
 Use black mascara for a more dramatic look, or brown mascara for a subtler effect. Put on two coats. Touch up any spots where the eyeliner or eye shadow may have smudged too much if needed.

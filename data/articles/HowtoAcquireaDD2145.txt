 One of the fastest ways to locate the desired DD214 is by hiring an independent researcher that is very familiar with the National Archives and NPRC. The National Archives maintains a list of military record researchers at: https://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help/topics.html?topic=military.
 Each researcher lists his or her specialty. Once you choose a researcher, email him or her the basic information about the type of documents you are seeking and ask for a quote as to the cost of his or her services.


You can contact multiple researchers and compare price quotes.
Depending on the cost of the researcherâ€™s time, you can choose to hire the researcher or seek the DD214 yourself., Depending on the services that you request, an experienced and qualified researcher can go to the physical location where your record is being kept and obtain a copy of the document. You will need to provide the researcher with a written authorization allowing him or her to access your information.


Typically, a researcher can gain access to the material more quickly than if you request the information through the NPRC.
A researcher will assist you in completing your paperwork and physically retrieve the documents for you.
You should be wary of any research companies that only have you fill in the DD214 paperwork and then faxes the request in for you., If you choose to hire an independent researcher, send the researcher an email that includes the information that you are seeking, the services for which you hired him or her and the agreed upon fee. You should also request that the researcher confirm receipt of your email and that he or she agrees to keep confidential any information that is not publicly available.

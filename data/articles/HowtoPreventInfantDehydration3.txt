Overheating can cause infant dehydration., By giving your baby a cool environment, you will help minimize loss of water. Higher ambient temperatures have also been connected to SIDS. Research shows that infants exposed to an average temperature of 84 째F (28.9 째C) degrees were more than twice as likely to die suddenly than those in an average temperature of 68 째F (20 째C).Pay attention to the temperature in the infant's room with a thermometer.
Get an air-conditioner in the summer.
Don't overheat your house in the winter.
 Don't swaddle the baby in a heavy blanket if the home is overly warm, even if it is cold outside. Overheating due to heavy coverings has been connected to SIDS.Do not bundle your child up when she is sleeping.
Dress infants in weather-appropriate clothing.
Avoid heavy fabrics, jackets, fleece hats, and long sleeves and pants in hot weather, unless the clothes are made of a breathable material.
 Get a stroller with an adjustable shade. Get a portable sun shade if you will be somewhere very sunny, such as the beach. Put a window shade in your car to protect your baby from the sun while you're driving.

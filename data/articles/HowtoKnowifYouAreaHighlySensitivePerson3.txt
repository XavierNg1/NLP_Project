 A long to-do list, numerous demands on your attention, and too many moving pieces can be too much for the highly sensitive person. You may be extremely vulnerable to emotional overwhelm and dislike spontaneity or uncertainty.If you are easily overwhelmed, it may help to schedule natural breaks in your day to reboot and decompress during chaotic periods. Steal away an hour of two in a more quiet, peaceful environment.
 Because you are naturally prone to anxiety, you may be unusually sensitive to caffeine. Consuming even small amounts of the substance may create an even greater stimulating effect on the HSP than in non-HSPs.If you notice extreme jitters or anxiety after consuming caffeine, limit its consumption in favor of non-caffeinated choices.
 HSPs are found to be quite sensitive to pain. While virtually anyone you meet is probably averse to pain, highly sensitive people may go to lengths to avoid it. Seeing needles in medical offices or witnessing sports injuries upsets HSPs.


This sensitivity to pain extends beyond yourself to others, too, which is why many HSPs may refrain from watching violent or gruesome movies., Highly sensitive people become overstimulated easily. Loud noises, strong smells, and bright lights cause sensory overload. Research shows this happens because your nervous system may receive incoming stimuli differently than non-hypersensitives.


You might find yourself avoiding crowds, noisy bars or restaurants, or boisterous environments in favor of relaxed and quiet atmospheres. Too much stimuli can actually cause fatigue or anxiety for the highly sensitive person.

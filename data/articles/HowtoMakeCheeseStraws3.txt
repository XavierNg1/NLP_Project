 For this recipe, you need to preheat the oven at 350 degrees. Pull out a flat baking sheet and spray with nonstick spray. Set the pan aside.
 Take the stale bread and crumble it in a medium bowl. Stir in the flour, cayenne pepper, and salt. Pour in the milk. It should start to feel like dough. Mix in the cheese. Knead the dough until the cheese is well mixed in.


Since ingredients were rationed in the war, the amount of fresh flour is minimal. The use of stale bread allowed every resource to be used for something.
If the mixture is too dry, add in a little milk at a time to thin it out.
 Roll the dough until it is about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick. Cut the dough into strips that are 6 inches (15.2 cm) long and a 1/2 inch wide.


You may need to dust your work surface with flour so the dough doesn't stick to it.
 Place the straws in the oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool before serving.

 Sometimes, approaching poetry in a new form can be a fun experiment and get you inspired. Take a familiar form, like a shopping list or a recipe, and write a poem in that form. You may be surprised by how placing content in a new form can shake up your writing practice and create images you may not have thought of with a more traditional form.You may want to find a shopping list or a recipe you have already written and replace the words with words from a poem. Placing an existing poem in a new form can also change up the meaning in the poem and make the poem more interesting visually.
 If you are looking for a less rigid form, you may decide to try writing a poem in the form of a daily horoscope or a magic spell. Play around with trying to write poetry in these forms and see what comes out of placing your writing a different structure., Another interesting structural device might be using dialogue that you have overheard in public places or among friends and using them as lines in a poem. You may also include dialogue that you have made up, overlapping real world conversations with fictional conversations. This could then create an interesting poem that uses different spoken slang and inflections., A literary form, like a sonnet or a sestina, can actually be a great way to get inspired, especially if you are struggling with how to start a poem. Choose a form youâ€™ve never used before, such as a haiku or a rhyming couplets, and challenge yourself to write a poem or a series of poems in that form.


You can look up different literary forms and study the guidelines around the form., Another way to challenge yourself with limits in your poetry is to use constraint based forms. These forms have set rules or constraints that you must follow to create a piece. You can create your own constraints, such as writing a poem that only uses vowels, or use constraints that have been used by other poets.

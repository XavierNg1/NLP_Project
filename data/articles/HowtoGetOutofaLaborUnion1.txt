 Every union is different. To figure out when and how to leave the union, you will need to talk to your union representative. Call them up or stop by to talk.


If you are not in a “right to work” state, then your ability to leave the union can be restricted.You should ask about those restrictions.;
, In some unions, you might only be able to leave your union during certain times of the year. For example, in Michigan, teachers can only opt out of their union in August.You can often find this window of time by getting a copy of your enrollment form.You might also read your collective bargaining agreement, which could contain this information.
, There may be forms you have to fill out to leave the union. Alternately, you might need to send a letter to your union.This letter should state where you work and that you resign your membership from the local and all affiliated unions.If you had union dues automatically deducted from your paycheck, then you’ll need to stop those deductions. You can get a form from your union representative or possibly Human Resources.
 As an objector, the full amount of your union dues will be deducted and payed to a tax-exempt charitable fund. You will no longer be a member of the union, though you will still work under the collective bargaining agreement.You can go to http://choosecharity.org/ and complete an application. Their legal team will then take over the rest.

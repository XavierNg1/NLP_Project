 No matter how far away always collect them. These are the only way of getting money period. Nothing else gives you money in the game.
 This makes it harder to get all the stars in time before they shrink. Examples of things you should use are: Rpg's, Grenades, Katanas, any rapid firing gun.
 This will allow you to keep killing puppets, thus giving you more chances to make money. This is best done on levels with 100 puppets and when you've killed about 90. You don't lose any weapons or money however.

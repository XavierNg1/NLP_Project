 If your cat has experienced severe frostbite, you may want to ask your veterinarian about medication to help your cat cope with the pain. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for the dose and duration of the prescribed medication.“Is there a medication that could help my cat deal with the pain?”

, If your cat’s skin has turned black, surgery may be needed to remove the affected tissue. If the frostbite is severe on the paws or tail, amputation may be needed. Antibiotics may be used to reduce infection. Ask your veterinarian about the most appropriate treatment option.“What is the least invasive way of treating the frostbite?”
“What treatment option will ensure the best quality of life for my cat?”
“What will be done to manage the pain during surgery?”

, You should watch to make sure your cat isn’t licking and scratching the affected tissue, which could make it much worse. To prevent this scenario, it may be wise to use a collar on your cat that restricts access to the affected tissue.

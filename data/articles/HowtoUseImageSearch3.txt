 A couple of search engines now allow you to upload an image and search for all the different instances of it throughout the web. Mainly, Google Images and Tineye.com.
 This feature is very useful if you want to find the original author of an image. You may need to do so if you are hoping to gain permission for commercial use of the content.


It can also be used to control the distribution of images you created. This can range from copyrighted material to incriminating images you are trying to keep under wraps.
You can use it for research. Say you have to write a paper about a painting for Art History. Do a reverse image search with a JPG of the painting and you will suddenly have access to all the different contexts in which the image appears online.
If you are looking for a higher resolution version of an existing image, reverse searching it can help.
You have the legal right to defend yourself against slanderous use of images you created, and images depicting your face or person. Reverse image search is a great way to find out who is using your images and for what purpose.
Reverse image search can also be used to satisfy other curiosities, such as how popular or widespread an image is.
 Go to the Google Images home page and click the tiny little camera shaped icon inside the search field. This will prompt you to designate an image for your search. You can choose between dragging the image from your desktop or browser into the search area, uploading the image from your computer, or entering a direct URL to the image. In an instant, you will be presented with your search results.
 It is a search engine just for reverse image searches. The mechanics of searching tineye are the same as Google. You can drag and drop, upload, or enter the image URL from the tineye home page to begin your search.


Tineye is dedicated to connecting content authors with the content they created. They offer networking opportunities and other options you wonâ€™t find on Google.

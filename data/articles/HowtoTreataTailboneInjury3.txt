 NSAIDs can reduce the pain and inflammation associated with a tailbone injury. Avoid NSAIDs if you have had gastrointestinal bleeding in the past, are taking a blood thinner, or have a history of kidney disease., The pain from a tailbone injury can be complicated by constipation and difficult bowel movements. Your doctor can recommend a stool softener to alleviate these gastrointestinal symptoms and make bowel movements more comfortable., Sometimes your doctor will suggest a steroid injection in the tailbone region to provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation resulting from a tailbone injury. Your doctor will decide if this is a good treatment option for you. Steroid injections are usually administered at your medical providerâ€™s office., While your doctor can prescribe narcotic pain medication to alleviate tailbone pain, it is important that you only take these medications if you are experiencing severe pain that is not alleviated with an over the counter NSAID. Narcotic pain medications are highly addictive and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

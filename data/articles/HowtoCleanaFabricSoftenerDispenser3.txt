 Pour a small capful of your regular laundry detergent into a bucket or large mixing bowl, and then fill the bowl with warm water from your kitchen tap., Being careful not to spill any of the water and detergent mixture, slowly pour the liquid into the soap and laundry softener dispensers. Then run the washing machine on the “warm rinse” setting to run the detergent through the machine and the fabric softener dispenser.If your laundry machine does not have a “warm rinse” option but only has a “cool rinse,” you can follow roughly the same cleaning procedure. However, you’ll need to pour hot, sudsy water into the fabric softener dispenser between each rinse. This allows the water and detergent to break down and clean whatever’s clogging the dispenser.
 Repeat the rinsing process at least three times, so that the detergent solution can clean out grime and build-up from the fabric softener dispenser. Each time you’ll need to pour another bucket full of warm water and laundry detergent into the fabric softener dispenser.You may need to reach inside of your washing machine’s fabric softener dispenser using a damp rag in order to wipe out any gunk or grime that has not been cleaned with the detergent and water mixture.
 Many cleaning sites also recommend using a vinegar mixture clean your fabric softener dispenser. If your dispenser is not fully cleaned by using liquid detergent and water, you can run vinegar through the dispenser to remove the clog.Vinegar—especially when coupled with baking soda—will clean the interior of your washing machine from any buildup that has accumulated over time, and will also clean out your fabric softener and soap dispensers.

 Male frogs are the ones who seem to croak at night without stopping. They do this to attract mates around breeding spots — female frogs use the calls of the males to determine which ones are healthiest and most attractive. Females, on the other hand, don't usually make much noise..


This isn't to say that female frogs don't make any noise. Female frogs may occasionally croak or call out in response to something else. For instance, female frogs will "scream" when grabbed by a predator. However, they won't croak constantly at night like most male frogs.
 There's no nice way to say this — male frogs will occasionally "hump" things. In other words, they will climb onto something, grasp it with their forelegs, and press the underside of their bodies against it tight. They often won't use an obvious "thrusting" motion like a male dog, but their intention should be obvious.


This isn't just restricted to female frogs (although this is often the case). Male frogs may "hump" or hug objects like plants or rocks. They may even hump other male frogs. Female frogs, however, will not hump.
 Some behaviors may seem like things that only male or female frogs would do, but in fact are not. A few of these are listed below:Both male and female frogs will defend themselves or attempt to run if threatened.
Both male and female frogs shed skin.
Both male and female frogs will attempt to camouflage themselves against similarly-colored things.
Male and female frogs of the same species have the same diet.
 It's not always easy to tell male and female tree frogs apart, especially if you are dealing with a very small species or a species without obvious male/female appearance variations. In these cases, you may want to consult an expert. Biologists, amphibian experts, veterinarians, and similar professionals can all be valuable resources.

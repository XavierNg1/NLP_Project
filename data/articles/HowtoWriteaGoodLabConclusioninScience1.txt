 Verify that you’ve accomplished all the parts of your assignment so that you can properly address them in the conclusion. Take a few moments to make a list of what you’re supposed to demonstrate or learn in the experiment.;
, To make sure your conclusion is consistent with the rest of your report, revisit your lab report’s introduction.This is a good tactic to help you brainstorm exactly what you’d like to say in your conclusion.
 Start mapping out the different elements of your conclusion by using the RERUN method. The RERUN method can be a useful structure overall for a short lab report, but it is especially useful for providing a conclusion to your report that reviews the experiment’s important components.,RERUN stands for:



Restate: Restate the lab experiment. Describe the assignment.

Explain: Explain the purpose of the lab. What were you trying to figure out or discover? Talk briefly about the procedure you followed to complete the lab.

Results: Explain your results. Confirm whether or not your hypothesis was supported by the results.

Uncertainties: Account for uncertainties and errors. Explain, for example, if there were other circumstances beyond your control that impacted the experiment.

New: Discuss new questions or discoveries that emerged from the experiment.
 The RERUN method is a good start, but there may be other components that you should include. It’s a good idea to talk about what you’ve learned in the experiment. You might also want to situate your research within the overall research field, or how you can relate the findings to concepts you’re learning in class.


Your assignment may also have specific questions that need to be answered. Make sure you answer these fully and coherently in your conclusion.

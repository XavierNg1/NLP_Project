 If you have a kitchen sink or shower with a flexible head, then that will be ideal for this process. Wrap a towel around your child’s shoulders and either clip it or have him or her hold onto it to keep it in place. This will help prevent any orange juice from getting onto your child’s clothing.;
, You will need to use 1 cup of 100% pure orange juice. Do not use orange juice from concentrate.Carefully pour the orange juice over your child’s head. Massage it in with your fingertips, making certain that the orange juice covers all of your child’s hair.


You can use fresh-squeezed orange juice if you prefer, but make sure that you strain out the pulp. It may be easier to buy some pulp-free orange juice to minimize your work, since this process is already quite intensive.
 It is important to leave the orange juice on your child’s head and allow it to work. Do not leave your child’s head uncovered because it may drip or dry and become sticky in your child’s hair. Either wrap your child’s head in a cotton towel or cover your child’s head with a plastic shower cap or a swimmer’s cap.


Leave the orange juice on your child’s head for 30 minutes

, After 30 minutes have passed, take the towel or shower cap off of your child’s head and shampoo and rinse your child’s hair as usual. After you have shampooed and rinsed your child’s hair, you should follow up by combing with a lice comb right away. Doing so will help to remove any dead lice left in the hair as well as any eggs left on your child’s scalp.

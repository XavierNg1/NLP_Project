 In general, scene hair is full and teased out on top, and thinner on bottom (or on hair that falls lower than your jawbone). The steps in this section can help you get the basic shape of scene hair.;
, Scene hair usually features layers, especially to create volume on top. How many layers and where you put them are up to you, but here are some suggestions:


Get short layers in the back and longer layers in front.
Keep a long distance between layers, such as having the bottom layer of your hair long, and the next layer situated 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2Â cm) up from that.
Cut your layers so that they frame your face.
 A lot of scene hairstyles for girls and guys have bangs parted far to the side (above the end of one eyebrow) and swooping over the forehead, sometimes even covering the eyebrows. Bangs are usually teased out (see Styling below).


Keep your bangs straight. Though some scene styles feature curls on other parts of hair, the bangs are usually kept straight. See more information on this under Styling.
 To keep a sharp, angular look on your ends, have them razored or buy a pair of razoring scissors at a beauty supply store.
 If you have really thick hair, consider asking a stylist to thin out the bottom layer. This will make it easier to style.
 If you have shorter hair but want the long scene strands around your shoulders, consider using hair extensions. You can have them applied professionally, or purchase clip-on extensions at a beauty supply store.

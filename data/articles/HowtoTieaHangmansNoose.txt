 Learning how to tie a knot on the internet is tough if you don't know the basic vocab. For this knot, you should know:



Bight: Simply a U-shaped bend, where the rope turns back on itself

Standing Line: This is the extra rope at the end of your knot. For example, if you were tying the noose at the end of a roll of rope, the standing line is the part leading back to the roll.;
, The longer the rope, the bigger the noose. Longer ropes also allow you to get more of the infamous coils around the top of the knot, which also makes it stronger.
 Take the end of the rope and create two bends, forming an S-shape with the rope. The standing line should be left long so that you have some string left at the end.

, This will slightly "ruin" the S shape -- what is important are the two bends.

, This is the first of the many "wraps" that sit at the top of noose. This is one revolution. Pull it tight, so that there is still the loop on one end./images/thumb/a/a9/Tie-a-Hangmans-Noose-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Tie-a-Hangmans-Noose-Step-5-Version-4.jpg

, Traditionally, a hangman's noose has seven wraps, but you can do it as many times as you want. You must, however, wrap it an odd number of times, otherwise you will not be able to finish the knot./images/thumb/7/73/Tie-a-Hangmans-Noose-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Tie-a-Hangmans-Noose-Step-6-Version-4.jpg

You must have at least 2-3 inches of the end of the rope left over when done.
 The bottom loop, means the loop next to the standing line of rope, leading away from your knot. Tuck the end of the rope through this bight.

, This will also expand your noose hole, tightening the entire knot so that you're just left with the rope, the coils, and the noose. Once tightened, this knot is strong and difficult to undo.

If the noose isn't big enough, you should start over, making a larger S-shape than before.

For 3 1-pint (473 ml) jars, use 10 lbs. (4.54 kg) of apples.
For 7 1-pint (473 ml) jars, use 12 1/4 lbs. (8.62 kg) of apples.
For 9 1-quart (946 ml) jars, use 19 lbs. (5.56 kg) of apples.

, Jars and lids should be placed in a dishwasher &/or oven to keep hot until use. Heat/wash jars and lids for sterilization then keeping the jars hot will prevent breakage. Boil lids until placed on jars. This helps create a clean sterile seal. Remember to use your magnetic lid lifter.
,,, Be careful not to add too much lemon juice this will result in sour apples!








, You only want to heat up the apples not cook them; otherwise you will have applesauce before you know it.









This blanching stops the enzymes from degrading the flavor during storage.
 Pack the apples into the jars tightly.
, If the apples need a little extra sweetness, add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar on top. The sugar will then dissolve and be absorbed by the apples during the processing.
 Place the jar lid on the jar and tightening until secure.
, Canning time varies depending on the type of canner and the altitude of your location. Always check your canner instructions. Here are some general cooking-time guidelines for use with a water canner:









0–1,000 feet (0.0–304.8 m) above sea level cook for 20 minutes
1,001–3,000 feet (305.1–914.4 m) cook for 25 minutes
3,001–6,000 feet (914.7–1,828.8 m) cook for 30 minutes
above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m) cook for 35 minutes.

If you use a dial gauge pressure canner. A weighted gauge pressure canner needs about 8 minutes. Verify with instruction manual.

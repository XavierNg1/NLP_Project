 Find an open area free of any hazards (uneven surfaces, sharp objects, or pedestrians). Skate parks are great places to practice tricks. Also large, open parking lots can be used for tricks. Make sure there aren't any rules against skating or scooters!


If you’re shy, stick to your driveway and garage till you feel comfortable.;
, Some might poke fun if you wear knee and elbow pads, but your joints are worth it! Always wear a helmet. You are most prone to injury when you first practice more complex tricks like the 180.


Don’t increase your chances for needing knee surgery!

, Push yourself in quick bursts to reach a fast speed. This will help you build enough momentum to get "air".


Gauge how fast you can reach on the scooter and aim for a few notches below this speed.
 This means bending your knees and getting as low as possible while remaining balanced. Center your weight below your torso.


If this feels uncomfortable at first, practice riding around in this crouched position.
 Push off the ground by extending yourself up, in a jumping motion, while holding onto the handle bars. Once you're in the air, pull the scooter in towards yourself.


Make sure that both wheels are at least half a foot off the ground; otherwise, one of the wheels might catch the pavement as you perform the 180., Shift the top half of your body, beginning with your head, in the direction that you want to do the 180. You can either go left (backside) or to the right (frontside). Rotate a full 180, or until you are facing the opposite direction.


When you turn your head/upper body, the rest of your body and scooter will follow.
 Straighten your legs out to reduce the spinning and land the scooter. If you don't stick the landing on the first try, keep trying!

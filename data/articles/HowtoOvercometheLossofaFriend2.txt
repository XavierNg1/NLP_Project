Phone
Email
Letter writing
Social network sites

, Don't get your hopes up by thinking that your friend will move back, because in most cases, there are slim chances. If your friend doesn't move back, you'll be heartbroken. Focus on your life now and stop waiting for something to happen. Be happy with what you have and smile.
 It may take awhile for this to sink in, but the whole world is not just this one person. Search for new friendly faces (perhaps while engaging in your new hobby) and open up. Who knows? You might find someone else.

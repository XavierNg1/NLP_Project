 The richer the air to fuel ratio (less than 14.7/1), the cooler the combustion will be, the leaner the air to fuel ratio (more oxygen), the hotter the combustion is and more NOx is produced. These particular engines either equipped or not with an EGR system may produce excessive NOx due to a lean condition.
 This device is located underneath the car in the exhaust system, between the exhaust manifold and the muffler., To check if the EGR ports are clear, start the engine and let it idle; using hot-gloves or a rag, reach underneath the EGR valve and push the diaphragm actuator rod upward. If the engine stalls or runs very rough, then the EGR ports are clear. If no (or very little change) occurs in engine RPM, then the EGR ports are plugged and must be cleared first (See repair manuals or Google it). Retest as mentioned., Air volume entering from the air duct through the air filter is measured by the MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor, usually located just before the throttle body and held down by three small screws.,,,,, Have the vehicle's emission gas retested to make sure it is in compliance with state guidelines.

 If you are untrained in knot theory, this can be tricky, but opening a knot is much easier if you know which loops and intersections are holding it together. Study it for a moment and try to determine which direction each loop should be pulled to loosen the knot.;
, You won't be able to untie the knot if the ends outside of it are pulled tight.

, Depending on how thin your string is, this might be impossible. If you need to use your fingernails.

, To untie a knot, you need to create slack. Depending on how you are holding the knot, that can mean pushing instead of pulling. Be gentle but firmâ€”tugging the wrong way too hard can just tighten the knot further. Move on to a different pair of loops until the knot loosens. Keep working the knot from different angles, trying different combinations until you get one or two spots of looseness.

, Just make sure you don't accidentally pull the knot tight again. Pull one end of the string back through the open loops to undo the knot. Once the knot opens up into a series of crossing loops, the surest way to get it untied for good is to trace one end back through the loops until there are no intersections.

, This is pretty simple. Click the "New Project" button in the top left, then follow the steps to make an "Empty Project". Then name it, and on the next pop-up hit "Finish".
 Rename the main .cpp file (the one that contains "int main()" in it) to the name of the project that you chose. The external dependencies file will fill itself

, Press the key after you have finished all of the above and the program will be created.
 Navigate to the "Projects" file that Visual C++ installs all of the programs to (in Windows 7, it will be in your Documents). It will be in the file with the name you gave it earlier, under the "Debug" directory.
 Double-click on the .exe file to run it, and if everything went well, the program should work fine. If it doesn't, try going through the steps again.
 C++ programs built using Visual Studio require them. You won't need it on your machine because it gets installed with Visual Studio. But you can't expect your clients to have it. Download Link: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679

 If possible, choose a location that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight every day.;
, Note which vegetables you want to plant first, as well as where you want to plant successive crops.


Consider the mature size of the vegetable. For example, melons require a lot of space and cannot be crowded.
Figure out the best spot to plant vegetables that prefer cool weather. Some leafy vegetables like spinach and lettuce, will wilt in full sun. Plant those in rows where they will eventually get some shade from taller vegetables.
Consult the back of your seed packages to see the length of maturation of each plant. If you plant several rows of carrots, which have a long maturation date, you won’t be able to use that space to plant more seeds later in the season.
 Till or hand spade your garden. Work in compost and till the soil again to make sure the compost is worked all the way through the soil.
 Get the most produce from your garden by grouping early-maturing crops. Plan to sow cabbage, carrots and beets in the same rows that you planted your early peas and beans. You can also plant corn in between rows of potatoes, radishes in between rows of lettuce, etc.
 Other plants like pole beans don’t need support because they are heavy, but if they lay on the ground, they will rot and attract garden pests.
 Don't wait for weeds to overtake tender sprouts or transplants. Mulching helps the soil stay moist and cool on hot days. Mulching will also help with weed control, and organic mulch will enrich the soil as it decomposes., Rainwater is best because it provides needed nutrients, but rain amounts vary greatly. Most plants, especially tomatoes, must have a lot of water to produce a high yield. Consider saving rainwater in barrels so that you can use it throughout the year.
 Put fencing around the garden to keep out deer, rabbits and other small animals.

, After the .tgz file is done downloading, proceed to the next step.
 You can do this however you want, using graphical tools or the command line.
 It will be in the format of oolite-{version}.linux-x86_64.run for the 64 bit version. The installer will ask you if you want to install system wide, or in your home directory. If you have root access and you want other system users to be able to play Oolite, go ahead and install it system wide.
 Your AddOns folder is ~/.Oolite/AddOns. You may have to create this folder manually.
 Have fun with your newly installed game.

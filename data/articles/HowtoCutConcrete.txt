You need to use a chalk line and box to mark a straight line on the concrete. This is the area to be cut.;
, This works particularly well when working with a sidewalk.


Set the blade depth of your circular saw at 2 inches (50.8 mm).
Begin cutting at the edge of the concrete and slowly follow the line you have laid out with your chalk line. I have found keeping the blade wet by pouring water on it as you cut reduces dust and helps keep the blade cooler.
This depth of cut will give you a straight edge scoring the concrete to finish breaking the remaining depth and a straight edge at the top to tie in with fresh concrete.



The cut-off saw allows you to penetrate to a depth of 6 inches (152.4 mm).
Most driveways, housing slabs and basement or concrete retainer walls are in this range.



Cut concrete to the correct depth.
Proceed slowly, maintaining minimum RPMs of the cut-off saw. Slow speed allows the saw to keep from overheating the blade and causing shrapnel-like pieces to be tossed into the air from a broken blade.
If you have helpers, have them keep the chalk line free of concrete dust made by the saw cut.

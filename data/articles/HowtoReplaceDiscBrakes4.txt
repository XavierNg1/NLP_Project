 If you have not replaced the calipers or loosened any fittings, you can SKIP to the next section. You may wish to bleed the brakes later if you determine that the brake peddle feels mushy or goes down too far.


You'll need a good helper for this, and do one side at a time.
 Grease and or fluid on the pads can keep your car's breaks from gripping properly and will make stopping harder.
,, This should be just enough to loosen it, being careful not to damage the screw (use a snugly fitting solid wrench, not pliers and not an adjustable wrench). Attach an appropriate size clear or rubber hose to the bleeder screw with the other end immersed in brake fluid in a jar or can before depressing the brake pedal. This helps to avoid sucking air back into the bleeder screw if the pedal is let up at the wrong time.
 Some fluid may flow out or you may see bubbling from the tube in the jar while only air is coming out. While the pedal is at the floor, close the bleeder screw. Have your assistant slowly lift the pedal. While the brake pedal is all the way up, open the bleeder screw again.
 Always tighten the bleeder screw before letting up the peddle; final check that it is tightened securely when finished. (Some brakes are gravity-bleed, and fluid will just run out when you open the screw, and only require you to open the bleeder screw until you see clean fluid, without working the brake pedal, but the pedal pressing procedure works in all cases).
 If the fluid gets too low you'll be introducing air into the master-cylinder and brake system again and will have to bleed it all out, which is even more extensive than just clearing air out of the wheel-cylinders and hoses.

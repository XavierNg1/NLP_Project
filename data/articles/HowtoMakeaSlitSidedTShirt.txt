These sizes usually work for everyone, but if its too tight or too loose you may need to adjust. Cut the entire sides starting below the shoulder hem (Where the sleeve ends) and going to the bottom hem.
 Start at the top and be careful not to miss any of them as you tie. If you want you can leave a few untied for a more edgy look, that usually works best in the middle of the sides or at the top or bottom. In other words, try not to just randomly leave some untied, pick your style and stick with it.

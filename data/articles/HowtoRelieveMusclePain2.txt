 It is essential to rest if you are experiencing muscle pain. If you continue to work and exercise through your pain, then you may end up making it worse. Take a day off to give your body to rest and recover.


If you do not want to take a day off from your normal exercise routine, then try working a different part of your body. For example, if your arms and back feel sore, then do exercises that focus only on your legs., Muscles are made of up of 75% water, so staying hydrated is a good way to help support healing.Most people need to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day, but you may need more or less depending on your size, age, and activity level.
 Doing some gentle stretching might also help to relieve muscle pain. For example, if your back muscles hurt, then doing a forward bend may help stretch the muscles and bring you some relief. Try incorporating some gentle stretching into your daily routine.


If you have chronic muscle pain, then you may want to check with a physical therapist to find out what sorts of stretches will help.
It is a good idea to warm up your muscles before stretching them. You can warm up your muscles by doing about five minutes of aerobic activity such as walking or riding a bike., Deep, slow breathing exercises may also help to relieve muscle pain.Try taking some slow, deep breaths to help your muscles relax.


To take a slow, deep breath, first get into a comfortable position. Try sitting in a comfortable chair or lying down on your bed. Then, count up to five as you breathe in through your nose, then count down from five as you breathe out through your mouth. Repeat this process several times.
You might also find it helpful to listen to some relaxing music or nature sounds as you breathe. The sounds might help you to relax even more.

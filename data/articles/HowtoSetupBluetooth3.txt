Because the Android system is open source and highly modifiable, slightly different versions appear on the many existing cell phone and tablet models. A few of these steps may differ from the steps you must follow on your own device, but usually any difference will only be superficial. For example, you may have to first go to the "Menu" screen before you can enter "Settings.",, There may be a box with the word "Bluetooth" next to it. If this box has a check mark in it, then your Bluetooth is already on. If it is empty, select the box.


If there is no separate Bluetooth option, you may have to turn it on by first selecting the "Bluetooth settings" screen inside the Wireless and Networks menu.
 Your Android device will now begin scanning for discoverable Bluetooth devices or components.


You may need to restart the component you are trying to connect. Many components are only discoverable within the first few minutes after starting up., The Android device will list all of the nearby Bluetooth devices or components that it can detect, and so there may be quite a few available. Make sure you select the correct device.
 Enter a pairing code (if applicable). Pairing some devices or components requires the use of a pairing code. If you are pairing two phones, for instance, you may be asked to create a pairing code on one of them and then enter the same code on the second device. Not all devices or components require that you create or enter pairing codes. Many headsets or hands-free components, for example, do not require pairing codes.

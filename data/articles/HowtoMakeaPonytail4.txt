 For this style, your hair shouldn't be too smooth. As with just about any ponytail style, it is well-suited for unwashed hair. Even if you have washed recently, though, you are aiming for tousled or wavy hair.


An easy way to get soft, unfussy waves is to braid or twirl your slightly damp hair into a bun and sleep on it. This will require a bit of planning ahead, but can save you precious time in the morning and sets you up for a simple and quick styling session in the morning.
 Use your hands or a brush to do this; make sure that you don't have any major knots in your hair, but don't over brush it. You want to keep that slight bed-head look.
 Next, tie the two sections together as though you were beginning to tie your shoelaces.
 Once you've completed your knots, loosely wrap an elastic around the ponytail.
 If you're worried about the style staying in place, you can leave the elastic, but removing it will make your ponytail look even more casual and undone.
 Instead of securing and tying your hair at the nape of your neck, make a side part, and gather your hair below your ear. Divide the hair into sections and knot twice. Using a thin elastic, secure the hair directly under the knots.

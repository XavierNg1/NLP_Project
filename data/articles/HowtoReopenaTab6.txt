 This will only open the last closed tab. You cannot repeat the command to continue opening closed tabs.You can also click the "Edit" menu and select "Undo Close Tab".
 If you closed a window with multiple tabs open, you can reopen the window by selecting "Reopen Last Closed Window" from the "History" menu.
 Safari lacks some of the tab tools that browsers like Chrome or Firefox have. You can use the free "Recent Tab List" extension to add a Recent Tabs button to your Safari toolbar. This will allow you to quickly open your recently-closed tabs.


You can download the extension from nickvdp.com/tablist/.

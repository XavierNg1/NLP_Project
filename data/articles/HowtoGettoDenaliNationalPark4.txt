 The website offers a detailed list of arrivals and departures, including trips from Anchorage and Fairbanks to Denali National Park. Make sure you leave yourself enough time to get to the train station from the airport, accounting for the possibility of delays.
 Although tickets can be purchased at the station on the day of your trip, buying them ahead of time will ensure that you will not be left without transportation if the train is sold out on the day you arrive.
 Both airports offer taxi service to all local destinations, including the train station.

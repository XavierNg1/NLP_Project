 Boil water either on the stovetop or in an electric kettle. Make sure that you pour in enough water, which should be around 8 ounces (250 ml) of water for each serving of tea., Because herbal tea is better made with hot rather than with boiling water, allow the water to cool for a couple minutes after boiling., Place one teabag in each mug of tea that you are making. Then pour the hot water carefully into each mug. Cover each mug so the tea can steep without too much steam escaping.You can also throw in a couple fresh peppermint leaves if you want!

, Let the covered mugs sit so that the tea can steep. If you prefer mild tea, only let the tea sit for three to five minutes. If you like strong tea, keep the bag in for 10., After your tea is done steeping, remove the tea bag. If the tea bag has a string, simply pull it out by the string. If it doesn’t, fish it out with a spoon so that you don’t burn your fingers.
 If you wish, add extras to your tea like honey, sugar, milk or lemon. If you prefer your tea plain, sip and enjoy it while it’s hot!

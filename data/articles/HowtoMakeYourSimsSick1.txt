 There are different ways you can get your Sims sick, but depending on which version you are playing, you may need to purchase an expansion pack. Here are some examples:


The Get to Work expansion for the Sims 4 will allow you to choose careers (such as medical) that might bring you in contact with illnesses.
The Seasons expansion for the Sims 3 will allow you to change the seasons, making it easier for your Sim to catch illnesses, such as pneumonia and hay fever.
Late Night for the Sims 3 will allow your Sim to purchase junk food from a food truck, which will increase their chances of getting sick.
Pets for the Sims 2 will allow your Sim to get sick from an animal bite.;
, Your Sims' immune system will go down, making it easier for them to get sick in the first place.
 Make your Sim wear summer clothing (such as shorts, tank tops, and sandals) in very cold weather. This will work even in the Sims 2.
 The virus will eventually transfer to the healthy Sim, making him or her sick. Here are some examples:


Make your Sim go to school and play with a sick kid.
Make your Sim kiss someone who is sick.
 Make sure that they are not close to a ladder, or they will get out before they can get sick. Keep in mind, however, that spending too much time in a pool can result in drowning. This will work if you have the Sims 3 Seasons expansion pack.
 Your Sim will develop pneumonia. Keep in mind, however, that this may also kill your Sim.


If your Sim gets sick, you can keep them sick by avoiding things like tea and orange juice, which will help them get better faster., Don't let your Sim bathe, shower, wash his or her hands, or use the restroom. Eventually, he or she will get sick or nauseous.


It'll take about two in-game days before your Sims' hygiene starts to drop.

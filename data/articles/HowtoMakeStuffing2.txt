, Remove the neck and giblets from inside the cavity of a thawed turkey. Rinse the cavity with cold water and pat the outside dry with a paper towel.
 Use a spoon to pack it in, then pull the skin over the stuffing and seal with small skewers.
 Seal the opening shut in the same manner as the neck cavity. If there's not enough skin to cover the stuffing, tie the legs together or place a piece of bread over the stuffing to hold it in.
 As a general rule, a stuffed bird will need to cook for 20 minutes per pound. Check the temperature by inserting a meat before removing the turkey from the oven. The thigh should be 180 °F (82 °C), and the breast should be 170 °F (77 °C).
 Serve the stuffing in a separate dish.

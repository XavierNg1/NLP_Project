,, You can click on edit if you would just like to add a few things but if you would like to build and change things you need to click "Build".
 The most important button to find once your game has loaded is the "Toolbox" button which can be found towards the right of your top bar. It looks like a red spanner and a blue spanner linked together. With this button you can add your models and decals, sets you've made and subscribed too as well as adding things from "Roblox Sets". This can all be found under "Inventory". If you click on the button next to "Inventory" which is titled "Search" you can search for anything on Roblox.
 The next most important button is "Anchor". This can be located in the middle of your top bar and looks like a black straight line with black straight diagonal lines coming out of it. This button can be used on any brick to prevent it from moving or, in a war game, being destroyed.
 You'll find ways to change colours, materials and surfaces as well as other things.


Once you become an advance Roblox studio user you'll be able to use and understand the other parts of it like "Explorer", "Workspace" and "Insert" but it's best to come on to those later by watching some videos on YouTube.

 Most pet stores carry chewing blocks made of wood. These are designed for gerbils, as their teeth grow continuously. Your gerbil will need access to his chew toys every day to manage his ever-growing teeth so he can keep them sufficiently worn down.Make sure the chew toy you give your gerbil is made with untreated wood. Treated wood could contain harmful chemicals that can be dangerous for gerbils.
 If you're skeptical of buying chew toys or just want to save some money, a small branch from a fruit tree is a great option for your gerbil. It will allow him to chew as much as he wants to keep his teeth in check.


Apple trees make an ideal wood for gerbils. You can also give your gerbil willow, beech, birch, or pine branches.If you give your gerbil a wooden branch, make sure the tree was not sprayed with any pesticides. These can cause serious health problems for your gerbil, so make sure the wood is clean and untreated., You should check your gerbil's front teeth on a regular basis. If you are providing your gerbil with wooden objects to chew on, his teeth should not be a problem. However, if your gerbil has any tooth pain or other dental problems, he may stop eating/chewing, leading to overgrown teeth.If your gerbil's teeth become overgrown, take him to the vet. Your vet may be able to fix his dental problems.
Do not attempt to cut or file your gerbil's teeth at home under any circumstances. This can cause serious injury to your gerbil, and could stress him out to the point where he no longer trusts you.

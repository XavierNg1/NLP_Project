 If you are going to include items that need to sit at the bottom of the bucket (like a tree branch, etc.) make room so that you can fit the piece on the bottom.
 If you have large, protruding items, add them first to the bucket and then you can build around them.
 For example, if you include a few protruding birch tree branches, surround the branches with pine cones and embed small twinkling lights around the pine cones to add sparkle.
 The smallest, special touches should be added after your structure has been created. This includes touches of glitter, lights or small berries.

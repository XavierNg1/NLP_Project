 This removal method requires a second person to work, since two hands are needed to pull the dental floss under the nails. If your nails are already very damaged, or if you are worried about damaging your nails, this method probably is not the best option, as it often takes layers off of the natural nail as the acrylic is pried off.
 Use a cuticle stick to gently pry up the entire bottom edge.
 He or she should face you, slip the dental floss under the bottom edge of the nail, and hold the two ends of the dental floss in either hand.
 Tell him or her to slide the floss back and forth and pull it up, so that the nail begins to come loose. Continue this sawing motion until the acrylic nail is free from the natural nail.









Make sure your partner doesn't yank the floss upward too quickly; you don't want your natural nail getting torn off with the acrylic.
Repeat the process with every nail until they're all removed.
 Use a buffer to clean up your natural nails, which may be a little torn from the process. Apply cuticle cream and moisturizer.
 Your nails should be acrylic free.Â

 Possums are attracted to yards and homes where food is plentiful. By removing food sources, you will make your property dramatically less appealing.


Do not intentionally provide food for the possums. You may think that you are doing a good deed, but possums fed by humans gradually lose their fear of humans and are more likely to become aggressive when food is not given to them.
Prevent possums from getting into your trash. Keep the lid of your garbage cans closed by securing it with bungee cords, chains, ropes, or weights. You could also by garbage cans with lids that have clamps to keep them on. Securing side handles to stakes driven into the ground will prevent the trash bins from tipping over.Feed your pets indoors. If this is not possible, feed your pets outdoors in the late morning or middle of the afternoon. Remove all sources of food and water before dusk settles in, and keep pet food away from pet doors or other openings to the house.
Keep food in secure compost containers. Do not use open compost piles. Instead, keep the compost in covered compost structures or covered worm boxes.
Clean barbecue grills and grease traps after you use them.
Pick up fruit that drops from trees or bushes. Better yet, avoid having plants that produce appetizing fruit.
Avoid laying out bird seed. If you do provide bird seed, try to lay some out in the late morning or mid-afternoon and only spread enough to feed the birds for that single day. Alternatively, fill bird feeders with seed and transfer them inside each night at dusk.



Mow tall grass, especially around houses and other buildings.
Remove piles of wood, grass clippings, or other debris. This also includes items like overturned planters or barrels.

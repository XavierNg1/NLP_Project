 Spaghetti can be eaten with nothing more than a single fork (in fact, this is how the Italians do it).Almost any standard-sized dinner fork will work.;
, Lift your fork and, with a scooping motion, gather a small number of strands between the tines of the fork. Point the fork sideways to keep the strands from falling out. Give the fork a quick (but gentle) jerk upward to separate these strands from the rest.


You really only need a few strands of spaghetti here. Two, three, or four strands may not look like much, but it will give you a good bite of pasta once it's wound up.
 Now, with the spaghetti strands still in the fork, gently press its points into a flat part of the plate or bowl. A curved lip at the edge of a plate or the sloped side of a bowl will work well, but any smooth, flat part will work.


The main thing you're trying to do here is separate the strands in your fork from the rest of the spaghetti.
 Now, use your fingers to twist the fork around and around in circles. The spaghetti strands caught in the tines will start wrapping around the fork and form a bundle. Keep winding until you have a tight, tidy little bundle of wrapped-up spaghetti.


If you notice other strands stuck to your spaghetti, jerk the fork upward and bounce it up and down a few times to separate it. The bundle should stay (mostly) on the fork.
 Now, carefully move the fork up to your mouth. Put the entire bundle in at once. Chew, swallow, and repeat!


If the bundle is too big, start over with fewer strands of spaghetti. Bundles that are too big are a recipe for spills and messy sauce drips.

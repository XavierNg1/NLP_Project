 Contracts vary according to duration, flights, teaching days, benefits, lodging, retirement accounts, day care and free tuition for children. The following are things to consider when looking at the contract.


Look at the contract and contact days. The contract length lists how many days you must report to school. The contact days means how many days you are expected to teach the students. A contract with 170 contact days is likely to give more vacation time than a contract with 250 contact days.
Research the standard of living in a country when you evaluate the salary. Buy travel books or look online to see what the average salary is and what amenities and food cost. Don't assume that a lower salary means it's not a good job.
 Start the official paperwork once you sign your contract. You will need to submit all the necessary proof up to 6 months in advance.

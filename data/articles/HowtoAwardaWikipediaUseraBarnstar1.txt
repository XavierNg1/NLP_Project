 A barnstar is the highest honor that you can give to a user, and you should only give the user a barnstar if they truly deserve it.
 You can find a list of barnstars that you can give a user here.
 You can do this either manually or with Twinkle, a gadget that registered users get access to when they become autoconfirmed users after being on for four days and making at least ten edits.

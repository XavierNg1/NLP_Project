 Remove all loose gravel, sand, dirt, and cement with a clean, stiff wire brush.;
, Screw 2 short pieces of 1 inch by 6 inch (2.54 cm by 15.24 cm) lumber together at a 90-degree angle to form an "L" shape.


The form can also be held together using several long pieces of duct tape.
 Place the wood form against the damaged corner of the concrete step so it is flush with the top of the step. Tape the form to the step firmly with duct tape.
 Spray a coat of cooking oil spray on the inside of the wood form to prevent the wood from sticking to the new concrete.
 Use a paint brush to apply a thick coat of latex bonding liquid on the damaged portion of the concrete step were you will be applying the new concrete.
 Mix a small amount of quick-setting cement in a plastic bucket according to the instructions on the packaging.
 Moisten the area where you are going to be adding the new cement so that the existing concrete will not draw the moisture out of the wet cement, making it less likely to harden properly.
 Use a pointed trowel to scoop the cement onto the damaged portion of the step and press it into the wood form. Overfill the wood form slightly.
 Use the flat side of the trowel to smooth the cement so it is flush with the remaining portion of the step.
,, Use a spray bottle to moisten the new concrete patch 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days. Then moisten the patch twice daily for a week.

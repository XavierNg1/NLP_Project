 Never take a personal attack (especially on an anonymous Internet message board) personally. Trolls, and their associated blathering, are only looking to provoke an emotional response for the trolls' entertainment. Don't fall for it!;
, This is known as ad hominem and is a logical fallacy and probably one of the most frequently used tactics on the Internet of distracting readers from the original topic or of attempting to discredit the poster. If the responder is employing ad hominem, then they have already gone a long way to losing all credibility to those that frequent the message board and understand even the most rudimentary processes of social discourse.
 Remember, written communication is highly ineffective at conveying nonverbal communication such as tone, inflection, body language, etc. There are few things more embarrassing than crafting a scathing response just to realize you misinterpreted the responders intention. But after reading this, you wouldn't do that anyway, right?

, If you determine that the criticism is ad hominem, no response is necessary on your part. If you do respond, it may be only to point out their transgression of logical reasoning. It may be tempting to employ ad hominem of your own, but by doing so (no matter how well employed), you have just joined them as bottom feeders.
 If they have, do not respond OR respond only to point out how and why their assertions are invalid.

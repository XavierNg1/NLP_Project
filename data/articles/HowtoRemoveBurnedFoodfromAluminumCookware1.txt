 Grab a metal scraper and start scraping the surface very gently; you don't wantÂ to scratch it. Keep doing this until you have removed all the burned food., Pour the cleaner in a bowl and mix baking soda with it. This will enhance the ability of the cleaner. Next, take a soft rag or cloth and start cleaning the pan both on the surface and on the underside.

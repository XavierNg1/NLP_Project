 If you've purchased the netting from a craft or fabric store, it'll probably be jagged on the side that was cut in the store. Trim this edge using a square rule, yardstick or table edge.


Fold down the edge 5mm (0.19") on one side and stitch all the way along.
Repeat for each edge of the netting, until you've stitched a hem on all of the netting.
Fold again and stitch the new fold to cover raw edges. This final stitch around will also give a clean and sturdy line.


Fold the hemmed net in half. Do this lengthways.
Pin this fold down 6cm (2.3").
Sew across the top down 2cm (1-ish inch), then sew a row 6cm (2.3") down.
 It can be any height you consider appropriate but if you're looking for guidance, around 2 metres (2.1 yards) from the floor is good.

Be sure to check for wall studs before mounting the rod. If not, use a bolt or toggle to assist.
 Gather as you push, until the whole mosquito net fits properly. To keep firmly in place, finish by pushing an acorn end onto the rod., Drape over yourself each night upon going to bed. Push it out a long way from your face and head so that it doesn't bother you. If the netting doesn't adequately catch itself to keep the open area shut, use binder clips or similar to keep it closed during sleep.

Tie back hooks and tie backs are optional additions but helpful for keeping the netting off the bed when not in use. Or, just tie it all in a loose hanging knot above your head.

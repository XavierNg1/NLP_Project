 A daily planner, small notebook, sticky notes, highlighters, and a calendar are recommended. You can either buy these at a store or make your own.


You may also want stickers and different colored pens.





;
, Choose a good spot in your room (or anywhere you'll see it often) and hang it up. Use highlighters and pens to mark special dates, such as sporting events or when your English essay is due.


You may also want to highlight when your class periods start and end. This way you're never caught off guard.
 Depending on what type of planner you get, fill in your information accordingly. Make notes to yourself about homework, pep rallies, and other events you participate in.
 Stick them up on your bathroom mirror with homework reminders, TV show times, and anything else you need to remember! Don't limit yourself to just your bathroom mirror, stick them anywhere you'll see them. (Make sure this doesn't bother your parents and/or siblings.)

, Make sure that all your homework is finished within three hours before bedtime, if you can. The faster you finish your academics the faster the social aspects of your life can begin.
 If you have an after-school job, life is even more hectic for you. Make a few copies of your weekly schedule and keep one with you at all times. This way you know when and if you have any free time., If you can't fit a whole day in, make sure you at least get eight hours of down-time per week. Enjoy your free time by participating in hobbies, hanging out with family, and relaxing.

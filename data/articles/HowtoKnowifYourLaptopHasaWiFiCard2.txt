 The Start menu is located at the bottom left of the computer screen. Click on the Start button to open the menu, then click on "Control Panel.", When the Control Panel opens, locate the icon that says "System and Security." Click the icon, then select "System." Within the System folder, you will see the Device Manager. Click to open.You may be prompted to enter an administrator password or confirmation when opening the Device Manager.
 The Device Manager shows you all the devices installed on your computer. Open "Network Adapters" to find a list of any Bluetooth, Ethernet, or WiFi Adapters.
 There is no one name for the WiFi card, so you will have to go through the list and look for something with "wireless," "802.11," or "WiFi" in the name.


If you don't see anything with "wireless" or "WiFi" in the name, then you do not have a wireless card.

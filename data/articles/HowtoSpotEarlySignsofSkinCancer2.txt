 You can help prevent skin cancer by wearing SPF. You should apply SPF 30 or more to any area of your body that will be exposed to the sun. Use about one ounce of sunscreen to cover your skin every time you apply it.


You can wear moisturizer with sunscreen on your face to help prevent clogging your pores., In order to help prevent skin cancer, you should avoid going outside during the times when the sun is at its peak. This is typically between the hours of 10 am and 2 pm. This is because the sunâ€™s rays are most direct during this time of day.


If you have to be outside, try to stay in the shade as much as possible., When you are going to spend a long time in the sun, you should wear protective coverings over your body. This means you should wear long pants, long sleeve shirts, hats, and sunglasses.


This will limit unwanted UV radiation exposure to your skin., If you are not sure if your mole or skin area is skin cancer, make an appointment with your dermatologist. If you are at high risk, you should have regular exams with your dermatologist to keep track of it. If you have had severe sunburn recently, you may also need to get checked out.


If your dermatologist is worried about a mole, you may need a shave biopsy to check the tissue.

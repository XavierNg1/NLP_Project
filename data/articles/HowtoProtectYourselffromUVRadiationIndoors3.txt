 If you wear eyeglasses, use lenses that help protect your eyes against UV radiation. While most lenses do so to some degree, some require an added treatment for 100% protection. Next time you get new glasses, ask your optometrist about the best option for UV protection.Note that UV resistant contacts can help, but cannot fully protect your eyes from UV radiation.
 Whenever you are exposed to sunlight for extended periods of time, even while indoors, it's worth wearing sunglasses. The quality of the sunglasses matters substantially. They should meet ANSI UV requirements, meaning that they block at least 99% of UV rays. They may also be labeled “UV absorption up to 400 nm.”If there is not a label regarding UV protection, or if the label says “cosmetic,” the UV protection the sunglasses offer will be partial at best.
Note that the darkness of the lenses does not correspond with the sunglasses ability to deflect UV rays.
 Industry and commercial use of machinery that produces UV radiation can quickly and significantly damage your eyesight. For this reason, businesses and unions have strong, specific regulations about the required protection to use in these environments. Follow these regulations at all times.In particular, goggles (usually built into a face shield) should be used whenever you’re welding.
Whatever the eye wear used at your place of work, it should fit snugly to your face, with no gaps through which UV radiation might reach your eyes.
Protective equipment for these types of uses should be designed specifically for this use. Do not use anything else for this purpose.

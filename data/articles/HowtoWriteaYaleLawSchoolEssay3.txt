 This seems simple, but there are a lot of applicants who blatantly ignore the 250-word limit in order to make their essay remarkable. Don't do this—an important part of the assignment is to see whether you can express yourself concisely.
 Step away from it once you've finished and do something else for an hour or so. Then, come back and reread it. You should then give it to friends and family member to read and critique.
 While careful editing is important, you can do too much. Don't edit so much that your essay loses its playfulness.


No reader is going to hinge her impression of your essay on your decision between two equally reasonable options. In fact, your reader isn’t even going to be aware of your choice. A decision over minutiae rarely makes or breaks an essay. If you’re in an advanced stage of writing and puzzling over two (or even three or four) compelling possibilities of sentence structure or word choice, chances are, all of them are fine.

 Here's Bella's room as it is described in the book: The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window... The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew.;
, Bella's room is a mint-ish green color. If you can't find that, choose a sage green. Do not make the color too dark or too light.
 Cream may be the best choice, although white lace will work fine as well.
 It doesn't matter which size bed you have, as long as it has an oak headboard, or no headboard at all. Her bedding is not explained in the book, so anything you'd like is fine.


To produce the "Bella" look, keep the bedding designs subtle. Bella does not like too much attention, so it is assumed that she would want a calm bedroom: solid colors or floral designs are fine. (In the movies she has light purple bedding and a nice dark purple floral print and pale lavender pillows.)

, In the book, it says that Bella has a "second-hand computer" on her desk. Consider having one of those, or any computer. You should also add a lamp, some picture frames, and maybe even a little cactus since Bella loves her hometown of Phoenix, Arizona.
, Spritz some floral-smelling perfume or air freshener around your room to keep it smelling fresh.

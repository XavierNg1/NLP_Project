 A 115-volt welder can handle aluminum up to an eighth of an inch thick (3 mm) with adequate preheating, and a 230-volt machine can weld aluminum that's up to a quarter of an inch thick (6 mm). Consider a machine with an output greater than 200 amps if you will be welding aluminum daily.;
, Aluminum requires a shielding gas of pure argon in contrast with steel, which typically uses a blend of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2). This should not require any new hoses, although you may need to replace regulators that were designed specifically for CO2.
 Electrode thickness is especially critical with aluminum and there is an extremely narrow range to consider. Thinner wire is more difficult to feed, while thicker wire requires greater current to melt. The electrodes for welding aluminum should beÂ .035 of an inch in diameter (less than 1 mm). One of the best choices is 4043 aluminum. A harder alloy like 5356 aluminum is easier to feed, but will require more current.

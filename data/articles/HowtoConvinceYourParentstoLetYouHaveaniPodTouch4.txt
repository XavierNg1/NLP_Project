 A good time to ask for an iPod is near a birthday or Christmas or another holiday. If you do ask for one around those times, don't ask for a lot. Your iPod will be your "big" present.


If your parents have been arguing or talking a lot about money, it is not a good time to ask for an iPod. Wait until you stop hearing those kinds of conversations.
Don’t stress that you need the iPod immediately. Instead say, “I know that maybe I can’t get this immediately, so I was thinking that I could wait for a few months, or until my birthday.”

, If you can ask when you can have a long discussion, your results will be better than if you ask when your parents are rushed or irritated.


Car rides are a good time to ask, since your parents will be sitting for a long time.
If you spend time doing chores together, like washing dishes, your parents might be able to spend more time talking to you.
 If your parents say that the iPod is too expensive, they may not be able to afford it. Wait a few months, and try to save up some money before asking again.


Do not whine or complain that everyone else has an iPod. Instead, revisit previous steps, and try to demonstrate why having the iPod would be useful to you.
If your parents turn you down without much explanation, do not be too aggressive. Wait a month or so, and then casually bring up the reasons that you would like an iPod again.
 If your parents seem like they might say yes, but have some reservations, make sure that they know how responsible you will be.


Let them know that you will not be distracted while your parents want you to be paying attention to them. Say, “I won’t let the iPod distract me from what is important. I won’t use the iPod when you’re talking to me either.”
Make sure they know that your schoolwork won't suffer either. Say, “I know that you might be worried that I won’t pay attention in class. I really only want the iPod for my down time, or when I’m waiting for the bus. I won’t use it during school.”

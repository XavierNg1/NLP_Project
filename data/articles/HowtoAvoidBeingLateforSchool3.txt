 A frequent problem is slapping the snooze button and drifting off again.Don't do this. Instead, when your alarm goes off, think fast, get out of bed straight away. If the snooze button turns out to be hard to resist, place your alarm somewhere else in the bedroom so that you have to get up to turn it off. By the time you're up, you're up.


Move your alarm clock to the complete opposite side of the room (away from your bed). So you have to physically get up out of bed each time the alarm goes off.
Play the alarm or music as loudly as you can in the morning, so that you can't stand it any longer, and you just want to get out of bed.
 If not, get dressed. Head down to breakfast and eat at a sensible pace. Don't bolt down your food.
 If needed, wash your face as well.
 You'll now be sure get to school before it's too late!

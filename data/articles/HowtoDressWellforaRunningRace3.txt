 Run with a water bottle to stay hydrated during your race. This is important in any kind of weather. Water bottles with hand-straps, runnersâ€™ belts with water bottles, and CamelBaks are designed to make carrying your water easier.You can also place water bottles along your route.
Some races have stations where runners can grab a cup of water.
 Hair that flies around can be distracting during a race. Headbands, ponytails, and clips keep hair off of your face and out of your eyes. For longer hair, find a ponytail holder or braid style that will keep your hair in place.Keeping hair out of your eyes helps with your visibility.
A ponytail or braid also keeps long hair off of your neck, which can get uncomfortable and sweaty.
A slipping ponytail or braid can be a distraction. Make sure yours will stay in place.
 Runners accessorize with all kinds of electronic gear. Headphones and watches are common gear for races. The best headphones for running are waterproof, light, and comfortable, with a secure fit.Watches help runners keep track of time, show different splits for intervals, and can even come with GPS.All of the technology you race with should be lightweight and comfortable so it does not distract you.

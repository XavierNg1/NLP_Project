 Western and English saddles are measured a bit differently, so before you make any measurements it is important to know what type of saddle you are looking for. Additionally, you want to examine the quality and style of the saddle differently depending on the type of work you plan on doing in it.
 Just as most saddles are built for the ‘average’ horse, they are also built to fit the ‘average’ rider. If you are very tall, petite, overweight, or any number of things that affect the overall size/shape of your body, you may need to get a special saddle. Just remember that when you sit in a saddle, the following should occur:


There should be a four inch space from your body to the front of the swell/pommel.
You should never be sitting so that you are resting against the cantle or the swell/pommel.
Your stirrups should fit comfortably without forcing too much bend in the knee.
 Sit in a regular chair with your back against the chair back and your feet on the floor. Use a soft measuring tape and measure the distance from your kneecap to the crease in your hip. This can be used in a size converter to determine the size of your saddle.
 Use your measurement to determine the seat size (and therefore the saddle size) of an English saddle. The measurement/size approximately equates as:


A leg/seat measurement of 16.5-inches or less equals a 15-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 16.5–18.5 inches (41.9–47.0 cm) equals a 16-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 18.5–20 inches (47.0–50.8 cm) equals a 16.5-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 20–21.5 inches (50.8–54.6 cm) equals a 17-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 21.5–23 inches (54.6–58.4 cm) equals a 17.5-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement larger than 23 inches (58.4 cm) will fit an 18-inch or 19-inch saddle., The measurement of seat is a bit different for western saddles than it is for English saddles. The easiest conversion is to subtract two inches from the size of your English saddle, and you’ll be left with the size of your western saddle. Use the following chart to determine your Western saddle size based on your leg/seat measurement:


A leg/seat measurement of 16.5-inches or less equals a 13-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 16.5–18.5 inches (41.9–47.0 cm) equals a 14-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 18.5–20 inches (47.0–50.8 cm) equals a 15-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 20–21.5 inches (50.8–54.6 cm) equals a 15.5-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement of 21.5–23 inches (54.6–58.4 cm) equals a 16-inch saddle.
A leg/seat measurement larger than 23 inches (58.4 cm) will fit an 17-inch or 18-inch saddle., When you’ve gotten your measurement, you can compare that to the seat size of a saddle to determine if it is in your size range. To measure the seat of an English saddle, measure from one of the ‘nails’ to the left or right of the pommel, straight back to the center of the cantle. This will give you the size of the saddle (for example, 16-inches).
 Similar to sizing your seat, the measurement of a western saddle seat is different from an English saddle seat. Using a tape measure or a ruler, measure straight from the base of the pommel to the stitching in the seat. Go to the base of the pommel and measure in a horizontal line straight back.


Be careful not to touch the saddle pommel when you measure the seat, as the angle of it will give you too large of a measurement. Go to just the base of the pommel along the stitching.
 Although your leg/seat measurement and saddle size can be a good indication of a well-fitting saddle, the only way to tell if a saddle truly fits is to sit in it. Try out many different saddles in several different styles to find the best fit and comfort level according to your personal preference. Be sure to adjust the stirrups to their proper length every time you try on a saddle.It is better to go with a saddle that is a bit too large than one that is a bit too small. It will be less painful for the horse, and easier for you to ride.
Bring a trained friend or two along to make sure you are sitting properly in the saddle.

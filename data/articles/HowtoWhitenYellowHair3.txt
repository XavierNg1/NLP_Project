 Find a tiny bottle of this dark purple liquid, at low concentrations (preferably 2%). It will usually be in the same aisle as bandages and antiseptics.
 Don't add any more, or you may end up with purple hair! The water should be a violet color, not dark purple.


Careful — gentian violet will stain anything it touches. You may want to try this outside instead of in your sink.
 Leave your hair underwater for 30–60 seconds. This should lighten your hair color and reduce yellow or brassy tones.
 Keep in mind that your towel may be stained purple.
 Repeat the process once a week for continuous color.

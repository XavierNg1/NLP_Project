 Make sure to use big, medium, and small pieces when choosing the artwork for your gallery wall. The bigger pieces will act as an anchor, bringing the composition together. The smaller pieces will be used to fill in the space around the centerpiece., To balance the composition, you need both vertical and horizontal pieces. Also, in addition to rectangular pieces, try to have square-shaped pieces (and even oval-shaped pieces) of art to create a balanced composition.Don’t skip oddly shaped pieces. Oddly shaped pieces can add an interesting element to your composition.
 Using different mediums will elevate your gallery wall to the next level. Choose from abstract paintings, photography, drawings, oil paintings, prints, and/or collages, to name a few.You can even create a theme by choosing three or four different mediums that complement each other like photography, drawings, and prints, for example.
 Pick artwork whose colors compliment each other like gold, beige, pink, and red, for example. This will help bring the composition together once it is finished.Keeping your color palette consistent will also make framing your artwork easier.
 Make sure your frames complement the color palette of your art pieces. Your frames should also be cohesive—they should all fall in the same color range or contrast each other.For example, white, beige, and light pink frames, or contrasting black and white frames.

 Mildew appears as grey powdery patches on top of the surface of the leaf.;
, You can brush mildew off with your hands but this won't rid your plant of the disease. If you spot a leaf blighted with mildew, prune back the shoot to a healthy leaf, or even to the ground if it needs it. Make sure you check the entire plant thoroughly, pruning as you go.
 If removing all the diseased leaves will leave your plant completely bare, consider using a pesticide/fungicide spray. This won't cure the disease but it will stop it spreading. Always follow the instructions on the spray container carefully.


Hold the bottle about 30 centimeter (11.8Â in) away from the plant and spray enough to coat the leaf but not enough to cause any drips.






Treat the plant either early, or late in the day, so you don't spray pollen-spreading insects like bees.
Wait 14 days and then repeat.
 To stop your plants from getting mildew, keep them well watered and fed, particularly at the beginning of the growing season.

 An apprenticeship provides on-the job training and classroom instruction. Most apprenticeship programs cost $400 to $1,000 a year, and take 3 to 5 years to complete. Most apprentices in Maine are paid about 50 percent of the market rate during on-the-job training. There are several options for apprenticeship programs in Maine.


Select a Maine Apprenticeship Program (MAP). Offered through the state to increase workforce development, MAP electrician apprenticeships offer on-the-job training and classroom instruction, and reimburses up to 50 percent of the tuition costs. MAP matches electrician job candidates with potential employers for apprenticeships.
Choose a union apprenticeship program. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) in cooperation with the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (NJATC) offers apprenticeship programs in Maine. The IBEW sponsors aspiring electricians through its apprenticeship program, and provides career placement assistance and continuing education opportunities. Union apprenticeships are offered in several locations in Maine, including Fairfield, Lewiston and Augusta.
Select an online electrician program. Online apprenticeship programs allow students to complete classroom training online. Most online programs match students with local apprenticeship programs for on-the-job training. Ensure the online electrician program is approved by the State of Maine Electrician's Examining Board before enrolling in classes.

 The sexton, or manager, is in charge of overseeing many transactions and arrangements for burial plots in the cemetery. The first step in arranging a cemetery buy-back is to identify who your cemetery's sexton is.


Search the cemetery's website for a directory or contact information. The website should list who the manager or sexton is.
If you cannot determine who the sexton is using the cemetery's website, you can try visiting the cemetery's main office in person.
 It may feel awkward to ask a cemetery employee about buying back your plot, but it happens quite often and is nothing to be embarrassed about. Not all cemeteries will engage in buybacks, but many do. If your cemetery offers buybacks, the sexton/manager will be the best person to speak with.Generally speaking, cemeteries are not obligated to engage in a buyback. However, many cemeteries will buy unused plots back, or at least recognize an outside sale., If the cemetery offers buybacks, the sexton/manager will most likely be the person to make the arrangements. In completing the transaction, the sexton will most likely consider how much you paid for the plot, how much it will be worth on the market today if sold to a new buyer, and arrive at a financial offer for you.

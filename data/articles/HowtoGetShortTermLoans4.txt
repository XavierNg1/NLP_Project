 There are innumerable online short-term loan services. (Speedy Cash, Check into Cash, Advance America are just a few.) Additionally, most physical short-term loan locations offer online loan services as well. Search the internet, or call a local office in your area to find a provider.
 After selecting the provider youâ€™d like to work with, visit their website and fill out an online application. You will be asked questions about your identity, your employment status, and your income., Depending on your state, you may be asked to scan or fax in some supporting documents. This would include documents like a state I.D. or passport (to verify your identity), and check stubs or bank statements (to verify your work status and income)., Once you are approved for the loan, you will be asked to link a checking account. This serves two purposes. First, by linking a checking account, the lender can now direct deposit money. Second, the lender can access your bank account to draw payments for the loan and/or fees at a later date.Be sure that you understand the terms of your loan agreement before you link your checking account.
Find out exactly when (and if) they will be drawing money.
 Once your checking account is linked and verified, you will receive your money in anywhere from a few hours to the following business day.The loan repayment (as well as any finance charges) are then electronically withdrawn on the maturity date of the loan.
Most payday lenders offer to renew the loan for a fee, thus creating a cascading level of debt on the borrower.

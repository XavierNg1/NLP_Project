 Be aware many venues may be reserved for New Year's Eve parties. Try to make reservations more than a year in advance, if possible. Schedule the times for night, starting your reception at around 8:00 so your guests will be there at midnight to ring in the new year.;
, Because it's a holiday, many people may have standing plans or reservations they'll need to cancel. Do this as soon as you have officially determined the date, aiming for at least six months in advance.
 Since guests will be eating later, it's a good idea to just stick with hor d'oeuvres and dessert for food. Mention in the invitation that guests should eat something beforehand and you'll be serving snacks and appetizers since they'll be eating later than usual. Make sure you include lots of champagne on your drink list, as well as coffee.
 Having a wedding on New Year's Eve is a good opportunity to do a black tie event. Everyone will enjoy the chance to dress up to ring in the year. Black, gold and silver are the colors typically associated with New Year's, so use those if you can.
 Do this around 3 months in advance instead of the usual 2 month timeframe used for wedding invitations.
 When doing a black tie theme, red and white roses are a great choice for flowers. Include noise makers, confetti, and party hats. Have a big clock or TV for the countdown.
 Good examples are personal champagne bottles, fortune cookies, a CD with the songs which were a hit during the past year, bells which say ring in the new year with your names or personalized calendars for the year to come (do it yourself or use the local copy shop).

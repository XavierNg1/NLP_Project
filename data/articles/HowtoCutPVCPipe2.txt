 There are two kinds of PVC pipe cutters: scissor style and ratcheting style. Scissor style pipe cutters are ideal for 1/2” to 1” PVC pipe, but are sometimes too difficult to use even for pipe that big. It's recommended instead that you use a ratcheting plastic pipe cutter, ideal for larger sized pipes and also effective for smaller. It's much safer and more reliable.


The arm strength necessary to use scissor-style cutters is sometimes a little extreme, and it would be easier to just use a saw of some kind. Investing in a ratchet style cutter will make your job a whole lot easier.
 Pipe-cutters have an open rounded edge to seat the pipe into, and a blade that will extend as you squeeze the trigger on the handle. Mark where you want the cut to be made, then seat the pipe in the mouth of the cutter to start cutting.
 Squeeze the hand-grip trigger on the handle of the pipe cutter to extend the blade and cut the pipe in half. Use your other hand to hold the pipe steady as it's cut. You shouldn't have to work very hard.

 Either run your power line to the area where you plan to put your fountain, or set up your solar power pump. Read the directions that come with the mechanism, as each power line or solar power pump is different.
 Assemble it according to the directions that come with the fountain. Many time, you will have to run the power line up to the fountain.


You will then have to install your pump. However, you should make sure your pump works before you do this. To check that your pump works properly, fill a bucket or container with water and test the pump by running that water through it.
 Raise your pump as high as you would like your water to go. Make sure that the pump is on a level surface and that it cannot be easily displaced by a heavy flow of water.


You can hide the pump mechanism by surrounding it with river rocks. Keep in my that you will most likely have to access it later for cleaning and maintenance, so do not bury it too deeply under river rocks.
 Once the fountain is filled, switch on the pump and adjust the water flow. Remember to regularly check the level of your water, particularly during hot weather.


Hot air could make your water evaporate.
 If you want to have fish in your fountain, determine the kind of fish you want and then find out what sort of environment they need to survive. Keep in mind things like:


How much oxygen in the water they need.
The kind of food they need.
Hiding spaces.
How much space each fish needs.

 Depending on the type of medical procedure you plan to have, you may simply be able to have a friend or taxi pick you up from the hospital. However, if you will be administered anesthesia, the facility may require someone who is able to take you home accompany you to the facility.Aside from the necessity of getting a ride home, a friend or family member can prove invaluable following your procedure.
In fact, many medical professionals recommend that another adult spends time with your for the 24 hours following a medical procedure that involves anesthesia.
Ask someone close by saying something like, "What are you up to next Thursday? I'm having a medical procedure and I need someone to accompany me. If I schedule the procedure for the afternoon, would you be able to join me, and potentially sleep over at my place to make sure there aren't any complications?";
, Especially in those cases where you are required to have another adult accompany you to the procedure, the medical professionals you are working with may have some solid recommendations. Since solo adults are more and more common, they may even offer a service to help address this concern.Simply say something like, "What do you usually recommend for folks in my position?"; or, "What are my options if I can't find a friend to accompany me?"

, There are many different types of medical home care options. You can even hire an after surgery professional to help you keep track of medical information at the facility, get you home, and even get you started on home treatment and recovery for the first 24 hrs.Ask the facility providing your procedure to provide you with a list of agencies that provide these services.

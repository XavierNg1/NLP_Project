 Everyone is familiar with the cat’s meow. This all-purpose “talk” can mean many things, but primarily it means “pay attention to me as I want something from you.” Your cat may want food, attention, petting or may even be signaling that it doesn't want to be touched. Cat owners soon learn to interpret the nuances of their cat’s meowing knowing precisely what’s on their cat’s mind.


After spending some time with your cat, you should be able to understand the difference between your cats meows depending on a variety of variables, such as the time of day or the location of your cat when it meows.;
, Purring is another familiar cat vocalization. While not all cats purr when they are happy, it is a good sign if you are actively petting your cat and it begins to purr. Just don't be discouraged if your cat never purrs, it might just not be in its vocabulary.


Contented cats purr, but cats in distress have also been known to purr. It is believed that purring in these situations, such as when a cat is ill, is a way for the cat to “call” for help.
 Hissing and growling is understood to mean that a cat is afraid and/or angry. NEVER pick up a hissing or growling cat, as it may display aggression and bite you. Leave hissing or growling cats alone if you can or approach them cautiously with a thick towel and leather gloves if you absolutely need to pick them up.

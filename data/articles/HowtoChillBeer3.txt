 While simple, this method gets time-consuming if you’re trying to chill multiple beers. Simply turn the compressed air can upside down and spray the beer until frost forms. Holding the compressed air can upside down will help ensure that it’s at its coolest.For safety, try putting your can or bottle into a Tupperware container and making a hole to spray the compressed air through.
You should also use a pair of gloves to prevent any potential frostbite or injury to your hands.
Also make sure to pour your beer into a clean glass after attempting this method, as some compressed air cans contain a bittering agent that is dangerous to ingest.
 If you don’t have central air, you can place your beer on top of or in front of your AC unit and turn down the temperature. It should take about 15 minutes for your beer to cool.Make sure you watch the beers as they may cool faster than you anticipate and you don’t want them to explode.
Use gloves or an oven mitt to remove the beer to prevent any potential injury to your hands due to the cold.
 If you live somewhere with a winter season or a place with easy access to snow, you can utilize the frozen water for your benefit. Simply open a door or window and place your cans or bottles outside. If possible, try to bury them as deep in the snow as you can. Just make sure you don’t forget them outdoors!

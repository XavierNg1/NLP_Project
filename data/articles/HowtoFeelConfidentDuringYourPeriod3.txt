 Exercising during your period is a great way to relieve cramps and to release endorphins in your body. Endorphins are hormones that are secreted in the brain that help diminish pain and increase positive feelings.Do light exercises like yoga, stretching, brisk walking, and biking. You do not want to over exert yourself, but you do want to get your blood flowing.
 Eating dark chocolate can also cause your body to release endorphins. However, try to stick to small amounts of dark chocolate at a time. Eating too much chocolate can have reverse effects since chocolate has a high sugar content., Pampering yourself while on your period will give your mood a positive boost. Instead of lying around on the couch, go get a manicure or pedicure, or, even better, get a massage. Massages can relieve period symptoms like bloating and cramping. Massages release endorphins in your body, as well., Watching something that will make you laugh will also release endorphins in your body. Watch your favorite comedy with a group of friends to improve your mood and confidence.
 Dancing is a great way to get exercise and release endorphins. Plan to go dancing with your friends at your favorite nightclub. Or, you can even plan your own dance party at home. That way, you can be more comfortable if you donâ€™t feel like dressing up.
 An occasional case of the blues during your period is normal. However, if you have extreme mood swings that affect your relationships, school, or work, you might be battling with a case of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD is similar to PMS, but symptoms like sadness, hopelessness, extreme moodiness, and marked anger or irritability stand out and take over.Contact your doctor if you feel like your symptoms are more serious than occasional feelings of loneliness or deflated confidence during your period.

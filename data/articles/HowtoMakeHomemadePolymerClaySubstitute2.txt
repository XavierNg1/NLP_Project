 This recipe has a higher ratio of glue, which makes it much stickier but also prevents cracks. The addition of glycerin also reduces cracking in the final product.


This recipe also dries much faster, taking only about 30 minutes.
However, after making the recipe you will have to wait at least one night and preferably a week until you can use the dough. This makes it less sticky.
 This will keep your clothes clean and tidy during the process.
 Mix ½ cup water with 2 cups pva (wood) glue in a non-stick pot. Boil them for two minutes while stirring constantly and then remove from the heat.


You can use any white children’s glue but wood glue works best for this recipe because it is stronger.
 Put the cornflour and water in a bowl and pour into the pot of boiling glue and water. Mix the ingredients well.


Cover the dough with plastic while it is cooling.
If using food coloring, add one to two drops and adjust as needed. Otherwise you can paint the clay after drying.
 Remove the dough and knead well. Continue kneading and adding extra cornstarch until the dough becomes less sticky.
 You want to work the gluten in the cornstarch into nice pliable dough. It is now ready for use.
 Put the dough in an airtight bag to prevent it from drying out while you wait until making use of it.

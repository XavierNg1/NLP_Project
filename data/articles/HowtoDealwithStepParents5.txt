 Help them to see that you are willing to let her into your life. Don't try to manipulate or your parents against each other, because that will only make things worse for you, not the parents. (After all, your parents and the stepparent are much smarter than you think!)

, As with any relationship there will be ups and downs so try not to react too strongly to any bumps in the road. Control your feelings and try to look at the big picture, rather than focussing on specific incidents. Enjoy the good moments, and donâ€™t get knocked down by the bad ones., It will not happen suddenly, but you will hopefully find that over time your relationship develops in a new way. It is important to help facilitate this by being open to spending more time together as you become closer, and not pulling down the barriers too quickly., Every relationship moves slowly and is formed within the context of who you are, who your stepparent is and your family dynamics. So, take it slowly but surely and always seek the best from the relationship. Once you have done the above actions with a happy heart and a great attitude, your relationship with your new parent will be better than you could imagine!

 Etymology is the study of the meanings of words. It also looks at the origins of words, and how they have changed over time. By learning about etymology, you can find new ways to define unknown words without using a dictionary. Start by looking at each part of the word in question. It is very helpful to look to see if the word has a common prefix.
Prefixes are the first part of the word. For example, a common prefix is "anti".
"Anti" means "against". Knowing this should help you figure out the meanings of words such as "antibiotic" or "antithesis".
"Extra" is a prefix that means "beyond". Use this to figure out words such as "extraterrestrial" or "extracurricular".
Other common prefixes are "hyper", "intro", "macro" and "micro". You can also look for prefixes such as "multi", "neo" and "omni".
 The suffix are the letters at the end of the word. There are several suffixes in the English language that are common. They can help you figure out what kind of word you are looking at.


Some suffixes indicate a noun. For example, "ee" at the end of the word almost always indicates a noun. Some examples are "trainee" and "employee".
"-ity" is also a common suffix for a noun. Examples include "electricity" and "velocity".
Other suffixes indicate verbs. For example, "-ate". This is used in words such as "create" and "deviate".
"-ize" is another verb suffix. Think about the words "exercise" and "prioritize".
 A root word is the core word, without a prefix or suffix. Most words in the English language come from either a Latin or Greek root word.By learning common root words, you can begin to identify new words more easily. You will also be able to recognize words that have had a prefix or suffix added.
An example of a root word is "love". You can add many things to the word: "-ly" to make "lovely".
"Bio" is a Greek root word. It means "life, or living matter". Think about how we have adapted this root word to become "biology", "biography", or "biodegradable".

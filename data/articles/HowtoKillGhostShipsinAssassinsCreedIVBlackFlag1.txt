 Legendary Ships hit hard, so you'll want to ensure that your ship is up to the challenge. To survive longer in battle, you need to upgrade your ship to take on any damage.You can defeat the Legendary Ships without upgrading everything to the Elite level, but it is highly recommended that you have the Elite Hull upgrade. This can be found in the San Ignacio Wreck.;
, The chain shot has a major role in defeating the Legendary Ships. The cannons fire from both sides of the bowsprit, and the chains demolish the opposing ship's mast and slow the vessel's speed. Upgrade your chain shot as much as possible to keep the enemy vessel from running circles around you.


It is an ideal weapon for the initial phase of the battle. The chain shot is predominantly used during pursuits or while approaching the enemy ship.
The number of shots you have is heavily limited. To increase the limit, you need to buy the appropriate upgrades.
 Besides the chain shot, you're also going to want Elite Swivel Guns, the Elite Ram, Elite Heavy Shot and Elite Broadside Cannons. Having these upgrades will make the fights a bit easier to handle.

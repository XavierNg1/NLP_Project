"Who's" is the contracted form of "who is" and is suitable for use only where the non-contracted form would also be suitable.
Ex. "Who's coming to dinner?"

“Whose” means “of whom or of which” and is a possessive pronoun, meaning it must be used to modify another noun.
Ex. “Whose car is blocking mine in the driveway?"
In question form, “whose” can modify a noun that isn’t explicitly mentioned.
Ex. “Have you ever heard her music?”
“Whose?”
“Kelly’s.”

 Give your rabbit adequate food and shelter. You need to make sure that your rabbit is healthy and happy before attempting to train it. If a rabbit is unhappy or ill, it will be less likely to be interested in completing training sessions with you.;
, Rabbits, and other pets for that matter, don't usually respond well to anger and aggression. The saying "you catch more flies with honey" is very true when it comes to training an animal. Having a positive attitude and being nice will build more trust with a rabbit, and thus make the rabbit more likely to follow your commands, than brute force or hostility.
 Spend a bit of time every day on training. Training should be done in short sessions, consisting of only 5-10 minutes. The goal is to do training consistently but in short bursts., Since training is based on incentives, you’ll need to find a treat that provides the most positive response. If you don’t know what your rabbit’s favorite treat is, experiment a little. If the rabbit leaves a treat alone, then it won’t work as a treat. If the bunny munches a treat right down, you have a winner.


You can offer a new food, in small amounts to avoid digestive upset, once a day and watch the rabbit’s response.

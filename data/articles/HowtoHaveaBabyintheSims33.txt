 Male Sims at the young adult stage or older have a 1 in 3 chance of pregnancy when abducted by aliens. The baby will be completely alien, and unrelated to the father. Here's how to achieve this:


Install the Seasons expansion.
Collect Space Rocks if you can. (They appear mostly at random, but a Collection Helper speeds it up.)
Have a male Sim stargaze outside at night, using a telescope. Repeat each night until abducted.
If the Sim has the Unexpected Weight Gain moodlet when he returns, he is pregnant. If not, try again.
 If you purchase the Lucky Palms world from the Sims Store, you'll have access to a wishing well. You can wish for a child here, but sometimes you'll get an evil one that appears from a black cloud.

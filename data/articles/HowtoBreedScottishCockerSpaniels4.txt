 The mother may have no appetite during the first two days after the birth. As she continues to lactate, her appetite will increase. Slowly increase her daily meals. After three weeks, you may be feeding her four times a day to ensure that she has enough energy to feed her puppies.Some recommend feeding the mother an additional 25% of her normal food for every puppy that she is feeding., Puppies should get their first shots between six and eight weeks of age. Three shots (Distemper, Measles, and Parainfluenza) are needed, but a fourth (Bordetella) is often recommended as well., The puppies will be ready to wean from their mother’s milk at around three or four weeks of age. You can start offering them puppy food at this time. You might even mix a little bit of puppy food into a puppy milk replacer.This should make up about 10% of your puppies’ diet at first. Slowly increase their intake of food over the next few weeks. Your puppies should be eating solid food only by six weeks., Around eight weeks of age, it will be time to take the puppies away from their mother. Contact the new owners, and let them know that their new puppy is ready to take home.

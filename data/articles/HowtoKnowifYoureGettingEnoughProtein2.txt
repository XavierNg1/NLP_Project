 When you’re trying to optimize your protein intake, it’s important to familiarize yourself with how much protein certain foods contain. This will help you make healthy decisions and ensure you consume the proper amount of protein each day. For example:A 3.5 ounce serving of roasted chicken breast contains 31 grams of protein. Typically, an ounce of meat has around 7 grams of protein, as a basic guideline.
A 6 ounce serving of plain Greek yogurt has 17 grams of protein.
One egg contains 6 grams of protein.
A large ear of corn has 4 grams of protein.
 You can make the most of your protein by choosing sources that are lean. Turkey and chicken are great sources of lean poultry. Fish is also a great source of lean protein. If you are a vegetarian, beans, tofu, or tempeh are great sources of protein.Fattier cuts of meat, like hamburger and sausage, are higher in cholesterol and saturated fats and should be consumed in moderation.
Try consuming leaner cuts of beef and pork, like pork loin or top sirloin steak.
 Making sure protein is a part of every meal will help you ensure that you’re consuming an optimal amount of this important macronutrient. Rather than loading up on carbohydrates at breakfast, try eating an egg or some yogurt. Lean meats, seeds, and protein-rich grains like quinoa are great lunch staples. And at dinner, be sure to include a source of protein like fish, meat, tofu or beans.

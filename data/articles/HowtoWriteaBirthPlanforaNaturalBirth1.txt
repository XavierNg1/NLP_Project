 Try to limit your birth plan to roughly one or two pages in length, as it should only consist of your birthing preferences. You don’t need to tell your medical staff or caregiver how to do their job, they are trained professionals in their field. You do need to tell them the specific preferences you have that you feel are necessary during your birthing process.;
, Clearly state the things that you want. It is also important to be more assertive than you otherwise would be with the language you use. You want to make sure that your preferences are clearly laid out.


You don’t want to use words like, “I could possibly” or “Maybe.” You want to make sure that you are using definitive phrased such as “I will want.” This type of language will help your caregiver to understand that you have been very clear in your preferences, thereby preventing surprise requests during the labor and birth.

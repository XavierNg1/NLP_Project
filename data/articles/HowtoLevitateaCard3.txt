 When levitating a card, you would face the deck of cards so that the audience sees the front of the cards.


Hold the deck of cards so that your index finger is behind the deck of cards, hidden from the audience. Simply use your index finger to lift the back card (the one closest to you) up.It helps to use your other hand to pretend you're "levitating" the card to add to the visual effect. From an audience point of view, it looks like a random card in the middle of the deck is levitating, not the back card.
 Get two straws. Take the wrapper about 3/4ths from the top and tear it around so you can take it off, but do not take it off yet.


Rub the majority part of the paper on the straw to create static friction, and quickly take the majority paper off. Absorb the static in your hands by putting the charged straws on them (Note: this will create a positive and negative charge on your hands, which will create force in between them the closer you put your hands together.)
Hold the card on one hand, and push the other hand over the card. If done correctly, the card will react to the forces of the charge, and will levitate!

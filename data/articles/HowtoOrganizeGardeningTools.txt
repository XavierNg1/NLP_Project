 Nail or screw a pegboard to the wall. Place hooks on it so you can hang small hand tools, attach larger tools like rakes or shovels, and create places for gloves, twine or other items you use in your garden. A pegboard is a versatile organizing tool that can be adapted to your needs and the tools you need to store.;
, Store shovels, rakes, hand tillers and other large gardening tools together. Gather up smaller hand tools and put them in one central location. This may be on a shelf, in a bucket or hanging on a wall. Regardless where you put them, store them together.
 Providing several levels that you can use to hang items, a trellis is a nice, decorative organizing tool for your storage area.
 Nail a bucket firmly to a wall. Wrap the garden hose around it until it hangs on its own. Insert your sprinkler into the mouth of the bucket. You've just created a cheap way to get your hose organized and up off the ground.
 If you have a table to place near it, that's even better. The cabinet can be used to store extra pots, potting soil, tools, seeds and other gardening necessities. The cabinet should be made from a material that will withstand the outdoor elements.
 Wash them and remove all labels. Use these jars to store packaged or loose seeds, bulbs or other small items you use when you are gardening. The jars keep the small items from being exposed to the weather or from blowing away.
 With the spout pointing down, insert twine spools into the mouths of the funnels. Thread the twine downward through the tip of the spout. Not only does this keep your twine organized and untangled, but it also gets these items off your tabletop and creates more usable storage space.

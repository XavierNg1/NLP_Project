 Bend knees to a position where the lower part of the upper leg is perpendicular to the ice (90 degrees). Skates are shoulder width apart. The back is straight, and the chest upright. Bend at the hips, shoulders back, the upper body leaning forward (50 degrees), and hold your stick with two hands.;
, If you are right-handed, place your left hand at the top of your stick (the butt end) and place your right elbow to your left hand. That is the standard distance your hands should be apart while stick handling and shooting wrist shots. Hold the stick slightly forward.
 If you lose sight of the puck, your head and neck might be too far back and your eyes up too high.
 From a moving position, keep a low knee bend and keep your feet moving. Acceleration becomes explosive because you are already in a stellar position where your knee bend is low and now you just have to move your feet faster. This allows for instant acceleration from gliding speed to top speed.
 The upper leg angle from which you can get the most powerful push is not 90 but around 120 degrees. Solid skaters should be in a position to push hardest at approximately 120 degrees (your butt should be really low). So if you retract your leg to an angle of 120 degrees to start from, and open up your knee bend to drive your leg hard, you would be past the knee angle (120 degrees) which will provide you with the most powerful leg drive.
 Grab your stick, blade side up, with your right hand, and place it between your chest pads. There you will see your center of gravity: the line from your naval to the floor/ice.
, When a player retracts his leg across the center of gravity, all the energy he uses to pull that leg back in is used to help drive the other leg out when the retracting leg comes across the center of gravity, almost touching the heel of the other skate. During a sprint for the puck, then the legs should be retracted across the center of gravity.
 Fully retract your legs.

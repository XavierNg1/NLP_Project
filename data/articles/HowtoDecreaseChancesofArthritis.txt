 Thinking ahead to the years when your body starts aging and care of itself with that in mind sometimes you can help prevent arthritis pain later in life - or at least help you prevent arthritis for a long time.;
, Excess weight causes the premature wear of the weight-bearing joints, including the feet, ankles, hips, knees and spine.
 The old saying, "If you do not use it, you lose it," is true. By not exercising regularly, muscles weaken and put more pressure on the joints. By exercising on a regular basis, the muscles are allowed to do their job and work with the joints, rather than working together for the muscles.
 While a regular exercise regimen is essential to your overall health, overusing your joints will have a negative effect on your body. The key is regular exercise - instead of trying to accomplish a week's worth of exercise once a week. Exercise daily - or keep a consistent schedule.
 Repetitive movements of the wrists or knees can cause problems later in life. Try to control activities regularly enough to prevent repetitive strain on the joints.
 A healthy diet and keep your bodies properly hydrated are important to prevent the onset of the attack of arthritis.

 If you use a colander or another strainer with larger holes, the quinoa will fall through the holes and into your sink.You can also use a coffee filter if you don't have a strainer., Measure the amount of quinoa that you want to use and pour it into the strainer or coffee filter. Do this carefully to make sure the seeds don't overflow and go into your sink.
 Turn on the cold water from your kitchen sink and let it rinse the quinoa for about five minutes. To quicken the process, you can agitate the quinoa with your hand. You'll know the quinoa is rinsed when the water coming out of the bottom of the strainer is no longer murky.

 Brush or comb through your hair well. Make sure that there are no tangles in your hair at all., Choose a soft elastic headband, the type that wraps all the way around your head to keep your hair out of your face. Working in sections, wrap your hair around the headband and use hairpins to pin the ends in place as you go. Continue until all of your hair has been wrapped around the headband.








You can also wrap you hair around the bottom part of the headband only.
 Unpin each section of your hair and let the curls down. Continue until your hair is completely loose.Keep your sweet, vintage curls in place by scrunching them with a dollop of mousse and spraying your hair lightly with hairspray.

 Slip-resistant stickers, strips, and mats are readily available, and are designed to prevent falls on the slick wet surface of your shower. You can find these sorts of materials at home supply stores and many general merchandise stores. They usually install easily, just like a sticker., Getting in and out of your shower will be much easier if you have something to hold onto. You can also use a grab bar as an orienting point while you are showering.Grab bars can be found at home supply and hardware stores.
 Itâ€™s a good idea to have a mat to step onto once you get out of the shower. This will collect any water that drips off of you, keeping it from pooling on the bathroom floor and posing a slip hazard. Look for a mat that has a bottom surface that is non-slip or that will attach to the floor (with suction cups, for instance)., If you are partially sighted, having your bathroom as bright as possible will make it easier to find items in your shower, and to get in and out safely. You can have additional light installed on your bathroom wall or ceiling, or just add a lamp to increase illumination.Position the lights so that they illuminate the shower itself and the sink area. These are the places which will benefit the most from additional lighting.
 If you are partially sighted, then increasing the contrast of items will make it easier to locate things and to distinguish similar items. This applies to shower and bathroom fixtures as well as to toiletries and showering products. For instance:If you have a light-colored shower, choose a dark-colored shower curtain.
Choose cloths that contrast sharply in color (such as a black one and a white one).
You can also do things like install a dark colored toilet seat on a light colored toilet, and put a strip of high-contrast tape at your desired fill line in your tub, to make it easier to navigate your bathroom in general.

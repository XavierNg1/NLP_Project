 Start off your drawing with the signature hotdog bun. Create the bun by replicating the shape of a large bean.;
, Add the end pieces of the hotdog by creating a C like shape and attaching it on both ends of the bun.
 No hotdog is complete without toppings of course. On top of the hotdog draw a squiggly line to make the ketchup or mustard. Feel free to add other toppings such as relish it's your drawing after all.
 Notice any smudge marks or errors then remove the errors with a good quality eraser.
 Add some colour to your freshly drawn image. Use tan for the bun, brown for the sausage, and yellow or red for the mustard or ketchup.
 Shading the drawing is optional however, it will make the drawing end up looking better.
 Use a dark colour to outline the drawing to really make it pop.

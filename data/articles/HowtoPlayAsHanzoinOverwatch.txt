 Like his brother Genji, Hanzo has the ability to run at walls and climb up them. Run at any wall and press "A/X"; hold that button and move the left analog stick up.;
, By pressing and holding the right trigger, Hanzo will prepare to fire an arrow at enemies. Line them up in your sights, then release the trigger.


Players in Overwatch tend to be extremely mobile, meaning you must move along with enemies' movements. Practice adjusting your aim while walking. You will need to perfect your reaction time.
Aim for headshots. These tend to do the most damage when landed.
Draw the bow all the way back before loosing arrows. This will give them max amount of power when fired.
 Press the left bumper to switch to Sonic arrows. Hanzo can use these to track enemies nearby via sonar.


While enemies are detected, use this opportunity to perhaps find a perch with a more clear view.
 Press the right bumper to switch to Scatter arrows. These arrows fragment on contact, and will ricochet off any surfaces.
 After dealing a certain amount of damage, you will unlock your Special Ability. Press "Y/Triangle" to switch to the Dragonstrike arrow. Launching this arrow will summon a dragon spirit that travels in a straight line, and will eliminate any enemies in its path.
 Hanzo has no need to reload, so you can shoot endlessly. But don't shoot blindly. Stand behind some protection, and take a peek out. Once an enemy is located, fire at them while you can. Duck behind cover when they discover you. If they start firing, wait for them to pause, then jump right back out and fire again. Try keeping your arrows aligned with where you expect them to be.

 A lobe is a separate section of the leaf that radiates off the central point, kind of like the fingers on your hand. Most sycamore leaves will have five large lobes, each with its own distinct vein running along it.Some sycamore leaves may only have three lobes, but five is more common.
From the tip of one lobe to the to the tip of the one across from it, sycamore leaves are often well over 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide., Sycamores have alternate leaves, which means a single leaf attaches to the stem in one spot, and the leaves alternate from side to side as you move along the stem.This is opposed to two leaves attaching at the same location on a stem, which is referred to as having opposite leaves.
 The leaves will have many rounded “teeth” along the edges and will look slightly serrated., In spring and summer, the leaves will be dark green. Then in the autumn they turn yellow before falling off for the winter.

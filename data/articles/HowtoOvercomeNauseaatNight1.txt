 Targeting the pressure point that eases motion sickness can keep nausea away. This point is the Pericardium 6 (PC6), located on your wrist. Find it by placing three fingers at the crease of your wrist with your palm up. This area on the inside of your arm/wrist can be targeted through pressure from your fingers., These bands, designed to use acupressure to keep you from experiencing motion sickness, are often available at drugstores or travel stores. They are typically a small sweatband that goes around your wrist at the PC6 with a half of a small ball attached to keep constant pressure., Lavender and peppermint are those most associated with calming the stomach and helping nausea. You can use them as essential oils and put them on your wrists, or on a soothing face mask. You could also try them as candle scents.
 Sometimes there are particular smells that can trigger nausea. These might be from food, strong perfume, or rotting or decaying smells. Keep your area well-ventilated (particularly the kitchen and eating area) to combat this.

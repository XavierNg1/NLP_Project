 Do this instead of buying large containers of oil. This will decrease the likelihood that the oil will oxidize and spoil., After you are finished using your cooking fats, secure and store them immediately. Because oxygen, light, and heat are the main causes of oxidation, store your fats in a cool, dark cupboard or the refrigerator., Before using the fat, look for signs of deterioration. Having a dark color, a low viscosity, or a foul odor are signs that your fat has gone bad.Do not use rancid or spoiled fats. The quality and taste of food cooked with rancid fat will be tainted.

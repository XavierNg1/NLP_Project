, The larger your turkey breast, the longer it will take to cook. When roasted at 325 °F (163 °C), turkey breast requires approximately 25 minutes cooking time per pound.For a smaller four to six pound turkey breast, set aside between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 hours. For a larger six to eight pound turkey breast, set aside between 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 hours.
If you're cooking at an altitude of 5,000 or more feet, you'll need to add five to ten extra minutes' cooking time per pound.
 Rub the turkey breast with olive oil, and sprinkle the skin with a few pinches of salt and pepper. If you wish, sprinkle dried thyme, oregano, sage or basil on the turkey.


If you want to use fresh herbs, chop them roughly and insert them under the skin of the turkey, so they'll cook right against the meat to flavor it.
If you like the taste of lemon with poultry, try slicing a lemon and inserting the slices under the skin, to be removed after baking.
 Spray an oven-safe roasting pan with non-stick spray or vegetable oil to prevent the turkey from sticking to it. Place the turkey breast in the roasting pan skin-side up.
 Roast the turkey until the internal temperature is 155 °F (68 °C) as measured by a meat thermometer.Cooking the turkey at a lower heat (325°F) helps make sure that the breast doesn’t dry out.


If you want to make sure the breast stays moist, you can baste the top of the breast periodically throughout the cooking process. Use either a large spoon or a turkey baster to pour the pan liquid over the surface of the breast.
For crispy skin, turn on your broiler and broil for five minutes after it has been brought up to an internal temperature of 155 °F (68 °C).
 Cover the turkey with foil and let it rest on a countertop for several minutes. During this time, juices from the turkey will reabsorb into the meat. Skipping this step will result in drier meat.
 Use a carving knife to cut it into portion-sized slices. Place them on a large plate for serving.

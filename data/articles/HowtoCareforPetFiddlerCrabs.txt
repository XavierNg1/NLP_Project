 Fiddler crabs should not be kept with fish. People have kept them underwater successfully, but these crabs don't live in water, they live on beaches. Their entire tank should be damp sand.;
, The rule is five gallons a crab, so a ten gallon is good for two. Three can be done but is slightly crowded. Males have a large claw that is used to attract females. Females have two small claws. They need heat in between 75F and 85F. This can be accomplished with a basking bulb or reptile heat pad.Get a wire mesh screen meant for reptiles.
 It should be embedded in the sand so they can crawl in. A Tupperware sand which container works well. Their water should be dechlorinated, meaning no chlorine should be in it. Tap water isn't suitable alone and needs a dechlorinated meant for fish to be added to it. Bottled water is fine. The water also needs marine salt added to it; this can be found at pet stores.
 Fiddler crabs are scavengers and will eat almost anything. They especially love fish, as that is their main food source in the wild.
 These guys live around trees such as mangrove and often climb.
 This is more for your benefit than the crabs because they LOVE to pinch you!

, They will flip upside down and shed their exoskeleton. It is important that you do not touch them. It will kill them. Once they finish molting don't remove their old skin, as gross as it is they need to eat it so their new exoskeleton can harden.

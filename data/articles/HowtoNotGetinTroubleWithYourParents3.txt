 One quick way to light the fuse of an argument is to say that your parent always or never does things a certain way. It might feel that your parent never lets you go to a friend’s house, but is that true? Even if it’s true for a particular friend, you’ve probably spent some time in your life with your friends.By overgeneralizing, you’re essentially telling your parent that she’s not a good parent. That’s not going to make her feel good.
Stick to your own perspective. Telling her that you’re angry and disappointed that you can’t go to your friend’s house might bring better results.
 When you feel like your parent is picking a fight with you, don’t argue back. Instead, try to sort out what your parent might really be trying to say. If your mom wants you to go to church with her, it’s probably important to her that you share her faith tradition. If your dad wants you to dress a certain way, he might be concerned about your reputation. Your parents are probably just trying to get you to value the same things they value.
You can choose your own values as you grow up, and you can live the life you choose.
By understanding that your parents’ anger may be based in fear that you might be choosing different values, you can afford to cut them some slack.
 When your parents ground you, or take away privileges (like phone or computer), they’re usually trying to make sure you experience pain as a consequence for something you’ve said or done. The purpose of the painful consequences is to keep you safe - so that you won’t do the thing again. If they didn’t care about you, they wouldn’t bother making consequences for you.It’s important to realize that your parent might be wrong - and that’s okay. They are doing the best they can.
Remember that this consequence is temporary. It will pass.

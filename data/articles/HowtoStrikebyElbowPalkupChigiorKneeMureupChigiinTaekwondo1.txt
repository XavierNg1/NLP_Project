 It can deliver a strike to the head, the back, the face, the checks, and the groin. These strikes can be painful and damaging enough to end a fight without much effort. Chigi of Palkup (elbow) and Mureup Chigi (knee), can be a very potent technique when executed with precision; it is particularly useful for women defending themselves at close range. As such, it is recommended that all girls and women learn how to master this kind of technique to use for close-range self-defense.


In Taekwondo, elbow strikes or knee strikes are most often used while in close range, but are also employed while jumping toward the opponent. The hardness of the elbow allows for hitting with considerable force, and experienced fighters can easily knock out, cut, or injure their opponent with a well-placed strike.






Elbow or knee strikes are generally most effective when used in combination with punches or kicks, to allow the fighter to close the distance, especially when women are being harassed close up.

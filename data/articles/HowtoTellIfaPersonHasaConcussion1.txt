 Although loss of consciousness is an easy indication of a concussion, it is not always requisite. Look to see if the person is responsive and can be roused with conversation. If they are unconscious, check their airways, breathing, and circulation to make sure they are all at normal levels.;

 If they seem to be acting strangely and are exhibiting the above symptoms of an altered mental state, ask a few questions to determine the extent of their incapacitation.

 Ask them how they feel; sufferers of a concussion often have:


Nausea or vomiting
Strong headaches
Heightened sensitivity to light and sound
Problems with their balance.
 If you have a flashlight, shine the light into their eyes. Do their eyes focus on the light and the pupils react correctly?

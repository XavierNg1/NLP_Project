 If you are crafty, and have a talent for making hair bows, necklaces, or scarfs, start selling them to your friends, family or the general public. This can be a fun way to make money on items you love to make.


Set up an account on Etsy to showcase your merchandise, and expand your customer base. Let your parents know you would like to set up an Etsy account, and ask them to help you set up a PayPal account so you can successfully sell your goods.
See if you can sell your merchandise at local craft fairs or garage sales.
 Depending on the quality and amount of clothes you have, you can sell clothes that no longer fit you or that you don't wear anymore. There are many thrift stores that will buy your clothes from you to resell in their shops. Simply go through your closet, and put the clothes you no longer want in a garbage bag. Take the bag to a thrift store in your area, and let them buy the clothes from you.


Be sure to always check with your parents before trying to sell any of your clothes or belongings. If you get permission from your parents, then you can try selling your clothes.
 Ask friends or family to pitch in their stuff they would like to sell so that it's a bigger and better sale. Put up signs around your neighborhood and town telling how to get to your house and what time the sale is. Many people get up early for garage sales, so be sure to start yours by 9 a.m., and keep it going until at least noon.


Remember to ask your parents if you are allowed to sell your things. See if your parents have things they want to sell, so you can sell your stuff together.

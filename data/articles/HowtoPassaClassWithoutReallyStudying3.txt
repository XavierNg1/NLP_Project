 Do this as you take notes in class and learn new concepts. This way, you can make associations between what you already know and what you are learning. When test day comes, the associations will help you remember the material better.Ask yourself, "How does this concept relate to something I already know?" "Does it relate to other data, observations, stories or subjects?" or "How does this information relate to the information that I have been learning in class so far?"
Additionally, when you learn a new concept, make sure to ask yourself if you understand it. If you don't understand the concept, then ask yourself more questions about how it fits into what you are learning.
 As you begin to associate new concepts with things you already know, draw webs to illustrate their relationship to each other. Start by writing the new concept in the middle of your notes and draw a circle around. Then draw lines straight out from the circle to create connections to related concepts; these are your secondary concepts. Draw circles around the secondary concepts and create connections to tertiary concepts. Keep doing this until your run out of associations., Metaphors will help you connect seemingly different ideas and concepts to each other. This is a powerful way to remember complex ideas.If you are learning about economic cycles, then try relating it to the formation of a wave in the ocean. For example, as waves slowly form, reach a peak and then crash, so does the economy.

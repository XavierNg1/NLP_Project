 Add 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 ½ tablespoons (19 g) of sugar, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of baking powder, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of nutmeg to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined.If you prefer, you can substitute a gluten-free flour blend for the all-purpose flour.
 Add 1 ripe avocado that’s been peeled, pitted, and mashed, ¾ cup (177 ml) of milk, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon (13 g) of melted coconut oil, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract to a food processor. Process the ingredients until the mixture is completely smooth.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender to mix the avocado mixture.
 Once the avocado mixture is smooth, add it to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix the avocado mixture in until it just combined.Take care not to overmix the pancake batter. The texture of the pancakes will be off.
 Place a large skillet on the stove, and add a small amount of butter. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the butter to melt so the pan is greased.You can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the pan if you don’t want to use butter.
 When the butter has melted, scoop a small amount of the better into the pan. Place 5 to 6 blueberries in each pancake, though you can add more to larger pancakes., After you’ve added the blueberries, let the pancakes cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Use a wide spatula to carefully turn the pancakes and allow them to cook for another 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.Don’t let the pancakes cook too long on the second side. You don’t want the blueberries to burn.
 Once the pancakes are finished cooking, lift them out of the skillet with the spatula. Place the pancakes on plates, and serve with your favorite pancake toppings.The pancakes are delicious with just a little butter melted over them.

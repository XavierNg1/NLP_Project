 If you are on a mobile device, use the mobile browser to visit the Facebook website. Most devices cannot write a Page Note from inside the Facebook app., After logging in, click the downward arrow in the top right corner. Select the Page that needs a new Note.
 Your Page options appear along a white bar near the top of the window. Click the Settings link near the right-hand side of this bar.
 The Settings menu includes a long list of sub-menus on the left hand side. Click Apps to view the settings for your Page's Facebook apps.
 If your Page doesn't have Notes enabled yet, find Notes on this list and click the Add app button to its right.
 Once Notes is added to your page, a few more links should appear under its name. Click Go to application to visit a list of Notes for your Page.
 The + Write Note button is in the top right corner of the Notes pane, underneath your Page banner. This will take you to a new screen where you can type in your note and upload attached photos.
 Now that Notes are enabled for your Page, you don't have to visit the Settings screen anymore. Look at the navigation bar for your Page, directly underneath your banner. This always links to Timeline, Photos, and a few other places, but now it contains a link to your Notes as well. If you don't see the link, click More and select Notes from the drop-down menu.

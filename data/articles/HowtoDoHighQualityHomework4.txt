 To avoid this, follow these simple rules:


Write at least 3 full detailed paragraphs
Or, write a plan sheet fully
Rest your hands for 5 minutes. Dip them in warm water and roll your wrists around
Keep ploughing through until eventually, the work is done.
 If you can't get to a photocopier, write out one and again, create a note sheet for annotations or use sticky labels for annotations.
 Ask your friends or parents or even teachers to have a look at it and ask them how you can improve. Don't be scared. Remember, it's for your benefits.

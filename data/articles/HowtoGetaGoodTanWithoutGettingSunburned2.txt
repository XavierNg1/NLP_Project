 Use a body scrub and a loofah to get rid of dead surface skin cells, or you'll come out of your tanning session looking speckled.
 Otherwise, they may end up turning dark brown or orange.
 When you use clear aerosols, you may have a difficult time telling how much spray tan you've applied to your skin.
 Get into your shower and close the curtain so that you don't accidentally spray tanning product onto other bathroom surfaces.
 Put extra moisturizer on your knees and elbows, and spray them lightly compared to other areas.
 Spray product into the air and step back into it as you would if you were applying perfume. Do this 2 to 3 times to make sure that you get enough product on your back.
 You can also buy a specially designed tanner remover to take off dark spots, streaks or other application errors.
 Expect to pay between $80 and $100.

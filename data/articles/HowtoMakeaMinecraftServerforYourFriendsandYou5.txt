 There are thousands of user-made plugins and modifications available to download for free that will change your Minecraft experience. These range from world-building enhancements, to complete economy overhauls and all new game modes. Use plugins to add variety to your server and to keep your friends on their toes.

Bukkit is the most popular way to add plugins to your server. You will need to download the CraftBukkit tool. Running CraftBukkit is a complete replacement for the Minecraft Server program; you will be running the CraftBukkit server instead of Minecraft.
 This server program will allow you to add custom plugins that are not supported by the standard Minecraft server software.
 There are a variety of plugin repositories available online. Find a plugin that sounds interesting to you and download it. Be sure that you are downloading from a trusted source.
 Unzip the file that you downloaded. The .zip file should contain .jar files that contain the plugin data. Copy every .jar file in the .;zip file into the PLUGINS directory in your server folder.


Restart the server to install the plugins. You may have to adjust your server settings files again after installing a new plugin.






Make sure that your whitelist is configured to only allow your friends to connect.

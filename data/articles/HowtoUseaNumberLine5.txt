 Find the first and second numbers in the problem.


For example, in 6 + (-2), 6 would be the first number and -2 would be the second.
 Put it on the first number in your problem.


In 6 + (-2) you would start by putting your finger on 6 on your number line.
 Adding a negative number is very similar to regular subtraction. You have now moved 1 space.
 This will make sure you end on the answer to your problem.


For example, if the second number in your problem is -2, you should have moved your finger to the left 2 spaces.
 This is the answer to your addition problem.


For example, if your problem was 6 + (-2), you would have started with your finger on 6. You would have moved your finger to the left two spaces, ending on 4. 6 + (-2) = 4.
 This is to check your answer.

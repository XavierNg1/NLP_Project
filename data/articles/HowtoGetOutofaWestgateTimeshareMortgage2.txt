 This is another option to get rid of your timeshare. A donation works by allowing you to donate your timeshare to a charity for them to use, so you don't have to pay maintenance fees anymore.
 As with a deed transfer, your timeshare must be paid off in full and you must be up to date on your maintenance fees and payments to donate your timeshare. And don't let the word "donation" fool you; even though you're giving the timeshare to charity, you might still have to pay to donate the timeshare.

Â , There are different options for donating your timeshare, so approaching several companies is a good idea.

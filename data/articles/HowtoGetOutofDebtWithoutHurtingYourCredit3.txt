 You can consolidate your debts onto a credit card with favorable terms, such as a low APR. In fact, you can often get a 0% APR introductory period that generally lasts 12-18 months.One of your current credit cards might offer balance transfers. Look there first. Make sure the card doesn’t already have a balance.
If you don’t have a current card, you should shop for one. Generally, you’ll need a score of around 700 to get a balance transfer credit card.
 You can also consolidate debts with a personal loan. You can obtain a personal loan at a bank or credit union, though credit unions are more willing to lend to someone with poor credit. You can pay off your smaller loans with the personal loan.


When you apply, the lender will pull your credit history. This “hard pull” will reduce your credit score slightly for about a year.
Avoid taking out a home equity loan or line of credit, since you’ll be at risk of losing your home if you can’t make payments.In fact, avoid taking out a “secured” personal loan backed by any sort of collateral. Only seek an unsecured personal loan.
 You’ll lose the introductory APR on a balance transfer if you don’t make the minimum payment on time.Accordingly, set up a system that reminds you when a payment is due. For example, your bank might send you text messages or emails if you enroll.
 Your credit score will climb as you lower your overall debt burden. Commit to using all available money to pay off your debts. Set up a budget and pick up a part-time job to speed up the repayment process.


If done right, debt consolidation should free up money that went to interest payments on your loans. Now contribute that money to your principal.
Don’t spend this extra money on luxuries, which is a common trap. You’ll only remain in debt if you do.

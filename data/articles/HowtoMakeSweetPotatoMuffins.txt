, Add each required ingredient in a large, mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to mix rather than an electric mixer as it can make your muffin batter hard and that causes dry muffins.


If you mix too fast or too long, the batter will get tough and the muffins will turn out dry. Once the batter is mixed properly stop stirring.
 Grease a muffin tray with cooking spray, butter, or margarine. using a pastry brush. Pour an equal amount of the mixture into the muffin tray using an ice cream scoop or tablespoon. If you end up short on the last muffin scrape a rubber spatula around the bowl to get the extra batter out.
 Set the muffin tray on the oven rack and bake for 15 to 17 minutes. To test if muffins are ready insert a toothpick or fork in the middle of one of the muffins. If it comes out clean, they're done. Place oven mitts on your hands and remove muffins from hot oven.
 Flip over the muffin tray and lay the muffins on a wire rack or plate. Have them cool for about ten minutes.
 You can top your muffins with buttercream frosting or glaze.Try adding other ingredients such as nuts, cranberries, honey, extra cinnamon, etc.

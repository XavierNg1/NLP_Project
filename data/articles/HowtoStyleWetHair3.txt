 Gather all of your hair from the ends and hold it in both of your hands. Push your gathered hair up from the bottom, so your hair falls to the sides and creates your natural part.Use your fingers to smooth out your part and add any stray hairs to the correct side of the part.
 When your hair is parted down its natural part, shake your hands through the ends of your hair to break up pieces of hair that are stuck together and give your hair some texture.If you want to, you can also work a small amount of mousse through the middle and ends of your hair for added texture.
 Use both hands to stretch out an elastic headband and place it on top of your hair, as if you were putting on a hat.Adjust the front, top portion of the headband so it sits where you’d like it, and be sure to keep the back, bottom portion of the headband over your hair.
 When your headband is in place, take small sections of the end pieces of your hair, wrap them over the headband, and tuck them in to the elastic.Consider starting from the center of the back of your head, and working your way outward, toward your ears.


The tucks don’t have to be perfectly symmetrical. When the tucks are uneven (tighter tucks, looser tucks), it gives your hairstyle some pretty texture.
If you have shorter hair that can’t tuck all the way into the elastic headband, use bobby pins to secure any loose pieces of hair.

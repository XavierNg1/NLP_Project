 TSP, or Trisodium Phosphate Powder, is a powerful powdered cleaning agent you can find in many home improvement stores. It usually comes in a white powder. You’ll want to add half a pound (227g) of TSP to two gallons (7.8L) of water. You should mix this solution in a bucket.Make sure to wear rubber gloves when handling the cleaning solution, since contact with the skin can cause burns and hives., The best brush for this purpose is a nylon brush with stiff bristles. Dip the brush into your cleaning solution, then scrub the wooden sliding, following the orientation of the panels. Most siding panels are horizontal, so you’ll want to scrub horizontally. Work in 20-foot (6m) sections.Dip the brush in your cleaning solution as needed.
 Right after you finish scrubbing a section of siding, you should rinse it before moving on to the next one. You only need to use clear water for this, and a garden hose is ideal if you have one., To work safely, you should have a second person holding the ladder for you. Fasten your brush to an extendable pole so that you can clean the second story without having to reach and stretch uncomfortably. Work in 20 foot (6m) sections, and always rinse before moving on to the next section.If your home has a third story, you may not be able to clean it safely by hand.

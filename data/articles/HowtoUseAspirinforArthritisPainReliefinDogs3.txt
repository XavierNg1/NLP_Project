 Arthritis is a common condition especially for older pets. Arthritis is an inflammatory condition, where the joint becomes inflamed and releases chemical distress signals such as cytokines and prostaglandins. However, inflammation is strongly linked to creating pain, and the joints become sore and painful.


In the longer term, inflammation weakens the cartilage lining the joint which is then more prone to chipping or damage, which creates yet more inflammation. In an attempt to repair damage, new bone is laid down, and this accounts for the distortion of joints that is associated with arthritis.
 Aspirin reduces the release of inflammatory markers such as prostaglandins and cytokines, and thus helps to reduce inflammation, and therefore pain.
 Aspirin provides relief against mild or moderate pain, but is not sufficiently potent to help severe pain. Increasing the dose of aspirin should not be attempted, because this makes overdose more likely (without improving pain relief).

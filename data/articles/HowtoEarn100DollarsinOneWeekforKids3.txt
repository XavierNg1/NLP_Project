 If you have neighbors who own dogs, ask if they need the dogs to be walked. Be sure to check with the neighbors who seem busiest first, as they will find your offer helpful. Make sure the dog you are walking is good with kids as well. Especially since you are a kid.
 If you're old enough to where you can be trusted with a small animal or child, get into pet or babysitting! If you have a little brother or sister, you probably have all the experience necessary.


Let your neighbors know that you're almost always available and would happily watch their child/pet while they're out on the town or on vacation. Do they have your phone number?

 Find a mounting block; it’s hard to get on a horse from the ground, especially your first time riding. Stand to the left of your horse. Put the reins over your horse’s head; hold them with your left hand and grab a chunk of mane, too. Stand facing your horse, and put your left foot in the stirrup. Stand up off of your left foot and swing your right leg around. Try not to land on the horse’s back too hard. Put your right foot in the stirrup, and take the reins in both hands.get on the normal way.
 Make sure that the balls of your feet are in the stirrups. You should put your heels down throughout your ride to provide stability and balance. You should also make sure that your reins are not twisted; they should be in a straight line from your horse’s bit into your hands.


Your instructor can also help you adjust your stirrups to make them longer or shorter.
 If you are riding a horse for the first time, you should definitely have an adult with you to supervise you. Whether you’re taking a riding lesson or going for a pony ride on a friend’s horse, you should always follow the directions of your instructor.


Make sure that you can hear your instructor, even from across the ring.
Be sure to tell your instructor if you feel nervous, uncomfortable, or scared. This is normal, and your instructor can help you get over your fears.
When you’re done riding, you will probably be asked to walk your horse for 10-15 minutes until it cools down. When its neck is about the same as the air temperature, you can dismount.

 This is important in case you accidentally light the paper on fire; you can just drop it into the sink and douse it in water. For this particular method you should write on the paper after the aging process, to avoid losing some of your work with excessive burning.
 There is no difference in the effectiveness of each source of fire. Simply use whatever is available to you. Avoid using a butane lighter as the flame is too intense for this type of work.
 Hold the edges of the paper between 1/2 inch (1cm) and 1 inch (2.5cm) above the flame. Move the flame along the edges, going back and forth along the sheet’s perimeter. This will create the darkened look of paper that's been around for a very long time and been damaged by time and circumstance. Do not put it too long on one place by the candle.


Don’t let the flame linger on any one spot too long; this could set the whole sheet of paper on fire.As you move the flame long the paper’s edges, make sure you’re moving away from your hand to avoid potential burns.
 If you want to further damage your sheet of paper, you can burn little holes into it. Again, put the paper around an inch above the flame, this time letting it linger. Pay attention to this spot as it browns and blackens. Once it’s reached the desired color, remove it from the flame.


If you want to burn holes into your sheet of paper, leave it above the flame slightly longer. The heat will eventually burn through, and a small flame will catch. Be quick to blow it out.
If the paper catches fire quicker than you can blow it out, drop it in the sink and douse it in water.

 Not everyone can afford an authentic trunk like the one Hermione Granger has. So a stylish and more affordable way to store your stuff would be a couple of brown leather storage boxes. To give it more of a wizarding effect, you can also add a Gryffindor luggage tag. This is a stylish way to keep organized.
 You can't have a 'Hermione Granger' bedroom without a bookshelf. Have all of your Harry Potter books and some of your other favorites on it. (Red bookshelf only works if you are making your room look like Hermione's hotel room.)

, The color doesn't matter (as long as it's not bright pink) but your 'Hermione Granger' room should have a desk. You can put a wand or a quill on it, if you have one, along with a journal. A cute addition would be a small cauldron (easily found at any Halloween site or store) to keep your writing utensils in (A small cauldron on a high table would do, because Hermione doesn't want children touching it). It of course needs a lamp. Leave the rest up to your imagination.

 A big comfy chair, with a bit of muggle technology and your room will be looking brilliant! Remember Hermione is very tidy and organized so keep it clean.

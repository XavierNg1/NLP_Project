 Clear the walls of all pictures, curtains, etc.;
, For inspiration paint the office walls your favorite color or favorite place to go (beach=blue, Camping=Green)

, Purchase simple furniture with plenty of space maybe even cabinets. It is better to buy white, tan, or brown furniture rather than black.
 While you're working you are going to want to be comfortable. Somewhere like Walmart, Target or your local furniture store.
 Make sure the curtains match the color of the walls, the furniture, etc.
 If you have family photos that is even better. Make the office cozy!

, Buy these things in bright, plain colors. Get some holders to put this stuff in (like decorative cups for the writing utensils)

, Get some baskets to place little stuff in like extra supplies, papers, or folders in. This will give the room a little organization.
 These things will make the room more cozy and homey feeling. The plant should be a fake one, but a real one would be more well "real" looking. Although you would have to maintain it.
 When you need a rest or just want to do paperwork in a comfy area this would be the ideal place!

, Make sure your information is easy to reach!

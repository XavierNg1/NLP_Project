 Buy a glycerin soap block, found in most craft stores, divided into small cubes or make your own.


Tie ribbon around the block to make a loop, turning at ninety degree angles to create each additional loop.
Carefully run one scissor blade on the back of the ribbon until you have completely curled it.
Repeat with the other side. They will look like gourmet soap and cost a fraction of the price.
 Buy a large plain white unscented pillar candle and peppermint candies (round or stick). Unwrap the candies. Using a hot glue gun or glue dots (found at craft stores), glue candies all around the sides of the candle. It will look like candles sold for $15 and more in catalogs and fancy stores.


You can even make your own scented candles


, Never be afraid to re-gift old gifts you've never used or opened. This can save you a lot of time and money, and you'll be getting rid of an unwanted item and up-cycling; just be sure to do it in the spirit of giving the item to someone you know will appreciate it. There is a lot of nonsense about re-gifting being unthoughtful––it is probably one of the more thoughtful approaches to giving precisely because you have to focus on whether or not it's an appropriate gift for the particular recipient.

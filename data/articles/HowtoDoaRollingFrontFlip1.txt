Move fast to build momentum., Tuck your chin into your chest. Roll from the back of your head and neck to your buttocks until your feet touch the ground again.Roll onto your toes with your heels off the ground., When your feet touch the ground again as you come out of the forward roll, spring up with your toes while you’re still in a squat. Use your calves to push off the ground. As you “punch” off the ground, raise your arms above your head and pull your thighs up to your torso., As you lift off the ground, bring your arms down from over your head and grab your upper shins.Tuck your knees into your chest as your hips rise over your head from behind., Once your hips are below your head again, let go of your shins. Open your legs from their tucked position and land on your toes.Bend your knees a little to absorb the shock when you land.Then extend your legs back into a standing position.

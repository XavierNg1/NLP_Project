 If your polyester garment is holding a static charge, turn the garment inside out. Grab a can of aerosol hairspray and hold it about eight inches away from the polyester garment. Spray the hairspray onto the garment to alleviate the static cling.This helps reintroduce moisture in the fabric, which can help break up static charge., Dry skin carries a positive charge and polyester carries a negative charge. As your skin rubs against the polyester garment, it creates static electricity.This is common in the winter when skin tends to be drier. Alleviate the charge by moisturizing before getting dressed., Dryer sheets are great for eliminating static in the tumble dryer, but they can also be used to remove static after the clothes have already dried. Grab a dryer sheet and glide it over the polyester garment to remove some of the static cling.

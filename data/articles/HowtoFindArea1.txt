 Because rectangles have two pairs of sides of equal length, label one side as the base (b) and one side as the height (h). Generally, the horizontal side is the base and the vertical side is the height.;
, If the area of the rectangle is k, k=b*h. This means that the area is simply the product of the base and the height.

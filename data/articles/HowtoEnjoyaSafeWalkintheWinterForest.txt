 Bundle up with layers, snow boots, and mittens as if you are going for a long walk.
 Ice patches are created faster on popular tracks than unsettled snow. Note the color differences on paths, as ice patches can be either sheer white or pale blue, depending how much frozen water has accumulated in the snow.
 It is easy to get lost and not an adventure if you take a wrong turn. If you do get lost, never panic. It's recommended to search for ski imprints or footprints and calm down rather than staying in one place and stressing out.
 Enjoy the "winter wonderland" scenery, not just on the ground, but all around you. Respect the land and animals that live on it by not littering or tossing cigarette butts.

It will happily follow its owner around, doing whatever they are doing. The Miniature Schnauzer wants to please its owner. In addition, it is protective of its family, quickly alerting them to anything that might be a danger, like a stranger at the door., Originally raised to hunt vermin, Miniature Schnauzers have a strong hunting instinct.

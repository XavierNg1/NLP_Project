 Look for the TextPlus app on your Android phone. It’s the one with the app icon with the green background and the TextPlus logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 All your messages and notifications received in your TextPlus account will be displayed. Swipe up and down to scroll through them.
 Tap the chat button with a plus sign on the top right corner. A Compose FREE Message screen will appear.
 Enter the name or number of the recipient or recipients in the To field. As you type, a drop-down list of entries matching from your contacts will be shown. You can just tap on the names from the drop-down list to add them.
 Tap on the bottom field on your screen. Your keyboard will appear. Type in your message here.
 When you’re done, tap the green arrowhead button beside the text. Your text message will be sent to your recipients for free, as long as their phone numbers are supported by TextPlus (US or Canadian mobile numbers).

 Climbing shoes are lighter and smaller than other athletic shoes. Look for a versatile shoe with a hard rubber sole that can handle various kinds of climbs indoors and out. A hard sole can handle all kinds of climbs, will not wear out quickly, and can hold an edge longer than a softer rubber sole., All brands are different, so take your time trying them on. A tighter shoe is good for aggressive climbing. Some advanced climbers prefer really tight shoes with their toes bent in the toe box. A softer, looser shoe is suitable for less challenging climbs, climbs with different sorts of pitches, indoor climbing, and for beginners.


Unlined shoes are more comfortable, but they stretch more so aren’t as durable.
With a stiff sole you can size up a little for comfort and still be safe on all kinds of climbs.
Leather shoes will stretch more than synthetics and will gradually conform to your foot. If you choose a synthetic shoe, make sure it fits comfortably when you buy it.
 Lace-up shoes are highly adjustable and you can customize how they fit. Velcro shoes are almost as adjustable and are easier to take on and off. This is helpful when your feet get hot or when you’re going between street and climbing shoes. Slippers are the most comfortable style, but they stretch out easily and need to be replaced often.
 Soft shoes will let you feel the rock better and are better for areas with slopes because they stick to the surface better. A soft shoe will not be very supportive, so your feet might get tired more quickly than in a stiff shoe. Stiff shoes let you stand on smaller ledges, but your foot won’t feel the rock as well. A stiff shoe will give your feet more support and prevent fatigue.

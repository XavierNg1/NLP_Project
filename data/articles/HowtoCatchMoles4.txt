 Fresh piles of dirt on the side of the mound will indicate an active molehill. The opening in the mound will be the mouth to the tunnels that you flood with water. When you flood the tunnels, dirt will wash back through the tunnels and drive out the moles., Place the tip of your hose into the molehill mouth, and turn on the water. You don’t want the water to run too fast, because you don’t want the tunnels to fill up with water too quickly. You want to trick the mole into thinking that it is going to be flooded out of its tunnels, and have it escape some other way., You will have to be ready at other nearby molehills to grab the moles as they try to escape, and place them in a bucket for later disposal. A bucket provides a safe area to contain the mole and ensure that it doesn’t escape and dig back into your lawn.Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling moles; their sharp teeth can pierce through skin.
 Contact your local animal services agency for advice on where to release the moles you catch. You may be restricted in where you can dispose the mole, and the condition in which you are disposing the mole, so it’s best to receive specific instructions from nearby animal services.

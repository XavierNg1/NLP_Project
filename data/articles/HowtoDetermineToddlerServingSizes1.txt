1 egg.
1 tablespoon of peanut butter.
1/4 cup of cooked beans or peas.
1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds.;
, As your toddler gets older, they'll probably drink more milk which is an easy way to give them dairy. Most one year olds should get about 2 cups (a cup is 8oz) of dairy products a day, while two and three year olds need 2 1/2 cups a day. To give one cup of dairy, offer one of these:1 cup of milk.
1 cup of yogurt.
1 cup of fortified soy beverage.
1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

 Toddlers usually love the sweet taste of fruits and have little trouble eating their daily recommended amount. For one or two year olds eating a 1,000 to 1,200 calorie diet, give 1 cup of fruit a day (fresh fruits are the best choice). For three year olds or toddlers eating a 1,400 calorie diet, offer 1 1/2 cups a day.

1/2 cup of dried fruit (like raisins, cranberries, or dried apple).
1 cup of 100% fruit juice.

A two year old should have about 4 ounces a day and a three year old needs around 5 ounces a day. To give your toddler one ounce of grains, offer one of these:1 slice of bread.

 Before your toddler turns two, they should be getting about half of their daily calories from fat. If your toddler is getting around 1,000 calories, this means that 500 of them should have good sources of fat. For example, you could give:Full-fat yogurt and milk.

Hummus.
 By age 2, your toddler should be drinking whole milk out of a cup. Your toddler should drink about 16 ounces (473 ml) of milk a day. Avoid giving more than 32 ounces (946 ml) a day since this may prevent your toddler from absorbing iron and may reduce their appetite for other healthy foods.Consider giving your toddler a vitamin D supplement if your toddler doesn't get much sunshine and drinks less than 32 ounces of milk a day. 400 IU of vitamin D can prevent your toddler from getting rickets.

 For most of human history, people defecated by squatting in the woods or over a hole in the ground — and a billion or more people around the world still utilize this position today. Squatting with your knees against your abdomen creates a better internal alignment for the release of a bowel movement (and tends to speed the process), and some experts believe this positioning significantly reduces the likelihood of developing hemorrhoids.If squatting is a step beyond where you’re willing to go to deal with hemorrhoids, try raising your feet while on the toilet. Place a low bench or pile of books under your feet. This will improve your internal alignment and may help you pass stools faster and reduce hemorrhoid-causing pressure.;
, Sitting itself is the real problem when it comes to hemorrhoids, so sitting for too long in even the most comfortable, “cushiony” chairs may leave you with rectal pain and itching; however, a softer seat is preferable to a hard one, so stick a thick cushion or pillow under your rear end when sitting down on a hard chair, bench, etc.You can also find a range of products marketed as “hemorrhoid cushions” (or similar) online. There is no guarantee that any of these will help more than a pillow, but they might. “Donut” style cushions of the type used when someone has had surgery or suffered an injury in the anal region are another option to consider. Try them and see what works best for you.
 If you’ve ever had hemorrhoids, you probably know that getting hot and sweaty “between the cheeks” can make your anus unbearably itchy and uncomfortable. Standing or especially sitting in constrictive, heat- and moisture-trapping clothing can make things even worse. Along with keeping the area clean and dry, then, choosing the right clothing can help soothe your posterior pain.Choose loose-fitting clothing (including undergarments) made of breathable fabrics like cotton. Change into a fresh pair of underwear if the ones you have on get damp from sweat.

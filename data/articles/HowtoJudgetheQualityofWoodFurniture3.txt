 Lower quality joints include dowel joints (held together with dowels)and butt joints (where the joint is two flat boards against each other, held together with glue, nails, and/or screws). If you see these joints, you have a lower quality piece of furniture., Wood should be put together with screws and glue, not staples or nails. Screws will help the furniture last longer because it has a better grip. Glue gives the furniture stability, but you shouldn't be able to see it., Cracks in the wood is a sign that it's not very good quality and will likely split at some point. Quality furniture is also made without knots. In addition, check to make sure the wood is hard by lightly scratching the surface (in an inconspicuous place). If it's hard, durable wood, it shouldn't scratch easily., Wood slides won't work as well over time. Look for metal slides, which will hold up better and keep you from shouting at your drawers when they don't want to slide properly.

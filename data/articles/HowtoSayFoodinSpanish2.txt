 This noun is often used for "food" and "nourishment", but it also means "pasture", "grass", "feed", and "grazing". Though its dictionary definition contains mostly agricultural meanings, it's often used for people as well. Like with "cebo," the usage is similar to "chow."

 This word sounds a little like the English word "pittance," but its meaning is actually much closer to "daily rations." You can use this definition or use the word as a sling term for "food" in general.The proper pronunciation is "pee-TAN-sah."

, The literal meaning of "pan" is "bread." However, the word is sometimes used to convey the idea of food or sustenance in general. This is done in English, too (e.g., "our daily bread").


"Pan" is easy to pronounce — it's just "PAHN" (rhymes with "John"). Spanish speakers use a somewhat short, "punchy" pronunciation for this word. The "ah" sound isn't drawn out like in the English word "pawn" — it's quick and staccato.
An expression you may want to know is "Pan de cada día" ("PAHN dey kah-da DEE-uh"). This is literally "bread of every day," or, in English, "daily bread."

 There is a good chance poison is not your best bet. Many people do not recommend using poison to deal with groundhogs, for a number of reasons.Before you resort to this method, consider bringing in a professional to assess the situation.


Killing animals with poison often inflicts great suffering. The groundhog may die slowly from internal bleeding, suffocation, or a number of other painful things, over the course of hours or days.It is not reliably effective. Most legal rodent poisons are designed to kill rats or mice, not woodchucks.Substances toxic to groundhogs are also toxic to humans and all other animals. Pets can and frequently do get into poison, and it can impact human health as well.The best-case scenario is that you will have toxic, rotting rodent bodies in your lawn to dispose of. The bodies will smell awful as they decay underground, and may attract other pests.The cleanup process can be time-consuming and dangerous., Groundhogs tend to go into hibernation in late September or early October, and their hibernation chamber is walled off, making them impossible to fumigate after this time., Place a piece of pre-cut sod beside each one.
 The process of igniting and placing the fumigation cartridge varies from brand to brand., Place it as deep inside the burrow as you can reach without throwing it. Use the end of a shovel to push it even farther.
 Stomp on it to create an airtight seal. Wait about five minutes, and watch the other holes to see if they are leaking smoke. If so, seal them with sod. Repeat until all the burrow entrances are tightly sealed.

Place the stuff you want to keep in the first pile.






The second pile is for the things that belong in other rooms of the house. (Dirty dishes, your sister's book, your mom's flash drive, etc.)






Put your garbage that cannot be recycled in the third pile.






Dedicate your fourth pile to recyclables.






Put stuff that is in good condition that you want to donate in the fifth pile.






Make the sixth pile the stuff that you do not want but would like to sell for a profit.

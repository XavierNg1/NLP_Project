 When you first get your Toyger kitten, you need to make sure she is up to date on her vaccinations. Ask her previous owner or breeder for her records so you know what care she has already received. At six weeks, she should have had her core vaccinations, including those for distemper, feline rhinotracheitis, and feline calici virus.


At nine to 10 weeks, she should have a booster for these vaccinations and her last boosters for these at 14 to 16 weeks. She may also need these repeated at one year old.
At 12 to 16 weeks, she should have her rabies vaccination. This will need to be repeated every year.
She may have also gotten a feline leukemia test at the same time as her first distemper vaccine.;
, When you take your kitten for her first check up around eight to nine weeks, your vet should start the deworming process on her. This should be redone every three to four weeks and at least two additional times after the first., Before your Toyger reaches six months old, you need to decide if you want to breed her. If you donâ€™t, have her spayed (or neutered if male). This will help prevent unwanted kittens as well as cut down on undesirable behavior such as heat behaviors and urine spraying.


You can have her fixed as early as eight weeks., After your Toyger reaches one year old, you need to take her back to the vet at least once a year for a health checkup. She should be given her rabies vaccination and be checked for any issues. Once she reaches 10 years old, take her twice a year to avoid any specific diseases more common in senior cats.


Although your Toyger should generally be healthy, there is one breed specific problem to be aware of. During these regular checkups, make sure your vet looks for heart murmurs, which have been noted as common in this breed.

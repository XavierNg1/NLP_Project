 In most injury or assistance situations, your doctor or physical therapist will give you a pair of crutches and explain how to use them. In the unlikely case that you get to choose which kind of crutches you want to use, here's a breakdown of what each crutch is good at and not so good at.


Underarm crutches:

Usually for temporary use involving injury
Less upper-body mobility, but more overall mobility
More difficult to use and may involve risk of nerve damage in the axilla (underarm)


Forearm crutches:

Usually for long-term use involving ongoing leg weaknessOffers more upper-body mobility than underarm crutches
Allows patients use of forearms without setting crutches down



, Plant your crutches 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5Â cm) in front of you, squeezing on your ribs and upper arms. Pushing down on the hand grips and not on your underarms, take a step with your weaker leg. Follow with your stronger leg. Repeat.
 Hold both crutches by the hand grips in one hand while pushing up with the other hand on the chair. Put one crutch under each arm and proceed as normal.
 Place both crutches in one hand holding the hand grips together and reach for the chair with your other hand to lower yourself down slowly. This is essentially reversing the process of standing up.
 Whenever possible, use a handrail when going up and down stairs. Place one crutch under one arm and use the handrail with the other arm for support.


Going up stairs: step up with the stronger leg, then the sore leg, and lastly bring up the crutch.
Going down stairs: lower crutch down to the step, move your sore leg down and then bring your stronger leg down. Make sure the crutch tip is completely on the stair

, Take an old sweatshirt or even a memory foam pad and fit it above the crutch pad for a little extra cushion. Even with extra padding, medical professionals advise against leaning on the crutch pads with your underarms.

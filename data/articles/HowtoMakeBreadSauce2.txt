 Slice a loaf of gluten-free white bread into thick pieces. Cut the crust from each edge of the slices and discard the ends. Put the slices on a drying rack and leave on your counter to become stale overnight.


If you’ve forgotten this step, you can dry the bread out in the oven. Preheat the oven to a very low temperature. Remove the crust from each thick slice of gluten-free bread. Put the bread on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Once the bread feels dry to the touch, remove it from the oven. Do not toast the bread., Peel and grate the white onion. Pour 1 liter of whole milk into a saucepan. Add the grated onion, a pinch of cloves, and 2 bay leaves to the saucepan., Place the saucepan on a burner. Allow the contents to heat gradually. Do not allow the sauce to boil., As the sauce heats, rip apart the stale bread into cubes over a mixing bowl.Just before the sauce comes to a boil, stir in the bread crumbs. Reduce the heat immediately., Allow the sauce to simmer on low for approximately ten minutes. During this time, the bread crumbs will absorb the milk and thicken the sauce. Once the sauce is thick, remove the pan from the heat., Use a slotted spoon to fish out the bay leaves. Add a knob of butter (approximately 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons). Pour in three tablespoons of double cream., Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and freshly grated nutmeg to taste. Pour the bread sauce into a warmed bowl or gravy boat. Serve the sauce as an accompaniment to your turkey.

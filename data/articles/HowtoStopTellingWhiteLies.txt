 It may sound cheesy, but it is a problem. Admit to whoever you have told lies to that you've lied to them, and you're trying to kick your habit of lying.;
, There are many reasons why someone would tell a lie. Maybe you were embarrassed, scared, or did it for gain, to get more friends, or be popular, or just out of a habit. Run the list through your head of all the reasons you lie.
 If you lie because you are embarrassed, realize that everyone has that feeling. Lying makes it worse, and you have to tell lie after lie to cover up those white lies until you are buried so deep in lies that you can't get out. What's more, in the end you'll still be embarrassed. Lying to get gain is a little different. If you feel like everyone hates you, or that you have no friends, talk to a close friend or family member, or even the school counselor. They'll tell you lying about yourself, your family, and your possessions is not wise.
 Make a promise to yourself that you will not tell white lies. Begin with, say, a week. So, you will not tell a lie for a week. If you pass that goal, make a new one: two weeks. Keep going and going with your goals, until you've completely stopped lying.
 To change any habit first of all you have to accept it completely. So own that fact that you have a lying problem and don't feel embarrassed about it and the work towards changing it.

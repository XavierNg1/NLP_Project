 Equip yourself with explosive arrows and grenades, these will work the best in your fight. Also have an auto handgun as a good back-up. Once you've saved, go on through the door to the fuselage of the plane.;
, When you go through the door, look right next to the door and you'll see a control panel. Push the button for a crate to shoot onto the floor of the plane, push the crate immediately to lower Tyrant's strength. Notice DIJ, the brave mouse, on top of the wall! Go ahead and move into the body of the plane.
 This will help you to avoid dying and launching your attacks. He will attack in two ways: slashing attacks with his talon and charging knock-down attacks with his other hand or shoulder. When the Tyrant rears back, run by him on the claw side. Get at a safe distance and launch your attacks.
 If you have made him weak enough, the crate should shoot at him and knock him out of the plane. If he is still able to stop the crate, you'll have to beat him some more.

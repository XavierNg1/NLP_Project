 The concept should be original and interesting. It should be something that could be sustained throughout a movie and work well visually., That is, your story should progress through it's conflict up to a climax. Through most of the story, it should be escalating in conflict and excitement., A scene must do something, such as introduce a character, establish a relationship, or move the story forward in some way. If a scene doesn't do one or (ideally) more than one of these things, it needs to be cut., Read script over multiple times to ensure it's ready to be pitched. Look for typos and awkward phrasing.


Try reading the dialogue with a partner. Not only will it help you catch typos, but it will let you know if the dialogue sounds awkward.
 The best option is a professional proofreader, but if you can't afford a person like that, have friends and family read it over for structural problems, typos, and grammatical errors.
 One way to create anticipation is to end a scene before you'd normally think it's finished. A classic example is when the bomb is ticking down, and the television show cuts to commercial. Everyone is still glued to the television because he or she wants to know what happens.

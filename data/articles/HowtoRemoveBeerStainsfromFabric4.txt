 When you clean up a stain on microfiber upholstery, sometimes the water itself leaves a stain, which you then need to remove. However, when you're looking at the stain, make sure you don't see any signs of beer left. You need to make sure that stain is gone before you start working on the water stain left behind.Look for discoloring, as beer can discolor fabric slightly.
You can also smell the area to check for a beer stain. If the beer stain is still there, repeat the stain removal process for upholstery.
 Use a clean white cloth. Make sure it is soft so it will be gentle on the fabric. Dip it into clean water, and wring it out. Press the cloth gently on the area to make it damp. You don't want to make the area soaking wet. You just want it to be damp enough that you can dry the fabric more quickly this time., The reason water sometimes leaves a stain on microfiber is because it dries too slowly. A blow dryer helps speed up the process. Wave the blow dryer over the fabric until the stain dries up, leaving you without a watermark this time.The main reason you want to make sure the stain is completely gone is that when you apply heat to a stain with a blow dryer, you are setting the stain in the fabric, making it nearly impossible to remove later.

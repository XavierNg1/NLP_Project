 The team that won the coin toss starts things off. They should choose a single player to act out a slip first. All players on a team must act out a slip at least once before anyone can go for a second turn.If you have difficulty deciding who goes first, have the winner of a quick rock, paper, scissors tournament select a strip and get the game started.
 Things like the category and the number of words in the phrase will give your teammates a better idea of where to focus their guesses. You can come up with gestures all your own, but usually:

Holding up a number of fingers at the start of a turn indicates the total number of words.
Following this with another number of fingers indicates the word you’ll first act out.
Laying a number of fingers on your arm indicates the number of syllables for the word.
Sweeping your arms broadly through the air indicates “the entire concept.”, Some gestures you think will work out great turn out to be a dud. Don’t be afraid to switch to a new gesture. The more hints you give your team with gestures, the more likely they’ll be to figure it out.


When your team guesses the answer, the round ends and your team gets a point. Then the other team repeats this process.
If your team doesn’t guess the answer and time runs out, your team passes the turn without getting a point, then the other team tries., If you and your friends are having fun, you don’t have to stop when you run out! Split up and write up some new slips. In some cases, there might be a few really good players on one team, making things imbalanced. Reshuffle teams to make things more fair.

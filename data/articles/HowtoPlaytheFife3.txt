 Locate sheet music for the fife online or at music stores. Use a fingering chart side by side with the sheet music to remember where to place your fingers for each note.


You may be able to adapt music for another wind instrument—like a flute, piccolo, or panpipe—to play for the fife. Ask music store staff or someone familiar with wind instruments for help with this.
 If you can’t or don’t want to read sheet music, you can also learn new songs simply by listening to them and sounding out the notes on your fife through trial and error, one note at a time.


It will get easier to pick out notes once you have a better understanding of your instrument and practice picking up songs by ear. If you get stuck figuring out a note or section of notes, try moving on to a different part of the song., Take deep breaths and move slowly from note to note when you’re figuring out a song. It helps to stand up rather than sit down to play. Hold your head and shoulders up and your chest open to take big deep breaths.


It can be very difficult and awkward at first to move your fingers from note to note. Be patient. Break the music down into small parts (just a few notes at a time), then repeat the same part over and over until you can move your fingers easily to each note before moving onto the next part.
 Look up a fife and drum corps in your area. Join one of these groups to team up with other fife players and drummers to learn new songs, get valuable input and experience, and play in parades or historical events.
 If you want to find another group to play with, and especially if you’re interested in the rich military history of fife music, talk to war reenactors about playing the fife for their reenactments or other events.
 Continue to play just for yourself and improve by learning more from a teacher, an instructional book, or watching videos and looking up music online.

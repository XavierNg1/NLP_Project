Don't get involved in it (don't pick sides, snap at your siblings or others, and especially don't physically fight).  Help from outside is better than another person out of control.
Watch and observe (if it is an argument), and see if anything you could do might help (remind your sister that you have a ticket as well, but aren't going to use it; that she can use your brush for today, etc).
If it is a physical fight (or an extreme argument), go get help from an adult that you can trust.  If none are available, try calling or texting one, letting them know the basic situation and how urgent it is.
Don't panic.  Your siblings may need you as outside help, even if there's not much you can do even there.
Don't say anything unnecessary (besides something that could let them know that you have a good solution, and probably nothing at all if it's a physical fight).  Often, when people are upset, they don't want anyone else interfering.  This can make them angry, and they may choose to take their anger out on another sibling.
Don't give up.  Keep trying to get help, and stay composed.
  This can do more good than you know.


Sometimes (but not always), all someone needs is a good example to follow.
It doesn't matter if you're the oldest, the youngest, or somewhere in between.
Adults often are impressed by people who set a good example, and it can help build trust between you.
Learning to stay in control can be a great skill for later life.
Someone has to start, and even if you begin very basically and quietly, you're doing something.

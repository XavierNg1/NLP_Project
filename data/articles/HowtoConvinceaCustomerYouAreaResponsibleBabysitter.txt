 Include your past babysitting experience, if you are trained in CPR (most customers will be very happy to see this on a resume), and at least two reliable references.;
, Wear decent clothes, and make sure your hair is combed through. A fancy outfit is not necessary, just something that looks nice. Looking nice will usually give the parents a better impression of you as a person.
 Even if you are babysitting for kids who are known to misbehave constantly, walk into the job showing confidence, that you are ready to take on the challenge.
 If you show up early, even if it is just by that little amount of time, the parents will likely see that you care about the job and the kid(s) that you are going to babysit. Avoid showing up too early, as the parents will likely be nowhere near prepared if you show up an hour early., This will definitely show the parents that you not only care about the kids safety, but you care about the safety of everyone in general.

It may also be a good idea to double check if you know about any medical conditions the kids may have. Double check if and when they have to take medication, how much should be given, and what to do should a complication arise.
 Sometimes, the parents may leave food for you to prepare dinner, lunch, or even breakfast. If they do, be sure that you cook what they asked you to cook, and only that. Even if the kids want something different, avoid giving into them, and cook what you were asked to cook.

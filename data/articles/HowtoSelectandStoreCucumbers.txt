 The cucumber should look fresh.;
, A good cucumber is firm and does not bend. This firmness should be right through to the tips of the cucumber.

, They will fare much better on the countertop, unless you eat them in less than 3 days. Also avoid storing near fruit (especially melons, tomatoes and bananas) as this will cause cucumbers to yellow and deteriorate quickly.

 You may be doing musical knowledge over scales, improvisation instead of aural. Know the order you are playing the pieces in, and rehearse with the accompanist beforehand. It is CRUCIAL you know exactly what the examiner is marking you on.;
, It can't get stressed enough; the better you know the pieces, the better you will do in the exam.
 For example, as you get to the higher grades, playing fluently, and with expression is very important.
 One used to hate aural, until they realised, hey, it's not worth many marks, and doesn't (really) matter if it goes horribly wrong. It's a way to pick up extra marks! Know all the questions the examiner will ask, and the possible answers. Listen to as many styles of music as you can and practise looking for style, dynamics, time signature etc. on those.
 It will always make you nervous, but relaxing can help you play your best.


When it's time to go in, smile and say hello to the examiner. Don't be put off by him/her; they may look intimidating, but they are not allowed to be too horrible!,, Look as calm as possible. Stand straight and hold your instrument carefully (or singing stand straight up) and wait to hear the examiner tell you to play/sing

, You normally have enough time to play it through once.

Fill each cabbage leaf with about 1/3 of a cup of your chosen stuffing.
Place the filling in an oval at the center of the leaf, perpendicular to the line of the stem.
Be careful not to overstuff!
You can use the leaf to sort of pre-roll the filling, by using it to compress it into the shape you want.










Roll the cabbage with the mixture inside, and set aside.
Start at the bottom, where the stem begins and roll upwards following the stem.
Once you have rolled to the halfway point, fold in the sides.
Continue rolling until it is closed.
 You're done!

 Changes in behavior and personality can signal health problems or just normal changes. To differentiate between the two, take your cat to be seen by a vet if it changes its daily routine or the activities it enjoys.An older cat might not like the food it used to or it may not even want to eat at all. It might also lose a little weight. Any of these issues are reason enough to have your cat looked at by a vet.
If your cat suddenly bites or scratches you more often, take it to the vet. These behavior problems could signal a medical problem that is causing your cat pain and irritability.
 It is important to be aware of the potential problems that can occur to older cats and to keep an eye out for them. This includes such problems and diseases as:Cancer
Urination problems
Loss of appetite or weight

Liver disease
Bad odor
Vomiting

, As your cat gets older, it will be more likely to get ill and it can have a harder time recovering from illness. In order to avoid many possible illnesses, be diligent about keeping vaccinations and medications up to date.Older cats may be particularly susceptible to certain infections due to decreases in their immune systems and an inability to groom themselves as much as they once did.
 It you are used to taking your cat to visit the vet once a year, you should start taking the cat in twice a year. This is because elderly cats are more likely to develop health problems, and it is important that they are caught as soon as possible., Older cats are especially prone to plaque buildup on their teeth, and dental disease. The vet can clean their teeth but daily brushing with a toothpaste made for cats will be easier on the cat and will prevent the problems before they develop.Elderly cats with sore gums or dental disease may avoid eating and become malnourished. If your cat has lost weight or has stopped eating, it may be caused by dental problems.

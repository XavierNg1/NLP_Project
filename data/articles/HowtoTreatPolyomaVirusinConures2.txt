 Confirm that your bird is infected with polyoma virus by visiting your veterinarian. The vet can conduct tests and determine right away whether your conure is suffering from the illness. Though there is no known cure for the virus, ask your veterinarian for advice about how to care for your conure after the diagnosis., If you have multiple birds, quarantine your infected bird right away in its own cage. Remove your other birds from their shared cage and disinfect it with an oxidizer, as well as everything in it. Bring all the other birds to the veterinarian to be tested for polyoma, and return them to the cage once their tests are confirmed to be negative., While some infected birds do recover from polyoma virus, most die from the condition. Large birds like conures may live up to 140 days with the illness, but young birds may pass away as early as 2-15 days after contracting the it. Do your best to keep your conure comfortable by giving it soft toys or blankets to rest under, and ask your veterinarian if any of the symptomsÂ  can be eased with supplements.For instance, your veterinarian may administer vitamin K injections to your conure to deal treat mild hemorrhages.

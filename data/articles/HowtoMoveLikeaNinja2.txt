 The idea in ninja training was to move so slowly and so quietly that your movements wouldn’t catch the enemy’s eye, even as you approached them.


If you see anyone while moving around, especially if they are facing in your direction, freeze in place immediately to consider your next move.
Silence and slow, controlled movements were at the heart of all ninja techniques and required a lot of patience and practice., Be mindful of light sources so you can navigate the shadows adequately.Ninjas almost always moved under the cover of night, but there were still other light sources to contend with, such as moonlight, enemy camp fires and so on.
You will have many other light sources to contend with in the modern world, so keep that in mind as you practice moving in shadows.
 Remember to breathe along with your movement. Unconsciously holding your breath can produce muscle tension, possibly resulting in a gasping release of breath if you are startled or accidentally unbalanced. Controlled breathing also keeps you calm and focused.


Practice rhythmic breathing with simple breathing exercises.
Consider practicing yoga, which emphasizes controlled breathing during movement.
Yoga will also make you more flexible and help you move more fluidly.
 Take advantage of any natural noise happening in your environment. Planning movements that may cause noise to coincide with the natural sounds.This way, any movement you make that makes a sound will be drowned out by the natural noise.


You can also create false sounds to distract the enemy or divert their attention.For instance, try throwing a rock in the opposite direction of where you’re hiding in the dark. It will make a sound, causing your enemy to look away from you and in the direction of the noise.
The ninja called this “Joei-on jutsu” – the art of concealing sound.

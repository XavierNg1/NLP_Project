 Even lenders specializing in bad credit lending want to see that their clients are reliable. One way to demonstrate this is to reside at the same residence for one year or longer. If your credit report shows an endless string of addresses, this does not bode well for your reliability., Having steady employment and an income that can be verified is a crucial component to receiving a car loan. For some dealerships and sub-prime lenders, having a steady, verifiable source of income is the only factor that decides whether or not you will get a loan. If you are not employed, work to rectify this before seeking a car loan.Your verified employment can be shown through a paycheck stub, W-2, or 1099.
Know the address and phone number of your employer, as well as the name of someone a lender can call to verify your employment.
 Yet another way to show that are an established and responsible adult is to maintain a bank account. You may be asked to provide information about your bank account to potential lenders, either to show your balance in savings, or to provide a location for loan money to be deposited. Not only does the absence of a bank account make you look bad, it may disqualify you for a loan.Visit a local bank and speak to a representative about checking and/or savings accounts.
The minimum deposit to open an account will vary by bank and type of account. In some instances, it may be as low as $20.
 When you apply for a loan, your lender may need to contact you. This will only be possible if you have a phone. Not having a phone makes it difficult for them to communicate to you, but furthermore makes you look irresponsible. Visit a telephone provider in your area and discuss phones plans (including prepaid options) that fit your budget.

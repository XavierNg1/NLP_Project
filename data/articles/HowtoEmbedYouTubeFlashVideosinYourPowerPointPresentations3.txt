 The size of the box that you create will be the size of the movie on your slide. The box will have an “X” going through it.
 Find the YouTube video that you want to embed in your web browser. Copy the address of the video into Notepad.


Remove the “watch?” and replace the “=” sign with a “/”

For example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BevOmZtKQ_w becomes https://www.youtube.com/v/BevOmZtKQ_w



If you want the video to play automatically when you open the slide, add “&autoplay=1” to the end of the address.

For example, https://www.youtube.com/v/BevOmZtKQ_w becomes https://www.youtube.com/v/BevOmZtKQ_w&autoplay=1



Copy the adjusted URL and return to PowerPoint.
 Select Properties from the menu.
 When you open the Properties for your Flash object, a table will open in a new window. By default, the table is alphabetized.


Copy the adjusted URL into the Movie field. Close the Properties window.

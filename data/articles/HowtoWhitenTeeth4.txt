 You should have picked up your whitening pen at the drugstore, and it probably cost about $20 to $30.
 Give your whitening pen a counterclockwise twist to release some gel.
 Use the pen tip to paint the gel onto your teeth. Try to avoid placing the gel on the gums.
 Avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 to 45 minutes.
 You should see a noticeable difference after about two to four weeks. Although pens do not effectively whiten between teeth, they will kill mouth bacteria and freshen your breath.

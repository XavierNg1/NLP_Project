 Listen for the click or other sound it makes when it shut, several of the newer roller coasters don't have 'clicking' restraints. This means you can have the restraint closer to your lap so you don't moved as much. These restraints are still perfectly safe and they won't unlock during the ride.
 It can be tempting to shut them but you can become disorientated making you feel nauseated. .
 This can help you to keep calm and can reduce the possibility of vomiting. Count under your breath if it helps you to keep your breathing steady.
 There is often music accompanying the ride. This may help to calm you if you concentrate on listening to the words or tune.
 That's what the ride's all about anyway! When you scream going down from high drops, it helps to expel the air and helps you to breathe as well as releasing stress to help you have fun!

, Talking is a good way to distract yourself during the ride. However, if it's hard to hear, you might end up yelling rather than talking, so be considerate of other people. The best time to talk is on the lift hill, this is the part where you have to wait to drop.
 This can help you to feel less scared. It's not ideal to sit here if you're looking for more thrills though. However, if you aim to not see the biggest field of view, the cart behind will allow for that.
 You did it. And you know you can do it again. Overcoming fear is a constant challenge in life and it's a great thing that you're practicing this lifelong skill.

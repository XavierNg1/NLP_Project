 The average mackerel weighs a little less than a pound, so you won't need a heavy rod & reel combination. A light spinning reel on a five foot pole and 6lb. or 8lb. test fishing line will allow for good casting and will be sturdy enough to reel in your catch.;
, My secret to catching lots of mackerel is Sabiki. Sabiki is a Japanese word meaning bait rig. The typical sabiki has a center line and several branches with decorated hooks tied to the end of each branch. One end of the center line has a snap onto which you'll attach a small weight, diamond jig, or other weighted lure. The other end has either a loop or a swivel, onto which you'll tie the line from your fishing pole. You will probably lose at least one or two rigs over the course of the day, so it is best to have three sabiki rigs and three diamond jigs (for weight) if you plan to fish for more than a few hours.
 Mackerel are easiest to catch from late spring to mid summer, before the bigger fish migrate north and start chasing them out of the harbor.
 New England has many harbors and plenty of coastline, and the fish can be nearly anywhere. Although you'll be fishing within a few feet of the surface, you'll still want deep water, so docks and piers work better than surf-casting at the beach.
, Jerk the fishing pole upward once every twenty seconds or so. This is called "jigging" and will make your sabiki rig seem like a frightened school of small fish - dinner for your mackerel!

, If you reel in too fast, your fish may break free. Mackerel like to swim side to side to try to escape, so enjoy the ride while you reel him in.
 Other mackerel in the school might mistake your fish's struggle for jumps of joy at the delicious food he's eating, and want to try some too! You may bring in up to four fish on a single cast, and more often than not, you may catch at least two at a time.
 You may be jigging for an hour or two before your first bite. Be patient; the school will swim by and see your rig eventually.

 It's a tool for packaging Python scripts into standalone executables.
 For example, if you want to create a Windows executable file, run cx_Freeze on Windows. Same goes for Mac and Linux.,, (As always in Python, correct indentation is important, and unfortunately is not shown here due to formatting difficulties.):

import sys
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
base = None
if sys.platform == 'win32':
base = 'Win32GUI'
executables = [
Executable(Python program name, base=base)
]
setup(name=executable_name,
version='version',
description='desc',
executables=executables
)

,, It should have been created during the previous step. Open that folder and the folder inside it.

There's your executable! The other files in that directory are required to run your executable, so be sure to always keep them with the executable.
The build can be customized in many ways. See cx-freeze.readthedocs.org for a description of all possible options.

 Don’t just hear her speaking to you, but really listen to what she’s saying. Put aside your needs and pay attention to what she’s telling you. Once she feels like you’re really interested in hearing what she has to say, she’ll be more likely to tell you her true feelings.Be an active listener by maintaining eye contact and nodding or responding as she talks.
 As you spend more time with your girlfriend, you’ll both get to know each other more, and you’ll be able to trust each other with your feelings and thoughts. Don’t be afraid to be open, honest and vulnerable with her., Being in a solid relationship means communicating effectively and meaningfully. When something is bothering you, talk to her about it. Broach the subject in a calm manner, and leave judgment and insults aside.Set a good time and place to have a talk if necessary. Don’t bring up a major issue just as she’s heading out the door for work. Rather, plan a time to talk when you both have some time to devote to a meaningful conversation., We communicate with our words as well as the way we hold our bodies. For example, folding your arms in front of you conveys defensiveness. When you’re in a discussion with your girlfriend, keep your body language open, especially when you are having an argument.Try these steps to communicate effectively with your body language:


Maintain eye contact.
Use a moderate voice level; don’t shout.
Sit facing each other.

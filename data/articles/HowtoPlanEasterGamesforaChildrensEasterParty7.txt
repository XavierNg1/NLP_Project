 On a cloth sheet or paper, draw a rough sketch of a good-sized rabbit, modeling it on the regular Easter bunny. Draw the rabbit standing on its hind legs, and holding its paws as if it were carrying an egg.
, The eggs should be as large as the space between the rabbit's paws. In each egg stick a pin.
 Each egg is to be pinned on the sheet, and right in the Easter bunny's arms, if possible. As the players take their turns, no matter how straight on the way they were started, the Easter bunny will be surrounded with eggs, until a player pins the egg in the Easter bunny's arms. The player who is closest to the arms, or spot on, wins a prize.

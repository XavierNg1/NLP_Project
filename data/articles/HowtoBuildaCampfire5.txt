 To start a log cabin fire, you’ll need to create a set-up similar to a teepee fire. Center your tinder in the fire pit, and use kindling to create a teepee shape around it. Make sure to start with smaller pieces of kindling and then add a second layer of larger kindling.Your teepee lay doesn’t have to be as large as it would if you were planning a teepee fire. Two layers of kindling are usually enough.
 Collect four pieces of firewood to set around the teepee. Take the two largest pieces and place them on opposite sides of the teepee. Next, set the two smaller pieces on the other sides to form a square with the wood. Make sure that the smaller pieces rest over the two larger pieces.Be sure to leave an opening on the side of the structure that is upwind, so you can reach the tinder when it’s time to light the fire.
 Over the four pieces of wood that form the base, lay smaller and shorter pieces of firewood in the same pattern. The goal is to create a cabin-like structure around the original teepee.The process of laying the wood around the teepee is similar to building with the Lincoln Log toys that you may remember from your childhood.
 Once you’ve built up the cabin for the fire, place some of your lightest kindling on top to close off the structure. Use a match or lighter to light the tinder inside the cabin.For best results, light the tinder from several sides.
Until the external walls of the cabin catch fire, continue to add kindling to the inside in order to feed the internal fire.
A log cabin lay typically offers up a longer-lasting fire, so it's an ideal choice if you need warmth for an extended period.

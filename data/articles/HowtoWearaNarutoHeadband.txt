 Leaf, Sand, Mist, Cloud, Rain, Waterfall, Rock, Grass, Sound... which will it be? Get to know all the different villages in Naruto and choose your favorite or one you'd like to be part of.;
, Naruto headbands are currently available in black, blue, purple, and red, choose a color that fits you best and goes with most of your outfits.
 There are several different ways to do so, you get some inspiration from the characters in the anime/manga, or invent your own unique way to wear it. Here are some suggestions:


As a belt. Just pull the cloth material through the belt loops on your pants and tie in the back. Have the headband centered in front of you.







Around your forehead. Tie it just below your hairline, with the metal piece in front.







Around your neck. Tie the cloth snugly around your neck with the metal plate facing forward. This seems to look best while wearing a hoodie sweatshirt or a jacket.







Like a headband. Tie the cloth behind your ears where your hair and your neck meet. Make sure to part your hair so some is in front of it while the rest is behind it.


Around your leg. Tie the material tight enough so that it does not fall off. (It works well when your sitting, but when you start to move it starts to fall off). Again, place the metal part forward. You can use safety pins to attach it to your pants, but be careful not to stab yourself!


Around your arm. Tie the headband firmly around the top of your left or right arm, just underneath the shoulder.







On your backpack. Tie it around one of the straps, or fasten it to the front of your bag. (This is a great way to wear it to school/work if you live in a country where you have to wear uniform and wouldn't be allowed to wear a headband like this.)

 Gay people are at high risk for depression and suicide,and if you insist on railing against them, you may worsen any emotional damage. If you feel extremely negatively towards gay people, the best thing you can do is stay away.


Every instance of verbal/physical abuse or harassment increases the victim's chance of self harm by 2.5 times.Never make yourself the reason that someone wants to hurt themselves.
Excuse yourself and say "I don't like gay people" if needed. This is much less harmful than a rant against them.;
, Say "I don't like to talk about that" and change the subject. This way, you can avoid hurting people's feelings and losing friends.

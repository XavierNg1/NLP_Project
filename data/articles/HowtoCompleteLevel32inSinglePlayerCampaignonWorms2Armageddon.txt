 You MUST have already purchased this campaign level from the Worms marketplace for 100 gold or the option to play it will not be available.;
, You must get across the map in under 5 minutes and kill the enemy worm before he kills you with his air strikes. You only have a fire punch and five girders in your arsenal and the terrain is filled with mines, so you will have to use your wits. You have 4 turns to complete your task.
 You will then need to quickly backflip right up next to the first mine, setting of its' self-destruct timer, and move past it to the roof just below the second mine. Although it may be tempting to then try to backflip over the next mine, you will not be able to, so the best method is to backflip at the exact moment the first mine explodes - this will hopefully throw your worm above the second mine and onto the top of the first spire. Your first turn will end and the enemy worm will skip his turn.
 This second worm will not be able to move any further on the map and its' only use will be to place girders for the first worm. Your second turn will end and the enemy worm will once again skip his turn.
 There will be two mines there; you need to jump across to the second mine, backflip onto the ledge above it, and quickly get out of the blast radius by moving onto the girder the second worm placed for you. Before the turn is done, you will need to get onto the other side of the third tower, or you probably will get stuck when the enemy worm fires off his air strikes. If possible, get right next to the enemy worm if you can. Your third turn will end and the enemy worm will skip his turn.
 If the first worm is next to the enemy, then the cover is not needed, but it's always good to be sure. Of course, this will mean the second worm will receive the brunt of the air strikes. Your fourth turn will end and the enemy worm should fire an air strike into the second worm, or into the cover provided for the first.
 Congratulations!

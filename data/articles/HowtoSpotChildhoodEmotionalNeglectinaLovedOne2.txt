 An adult who experienced childhood emotional neglect doesn’t show much concern for others. They tend to be closed off from people around them, even their loved ones. They just can't seem to relate to others' human sides.

For instance, you may notice that they call people who cry or upset “wimps” or have a difficult time understanding why people are emotional. They also often turn away from the people who need them the most., Adults who experience CEN are often extremely critical of themselves. They may become very upset if they make a mistake or don’t do the job the way they intended. They are often perfectionists and hold themselves up to a high, often unattainable, standard.

They may also not make time to care for themselves. You may find that they never take time to do what they enjoy or relax. This is likely because they aren’t aware of what they are feeling and how to make the situation better., Victims of childhood emotional neglect often act out and throw tantrums. They are unable to process their feelings in a rational way and explode because of it.

You may also notice they act emotionally abusive to those around them, including you. You might also feel disconnected to the person because they are unable to process their emotions., Many people with CEN look to drugs and alcohol to fulfill their needs. Anyone who experiences trauma, including emotional neglect, is predisposed to addiction.

Although substance abuse is the most common form of addiction for people with CEN, they may become addicted to other things, such as gambling and sex.

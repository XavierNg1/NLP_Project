 If you’re taking pictures of friends or even family members, they might not like the pictures. And if they don’t like the pictures, they probably won’t want them available for the whole world to see on social media. Ask friends and others in the images you take if it is alright to post them on social media.In some places, posting images of children – even your own children – without their approval is illegal.
If your child is old enough to ask whether you’re posting a photo of them online, you should ask them if it is okay for you to do so.
Even if others approve you posting the photo, think twice before doing so. Oversharing images of yourself with your friends or your children might grow tiresome for people consuming your social media.
 There are a number of things you could say on social media that might damage your reputation or even get you in legal trouble. For instance, if you post how drunk you were last night (or drunk you are currently), the post might give a future employer or college application evaluator the wrong impression about who you are.Employers and colleges often check social media accounts, so your controversial posts could cost you your job or education.
Likewise, if you are an illegal immigrant, you should not post information about how you came to be in your current country, or mention your current legal status.
 Posting critical comments about your coworkers, employer, or employees could land you in hot water. Even posting something good, though, might get you in trouble. For instance, if your employer sees you were using social media instead of working, they might be upset. Avoid sharing anything about your work experiences on social media.If you want, you could share where you work, but never relate stories about your workday on social media.
Assume your employer will see all your social media posts.

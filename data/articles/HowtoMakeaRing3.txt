 You don't need a ring mandrel to be able to make rings; any round object the size of your finger will do. Try the extended lid of a nail polish bottle, a mascara tube or a marker.
 Leave about 3 inches (7.5cm) to work with on either side. The loop formed this way will become the ring, while the overhang on either side will form the two halves of the bow.


If you're not sure what thickness you want, try 20 gauge.
 This bend will form half of the bow. Pull the wire outwards, then bend it up, over, and back towards the center.
 Clip the excess wire from the ends of the bow.


If desired, you can curl up both ends of the bow slightly for a nice finish.
 This will form the band usually seen on a bow and holds the bow in place. Clip away any excess. For a funky loop, wrap lots of wire as shown below.


For a subtler look, try wrapping the wire only a few times (or even wrap it in an X shape).
 If this isn't done, you risk the bow ends cutting into your fingers.
 The usual position is to face the ends of the bow point towards your arm. Done.

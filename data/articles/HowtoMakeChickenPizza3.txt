 To ensure that the oven is hot enough when the pizza is ready, it’s important to preheat the oven. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s preheated. It may beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.
 Take ⅓ cup (80 ml) of the ranch dressing, and spread it over the pizza crust. Make sure not to spread it all the way to the edge of the crust, though. Leave a ¾-inch (1.9 cm) border around the edges.You can use store bought ranch dressing or make your own if you prefer.
 In a medium size bowl, combine 2 cups (300 g) of cooked chicken that’s been torn or cut into bite-sized pieces with the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of ranch dressing. Stir well to ensure that the chicken is well coated with the dressingYou can grill or saute chicken breasts specifically for the pizza, use leftover chicken, or purchase a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.
 When the chicken and ranch dressing are well mixed, spread it over the prepared pizza crust. Next, sprinkle 2 cups (200 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 cup (100 g) of shredded cheddar cheese, and ¼ cup (40 g) of sliced green onion over the pizza.You can omit the onion or add extra toppings, such as diced tomatoes, if you prefer.
 Place the baking sheet with the pizza on it in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for approximately 14 minutes or until the cheese melts and the crust is golden brown.

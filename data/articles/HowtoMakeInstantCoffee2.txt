 You will need 1 teaspoon of instant coffee and 2 teaspoons of hot water. For stronger iced coffee, use 2 teaspoons of instant coffee, and 4 teaspoons of hot water. Stir the instant coffee and hot water in a cup until the coffee granules are completely dissolved. You will end up with a thick, concentrated coffee syrup., At this point, you can also add in some sugar, vanilla extract, or spices. Once you have added everything, stir the coffee base with a spoon to mix it all together. Here are some ideas on how you can flavor your instant coffee:


Add some cocoa powder or chocolate syrup for a sweet, unique taste.
Add a few drops of vanilla extract for a sweet, classic taste.
Give your coffee a unique flavor with a dash of ground spices. Consider using any of the following: allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.
Consider using some flavored coffee creamer instead of sugar and other flavorings.
 Pour 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water over your coffee base. For a creamier iced coffee, use cold milk instead.Stir until everything is combined. You will end up with a cup of cold coffee.


Consider using some flavored coffee creamer. Keep in mind that most flavored coffee creamers have some additional sweeteners in them, so if you already added sugar to your iced coffee, you might end up with something that is too sweet.
 Fill a tall glass with ice cubes, and slowly pour your cold coffee over the ice.
 You can drink your iced coffee straight, or you can add some milk or creamer. You can use whole milk, half-and-half, or even coconut milk. How much milk or creamer you use depends entirely on your preferences. Once you have added your milk or creamer, stir the iced coffee with a spoon until you have a uniform color.
 You can drink it straight from the glass, or you can add a straw to it. Drink the iced coffee while it is still cold and before the ice melts.

 Habitually hitting snooze will create a habit that can be very difficult to break. Set your alarm somewhere across the room, out of your immediate reach, so that you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off.
 Leap out of bed enthusiastically and spread your arms wide as if to say, “I am so ready for today! Bring it on!” It sounds silly, but it really does work (even if it just makes you giggle).
 During sleep we breathe very slowly, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen hitting our system than what our fully awake bodies are used to running on. Getting our brains back up to full speed depends on the time it takes for the body to inhale enough oxygen to get all of our processes going. Taking some big, deep breaths will get oxygen flowing faster, allowing your brain to fully wake up and reboot before you fall back asleep!

, Doing this consistently can also help you to reset your internal clock to accept your new earlier wake up time.
 Dehydration can make you feel very tired. As soon as you wake up, drink a tall glass of water. You’ll rehydrate your body and feel instantly more awake., Every time you successfully wake up early, reward yourself! It doesn’t have to be a big deal, but do choose something that is genuinely rewarding to you, whether that’s coffee, your favorite breakfast, or putting on your favorite music.

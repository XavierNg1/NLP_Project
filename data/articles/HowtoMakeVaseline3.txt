 To create a healthy, vegan “Vaseline,” you’ll need equal parts organic cocoa butter wafers and organic cold-pressed sunflower oil. Adjust the amounts based on how large a batch of “Vaseline” you want, and add them to a small or medium saucepan.For a small batch of the “Vaseline,” use approximately 1 tablespoon each of the cocoa butter wafers and the sunflower oil.
For a larger batch of the “Vaseline,” use approximately ½ cup each of the cocoa butter wafers and the sunflower oil.
 Place the saucepan with the cocoa butter wafers and sunflower oil on the stove, and turn the heat to low. Let the mixture warm until the cocoa butter wafers melt completely, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.Stir the mixture periodically as it’s melting to ensure that the ingredients blend completely.
 Once the cocoa butter wafers have melted completely, remove the saucepan from the heat. Carefully transfer the “Vaseline” mixture to a glass jar or bottle, and allow it to cool for two to three hours before using.

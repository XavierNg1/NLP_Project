 The paper should be about 9 by 12 inches (22.86 by 30.48 cm).
 First fold it in half, then fold that half in half again. Do not fold it accordion-style. The new dimensions should be 2.25 inches by 12 inches (5.7 cm by 30.48 cm).
 Leave a small notch at the bottom, where the fold is, to act as the stem. From there, cut out a feather shape, which could also be called a football or half-teardrop shape. Make the feather as long or short as you please.
 Cut small slits, about 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) long and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) apart. Only cut along the open curved edge. Do not cut into the stem or the folded spine. Cover the entire outside edge in these slits.
 The paper feather should open up into two separate, clear feather shapes with fringes on all outer sides.
 Only use a small amount of glue to prevent the glue from sticking on the feather fringes. Apply the glue to the interior of the fold.
 Press the other feather cut-out into the glue and let dry.
 The feather should be glued along one side of the brim, starting somewhere around the middle and extending to the back of the hat or slightly past the back of the hat.,

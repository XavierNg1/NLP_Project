 The tea needs to be strong, so consider using two bags. Brew enough tea so that you will be able to rinse your hair completely with the tea.The amount will depend on the length of your hair. If you have very short hair, a large cupful may be enough. If you have very long hair, you may need a pitcher of tea. Fortunately, tea is cheap and easy to make, so if you need more, you can always make some extra.
Make sure that you wait for the tea to cool before applying it to your hair! It can still be warm, but make sure it wonâ€™t burn your skin.
 If you only wish to lighten certain parts of your hair, you should separate those sections from the rest of your hair. Instead of dumping the tea all over your hair, you can put it in a spray bottle and spray it directly on the section you wish to lighten.


You can also dip the sections directly in the tea, and use your fingers to apply it to the roots.



Slowly pour the tea over your hair until it is completely drenched in the tea.
 If you wish, you can leave this on your hair for as long as you wish. Some suggest leaving it on for 15 minutes, while others suggest letting it stay in until your next shampoo.You can try both ways and see which yields better results.
 If you can, after applying the tea to your hair, go out into the sun, and let the sun dry your hair. This will speed the lightening process.As an alternative to completely drenching your hair in the tea, you could make the tea, put it in a spray bottle, and spritz onto your hair before going in the sun each day.Remember to use sun screen each day on the parts of your skin that will be exposed.
 As with all of the methods, it will take many days for you to see results. Fortunately, the tea method will not damage your hair as badly as lemon juice might.


If you have very dark hair, be patient! Eventually your hair will lighten, but understand that it is unlikely that your hair will ever be platinum blonde without using bleach or some other chemical treatment.

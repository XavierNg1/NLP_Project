 Italian vowels are different than English vowels, and each letter stands distinctly as one sound. It may sound complicated, but it isn't.


A sounds like the ä in "Father"
E is pronounced like è in "Vendor"
I like ï in "Naive"
U is ù as in "Goo".;
, Many Italians have some difficulty in pronouncing the English "th", and so pronounce it as either "t" (as in "Think"), or "d" (as in "The"), respectively.
 Since you are pretending to be a foreigner your working knowledge of the vocabulary would not be complete.
 In Italian, words such as "Azzurro", "Pollo", or other words with double consonants are pronounced twice as long as single consonants. Thus, it would be "Bet-ter" and not "bedder".
 This is an optional step, and obviously not done every time. The Italian language uses it, and thus, Italians are familiar with it. Example: "You are going later, no?"

,, Be careful with this one, as too much of it will make you pretentious! But if you want to, remember this:


GL is LL (as in "Million")
GN is ñ (as in "Canyon")

 Unless you're in grade school, relying excessively on shorthand and 'texting' language will get you nowhere when it comes to impressing someone new. Many people's only experience of you will be via your online presence, so you should do your best to appear intelligent and mature. This includes using proper spelling, relatively accurate grammar and keeping use of emoticons in moderation., Each time you make a post online, you should consider how it reflects upon you as a person. While there is a place for offensive humour and wild stories, posting it publicly will rarely get you in the good graces of people. If you're trying to impress one guy in particular, it doesn't hurt to tone down your online personality. Every guy is looking for his own set of traits in a potential girlfriend, but the vast majority would prefer to be with someone who know how to exercise some tact.
 You won't like everyone you meet online, but given that you don't know who will see your posts, it doesn't hurt to exercise kindness and empathy. If a guy goes on your profile and sees a bunch of posts about someone you hate, hes going to feel turned off and otherwise uninterested. If you have really negative thoughts to get off your chest, they're better suited for private messaging.
 Even if you're legitimately interested in someone, he won't feel as invested in you if he see you treating multiple other guys the same way. If you're interested in harmless flirting with numerous individuals, you should take care to keep it largely private. It is alright if hints of it are made public, but you don't want to be perceived as tease. If that happens, it will become more difficult to find someone when you're actually serious about seeking out a partner.

 When you're using deep tissue massage, particularly on the back, you need to be careful of where you are massaging. Hitting the spine could cause pain or even damage, so you need to avoid massaging heavily in that area., If you're massaging the whole body, avoid the front of the neck, the abdomen, and the inside of the upper arm. These areas are more vulnerable to damage than others, so it's best to avoid them., Deep tissue massage, like most forms of massage, can cause problems if the person has certain health conditions. For instance, bleeding disorders, fractures, osteoporosis (severe), and deep vein thrombosis could all cause problems with massages., When working on the limbs in deep massage, it's best to apply pressure as you move towards the heart. That means going up the leg, for instance, instead of going down it with your massage techniques.Applying deep pressure towards the heart helps keep the blood flowing that direction.
Deep tissue massage may help lower blood pressure., A deep tissue massage shouldn't be overly painful. A little bit of pain may be okay, but if you notice the person is clenching their muscles or curling their toes, it's too much. You need to adjust your approach to make it softer. You can also check in with the person, asking them if it feels okay.

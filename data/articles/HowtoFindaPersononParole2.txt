 If you're going to search records and databases online, you'll get a lot further if you know the person's legal name rather than an alias.
 Criminal records are open to the public, so you should be able to find information about the person's status, possibly including parole records, by searching public records online.


Keep in mind you may be charged a fee to conduct full searches of criminal records.
The National Center for State Courts can help you find online records of the state court where the individual was convicted. Although court records may not have accurate current contact information for the person you're trying to find, they may include information for a friend or family member who would know the person's whereabouts.
 If the person was convicted of a crime that required him to register as a sex offender, he also must report his address to the sex offender registry in your state.Every state has a sex offender registry that includes the current residence of every person who is required to be registered. This information typically can be found online in a searchable database., Go to https://vinelink.com/vinelink/initMap.do and follow the instructions to register with the online version of the National Victim Notification Network.


Once you set up a user account on VINELink, you will receive a notification either by phone, email, or text message when the custody status of any offender you've listed changes., Most states have a dedicated office to provide crime victims with resources and assistance, including help and support after the offender is out on parole.In addition to VINE, many states have their own victim notification network that can help protect you by notifying you when the offender's status changes.If the offender attempts to contact you while on parole or otherwise harasses or frightens you, victim services can assist you in filing for an order of protection to keep him away from you., If you know anyone who knows the person on parole, such as friends or family members, you might consider calling them to find out if they've heard from the person or know where he is.


If you don't want the person to know that you're looking for him for whatever reason, reaching out to friends or family might not be a good idea as he might find out.

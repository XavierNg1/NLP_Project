 You will still be contagious for up to 24 hours after you start antibiotic treatment so it is important you take measures not to infect those around you. Be careful not to cough or sneeze on other people. Doing so can spread the bacteria that causes strep throat.When you have to cough, cough into your hand, arm, or a tissue. If you cough into your hand or bare arm wash the infected area as soon as possible.
 You carry numerous germs on your hands every day, especially when you are already sick. Although being conscious about how you can keep germs off your hands in the first place is helpful, the best way to keep germs from spreading is to wash your hands frequently throughout the day.


To properly wash your hands, work up a lather using soap and warm water. Be sure to scrub both sides of your hands, your wrists, in between your fingers, and around your fingernails. Continue washing for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and then rinse them well with warm water and dry them with a clean towel., In addition to preventing the spread of strep throat to others, you also want to take measures to keep from reinfecting yourself. One way to do this is to use disposable tissues instead of a handkerchief that you use many times before washing. Throw away dirty tissues after each use., Your toothbrush can also carry germs that can reinfect you with strep throat. Replace your toothbrush both as soon as you start feeling sick and then again when your symptoms have subsided and you are feeling better.

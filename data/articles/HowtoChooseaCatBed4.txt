 If you want your cat to use a cat bed instead of spending the day lounging on your furniture, then you should place the bed in an area that your cat already likes to sleep. This may prompt your cat to use their own bed., Cats love to be warm so you may want to try situating your catâ€™s bed in a sunny spot. Try putting the bed in a room that has lots of natural light and windows.
 Some cats enjoy being able to see their surroundings. You may want to put their bed in a windowsill so that they can have a view of the outdoors. Some cats also feel more secure when they are off the ground.

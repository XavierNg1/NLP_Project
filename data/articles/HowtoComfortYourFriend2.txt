 Try to put yourself in your friend’s shoes, and let your friend know that you understand their emotions. Say something like, “That sounds so hurtful,” or, “You must feel really disappointed.”Don’t say “I know how you feel” to someone who’s upset, since that can seem dismissive. Show your empathy by naming specific emotions instead.
 Validate your friend’s emotions to help them feel less alone. Say something like, “It’s okay to be angry about this,” or, “Anyone in your shoes would feel betrayed right now.”, If you don’t know how to help your friend, ask. Tell them that you want them to feel better and you’re willing to do whatever they need.Say something like, “What do you need from me right now?” or “How can I help?”

, Some people don’t like asking others for favors or support. If your friend is like this, take the initiative so they don’t have to ask. Offer to get together again soon, or plan an activity that might help cheer them up.For instance, say, “I’ll call you when I get home tonight, OK?” or “Do you want to meet up for lunch tomorrow?”

, If your friend isn’t talking much, don’t feel pressured to fill in the silences, especially if nothing you say will make the situation better. Just sitting quietly with your friend will help them feel supported.Tell your friend it’s OK to cry if they need to. Sometimes crying is more cathartic than talking.

 Fill a medium-sized saucepan with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water and 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar. Place the saucepan on the stove, and turn the heat up to medium. Don't get impatient and turn the heat to high. If you heat the sugar water too fast, the sugar will caramelize.;
, Wash the strawberries and cut off the stems. Cut them into thin slices.
 Don't worry if the mixture appears thick. The strawberries will release more liquid once they start to cook.
 Add up to 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of lemon juice if you like your strawberry sauce tart. Add up to Â½ teaspoon (3 milliliters) of vanilla extract if you like it on the sweet side., This will help everything cook more evenly. It will also help the sugar from caramelizing.
 Place a mesh strainer over a mixing bowl. Pour the syrup into the bowl, through the strainer. Discard the cooked strawberries, or save them for later.
 You have just gotten all the flavor out of the strawberries. Now, you need to finish cooking the syrup to get it nice and thick.
 Once the mixture starts to boil, reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for 5 to 10 more minutes. During this time, you'll notice the syrup start to thicken. Remember to give it a stir from time to time with your whisk. This will help the syrup cook evenly.
 If you are using a bottle, pour the syrup through a funnel. This way, you won't spill any. When you are done, put the lid back on the jar or bottle.
 Don't place it into the fridge while it is still hot, or it may cause the surrounding food to heat up and start to spoil.

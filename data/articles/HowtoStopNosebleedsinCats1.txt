 Cats easily pick up on human emotions. If you panic, your cat will become nervous, which will cause their blood pressure to rise. This can lead to more bleeding. On the other hand, keeping a cool head will allow your cat to calm down and cooperate with you., First, talk to your cat in a soothing tone and pet them as you normally would. This will work with your calmness to help your cat settle down. Then, secure them in a comfort bag. Make sure it's not too tight around the cat's neck.


If you don't have a comfort bag, you can wrap them in a towel and secure it with a clothespin. This will allow you to start taking measures to stop the bleeding., Readymade ice packs are usually too large for small feline noses. Take one or two ice cubes from your freezer. Place them in a plastic bag. Then, wrap the bag in a clean towel.
 Place the ice pack on the bridge of your cat's nose. Make sure you don't cover your cat's nostrils. The cold temperature should cause the blood vessels to constrict and stop the bleeding., A nosebleed can stem from a number of illnesses or injuries. Medication could worsen your cat's condition. The only exception to this rule is if your vet has prescribed medication specifically for the nosebleed or its underlying cause., Find a clean and dry paper towel. Wipe away any blood from your cat's face. This will keep their airways clear and prevent them from swallowing blood. Make sure you use gentle strokes. If the nosebleed was caused by a cut in the nose, forceful strokes could trigger more bleeding., Nosebleeds in cats occur due to an underlying illness (such as an infection or leukemia) or injury (such as head trauma or a foreign body in the nose). Only your vet can make the proper diagnosis and take measures to cure the condition or keep it under control.


Depending on what's causing the nosebleed, treatments can range from simple antibiotics to surgery or a blood transfusion.

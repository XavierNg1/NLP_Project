 Start by asking your toddler if they’d like to go outside in the stroller for a little while. Tell them it will be an exciting adventure and that they can play in the stroller. Emphasize that the stroller will be a place where they play, sleep, or simply watch the world outside. This can help your toddler get excited about going into the stroller and make the stroller ride easier for you.For example, you may say to your toddler, “Are you ready to go on an adventure in the stroller?” or “Ready for stroller time?”;
, Make sure your toddler is comfortable in the stroller so they will be more willing to stay in it while you are out. Use blankets and small pillows to provide padding in the stroller. Bundle up your toddler in layers, especially if the weather is going to be temperate or a little chilly outside. Put socks and gloves on your toddler so they are warm and cozy.You can also check that your toddler is comfortable in the stroller before you set off. Ask them, “Are you comfortable in there?” or “How does being in the stroller feel?”
Make sure they are shaded from the sun in the stroller. Put a hat on your toddler. Make sure a sun shade is down over the stroller, if there is one.
 Keep your toddler occupied by planning time in the stroller with their usual nap time. This may be a good option if your toddler is already following a strict nap schedule and doesn’t mind sleeping in the stroller.You can also try putting your toddler in the stroller right before their nap time and letting them fall asleep during the stroller ride.

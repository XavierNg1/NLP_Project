 You can use either the cleaning solution or a spray-on furniture polish. Whichever cleaner you use, apply it to a soft cloth to do the actual cleaning, not directly onto the reel seat. Rub gently; however, you may need to scrub to get rid of stuck-on dirt from the reel spacers.


In a pinch, you can also rinse away dirt by flushing the seat with warm water.
 You may also want to apply an actual polishing compound to the reel seat.

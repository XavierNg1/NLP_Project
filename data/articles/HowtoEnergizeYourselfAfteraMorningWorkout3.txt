 It might seem odd to eat before a workout to feel energized after, but it can work. You know your body best, but some people who eat before a morning workout discover they have more energy during and after the workout.A small shake with some whey protein or a piece of fruit is a great option for a small, pre-workout meal.
 On the nights before you plan to work out in the morning, go to bed earlier than usual. How early you go to bed should correspond to how early you're waking up for your workout. If you stick to this schedule for the days you want to work out in the morning, your body will get used to it and it can become easier.For example, if you normally go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am but want to fit in a 30-minute work out in the morning, go to bed at 9:30 pm and wake up at 6:30 am instead.
 Your body needs to be warmed up properly before you begin any intense workout. Because your body's temperature is lowest right when you wake up first thing in the morning, you need to make sure you perform a longer warm up than you would if you were working out in the afternoon. You should warm up for about 10 minutes before a morning workout.You can warm up by stretching, walking, and doing jumping jacks without injuring your body.

 If you're administering medication via syringe, follow up with 5 to 10 milliliters (0.17 to 0.34  fl oz) of water. This will help your rat's body digest his medication quicker. Your rat may also be slightly dehydrated if he was struggling or upset when being syringe fed., Never syringe feed a rat while he's lying on his back. This could lead to choking. Always make sure your rat is upright before administering medication, food, or water via a syringe., If your rat is particularly resistant to being syringe fed, consider mixing his medication with pleasant tasting liquids. Soy formula, Kool-Aid, or Sprite may taste better to a rat than his meds. However, make sure you check with your vet before mixing anything into your rat's medication. You want to make sure additives won't affect the medication.

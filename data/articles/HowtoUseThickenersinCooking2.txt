 For example, any recipe that includes vinegar or lemon juice would not respond well to a cornstarch thickener. It is especially useful in recipes with milk and eggs, such as custard.


Add 1/4 tbsp. (2.4 g) of cornstarch to 1 cup (237 ml) of liquid to use cornstarch as a thickener. Mix it well with cold liquid before adding it into a hot recipe. Add the cornstarch mixture slowly as you bring the mixture to a simmer. Whisk constantly during this process.
Cornstarch does not stand up very well to freezing or overcooking.

Select wall tiles that are matte and in a contrasting color to the floor., The use of contrasting colors can drastically improve visibility for vision-impaired individuals. Try using a black toilet seat on a white toilet bowl, or having a dark-colored sink basin against a white-tiled bathroom.You can also purchase towels and bathmats in contrasting colors.

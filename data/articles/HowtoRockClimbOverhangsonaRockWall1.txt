 Gather your gear and build up skills.;
, Due to changing gym routes, by the time you're ready to make an attempt, the route might have been taken down. Don't fear, though! Gym routesetters have a tendency to put a fairly easy route on the biggest overhang in the gym. If you're just starting out, though, opt for a smaller overhang.
 Although this is optional, most overhangs are lead-only so there aren't any swinging top rope climbers.
 Although using your feet is more important than ever, upper body strength will be a big help as well. Practice pull-ups and hand boards, but the best way to train for climbing is to climb.



Keep your hips in close to the wall to have more weight on your feet. Be as close to vertical as you can, but keep your feet on the wall and don't sag.
Use hooks! Heel and toe hooks are both great moves on overhangs. Heel hooks act as an extra hand and are used for pulling. They don't come off from the wall as easily as normal foot placements do on overhangs. To do a heel hook, just put your heel up high on the wall and hook it behind a jug. Toe hooks are used on under clings. To use a toe hook, place your foot low on an under cling. Put your toe behind the jug. Pull with your hands to achieve opposition. Toe hooks are used to keep you in place on the wall.
Kneebars, although rare, are incredible. A kneebar is when you can place your foot on a large hold and your knee against another hold and let go with both your hands. Kneebars are perfect rests and look very cool. Make sure you don't hit your head if you fall attempting one, though!
If there's a dihedral, you can get a no-hands rest off of it.
 Although it might seem easy to be overwhelmed, it's not as bad as it looks. Try your hardest to make it, but don't push past the point of injury. If you fail, then try again and again.

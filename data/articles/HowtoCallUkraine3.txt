 It is free to connect to another Skype user using the Skype video chat, even if the other user are located internationally.This is no different from Skyping someone domestically.


If the person you are calling does not have video capabilities, you can make a voice call on Skype.
 If the person you want to talk with does not have Skype video chat, you can use Skype to call their mobile or landline. Once you login to Skype, click on “Call phones”; from there you can enter a number to dial.


Although this feature is not free (since you are calling a phone line), Skype offers low calling rates, based on the country you are calling to (not from).
You can pay to call a Ukrainian landline or cell phone through purchasing Skype Credit or an international-calling subscription., Unlike calling a cell phone or landline over Skype, Facebook Messenger allows you to place international phone calls for free. To call using Facebook, open an individual’s Messenger window, and click on the “Call” icon (the small phone at the top of the Messenger window).


You can call any Facebook users—domestic or international—whose “Call” icon is blue. If the individual’s icon is black, there are either offline or have not updated their Messenger.
 Although the Google Voice feature is only available in the United States, you can use it to make international calls, including to Ukraine.Google Voice is an extension of Google Chat (which allows video calls).


Before you can use Google Voice, you will be required to provide an existing U.S. phone number, or be assigned a specific Google Voice number.
While international calls on Google Voice are not free, they are less expensive than calls made on a cell phone or landline.

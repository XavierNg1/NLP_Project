 Place the mala in your lap and grasp it with both hands. The goal of divination is to reveal intentions and encounters that are otherwise unknown to you, so grasping at random in essential. Try closing your eyes while you grasp the mala to be sure your selection is as random as possible., Begin counting by three beads at a time once you have a bead in each hand. You should be moving each hand closer to one another as you count. There is no specific form for moving your hands through the mala in divination, so try whatever is most comfortable.The easiest way to count by threes is to use your thumb to move each bead while the mala rests on your index finger for support.
 Continue counting until there are three, two, or one bead in between your hands. Each number has a specific significance in the process of divination. Make a mental note, or a quick note on a piece of paper, of how many beads are in between your fingers., In order to have a complete divinatory practice you will need to repeat the initial grasping and counting three times in total. The number of beads that remain in between your fingers (three, two, or one) will have a specific significance depending on which repetition they were counted., Consulting a divination chart will allow you to read and understand the divination you have just performed. If you are practicing divination within a specific tradition, like Tibetan Mala Divination, use a chart that corresponds to that tradition. Divination results and readings will vary depending on which chart and tradition you consult.

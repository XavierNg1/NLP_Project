 Think of something positive you can say...and actually mean it! Don't tell her 'I really like your shoes' if she's wearing beat up sneakers! Complimenting her clothes or looks is not a bad idea, but it runs the risk of being predictable. Try to be original, and, if it comes naturally to you, humorous. Don't force it though if you're not a naturally funny guy!;
, Girls hate it when you don't and it's a MAJOR turn off. Give her space, don't put her down and keep your hand to your self. If you don't give the girl her needed space she may get angry at you and start an argument which may lead to a break-up.
 Don't automatically flirt, get suggestive, or change the tone of the conversation the minute she thanks you for a compliment or laughs at your jokes. Lots of people can be a bit shy, so if she seems this way don't try to force things. Shy people don't usually dislike other people, they just need a little bit more time and space to get to know you. Watch closely for signs that you may have stepped too far into her 'comfort zone'!

,, But if you're not interested don't try to fake it. Listening and encouraging a woman to talk about things that interest her will not only help you to keep the conversation going two ways but will help you figure out if she shares any of your interests in the first place, and might even help you think of an enjoyable activity you could share if you decide to ask her out.
, We live in a world full of weirdos and she doesn't have any reason to think you're not one of them! Besides, late night dinners carry with them a lot of baggage and unwanted expectations for a lot of people, so it's best to wait until further down the road for that!

,, You don't want to make her think you're a self-centered jerk.
 Don't just tell her you agree, tell her why you agree, she will most likely appreciate your response and will know you're listening to her.

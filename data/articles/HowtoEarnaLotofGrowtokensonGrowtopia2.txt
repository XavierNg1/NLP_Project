 Players love giveaways, especially when the items being given away are high in value. To host a giveaway, you don't even have to create a new world; you can host it in an already-existing world, such as your farm. Just make sure you block off anything you don't want other players getting into., A good choice is World Locks. If you're going to do this, make sure you stock up on a lot of them, as people will be asking for more giveaways., This is so players can't run and get the item before the giveaway begins. Make sure it's closed to public., If you're giving away multiple items, keep them in your inventory and host many "rounds" rather than giving everything away on one "round" all at once., Super-broadcasts are better than normal broadcasts (a super-broadcast goes to everyone in Growtopia, while a normal broadcast goes to 100 players). You can also use a custom broadcast, which allows you to choose how many players you'd like it to go to., Keep it under 30 seconds; otherwise people will think you're a Growtoken scammer. Once you reach 0, unlock the door to the public. Once the item is obtained, use the /kickall slash command or separately kick the players until everyone is back at the White Door.

If you have more items to give away, lock the door before you kick the players. After everyone is back at the starting point, repeat this step.
 Let them linger on until the giveaway is over for extra Growtoken time.

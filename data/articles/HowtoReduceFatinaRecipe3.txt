 When you cook in a skillet, you typically spray it or pour some oil into the pan to keep the food from sticking. Switch to a non-stick pan that removes the necessity for oil. Even if you don’t use much oil, you’re adding fat to the recipe that is unnecessary when a non-stick pan achieves the same purpose.Copper skillets are a great non-stick option. Teflon coated pans are another good option.
Cooking without oil may require you to change the way you cook the food.
 Recipes that instruct you to add oil to the pan typically list a specific amount, but you may be in the practice of simply pouring oil into the pan. Start following the measuring instructions and even try using a little less oil than you are instructed.If your recipe does not list an amount, try using less than you think you need and see if it ends up being enough. Experiment to find the right measurement when one isn’t given.
 Place vegetables one layer thick in a flat pan and add just enough water to cover the bottom. Cover the dish with a lid and heat for a few minutes in the microwave. Then let the dish sit for another 4-5 minutes. The vegetables will get tender without the fat of butter or oil.Steam vegetables in a steamer or in the oven if you don’t want to use a microwave.

 Use a pin to drill two small holes on opposite ends of the egg. Insert a toothpick or straightened paper clip and push it in and out of the hole to break up the yolk.


You may need to widen the holes in order to successfully remove the insides of the egg.
If you are worried about the egg cracking, put some scotch tape or a band-aid on the ends of the egg, and pierce the shell through the tape.;
, The top of the egg is the narrower, pointier end. As you blow air into the egg, the yolk and white should flow out from the hole on the opposite side.


Make sure you have a bowl or container set up to catch the insides of the egg!

, Use the straw to blow out water and any remaining yolk or whites that might still be in the egg.


You can dry the egg in the microwave for 10-30 seconds, which may make it a little stronger.
For an added surprise, you can fill the egg with confetti once it's dry. Just make a funnel out of paper and use that to pour confetti or glitter through the hole. Fill the egg about halfway.
Seal the hole by gluing a tiny scrap of tissue to the shell. You don't want the seal to be visible, so use a piece that is as small as possible and as close to the color of the shell as you can get.
Make sure there's no evidence of confetti or glitter on the outside of the shell to give away your surprise.
 Make sure you are covering the holes with your index finger and thumb so they can't see them (or the tissue paper seals).
 Because you are actually cracking an (empty) egg on their head, the trick is most effective if they can see you doing it.

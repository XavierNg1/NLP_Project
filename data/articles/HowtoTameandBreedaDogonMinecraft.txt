 They spawn in the Forest, Taiga, Mega Taiga, Cold Taiga, and Cold Taiga M biomes. If you are in creative mode, you can also spawn one using a wolf spawn egg.;
, They can be dropped by skeletons and wither skeletons, obtained from chests in desert temples and jungle temples, or caught by fishing. Then walk up to the wolf and right click on it with the bones. It may take multiple tries and will consume your bone. After you tame it, you can make the dog either sit or follow you by right clicking on it. When it is tame, it will be sitting by default, so you will have to right click it to get it to follow you.
 Make sure both dogs are at full health, then breed them by feeding any kind of raw or cooked meat (including rotten flesh) but not fish. You can feed them by right clicking.


The two dogs should go into love mode and breed a baby dog.
 Usually, the baby is already tamed. You can also make the baby sit or follow you. When the puppy is born, it will have low health, so you should feed it to bring it back to maximum health.

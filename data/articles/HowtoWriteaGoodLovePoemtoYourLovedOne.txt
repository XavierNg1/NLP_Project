 There should be no reason to fret about how eloquent your love poem is, because your emotions are all that count to the person you love.
 As you write a love poem, it is important to stay on track and avoid distractions. Once your words begin to flow, you don't want to be interrupted with mundane tasks.
 It is not necessary to write a love poem that rhymes, so if you have a free verse in your heart, then write it down that way. Think of how the person makes you feel, and write about it. Ask yourself questions about who they are, how they view the world and how they change your world for the better.
 Don't try to make your love poem sound smarter than it should. Don't look for large vocabulary words or use a thesaurus. Just write your feelings out in an uncomplicated manner when you write a love poem. Your succinct feelings pack the most punch. Simply tell him how you feel when you are away from him, and how you feel when you are together. Tell him all the things you would say in person if you had the time to put the words together in the right way.Read it out loud as your write your love poem. This is important, because more important than a rhyming poem, is a poem that has good strong rhythm throughout. This means that as you read you should feel a rhythm in your voice that stays through the entire reading.
 When you write a love poem for Valentine's Day or a birthday, you should make it look pretty on nice paper, and wrapped in a nice little box. The presentation is not vital, but it adds something special to your words and present.

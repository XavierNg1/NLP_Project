 Ask your friend if you can run errands, cook, or do laundry for them. Better yet, just do the work quietly and let your friend know afterwards.For instance, say something like, “Would you like me to come over and help you around the house tonight?” or “I made some food for you to put in the freezer. When should I bring it over?”
Don’t just tell your friend to let you know if they need anything. Many people don’t like to ask for help, even if they need it. Take the initiative yourself.
 Your friend might be dreading having to explain over and over to other people that their child died, especially if the death was unexpected. Ask if they would prefer for you to break the news to teachers, doctors, coaches, and other people their family interacts with often.Do not tell anyone about your friend’s loss unless they give you permission. It should be your friend’s right to decide how and when to break the news.
 As time goes by, let your friend know you haven’t forgotten their child. Light a candle for them, bring their name up in conversation now and then, or make a donation in their name.Don’t worry that you might be bringing back painful memories for your friend. For most bereaved parents, it’s very comforting to know that someone else still remembers and cares about their child.
 Many community churches and mental health centers offer special support groups for parents who have lost children. You might research organizations like this in your friend's area and pass along the information to them. If you live nearby, you might even offer to join her at a meeting, if it will make her feel more comfortable.

Ask religious and spiritual leaders in their community about such groups. You might also contact mental health counselors or therapists to see if they facilitate parent bereavement groups.
You might also search for groups online like The Compassionate Friends.

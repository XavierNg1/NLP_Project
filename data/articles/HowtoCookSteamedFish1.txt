 You can use any kind of thicker fillet (salmon, halibut, bass, snapper etc.) Or you can use a cleaned and scaled whole fish. Lay your fish in a lightly oiled glass dish with a lid.If you are working with several fillets, you can overlap them in the dish.;
, If you'd like, you can start an easy side to cook while your fish is cooking in the microwave. Put some rice in a rice cooker and turn it on. Try basmati or jasmine rice. Or, get your water boiling for couscous. Try salting the couscous water and adding a little butter or oil.
 Here comes the fun part. What kind of flavor are you craving? You can easily season your fish with any of the recommendations below, or create your own seasoning. Don't worry about basting the fish perfectly, just glob your seasoning on!


A few dashes of coconut milk, cloves, a clove of diced garlic, fresh or dried basil, cilantro, sliced chives, and lemon juice.
Lemon or limejuice, sliced green onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.
A pinch of ground cumin, a clove of diced garlic, sliced sweet onion, cilantro, salt, and pepper.
A splash of soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil, grated ginger, a dash of rice wine, and sesame seeds.
 Cover your dish with a lid and place it in the microwave for 4-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillets.


Use a fork to carefully test the doneness of your fish by gently flaking away at the meat. If the meat is white (or barely opaque) and flakes easily, the fish is done.
 Combine your fish with a side of rice, couscous, salad, or whatever you prefer, and enjoy!

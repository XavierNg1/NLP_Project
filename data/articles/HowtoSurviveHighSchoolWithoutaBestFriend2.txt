 You don’t have to be an all-star athlete in high school to enjoy sports.


Whether it’s dance, volleyball, hockey, football, soccer, cheerleading, basketball, or track, choose a sport that you enjoy.
Being on a team will let you meet and connect with your peers and maintain your physical fitness, which will keep your endorphins high. Endorphins are chemicals in your brain, and higher levels of endorphins equate to a higher level of happiness. They can act almost like an antidepressant.
If you can’t play for a school team, look into playing in community leagues.



You can take classes at school, join an after-school club, or look for local classes. Community newspapers often have a list of free or inexpensive art classes.
There are many types of creative expression to choose from. You can draw, paint, write poetry, act in a play, sing, play an instrument, or even learn to build things.
 Volunteering lets you get outside yourself and do something for someone else.


Volunteer based on your strengths. For example, if you are a great artist, volunteer at a local nonprofit arts museum. Or, if you’re good around children, volunteer somewhere like the Ronald McDonald house or the children’s hospital.



Create a resume and go around to local business and fill out applications. Even if they aren’t hiring, they’ll often put your resume on file.
Look to online job boards for posted openings. Qualifications will often be included in these, so you’ll know if you can apply.
Ask your parents or other adults if they have any contacts that might help you find a job.
Consider a nontraditional job with flexible hours like babysitting or taking care of a pet.

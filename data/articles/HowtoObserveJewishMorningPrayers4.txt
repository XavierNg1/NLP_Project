 There are 4 parts of the morning prayers


All the prayers are written in Lashon Hakodesh (Hebrew: "language of Holiness"), otherwise known as Biblical Hebrew.
If you do not know how to read Biblical Hebrew, it is suggested that you buy a prayer book with a translation to a language with which you are familiar.
Birchas Hashachar (Hebrew: "blessings of the morning")
P’sukei De’Zimra (Hebrew: "passages of praise")

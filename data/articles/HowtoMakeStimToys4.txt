 Any type of flour works for this purpose, but use a typical balloon rather than a water balloon, as water balloons are thinner and more susceptible to popping.


Don't get a cheap balloon, as these will pop easily. You may even want to put one balloon inside of another balloon before filling it, as a precaution.
If you have an allergy to latex, use latex-free balloons.
 You can use your fingers to gently widen the neck of the balloon.
 Take a small spoon and begin adding flour into the balloon. Be cautious to avoid spilling flour all over your workspace.
 The balloon should be full enough so that there's minimal air, but not full enough that it's impossible to change its form using your hands. If it's firm to the touch, it's too full, and you run the risk of it bursting and making a mess everywhere when you squeeze it.
 Stretch out the neck of the balloon, then knot it by creating a loop and slipping the end of the neck through the loop. Make sure not to flip the balloon in a way that causes the flour to spill out.


If you've "double-bagged" the balloons, be sure to tie both of the balloons, not just one. Tuck the innermost knot into the second balloon, and then knot the outermost balloon.
 You can knead the balloon with your hands and move the flour around inside of the balloon. Just be careful not to squeeze all the flour to one end of the balloon, or it might pop!

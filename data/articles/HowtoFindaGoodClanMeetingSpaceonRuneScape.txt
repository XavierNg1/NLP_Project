 many factors affect your meeting space- whether it be seclusion or open space. pick an unused spot.;
, You may want a very large space for a very large clan, and these are easy to find. Many places in Runescape are large and unused- these are good for teaming up. A multi-combat place is recommended.
 You may want to easily be able to access others so you can PK. This is good. Places near crossroads are good, like Draynor Manor or the top floor of the farm across from the Lumbridge potato field.
 Sometimes an irresponsible member of your clan may lead an enemy of the clan to your meeting place. When this happens, change your meeting spot.
 If by any chance you run into another clan claiming a meeting spot as theirs, don't use it. They probably WILL fight you over it.

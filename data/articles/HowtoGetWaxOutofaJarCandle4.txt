 Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 200°F (94°C). The warm temperature of the oven will be just enough to let the candle wax melt.
 This will not only protect your baking sheet, but it will also make cleaning up quicker and easier; all you have to do is pull the foil off, scrunch it up, and throw it away. Be sure to cover the sides as shown so that no melted wax will drip onto the baking sheet inadvertently when you remove it from the oven (thus flavoring your next batch of cookies in an unfortunate manner).
 You will be placing the baking sheet into the oven and letting the wax melt, so be sure to leave enough space between each jar. If you have a lot of jars, or jars with a lot of wax in them, consider putting only a few jars onto the sheet at one time; otherwise, you will risk the melted wax over flowing and spilling onto the bottom of your oven.
 After about 15 minutes, the wax should have melted and pooled at the bottom of the baking sheet. Do not leave the oven unattended. Melting wax is very flammable.


Consider leaving a window open. The melting wax will release a lot of fragrant oils. It will make your house smell nice, but it may also give you a headache.
 Set the tray down onto a heat resistant surface.
 The glass will be hot, so be sure to protect your hands using an oven mitt.
 There may be some wax residue inside the jar, especially around the rim, which was touching the melted wax.


If a paper towel does not get the wax out, then try washing the candle jar with soap and water, or wiping it down with a cotton ball soaked in baby oil.
 You can now stick a candle wick into the jar and fill it with wax to make a new candle. You can also paint the jar and use it to hold items, such as pens.


Consider melting the old wax down and using the melted wax to make smaller candles or wax melts.

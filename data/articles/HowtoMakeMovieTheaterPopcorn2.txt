 A small soup pot or a large saucepan should work fine. Add 3 tablespoons of peanut oil the pot.Some movie theaters cook their popcorn in coconut oil, so if you prefer, you can substitute coconut oil for the peanut oil. Heat the oil until it's liquid before placing it in the pot., Use aluminum foil to form a lid for the popcorn, which will keep the kernels from flying out. However, to let the steam out, cut holes in the top with a knife. Letting the steam out results in a crispier popcorn.Instead of salt, you can substitute what many movie theaters use, a popcorn salt with flavorings called Flavacol. You can find this flavoring at a restaurant food supply store or on the internet., Set the pot on the burner on medium heat. Turn the heat on medium., As it heats, move the pot around to keep the kernels from staying in one place. Be sure to use oven mitts to protect your hands. Listen for the popcorn to stop popping. If it stops before 3 minutes, take it off the heat., Take the aluminum foil off, and stir the popcorn to incorporate the salt., Add 2-3 tablespoons of clarified butter. While stirring the popcorn, continuously drizzle the butter over the popcorn, so it coats it evenly.

 A fizz will result, which will help remove any hair, dirt or other gunk.









Combine 1/3 cup (2.7 oz.) of baking soda with 1/3 cup (2.7 oz.) of white vinegar.
Pour the mixture down the clogged drain as soon as it begins to fizz.
Allow the mixture to sit in the drain for at least 1 hour, then flush it with hot water.
 Mixing together salt, baking soda and hot water will create a chemical reaction that should eat away the worst of the clog.









Combine 1/2 cup (4 oz.) regular table salt with 1/2 cup (4 oz.) baking soda. Pour the mixture into the clogged drain.
Leave it alone for 10 to 20 minutes, then flush it with hot water. The drain should clear when you run the water.
 Pour 1/4 cup (2 oz.) of any dish detergent into your toilet bowl.









Pour boiling water into your toilet bowl after you have added the dish soap. The soap should lubricate the drain and clear any residue or debris.
Plunge the drain until it is clear.

 For this trick you will need to cut one of your cards in half. Do this with a trick deck you don't plan to use for card games. Take out four cards: three jacks of any suit and a number card (4 of hearts or 7 of diamonds)., Use a pair of scissors to cut the numerical card in half so that the top and bottom of the card are still clear. Then use tape to join the ends of the severed card together. Don't tape in front of the inside of the card.


Your card should now be able to be folded without tape showing., Fold the numerical card on top of one of the jacks. Hold the cards so that the masked jack is in the middle of the other jacks. When showing the hand to people it should look like a numerical card in between jacks., Once you have the prepared cards in your hand, you're ready to try it on someone. First show your audience the "three" cards. Make some type of line about how one card is being sandwiched between two jacks. You want to get them thinking about the two jacks in your hand., Now you're ready to finalize the trick. Turn the cards over so they are face down and pull them onto a surface starting with the bottom card. The masked jack will look like any old face down card. It is important to grip and conceal the sleeve card. Have someone from the audience flip the cards over.


When finished successfully, the audience will see three jacks.
Practice concealing the "mask" and work on preforming this trick quickly. The faster you can do the trick, the more convincing your act is.

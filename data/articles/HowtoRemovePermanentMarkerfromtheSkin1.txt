 Hairspray that contain alcohol are great for removing permanent marker stains. Move into a well-ventilated area and spray the hairspray onto the stain so that it is completely coated with the liquid. Use your fingertip or a cloth to rub in the hairspray to the stain. When most of the ink has been dissolved, wash your skin off with soap and a bit of warm water and pat dry.

, Hand sanitizer contains a good amount of alcohol, which works to thin and erase the ink from a permanent marker stain. Squirt out some hand sanitizer onto your hand, and then rub it onto the marking on your skin using a circular motion. Doing this for 15-30 seconds should cause the marker to dissolve slowly, mixing in with the sanitizer. Rinse your skin off with warm water, and repeat the process until all the ink has been removed.
 Similar to hand sanitizer, insect repellent contains isopropyl alcohol, which dissolves permanent marker ink. Spray on a heavy amount of bug spray over the marker and use your finger or tissue to rub it into your skin. Continue spraying on the repellant and rubbing the marker stain until it dissolves completely, then wash your skin with soap and water.
 Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol is nearly guaranteed to get rid of your permanent marker stain.Simply pour some rubbing alcohol directly onto the stain or a rag, and use your fingertips or a rag to rub it onto the marker stain. The marker should fade relatively quickly; continue rubbing until all the ink is gone. Finish off by washing your skin with warm water and a bit of soap, and pat dry.








Use a rag or towel you donâ€™t mind getting dirty, as permanent marker will stain the cloth.

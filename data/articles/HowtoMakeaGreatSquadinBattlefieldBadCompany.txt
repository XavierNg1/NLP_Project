 Use them wisely and make a great variety with each class.;
, You can talk to the support guy and tell him you need health or repairs. You don't need go to someone outside of your squad(which is very frustrating). If you go in a vehicle with some squad members and you see a tank shooting at you, tell the support to get out and repair while your vehicle is taking damage. It will give you a lot of points and is very essential to keeping you and your vehicle alive.



One support: Which is what I explained in step 2.
Sabotage: This is mainly for attackers. This squad contains all specialists with C4's. This is the most successful squad type for attackers in my opinion. All specialists rush in and plant C4 on the gold crates and then destroy all gold crates in a matter of seconds. While some squad members plant the C4's, someone has to protect them if someone comes in the room or gold site.
Sharpshooter-Planter Combo: This contains a recon sniper to get in a position where they can see the gold crate and around it, and another squad member to plant the bomb. While it is armed, the sniper can snipe anyone who tries to defuse it.
Cheat: This squad has to have someone hide or camouflage behind there base while other squad members spawn on the person behind the base. The person hiding behind the base should probably be a sniper if the map is on Oasis, End of the Line, or Harvest Day.
Demolitionists: All squad members go demo with shotguns and defend/assault the base. If you are defending the crates, hide in an area where you can get a good shot on them as they come in to plant a bomb. If you attack, get in an area where you can keep on shooting the crates with rockets. Look out for snipers and don't go out in the open as a demo because demos don't have long range. Try to run along alleys and walls of buildings.

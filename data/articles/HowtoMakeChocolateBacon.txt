, If your bacon wrinkles and bubbles eagerly, the heat is too high and/or you're not flipping it often enough. Keep it on medium heat and flip often.
 For less grease and more crispiness, promptly flip the bacon on the paper towel, then blot the surface firmly with yet another paper towel.
,, Fill a pot almost halfway with water and set the heat on medium-low. Put a bowl on the pot and put the chocolate in the bowl. Add about two cups' worth of chocolate chips. The sweetness of the chocolate is up to you, but semi-sweet is recommended, and a splash of peanut butter chips never hurt anything (unless you are allergic to nuts).
 They will be stubborn at first, but you must persist. The double boiler will keep you from having to stir constantly.
 Use the spatula to coat each piece with chocolate. It also helps to leave one end of the bacon uncoated (the fatty end, if there is one) to avoid messy chocolate fingers.









Optional: Scrape off excess chocolate for a more powerful bacon flavor. This will please the hardcore bacon lovers in your life. Leave the ample chocolate coating (as shown) for the less bacon-inclined.
If you're in a rush to consume your bacon, put them in the freezer so the chocolate hardens quickly.

 It is also a good idea to sanitize and disinfect the handles of your makeup brushes. Although you should always wash your hands immediately before applying makeup, the handles may begin to develop a layer of oil and bacteria from your hands. Dip a paper towel or cloth into a small dish of rubbing alcohol.
 Squeeze out any excess alcohol to ensure that it does not drip into the barrel of the brush. Then, wipe the handle with the towel to disinfect it., Once you have finished wiping down the handle, lay the brush on a flat surface to dry. Rubbing alcohol dries very quickly, so it should not take longer than 15 minutes to completely dry.

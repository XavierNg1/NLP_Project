Start out in your backyard or another forgiving, grassy environment.
 Going outdoors strengthens your immune system, promotes an active lifestyle, and encourages a positive, proactive attitude.Spending time in nature can make you feel peaceful and put things into perspective. A long walk along a gorgeous mountain path will remind you of the beauty of the world and help you realize that being on your own is okay.


Make sure you let someone know where you're going and what time you'll be back. That way, if you get injured on your hike, your parents will know where to look.
 Dance classes, Zumba, step class--these workouts are insanely fun, but can also be a little embarrassing while you try to work out the steps and follow the instructor.

Yoga is another great, solitary workout. You can really focus on your movements. Plus, if you go to a class, chances are almost everyone there is alone, too.If you don't belong to a gym, just look up some videos for kickboxing, Zumba, or other fun workouts you can do in your living room., Give yourself a face mask, paint your nails and toenails, and sip on some chilled cucumber water. Try out some new makeup tutorials and finally figure out how to do a perfect cat eye. Just allow yourself to luxuriate and relax and feel like royalty for a while.Ask your mom if she wants to splurge with you--maybe she'll treat you both to a massage or a mani-pedi.

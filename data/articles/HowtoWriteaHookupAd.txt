 If you are going to send or receive e-mail related to hooking up it is a wise idea to create a separate e-mail account. Do not use your primary or work accounts. It is not advisable that you use your real name in the body of the e-mail address or as the name displayed when you send something.;
, Your age, your height, your weight and/or body type description as well as the colour of your hair and eyes. By doing this, you can avoid posting a photo publicly.
 Sometimes in a hookup ad people will mention something about the size or characteristics of their sexual organs. If you choose to do so be matter-of-fact but not profane. Also, be honest in regards to such topics as penis size. You don't want to look like a liar later on.
 Be matter-of-fact but not profane.
 It would be a wasted effort to e-mail someone back and forth only to find out that you're not looking for the same thing. By mentioning what you are not looking to do, people can take this into account before contacting you.
 It is not your intention to waste the time of others in your search for a hookup, therefore it is advisable to let potential responders know your personal preferences. Popular things to mention might include an age cap (ex: Maximum age of 30, 40, etc.), geographic location preference, body type or ethnicity.
 If you have an STI be forthright and mention this in your ad for two reasons. First, you don't want to infect anyone new. Second, you might be able to meet someone with the same STI whom you can consort with. You may fear getting no responses, but it's always better to be honest in this scenario.

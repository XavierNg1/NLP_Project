 This works best for crew or knee-high socks. The result is a very tidy square-looking fold that doesn’t stretch the cuffs and helps keep the sock drawer looking especially neat!








Again, start with a pair of matching socks you want to practice on.
Lay the socks on a firm, flat surface.
Straighten the socks out with your hands. There should be no lumps.
 The bottom sock’s heel should be facing up. The top sock should cross the bottom one at the middle.









Hold up the bottom sock by its toe and fold it across the top sock. The cross will now look like the letter T. Tuck the toe part that extends past the top sock underneath it.
Now hold the cuff of the bottom sock and fold that end also across the top sock as far as it will go.
Start tucking the unfolded sock by first bringing it by the toes across the forming square. Tuck in the part that might be sticking out.
Bring over the remaining long part by the cuff.
Turn the folded sock square and tuck in the two cuffs that are still loose. Flatten the folded square.
 This method is well worth the time. It will not only help extend the life of your socks, but it will make storing and finding them a breeze.









Practice makes perfect, and in this case it makes perfectly folded socks.
This method is also fantastic for arranging socks in neat drawer dividers.
Once you start folding socks this way, accidental snags and stretched cuffs will become part of the past.

Reduce the heat and allow the mixture to simmer., It will take an hour and a half to two hours for your mixture to thicken to a jam-like substance. During this time, stir the mixture regularly to prevent burning. You will have to stir the mixture more towards the end of the cooking process, as it will burn more easily during this time., When you're getting to the end of the simmer process, you can begin to prepare your jam jars.

When you're done, you can store your jam in the fridge.Unopened jars can last up to six months. Open jars will last about six months in the fridge.

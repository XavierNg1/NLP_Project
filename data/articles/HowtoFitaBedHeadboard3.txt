 Locate the screw holes in the back of the bed’s head. If you find bolts there, remove them. If not, purchase bolts of the appropriate size for the holes you find.Floor-standing headboards and those with struts are installed in nearly identical fashion.
 Note that the struts to a floor-standing headboard are built into the headboard itself. This is the bottom end. Position the headboard upright behind the frame’s head. Line the struts up with the screw holes in the frame. Keep the bottom of the headboard flush on the floor.The chief difference between floor-standing headboards and those with struts is in the name: floor-standing headboards should do just that. Don’t adjust the height as you would with simple struts.
 Fit a bolt through the gap in each strut. Screw it into the corresponding screw hole. Tighten it all the way so the headboard becomes firmly attached to the frame.Have a partner hold the headboard up so it remains flush against the bed frame as you work.

 A times table shows the products of sequential factors. Each column is labeled with one factor, and each row is labeled with another factor. The cell where the row and column meet gives you the product of the two factors.
 The standard times table is for factors 1-12, but your teacher may only require you to memorize a table for factors 1-10, depending on what grade you are in.
 You can also find a blank table online and print it, or use graph paper.It’s best to keep your table very neat, so that you don’t confuse factors.

When you make your table, be sure to keep room to the top and left of it so that you can label your rows and columns.
 The column to the left should be labeled “1,” and the other columns labeled in order up to 12. The top row should also be labeled “1,” and the other rows labeled in order down to 12.
 Since any number times 1 equals that number, you can quickly fill in the first row and first column of your times table, since these will all equal the number being multiplied by 1.

For example, in the top row, you would fill in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, since 1×1=1{\displaystyle 1\times 1=1}, 2×1=2{\displaystyle 2\times 1=2}, 3×1=3{\displaystyle 3\times 1=3}, etc. The first column follows the same pattern, since it shows 1×1=1{\displaystyle 1\times 1=1}, 1×2=2{\displaystyle 1\times 2=2}, 1×3=3{\displaystyle 1\times 3=3}, etc.
 The second row represents 2×x{\displaystyle 2\times x}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals each factor you are multiplying by 2, from 2-12.

For example, 2×2=4{\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}, 2×3=6{\displaystyle 2\times 3=6}, 2×4=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=8}, etc.
 In each row, you are multiplying that row’s factor by each factor represented in the columns. A quick way to fill in each row using mental math is to add that row’s factor to each product.For example, the numbers in the third row will be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36. The numbers in the fourth row will be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48. Note that for the third row, which represents the factor 3, you simply add 3 to each product to get the next product. For the fourth row, which represents the factor 4, you add 4 to each product to get the next product.
 You can verify all of your numbers are correct by using a calculator. You can also check your table against one in your math textbook or online.

 These are the tools you need to craft your set and there is no point working with materials you don't like.;
, Have a clear idea of what you want to do and the tracks you are going to play.
 You can either do this by finding an existing club and asking them for a set or trying to set up your own night. This will help decide what you are going to end up playing as few glam nights will let you play death metal.
 Is the set going to be a set for people to dance to or listen to? This can depend on when during the night the set will be and what sort of club you are playing.
 The track that you thought was killer at home can very suddenly become so-so in the heat of the moment. The better the slot you have the more options you need to bring with you. It's also nice to have requests with you.
 The best sets flow together from song to song, avoiding staying on one style for two long.
 Playing to your own crowd helps build your confidence, having friends on the dance-floor encourages others to join in, and you will never upset a barman by bringing along thirsty customers.
 Most mixers take a couple of minutes to learn for segue-ing but it's always good to know exactly how it functions. It's also good to ensure that your music is in a format the equipment can use.
 Bring your own headphones, get to the booth with plenty of time to avoid a rush, and check what has been played before. It is often considered bad form to repeat earlier songs or artists. If the club records set lists then be sure to bring a pen.
 Play track one, whilst it's playing focus on what track two will be and where you want to go after that. Don't think beyond track three or you will not be able to adjust for the audience or for the better track choice idea that will come along.
 If you are getting a reaction then be ready to go with it and give them a bit more of what they fancy. If they are dancing then go with what keeps them up there, if they are listening then keep them tapping their feet.

 If you have a choice between an electric and an acoustic guitar, learn to play the F chord on an electric guitar first. The thinner strings and faster fretboard make it much easier to maneuver around the strings, especially for barre chords.











The strings are closer to the fretboard on an electric guitar, so playing doesn't require as much finger strength.
 One good tip is to buy thinner strings for your guitar (preferably size 9s on an electric and size 10s on an acoustic) if your current strings are very thick.



Thinner strings don't require as much pressure to hold down, so they will save your fingers some pain!
If you want to learn how to change the strings on your guitar, see this article.
 The action of your guitar refers to how high the strings are placed above the fretboard. This requires professional servicing, but is a key step to make playing and learning guitar far more fun.



The lower the action, the less pressure you'll need to apply to the strings. Cheaper guitar often have very high action, which can be a problem for newer guitar players.
Luckily, guitar shops are usually able to lower the action of any guitar as part of a set-up service. You'll have to pay money for this, but it could potentially make your guitar a lot nicer to play!

 Head on over to the Flight Club after you have a level 10-14 dragon to take the gliding classes; they really help. This an optional but highly helpful step.;
, The arrow at the bottom of the screen should help you if you are in the quest; if not, find where the Timberjack Taxi is and look to the left when you are facing the Taxi. You should see a curvy stone pathway. Follow that until you find the ledge with a light on either side. That is the highest point in the Wilderness.
 Then, move your mouse over to the green button at the lower right side of your screen and push it. Use your arrow keys to steer.
 Then land by pushing the down button until you see your dragon's feet touch the ground.
 There is another, smaller landing pad there; walk to it.
 Then, glide over to the left cave, the cave with all the trees and boulders in front of it when you are working in the quest. Then, congratulations! You have gotten over to where you need to be and learned how to glide in the process! You can now continue working in the quest. Don't forget to keep practicing in the Flight Club!

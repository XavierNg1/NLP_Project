 If you've entrusted a key to a friend, family member, or neighbor, now's the time to retrieve it. If you don't have your phone on you, head to a neighbor to call a key holder to help you out of this bind., This is generally a last resort. Having your landlord come unlock the door oftentimes costs a fee. And that's if they answer the phone. If your landlord isn't answering, or if you can't find their number, this option may lead to a dead end., Locksmiths are trained in techniques and equipped with tools that will, in most cases, help you break into your home without doing any damage. The cost of a locksmith varies widely depending on location, and can range from as low as $15 and as high as $75 (or more, depending on the lock).

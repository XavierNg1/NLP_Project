 You can also capture a Combee and use its ability to get Honey after battling with it.;
, Only four trees in the game will attract Munchlax, which will be chosen randomly before you start playing. If they are a Munchlax tree (you won't know if it is or not), there's only a 1% chance of attracting one, so try finding the good one.
 If you slather the same tree ten times and a Munchlax hasn't appeared, better try another tree.
 You will have to breed it. Since it will probably be male, you'll have to capture a Ditto to breed it, and if you're lucky and it's female, you can breed it with any Pok√©mon of the Monster egg Group. Note that Snorlax must be holding a Full Incense to get Munchlax, if not, you'll get a Snorlax.

 Make an upside down V shape, starting about an inch and a half away from your hairline. The “top” of the triangle should be about in the center of your head.A good guide for to locate the outer points is in line with the outer edge of your eyebrows. Any bangs cut outside of that could look too wide.









Your hair should be completely dry while you’re cutting your hair. You probably also want to cut your hair when it looks “normal,” or how it looks on a typical day. If your hair is unusually curly or atypically frizzy on the day when you cut it, you might be displeased with how it looks on a normal day.
 Tie the rest of the hair back into a low ponytail. Make sure that the only hair out of the ponytail is either the hair that you will cut into bangs.
 This means that if you want your bangs to blend into the rest of your hair, cut them long enough so that all of your bangs are the length of that longest hair. You can always cut more.
 Comb your bangs horizontally so that they lie flat against your face. Decide how long you want your bangs to be. Remember that you can always cut them shorter, but you cannot add back hair that you cut off.
 Use your nondominant hand. Make sure that the hair is even and pulled taut.
 Hold your bangs between your thumb and index finger, and, using your scissors, cut vertically up towards your fingers. Keep the scissors open and go slowly and lightly. The hair should become more feathered and layered.
 Keep the scissors vertical, but move horizontally. If you want your bangs to blend into the rest of your hair, cut gradually less hair as you move toward your ears.

 According to the Bible, you must confess your sins before you can be officially baptized. Speak to a priest or another Christian minister.The Bible describes John the Baptist baptizing people as such: "Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins." (Matthew 3:5, 6, NKJV)

, Many believe that it is not enough to merely confess your sins – you must truly repent for what you have done. Think about what it means to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior.Ask your priest for help. If you aren't sure how to make the step from confession to repentance, ask your pastor/priest or a knowledgeable member of your church for advice.
On Pentecost after the resurrection of Jesus, many people were amazed by the Holy Spirit. When they asked Peter what to do, he replied, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.” (Acts 2:38, NKJV)., The final prerequisite for baptism is that you really, truly believe. Search deep within yourself to make sure that you are ready for this decision. If you believe that you are ready, then you are ready. Express your intention to become a fully-baptized Christian.There are no age restrictions for baptism. In Christianity, any human being who has not yet been baptized can receive the sacrament of baptism. It is said that baptism leaves a permanent mark on your soul, such that you never need to be "re-baptized."

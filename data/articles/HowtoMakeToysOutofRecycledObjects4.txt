 A car tire swing is a great way to use up old tires for another year or more. For directions on making this, see How to make a tire swing.
 If you have an outdoor playground area, there are lots of fun things you can do with old car tires to make it even more fun, including making a car tire rocker, a car tire seesaw or a car tire sit-on animal.


For a car tire rocker seat, cut an old tire in half. This requires serious sawing ability, so if you don't know what you're doing, ask someone who does or have a hardware place do it for you. Bolt cutters are also helpful for cutting away edges that are difficult to saw away. Clean the tire half well. Measure a slat of wood that is wide enough for a child to sit on and slightly longer each side than the tire half. Cut two brace pieces of wood for sitting between the tire and the wooden seat as well. Sand the wood well, then spray paint. Also spray paint the tire half, using the same color. Spray with an outdoor sealant to protect the paint finishes. Use long wood screws with washers to hold the open sides of the tires together, then attach the braces and finally, nail the seat in place. Handles are also a good idea, so you might like to attach these at the end too.

 Protein bars are a great snack for on the go, for school or for work. It's simple to make and you only need about 3-4 ingredients. You can also easily adjust the ingredients to fit your dietary needs.
 Scoop 1 or 2 tablespoons of protein powder. Place some Â into your oatmeal when cooking for added protein and flavour.
 Chop up the fruits you usually incorporate into your smoothie and pop it into the blender. Pour in some sort of liquid so it blends smoothly. Sprinkle some protein powder into the smoothie and blend away, you'd be surprised at how much better it taste when you add protein powder.
 Pour yourself a glass of water or almond milk. Add in 1-2 tablespoons of protein powder, if you feel like you need more put some more in but not too much. Stir with a spoon and drink away.

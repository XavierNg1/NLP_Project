 Don't use your thumb when finding a pulse, because you will feel your own pulse instead of the patient's pulse.


Press your fingers against the bony part of patient's wrist. You will be pressing an artery between your fingers and the wrist bone, which helps you feel the pulse. Take care not to press too hard.
If you can't find the pulse in the wrist, try finding it on the side of the patient's neck or on the inside of the upper arm or upper leg.
 Multiply by 4 to get the heart rate. If the pulse is irregular, count for a full minute.


A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. In addition to the heart rate, note any irregularities.
A regularly irregular heart is one that seems to have an extra beat or a skipped beat at regular intervals.
An irregularly irregular heart rate has no real pattern of irregularity. It may be difficult to determine a heart rate.
Athletes may have heart rates lower than 60 and a person in pain or other distress may have heart rates higher than 100

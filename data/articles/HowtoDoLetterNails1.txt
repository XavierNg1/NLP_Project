 Apply a base coat and 1 to 2 coats of your choice of nail polish. Let the first coat dry before applying a second one.Don't worry about applying a top coat just yet.


This method is great if you want a handwritten font, such as cursive.;
, You will paint one letter on each nail. If you are using a 4-letter word, you can paint a simple image, like a heart, on one of your nails.
 If this is your first time doing nail art like this, consider practicing first on a sheet of paper. For best results, use a color that contrasts with your background color. For example, if you painted your nails pink, white or black letters would look great on it! If you painted you nails a metallic color, consider making the letters a non-metallic color.









Do the letters one stroke at a time.
 Once you have your letters painted, take a close look at them. Are there any uneven areas? If there are, you can fill them in using your striper/thin brush and letter color. If there are any jagged or rough edges, you can paint over them using a striper/thin brush and your background nail polish color.
 Let your nails dry completely before showing them off. You can do this by sitting in front of a fan for about 20 minutes, or by dipping them in icy-cold water for 2 to 3 minutes. Be careful with your nails for the first hour or sore, however; the polish will still be soft and easily dented!

, It could throw your defender off, and you might need a different play style to win. If he's a pretty defensive type player, who doesn't like giving up shots, you must learn to get off quick shots, or learn some moves. If he's a player who likes getting in close to shoot, keep your eyes on the ball, and stay between him and the net at all costs. If he's more of a Tracy McGrady, who just likes to score, then you gotta be on your toes, because he's gonna fire them off every chance he gets.
 If you always go for steals, you'll soon be out of breath. You still got to play some good defense, but you should be more concerned with not letting him get by you than getting the ball from him.
 If you don't win, it's not the end of the world. These are the time when you got to learn real street ball moves.
 In street ball, you might be able to get in a few good dunks but your opponent will be guarding the hoop closely. If he is worried about guarding the hoop, he will not be concerned about you taking a shot from the three point line. Once he figures out that you can shoot and dunk, he will have to stay closely on you which is when you put some moves on him to put him in his place. He will soon be out of breath and defense will be easy because he's going to throw up a prayer because he will be too tired to do any real damage on the court.

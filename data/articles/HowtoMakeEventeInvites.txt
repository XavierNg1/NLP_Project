,, This is my favorite way of doing this. Make sure whoever you're inviting has a Gmail account. If they don't? It's free and easy and takes about 2 minutes.


Now, go to your inbox and find the small, blue words in the top left corner. The 2nd from the left should say 'calendar' and click on it.
Go to the date on which your event is and click on it. A little speech bubble-like thing will pop up and you should click "add event details." Fill the areas out which ought to include What, When, Where, and that type of thing.
It should also say 'My Calendars.' Right above this it will also say 'Add.' Remember where this is and call yours friends and have them do everything you just did while guiding them through it on the phone. Tell them to find the 'Add' button and click on it. Now have them select "Add friend's calendar" and follow the given steps.
Eventually you will have all your Gmail friends be able to see your calendar, so next time it will be much easier for you to send out invites over the computer!

Now, go to the calendar on your group and enter the information on the event.
This is a great way to do things because it's like having a mini website for you and your friends.
Your friends will get a reminder a couple days before the event.
You can also blog on your group which may help if anyone has any questions.

Fill in these areas with the info in non-bold.
Be specific so that your guests will understand what they're being invited to.
Get creative and have fun!

 This will raise your heart rate and increase the distance you cover as well as the number of calories you burn during your workout.
 For example, walk for 5 minutes at a speed setting of "2" and then raise it to a "5" for 10 minutes. Continue increasing the speed until you are running.
 Set the speed on your treadmill to an easy jog, and then increase it for 3 to 5 minutes so you are running fast. Then, bring it back to a jog.

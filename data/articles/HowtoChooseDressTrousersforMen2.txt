 When you try the dress trousers on, wear them at an appropriate height. The “fall” of the trousers – the distance between the crotch and waist – is longer than on jeans and other casual pants. Therefore, hike the dress trousers up to their proper height above the hips when trying them on.The trousers should stay on comfortably without the aid of either suspenders or a belt.
When trying trousers on, wear shoes and a shirt you’d actually wear with the dress trousers.
 Ballooning fabric – that is, the outward motion of excess trouser fabric from the crotch, buttocks, or other areas of the trousers – is a sign they do not fit properly. In some cases, you might be able to get this ballooning taken care of by a tailor, but it’s usually easier to just find a pair of dress trousers that fit you better., Some trousers fit better with a belt. Others fit better with suspenders, which makes the trousers fit more loosely. If you know that you will always be wearing trousers with a belt, with suspenders, or with both, ask your tailor to adjust the dress trousers accordingly before (or after) obtaining them.Some dress trousers for men do not even have belt loops, so look carefully at the trousers you wish to obtain before making a decision.
 If your trousers are widest at the ankles, they will not fit properly. You might trip and look silly. Therefore, choose dress trousers that taper toward the ankles., If your trousers are stretched tightly across the thigh, they will not be comfortable and will impede your movement. Excessively tight trousers are more likely to come apart at the seam.Bunching might also occur in the lower legs, but the thigh is the area most traditionally associated with bunching.

 If you're not interested in their trade, tell them so. If they continue to harass you, block them. Being rude to them will only get you reported!

, Don't threaten them. Don't offer second/third/tenth chances. Just silently report them for scamming. It's that easy.


Don't ask for items in exchange for not reporting them. That's scamming and being a bully.
 If you don't want to hear them, block them. Blocking is one of the easiest ways to avoid Jammers who get on your nerves or make you feel uncomfortable.
 Don't be rude about it. Tell other people who are thinking about becoming ensnared in a scammer's trap about what they're doing.
 If you've made them aware of the consequences and they still want to go through with it, back off. You'll only make other people angry and risk being reported yourself.

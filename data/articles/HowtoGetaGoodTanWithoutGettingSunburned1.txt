 Sunscreens allow some of the sun's rays to penetrate, giving you some tanning action while shielding you from many harmful UVA and UVB rays.;
, Before start sweating or swimming, wait about 15 minutes to give your sunscreen a chance to bind to your skin.
 Do not lay out between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The sun's rays are strongest during those hours, and you're more likely to get a sunburn.
 Start by laying out for 15 minutes and add 5 minutes or so per week. Your tan will progress more gradually, but you'll avoid getting burned.

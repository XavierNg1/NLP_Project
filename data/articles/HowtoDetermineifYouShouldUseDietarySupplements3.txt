 The specific doses you need to take will vary depending on which supplement you take. Always read the label to know exactly how much of each supplement you should take each day. Although supplements are good for you, you can actually overdose on them.You can also ask your doctor how much of each to take if you are unsure.
 Just like medications, supplements have recommended dietary allowances (RDA). The RDA of supplements will vary based on your age, gender, and particular situation. These will be different based on each supplement as well.


Know that many daily values (DV) will exceed the RDA. Your RDA is the minimum required for you to take each day to get the benefits of the supplement.
 Some supplements can cause toxicity if you take too many of them. Water-soluble vitamins, such as the B vitamins, generally do not cause problems because they are flushed out when you urinate. There are others that can cause problems. These include:


Iron, which can cause constipation and rarely, more serious conditions such as hemochromatosis
Fat-soluble vitamins, such as Vitamins D, E and A, which can cause toxicity over time because they are stored in body fat and are released over time.

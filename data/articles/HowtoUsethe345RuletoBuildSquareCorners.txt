 If a triangle has sides measuring 3, 4, and 5 feet (or any other unit), it must be a right triangle with a 90º angle between the short sides. If you can "find" this triangle in your corner, you know the corner is square. This is based on the Pythagorean Theorem from geometry: A2 + B2 = C2 for a right triangle. C is the longest side (hypotenuse) and A and B are the two shorter "legs."3-4-5 is a very convenient measurement to check because of the low, whole numbers. The math checks out: 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.;
, You can use feet, meters, or any other unit. Draw a mark at the end of three units.


You can multiply each number by the same amount and still use this. Try 30-40-50 centimeters if using the metric system. For a large room, use 6-8-10 or 9-12-15 feet or meters.
 Using the same unit, measure along the second side, at – hopefully – a 90º angle to the first. Mark this point at four units.
 If the distance is 5 units, your corner is square.If the distance is less than 5 units, your corner is less than 90º. Move the sides apart.
If the distance is over 5 units, your corner has a measurement of more than 90º. Bring the sides closer together. You can use a framing square as a guide when you do this.
Once you’ve got a square corner, you can check the room’s other three corners to ensure they’re the same.

 Put your hands spread out on the ground. Face away from a nearby wall. Make sure an adult is present when doing this move to keep you from falling.
 Put your feet against the bottom of the wall and "walk" backwards. Keep your hands on the ground. Straighten your elbows and knees as you go up.
 Once your legs are straight and your toes are up against the wall, it's time for your hands to do the walking. Start by moving your right hand back slightly. Bring your left hand back to line up with the right. Repeat this until your stomach is very close to or flat against the wall. You have just done an easy handstand., In gymnastics, when a coach or guide tells you to "return to position," you should go back to the stance you started at. In this case, return to the crouch from Step 1. To get back down, walk forward with your hands and let your legs slowly slide down the wall.

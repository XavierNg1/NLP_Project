 Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.
 The best size is one that covers the jar fully and is neither too small, nor too large. If it is too small, perhaps join two doilies together.


If you have to cut the doilies, do so with great care. Use Mod Podge or clear nail polish to seal the cut edges of the doily to prevent fraying while working with it.
, Take care to smooth out wrinkles or bumps as you go. Allow to dry in place.
 This will seal it and help keep it clean during use. Allow to dry.
 Tie a thin ribbon or a length of burlap around the neck of the jar. You might add something else too, such as a little bell, a small star, a bead or a love heart (made from metal, wood, plastic, glass, etc.) just as a finishing touch.
 The jar can be used for storing items (such as pens and pencils) or you can even use it as a lamp. Drop a votive candle into the base of the jar, light with a long-stick match and see the beautiful patterns the doily makes with the glow of the candle behind it.

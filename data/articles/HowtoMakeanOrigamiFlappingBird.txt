, If you haven’t already, fold the square in half diagonally. Repeat in the other direction. Unfold the paper and you should see the X.
 Make sure the ever-so-slightly-raised center of the X points up (like the top of a very flat pyramid).
 First both vertically and horizontally to form a + that intersects with the center of the X. When you’re done, the creases of the + will bend in the opposite direction as those of the X.
 The shape is similar to the origami “fortune teller” (a.k.a. “cootie catcher”) used in children’s games.
 Turn the paper, so that you have a diamond with the open end facing you.
 Start by making sure the opening is at the top of the diamond.






Grab the right-hand corner of the upper layer and fold it downwards and inwards toward the center, then repeat on the left-hand side.
Flip the paper over and repeat on the other layer.
, Flatten. Turn the paper over and repeat. You should end up with a kite shape.
,, Pull it down slightly, reverse its crease, and bend it downwards.

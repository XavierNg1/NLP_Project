 Make sure it's in ok condition.
 You'll need the dish, aluminum foil, insulation (e.g. newspaper), black paper, a stand, and some tape., Fold up your insulation so it's a triangle that's the shape of one of the ribs. Tape it together., Make sure it's flat! Otherwise it will not reflect as well. Put it (shiny side up) on the insulation and tape or glue it to the satellite.,, Tape the black paper to the outside of the dish. (This step is actually optional, so skip it if you don't want it.), You now can cook all the food you want using the focus on the sun.

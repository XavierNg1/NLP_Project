 It can punish if your opponent isn't expecting it. Make sure you always remember to charge it up and don't use it right away. Your opponent will begin to get nervous, will forget about it, and you could easily strike them when they least expect it.;
, However, don't use it as much, because that move is slow when releasing the missile and could cause a blind spot and a free spot for your opponent to grab you or just attack you.
 Even though her grabbing range is great, it's slow and you could be grabbed yourself if you don't use it carefully.
 Her side smash is best to use to send an opponent flying. Her up smash is mostly best for racking up damage. Same with her forward air attack (racking up damage).
 This isn't the best move, because if you miss your opponent, that leaves you falling to the ground and no dodging till you get to the ground. Characters could easily use their back air to send you flying if you have plenty of damage already done to you.
 Samus is fast, but not fast enough that you should use her dash attack. It's not the best and you most likely miss a lot.
 This is a powerful combo attack that will send them flying if you use it right.
 She's a great character. Even if you main other characters, give her a chance! If you follow these steps and are prone to reacting quickly, you should be able to do great with her.

 Mangoes should be selected by aroma, not by color; color distinguishes variety rather than readiness. The aroma should be distinct and ripe. In addition, choose mangoes without blemishes or splits.;
, Keep firm mangoes at room temperature to begin with. Once they are slightly softer (they will indent when gently pressed), place them in the fridge.
, Mangoes can be frozen. The skin will turn black but the flesh will stay in good condition (it will be just a little softer than prior to freezing). You can freeze either the entire mango or you can freeze chopped up pieces.

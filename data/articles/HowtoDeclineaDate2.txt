 You absolutely have the right to say no if you aren't interested. That said: you don't need to be cruel in order to decline a date. Try to empathize with the person. Be kind and straightforward.Say, "I know how it feels, and I feel bad to let you down like this."
Say, "I hope we can still be friends. I'm not interested in you romantically, but I do truly value you as a human being."Think of a time when you felt rejected. Consider what you can do to make the rejection less harsh.
 The more of a connection you make with a person, the harder it can be to brush off his/her offer of a date. Keep your conversation light. Focus on broad and basic topics. That said: you may need to get serious if you are asked out by a friend or someone that you already know well.
 If it feels right, mention someone you know that you think would adore the person that you declined. Offer to introduce this person to someone that you think he/she would like. Be aware that this is only appropriate in situations where a person is asking you out casually.


If a friend or acquaintance is absolutely in love with you and asks you out, then it may not be kind to immediately suggest an alternative. Be compassionate and respectful.
If a stranger strikes up a conversation in the supermarket and asks you on a date, then this might be the perfect opportunity to set him/her up with a friend of yours. Make sure that you're suggesting a match that might actually work â€“ not just making an excuse to escape.

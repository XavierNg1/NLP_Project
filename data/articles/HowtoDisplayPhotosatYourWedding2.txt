 When deciding where to place photos, think about where your guests will be walking or sitting. Hang photos behind food tables, set up tables of photos near drinks, and place your guest book and programs on a table filled with frames.You may want to place shelves with photos or twine with pictures clipped to them near tables or areas people will walk past.
 For a personalized touch, consider putting a caption with each photo you display at your wedding. Clip a caption next to the photo of your parents' wedding hanging on twine, or set a folded card next to a framed photo of you and your partner on your first date.You can make caption flags you tape to the back of frames, or place caption strips in the bottom of the frame.
 One easy and classic way to display your wedding photos is to put them in frames. You can buy frames that match your wedding colors, go for classic black, or even make DIY frames with your wedding party.Consider buying vintage or antique frames from yard sales, thrift stores, and antique shops.
 Displaying your photos by letting them dangle around the reception hall is a unique way to share your photos. The hanging photos catch your guests’ attention. You can string twine or clothesline along walls and from the ceiling. Clip photos with clothes pins or binder clips.This saves money on frames since the photos won’t need them.
You can display a lot of photos this way. You can have a theme for each string, or mix photos of family members weddings, baby photos of you and your fiance, and photos from your relationship.

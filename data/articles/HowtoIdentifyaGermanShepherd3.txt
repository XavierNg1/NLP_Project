 If you see a dog that you think might be a German Shepherd and are curious about the breed, approach the owner and ask. For example, you could say something like “Is that a German Shepherd? It is such a cute dog.” Alternatively, you could say “What kind of dog do you have? I am considering getting one.”


Most dog owners will be happy to tell you about their dog and the breed.
 If you are unsure of your dog’s breed or lineage, ask your veterinarian to help you identify the breed. Veterinarians will be familiar with the breed standard of most dog breeds. They will be able to easily examine the physical characteristics of the dog to help with identifying the breed.
 If you are purchasing a German Shepherd from a breeder, you should talk with the breeder about the puppy’s parentage and lineage to make sure that you are getting a purebred dog. A licensed breeder will be able to provide you with paperwork that proves both parents are recognized as German Shepherds by the American Kennel Club.


Make sure that you always use a breeder that is licensed by the American Kennel Club. This will also help to ensure that you are purchasing a purebred dog.
 There are a number of applications available that can help to identify different dog breeds. In order to use the app, simply upload a photo of a dog and the app will identify the breed.For example, try using the Microsoft app called Fetch!
These apps are not always 100% accurate, but a German Shepherd has fairly unique characteristics.

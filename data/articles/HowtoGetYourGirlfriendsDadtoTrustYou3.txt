 Your girlfriend's dad should be able to see that you have genuine affection for his daughter, but you also have to be careful not to do anything that might make him feel uncomfortable.Do things that show how much you care for his daughter, while also suggesting you are respectful. Behaviors like opening doors for her, pulling out a chair for her to sit in, and generally doting on her can help him see you are treating his daughter right.
Mild physical affection like holding hands, a hug, or peck on the cheek are also probably ok behaviors. Don't get sexual in front of your girlfriend's dad, though. No groping, tongue kissing, or anything along those lines.
 When your girlfriend speaks, make it clear you are paying attention to her, as this shows respect for her. However, don't pay so much attention to her that you are excluding her dad or other people who might be around.You want to make it clear that his daughter is important to you, but you also need to show that you are socially competent and respectful of others. No one wants to feel ignored or excluded.
If you don't engage with your girlfriend's father, he can't get to know you and see that you are trustworthy.
 Respect your girlfriend's father's rules about her, at least when he's around. Don't act like you know better than him what is best for her.


If you stay at his home and he expects you to sleep in separate rooms, do so without complaint.If your girlfriend still lives at home and has a curfew, make sure you always get her home on time. This shows that you respect her father and can be trusted.

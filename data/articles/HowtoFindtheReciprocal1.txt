 The definition of "reciprocal" is simple. To find the reciprocal of any number, just calculate "1 รท (that number)." For a fraction, the reciprocal is just a different fraction, with the numbers "flipped" upside down (inverted).For instance, the reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.;
, Again, the reciprocal of a number is always 1 รท (that number). For a whole number, write that as a fraction; there's no point in calculating it out to a decimal.


For instance, the reciprocal of 2 is 1 รท 2 = 1/2.

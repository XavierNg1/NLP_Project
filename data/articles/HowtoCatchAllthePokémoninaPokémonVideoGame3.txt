 This will help later when you want to trade with friends. Depending on your version, there will be unique Pokémon unavailable in the counterpart to your version.


It can also be helpful to catch two rare Pokémon, keeping one for yourself and saving the other later for trade.
 If you know someone playing a different version of the Pokémon, talk to that person and make arrangements for trading.


For example, if you’re playing the Pokémon Black version, look for someone playing the other version of the game, which is Pokémon White.
 Completing the game opens full access to the Pokémon in their version.
 Link the two devices either using a link cable (for Game Boy) or through Wi-Fi connections (for DS/3DS consoles). While inside the game, head to a Pokémon Center and begin the trading sequence.Avid collectors sometimes collect two of every kind of Pokémon to do a full swap with another player. Doing this will allow you to own all the Pokémon available for that version of the game.
If you can’t find anyone to trade with, get another version of the Pokémon game and complete it on another Nintendo portable game console (Game Boy, DS, 3DS).

 Depending on the engine you are using, you may need to use a pair of pliers to disconnect the spark plug wire to remove the oil drain plug.Use a suitable receptacle to drain the oil into, and wipe any spills.


It's best to drain the oil from an engine when it's slightly warm, as the heat allows for a faster flow than when cold.;
, Loosen the fuel hose clamp before you start draining your fuel. You can do so by tracing the route of the fuel hose from the engine to the base of the gas tank. Notice where the hose attaches to your lawn mowers carburetor.Using your pliers, squeeze the clamp loose and slide it upwards on the hose. Now you can detach the hose and drain your fuel into a bucket.
 You can usually find the throttle linkage beneath the carburetor. There will be a cable that should connect to the throttle, and by removing the screw that holds the cable in place, you can easily remove the throttle linkage., This part is on the side of the engine and will have the shape of a small can.Electric-start lawn mowers will have a red battery cabled attached. Use a wrench to unfasten the cable from the starter.
 At the base of your mower engine is the mower house, which is where the engine is seated normally. Using your wrench on the bolt and another to hold still the nut below the mower house, unscrew the bolts holding your engine in place.
 You will find the drive belt on pulley on the crankshaft beneath the engine. Incline the engine slightly forward and pull the drive belt from its pulley., Taking the engine firmly with both hands, lift the engine from the mower house and place it carefully off to the side in a safe place.

 Once you meet the artist and get comfortable, it'll be time to remove your clothes. A private changing room will likely be provided or there may be a folding screen that you can change behind.
Use the privacy to get centered and ready for a nude art modeling session. Remove your clothes and put on your robe and slippers.
Step up to the modeling area. Step up onto the model's area holding only your timer to mark the time passed in each of the posing sessions.
 Your artist will designate an area for you to place these items during your session. If sitting or lying down, it is best to do so on a towel or sheet. The artist may provide one for you, or you can bring one of your own.
If you do not have a towel, it is hygienic and highly recommended that you place your robe beneath your bottom for sitting poses.
Some artists even enjoy drawing the additional "drapery."

, Keep your body and eyes very still. Listening to your artist is key for a successful session.It is useful to fix your gaze on one spot; do not make eye contact with any artist unless specifically directed.
Relax into the pose, but not so much that you move from your original position.
You may be asked to time your own poses or the artist may tell you when you're finished.
If you're not sure about what the artist means, don't be afraid to ask for clarification. This is far better than striking the wrong pose.
If you're told to hold a pose that is too challenging, it's better to speak up than to try to hold it.
The artist would rather have you hold a pose that you can maintain for the duration instead of having to start over.

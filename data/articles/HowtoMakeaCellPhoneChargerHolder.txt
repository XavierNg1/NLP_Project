 Or, you can use nearly any bottle that has a wide body. Clean it out completely and make sure that the bottle is dry before moving to the next step.;
, Make one cut on the front of the bottle, halfway down. Only cut out the front of the bottle so that the back remains intact.


Slice off the top of the bottle and round out the top to create an upside down “U” shape.






Add a hole or opening to the middle of the “U.” The hole will allow you to hang the holder from the adapter, so consider using the adapter's shape to guide you in perfecting the size.
 Measure the bottle to determine how much fabric you will need.


Mark the dimensions on the fabric, then cut out the pattern.
 Wrap the holder with the fabric using hot glue. You may need to trim away fabric pieces as you go but wrap the back first, then bring the fabric around to the front and join it underneath the bottle.


Cut the fabric around the hole or opening and add more hot glue to secure it in place.
 Done!

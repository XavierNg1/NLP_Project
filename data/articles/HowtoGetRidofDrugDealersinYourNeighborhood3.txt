 Drug dealers look for locations where neighbors don’t talk to each other and where people tend to be isolated. This allows them to more easily intimidate people who notice them. A strong, active, positive community is one of the best deterrents for drug dealers.


Hosting activities such as community cook-outs, block parties, and other events will help you get to know your neighbors and strengthen your community., See if they will help clean up and refurbish rundown storefronts and parking lots. These clean-ups could even employ people who might otherwise turn to drugs.
 Sometimes, young people get involved in drugs because they don’t see better options. A youth center can provide alternative activities and opportunities for young people.Work with local churches, businesses, social services, and police to provide resources and training. Young people can be very effective peer anti-drug educators.
 Schools, churches, and the police usually have resources that can help you establish a drug prevention fair to educate people on the dangers of drug use and how to prevent drug activity in your area.

 Bite and claw marks at various stages of healing indicate animal fighting. Notice if scars or wounds do not match the teeth and claws of the animal you suspect has suffered cruelty.For example, if you suspect a dog has been subjected to dog fighting, look for bite marks that might be consistent with another dogâ€™s jaw size, particularly at the face, neck, and front portions of its body. While spotting wounds once might not be suspicious, be aware if the animal consistently shows signs of fighting injuries.
 In addition to wounds obviously inflicted by another animal, notice any series of wounds that indicate prolonged violence. Be suspicious if one skin abrasion, scratch, or burn shows signs of healing while another is fresh.For example, abrasions around the neck from a tight collar might appear to be healing one day then appear to be fresh the next time you see the animal. Other examples of suspicious injuries include possible cigarette burns or sudden bleeding from orifices.
 Note if the pet owner you suspect of animal cruelty has ever exhibited violent behavior. If you interact with that person consistently, be aware of any shouting or yelling, frequent intoxication, or throwing or destroying objects.Research has shown that behaviors like animal abuse, property damage, and domestic violence are all interrelated. For this reason and for your own safety, avoid confronting the person you suspect on your own.

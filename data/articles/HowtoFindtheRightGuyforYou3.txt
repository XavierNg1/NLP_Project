 Steal quick glances and smile at the guy that you're interested in.
 Don't be afraid to spark up the conversation yourself if he doesn't start talking to you first. In the wise words of Nelly Furtado, "chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute." Don't let that cutie get away without a conversation.


Ask him a question or make a witty comment about what he's doing to break the ice. For example, if he just loudly lost a game of pool to his buddies, you might tease him and tell him you know a good place that he could take lessons.
Body language is just as important as each word you say. Show him you're interested by maintaining eye contact, leaning slightly forward with your body, playing with your hair and flashing him coy smiles.
 Dating is hard. It forces you into a vulnerable position where you have to talk about yourself in a favorable light over food you might not normally eat. But, it really can be fun if you approach it in the right way.


Be yourself when you're on a date. Though we often have the tendency to hide our quirky traits or nerdy obsession with Star Wars on the first date, resist the urge to misrepresent yourself.
Don't take yourself too seriously. Take the pressure off and allow your true personality to shine through. If you joke and lighten the mood, you'll encourage your date to open up and do the same.
Don't try to force a connection. If you haven't felt a spark after a few dates, let it go. Be straightforward with your date by telling him that you just aren't feeling the romantic vibes and suggesting that you remain friends.

 Do what everyone else is doing, but to a lesser degree. If everyone is laughing, chuckle; if everyone is crying, shed a tear. The key is to be subtle in all your actions.
 By not replying to others, you’ll avoid their current attention. Further, your lack of reply may likely cease other correspondence.


Turn off your cell-phone. Avoid calls and texts the same. Set your voicemail to let everyone know you’ll be out of the loop for a while. Let emergency contacts know where you’ll be and how to reach you otherwise.
Don’t check your personal email. Work email may be unavoidable, but personal email can wait. Set an “out of office” auto-reply, or pretend you’re on vacation.Log out of social networks. No tweets, snapchats, or facebook messages. Imagine you are trying to avoid revealing a show’s cliffhanger secret or the final score spoiler.
 Try to avoid eye contact so people aren’t prone to engage you. Lack of eye contact signals inattentiveness and lessened interest.Try not to initiate conversation with anyone. If someone initiates with you, be polite but abrupt. Make it clear you wish to be left alone.

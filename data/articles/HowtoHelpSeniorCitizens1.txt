 You can do this by inquiring at local nursing homes, places of worship, volunteer organizations, looking online, or asking family and friends if they know of opportunities. Write down any opportunities you find that sound interesting to you.


Look for opportunities to help senior citizens while also doing something else you love. For example, if you play the violin, inquire with local organizations or nursing homes about opportunities to come play at a residence for a special occasion (such as a major holiday) or on a regular basis.;
, Make a list of potential places to volunteer and then start contacting them to find out how you can help. Think about what you would enjoy doing the most or what would give you the most satisfaction and start there. Do you enjoy working directly with people and being very hands-on? Or do you prefer to be in the background and run things behind the scenes? Think about your style and personality and find volunteer opportunities that suit you.


Look for a phone number on the organization's website. Call and let them know that you are interested in volunteering.
Send an email to an individual in the organization and ask how you can help. You could say: "I'm interested in helping senior citizens and wanted to ask if you are looking for volunteers." If they don't know, they can most likely direct you.
 This is especially useful if you are skilled in a trade, such as plumbing or carpentry, and can offer needed services for charity. You can take out a classified ad to advertise your services or talk to others to find out who might be in need of your services.

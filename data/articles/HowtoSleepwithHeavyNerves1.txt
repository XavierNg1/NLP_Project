 Some people find that doing something relaxing, like taking a hot bath or shower, reading a book, or working on a craft can help relax the mind before bed. Figure out something that you find relaxing and try to set aside some time each night before bed to indulge in your own pre-bedtime activities., It may sound obvious, but engaging in stressful activities shortly before bed can make you more anxious, which in turn may increase the chances of losing sleep.Avoid doing anything work-related or school-related before bed (which includes checking your work email), and resist the urge to look at the clock if you're lying restless in bed.

 Always note local laws before you start advertising. Private property is often closed off to you. Public sidewalks and universities are often safe distribution points. Make sure you are allowed to visit businesses, open mailboxes, or drop fliers at front doors. When you are asked to leave a non-public area, leave without a fight., Look like you belong by dressing like those around you. People will be more receptive to your message when you appear approachable. Focus audience attention on your message, not yourself. In an average area, you probably won’t want to wear ragged jeans. You wouldn’t advertise your restaurant on the street while wearing a suit and tie, either.Sometimes you may find a creative approach, such as a costume when advertising to children, to be beneficial. People outside the target group may be less likely to take your leaflet, however.
 Your sales pitch should be short but descriptive. You may say, “Would you like to learn about vegetarian eating?” or “Come eat homemade pizza at Primavera Pizza” as you hand out your leaflet. These messages describe your purpose without being offensive or forceful.Keep in mind that direct contact like this is an opportunity to answer questions and refer people to additional resources.
 Approach everyone with a smile. Do not hound people with your leaflets. Don’t get into any heated debates. When someone is rude, excuse yourself from conversation. Good manners will make people more likely to accept your leaflets., Seeing discarded leaflets may make you feel bad, but leaving them on the street can be bad for your cause. Multiple discarded leaflets make it look like your logo or message has been ignored. Also, these fliers form unappealing litter.

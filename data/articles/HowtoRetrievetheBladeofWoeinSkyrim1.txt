 Astrid can be found inside the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. To get there, take the road outside the city of Falkreath (the southernmost city on the map), and after a minute of walking, you should come across a wooden door with a skull carving on it sitting right beside a black pool of water. This is the door of the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. Approach the door and press the corresponding “Enter” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to enter it.;
, You should find Astrid standing in the middle of the first hall of the Sanctuary. Astrid is a female Nord with long blond hair and wears brown leather armor over black sleeved attire.
 Press the corresponding “Crouch” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to crouch down to the floor. Slowly approach Astrid from behind, making sure that she doesn’t see you.


If Astrid sees you, you need to exit the Sanctuary and enter again in order for you to be able to steal the dagger from her.
 Once you’re behind Astrid, press the corresponding “Pickpocket” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen and Astrid’s item inventory will open on the screen.


Scroll down the item list and look for the Blade of Woe. Once you find it, press the corresponding “Steal” button on your controller as displayed on the game screen to take the weapon. You’ve just retrieved the Blade of Woe and is now yours to use.

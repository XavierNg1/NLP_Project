 You'll just give people kills.;
, You have no teammates to watch your back so stay alert.
 Now weapons aren't everything, but having a rocket launcher, a sword, or a sniper rifle helps. A lot.
 When two other players are duking it out, wait till they lower each others shields then take them both out.
 Dying sucks, but if your start playing stupid you'll die even more.
 Don't take the game too seriously. It's just a game. A fun game, but only a game. Fun=Success.

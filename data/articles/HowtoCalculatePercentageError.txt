 The formula for calculating percentage error is simple:'x 100


The approximate value is the estimated value, and the exact value is the real value. Once you find the absolute value of the difference between the approximate value and exact value, all you need to do is to divide it by the exact value and multiply the result by 100.;
, This means that you should subtract the real value from the estimated value. In this case, the real value is 10 and the estimated value is 9.


Ex: 10 - 9 = 1

, Simply divide -1, the result when 10 is subtracted from 9, by 10, the real value. Place the fraction in decimal form.


Ex:-1/10 = -0.1

, The absolute value of a number is the value of the positive value of the number, whether it's positive or negative. The absolute value of a positive number is the number itself and the absolute value of a negative number is simply the value of the number without the negative sign, so the negative number becomes positive.


Ex: |-0.1| = 0.1

, Simply multiply the result, 0.1, by 100. This will convert the answer into percent form. Just add the percentage symbol to the answer and you're done.


Ex: 0.1 x 100 = 10%

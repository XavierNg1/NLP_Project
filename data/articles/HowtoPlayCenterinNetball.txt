 It includes giving that center pass at the beginning of the match, continuously running up and down the court, pulling the team together and supporting shooters in the defender (D). It also involves a great deal more, as you'll discover upon playing.;
, You need to drive down the court and make space to receive the ball.


As soon as the umpire blows the whistle and it's your centre pass, the wing attack (WA) should drive square, a ready option.
When WA receives the ball, goal attack (GA) should cut back down court, but C should drive across, to make a down-the-line option.
Once C receives the ball, GA/GS (goal shooter) should make themselves available, with one of them catching the ball and the other positioning themselves under the hoop, ready for the ball and ready to shoot.
 Fake/dodge or some kind of movement to get past your defender (in front of them).


Run quickly into space for your teammate to pass to you.
Be in a space that your teammate can pass to you without error, without the other team intercepting the ball.
 You and your team need to confirm who is cutting forward and sliding back so you can sharply get that ball to the D.

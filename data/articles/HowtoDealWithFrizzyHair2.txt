 After you’ve washed your hair, it’s a good idea to apply a silicone-based serum. It will coat the strands of your hair, so the cuticle stays smooth and frizz is reduced. Squeeze a dime-size amount into your palm, rub your hands together, and then work it through your hair.To ensure that the serum is evenly distributed throughout your hair, work through your locks with a wide-tooth comb after applying it.
After applying the silicone serum, you can either allow your hair to air dry or blow dry it.
 When your hair is frizzy, you often need additional styling products to get it to cooperate. Choose gel, mousse, or hairspray that’s alcohol-free, though, or you’ll wind up drying out your hair and making it more frizzy.Styling products that are formulated with natural ingredients are usually a good option for frizzy hair because they aren’t as harsh. That means they’re less likely to dry out your hair.
 If there is still some frizz or flyaways in your hair after you’ve styled it, combat them by misting your brush with a shine spray before lightly brushing your hair with it. That will help smooth the individual hairs that are acting up back into place.It’s best to use a natural bristle on frizzy hair because synthetic materials such as plastic can rough up the cuticle.

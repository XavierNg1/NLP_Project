 As the oven preheats, prepare loaf pans and gather the ingredients listed above.;
, Grate the zucchini using the side of the grater with the largest holes. Make sure both ends of the zucchini are chopped off before grating. Once all the zucchini is grated, place it in a paper towel and squeeze out any excess liquid.
 The dry ingredients here include: flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg. Use a whisk to ensure all the ingredients here are blended fully.
 A large bowl is required because in the later steps, the dry ingredients will be added to the same bowl the eggs are in along with other ingredients. If you locate eggshells in mixture, please look at the "Tips" section below on how to remove them.
 Beat together well. The sugar and oil will be added to the same bowl as the eggs in preparation for the dry ingredients.
 Vanilla and dry ingredients are now being added to the same bowl as the eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and oil. To avoid using your egg beater on the highest setting, please look at the "Tips" section below.
 Stir in the drained and grated zucchini. The zucchini must have no excess moisture. So if it isn't dry, wrap the zucchini in a paper towel again to remove any excess moisture.
 Make sure the walnuts are chopped so that they can be evenly distributed throughout each loaf.
 Spraying the pans with non-stick cooking spray will allow for easy removal of loaves after they are done baking. Common alternatives for non-stick cooking spray include butter or oil.
 Divide the batter equally between the loaf pans. Fill each pan 1/2 of the way up the pan.
 Bake for 50 minutes or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. A common tester used is a wooden toothpick or a metal fork.
 After they are done cooling, you're ready to enjoy your tasty new recipe!

 Trading is the easiest and fastest way you can learn what people want. Learn to trade fairly and get a reputation for being trustworthy. Learn your rares as well to be sure you do not over trade. If someone accepts your under trade, then you are lucky, since you get to keep some of your current rares and get more rare.
 Trade smaller items such as rare item Mondays for rare bows and arrows, worn blankets (non rare), rare fox hats, pirate swords, and much more. Place them on your trade list, go to Aldan, and say something like "I accept 1 den beta per item on my trade list!"

, Use these den betas to trade for a black short wrist or a bad long wrist. Consider trading your black short wrist for a green long wrist (if you got one). That would be a fair trade, and long wrists are more preferred than short ones.
 Two bad long spiked wristbands equals one good short collar (not black). Trade them for the short collars before carrying on. Replace the wristbands for better items if you'd like, or just trade 8 den betas for a good short collar. Trade 6 den betas for a bad short collar if you're aiming for something else, and 14 den betas for a black short collar if your going for a good rare. Note: A black short may seem rarer, but it is actually worth a green long spiked collar.
 Trade 2 bad shorts for an orange or pink long collar and add a den beta to be fair. Save up 2 good shorts (would be worth 16 den betas) and a bad long wrist, and trade them for a good long collar, such as a purple long. Trade for at least 2 bad longs and trade them for good long collars. Aim for 6 bad longs or 3 good longs if you're trying to get a black long collar quickly.
 Most people forget to do this, but buying items that are going out of stores can be a great way to obtain rares. Check everyday each store, and see if items are going on clearance. You may think that they're worthless, but one day, they might be worth a good rare or as such.

 MAC has a distinct logo and font used for all of their packaging, which is very sleek and stylized. Counterfeit products will have the same logo but it will either be stretched or manipulated in some way, or it will be placed in a different area of the packaging or casing than it would normally be. For example, the MAC logo is usually centered on its genuine products but a counterfeit may position the logo at the top or toward the bottom. Additionally, MAC uses capital letters for all of its packaging and lettering.Compare the lettering on the package to a MAC product you already have that you know is not counterfeit. If you observe obvious differences, you may have a counterfeit.;
, MAC products come in a casing that has tiny glitter particles on the surface, giving it a subtle shimmer. Counterfeit products will usually manufacture casings that are dull or have a different sheen in comparison. They are also often a slightly different shape, usually bulkier and/or larger than its genuine counterparts., The labels on the bottom of the casing is a great indicator of whether or not the product is genuine. MAC uses all caps on their labelling and labels are either gray with black print or white with a light gray print. The font used by counterfeit manufacturers tends to be bulkier and less sleek., MAC lipsticks have a faint sweet vanilla scent. The fakes will often smell like plastic or cheap perfume. If youâ€™re unsure, take a whiff of the product; the smell should be able to give it away., Some fakes will have a name, but it may not be the name of any genuine MAC items or products. To find out, simply go to www.maccosmetics.com and click on the magnifying glass symbol in the upper right hand corner. Search for the name of the product. If it does not appear, it may either be a discontinued product or it is fake.

 You will be building this Mini Coffin.


The overall size will be as shown.;
, Repeat so you have two identical pieces. Measure and mark a vertical center line (2 ¾” from edge) on one of the pieces. Use this centerline to measure off the top and bottom cuts.
 Connect points to outline the coffin top and bottom.
 Nails can be used on the portions that you plan to remove.
 This project used a miter saw with a laser site. However, these cuts could be made with a table, circular or handsaw. At this point, unless you are an expert woodworker, you will notice that the length of the sides doesn’t match the drawing exactly. Don’t worry, this isn’t critical.
 You will need enough wood to match the perimeter of the coffin.
 Set the miter saw to an angle of 40.8 degrees (90 – 49.2). Cut one chamber. Reverse the work piece and cut the same chamfer on the other side. Cut it long and then make a few extra cuts until you match the bottom length.
 Cut the 40.8 degree angle on one side – leave the work piece long since you will be cutting a different angle on the other end. Do a fit check at this point. The bottom side and long side should mate nicely when positioned on the bottom work piece.
 Angle should be 36.8 degrees. Again, match the side length to the bottom length.
 Cut the 36.8 degree angle on one side – leave the work piece long since you will be cutting a different angle on the other end. Again, do a fit check.
 For reference, marked a number on the bottom and the matching side since each length could be slightly different.
 If not, adjust as needed. Attach the sides to the bottom and to the other sides. Use glue and clamps. Wood filler could be used at this point.

 Scotland observes GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) between the last weekend in October and the last weekend in March, and changes to British Summer Time (one hour ahead of GMT) from March to October. Look up the current time in GMT or BST.Then, compare this time to the time in your location to figure out the time difference. Do not call someone in Scotland in the middle of the night unless they have explicitly asked you to do so.


Shops in Scotland are usually open from 9am-5pm Monday through Saturday. Businesses in villages and rural areas usually keep more limited, traditional hours than businesses in major towns and cities.If the time is 8pm in Los Angeles, 11pm in New York, 5am in Paris, and noon in Shanghai: it is 4am in Scotland. Check the time difference before you call!

, Calls made to Scotland between 6pm and 8am GMT (local time) may be charged at a lower rate than calls made during peak hours.That said: let the preference of the person whom you are calling dictate the time of the call.

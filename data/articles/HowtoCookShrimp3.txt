 Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator and rinse them under cool water. Shake the excess water from the shrimp.


Peel the shrimp if you would like to cook them without the shells.
Leave the shells on if you prefer to peel them after they are cooked.
 Add a tablespoon of oil and swirl it around the pan.
 Arrange them in a single layer, making sure they don't overlap.
 The side touching the pan will begin to turn pink.
 Make sure each shrimp gets flipped. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the second side is pink. The shrimp are finished when they have turned bright pink and the flesh is opaque white, rather than translucent.
 Serve warm.

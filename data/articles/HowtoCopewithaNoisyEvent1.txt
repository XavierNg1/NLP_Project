 If you're involved with the planning or organizing of the event, choose a place that's quiet.

Go for someplace with a separate room. Some restaurants and convention centers separate rooms for private events.
Choose a place that doesn't play music or television loudly.
Ask to visit a prospective venue at the same time of day or during a similar event, and observe the noise level.
Be aware of the acoustics in the room. A room with lots of hard surfaces can get full of echos when everyone tries to talk over everyone else.;

Restaurants will usually have the fewest visitors between 3 and 5pm.
Take advantage of shoulder seasons for travel destinations. During spring (except spring break) and autumn, most schools are in session, and the cooler, wetter weather may make some destinations less attractive to the biggest crowds.
Restaurants that have big rushes on Friday or Saturday nights might not be so busy on Tuesdays. Most will know when they're busiest, and many will be glad of the business at non-peak times, so ask in advance.
 Does it need to be 200 people, or would 40 suffice? Or, could the event be broken into two or three smaller sections, perhaps by room, by activity, or by date?

A smaller group also lets you use a smaller venue, which in turn gives you more options and often reduces costs.
 Assuming the weather is pleasant, your guests can enjoy the outdoors without loudspeakers and without echos., Most will gladly back off on the sound levels if they know your preference.

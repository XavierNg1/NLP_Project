 Your potential employer will not likely have access to your previous performance reviews. You and your references may be their only source of information regarding your previous employment. In order to be accurate regarding your previous performance reviews, as well as to prepare to address your professional development, make sure you know what makes you a valuable employee.
 When you apply for a position at a new company, you have the luxury of providing to them all the information about you. You get to choose the people who attest to your diligence and qualifications.


Typically, it is corporate policy not to give any sort of negative reference.In cases of harassment, discrimination, defamation, retaliation or disparagement you may wish to pursue legal action., This is important where your organization doesn't have a formal feedback structure in place but it's important even where there is one. Give factual examples of praise done for work from your supervisor and colleagues and how it has helped the firm or your team.

 A mistake most people make is shampooing everyday. It may seem like a good idea, but it strips your scalp of the natural oils it needs to be healthy. Naturally curly hair requires all of the moisture it can get to stay healthy due to the shape/form, and excessive shampooing can leave your hair dull and dry. Remember that you can still shower without shampooing. If you like to shower everyday, you can switch off. One day you can shampoo and condition, and the other you can just condition.;
, Studies have shown that conditioner's impact your hair more than shampoos do. It's definitely recommended that you find a shampoo for your hair type, as it will help your curls turn out better.
 However, don't trim it until needed.
 As often as you want, warm up coconut or olive oil, rub it all around your hair/scalp, braid your hair, then shower the next morning.
 Brushes can be very damaging to curly hair. By replacing your brush with a comb, not only will you make untangling easier, you'll protect your hair.
 This locks in the products and keeps them in your hair.
 After getting out of the shower,use a good scrunching gel and scrunch your hair.
 Replacing your towel means reducing frizz and getting better sculpted curls.
 If you ever need to dry your hair quick, you should buy a diffuser for your blow dryer. Diffusers evenly distribute the air and heat and don't give you the frizzy look blow dryers usually give you.
 The night before, take a shower and put it in a messy bun while still wet. The next morning spray your hair with water and scrunch.

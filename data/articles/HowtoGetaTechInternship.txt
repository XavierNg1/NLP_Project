 The field of technology isn't for everyone. Before you spend your resources diving into it you should understand what it is, and what it would mean for you to enter it.;
, It is important to be educated before you apply to the internships. Unlike other industries, at a Tech Internship you'll be expected to walk as soon as your feet hit the ground.
 You'll have to work hard in order to do this, but people with higher GPAs have a better chance of getting an interview. Keep a 3.7 as best you can, that will be good enough for the majority of places.
 It is important to get on the good side of one of your instructors, so that they will feel comfortable writing an honest referral on your behalf. Companies will want to see that you can learn as efficiently as you can code.
 Many larger companies start reviewing applicants during the Winter for their Summer Internships. If you want your name to be one of the first in the pile, then it would suit you to apply during the winter.
 The interview is sure to have coding questions. Be sure you brush up on all of your development skills. Invest in books on getting past a Coding Interview. Once you're confident in coding, brush up on your interpersonal communication skills. Remember, part of what they are trying to figure out is if you are a joy to be around. Try to be charismatic, yet smart in your interview.
 If you perform better than those around you there is always a chance you could be hired after the internship. Arrive early, and leave late when it looks beneficial. Always be available, and always be ready to learn.

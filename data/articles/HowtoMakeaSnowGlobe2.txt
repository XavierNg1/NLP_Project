 There are many different kits available, some which allow you to simply slot in a photograph, some which require you to sculpt your own own clay figurines, and others which provide you with a water globe, base and other materials for making a professional-looking snow globe.
 Once you have your kit, follow the instructions on the packaging to put it together. Some will require you to paint the parts and glue the figurines to the base. Once the scene is set, you will usually need to glue the glass (or plastic) dome to the base and then fill the dome with water (and snow or glitter) from a hole in the base. You will then use the stopper provided to seal the snow globe.

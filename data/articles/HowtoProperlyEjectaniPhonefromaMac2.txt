 The iTunes app looks like a musical note icon inside a circle. You can find it on your Dock or in your Applications folder.
 This button is located below the Play button and the Volume slider in the upper-left corner of iTunes. It will open the Summary screen for your iPhone.
 You will see a navigation panel to the left of the Summary screen. Your iPhone's name will be at the top of the menu.


If there are multiple Apple devices connected to your Mac at the same time, your iPhone's name might be further down on the left-panel menu.
 The Eject button looks like an upwards-pointing arrow next to your iPhone's name on the left panel. Clicking on it will eject your iPhone.
 Pull out the USB cable to unplug your iPhone.

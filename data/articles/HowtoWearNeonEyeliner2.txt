 If you're choosing your outfit after your eyeliner, remember that neons are dramatic. You should wear neon eyeliner with a plainer outfit, such as solid colored ensembles in duller shades like browns, beiges, grays, and blacks. You should also keep your jewelry minimal. Your eyeliner is your main accessory, so you do not need too much extra.Stick to very basic items of jewelry that do not draw too much attention. Something like stud earrings and a simple gold chain could pair well with neons. Stay away from anything too bright or shiny.
 Neons work best when paired with played down eye shadow. You do not need big, bold colors of eye shadow if your eyeliner is already so bright. Stick to neutral shades of eyeliner that highlight your eyelids without adding too much color. For example, go for a light layer of beige for your eyelid over a bright color like blue., Mascara can help bring out your eyes, but you do not need a lot if you're already using neon eye shadow. Stick to a single layer of brown or black mascara if you're going for neon eyeliner.Avoid colorful mascara if you're already wearing neon eyeliner.

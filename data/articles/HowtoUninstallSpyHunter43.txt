 Spyhunter can cause serious problems when you try to uninstall it, as it has no actual uninstallation program. All uninstalling it will do is remove it from your list of installed programs, but the program will still remain on your system. Microsoft has a tool that some users have reported helping to solve the problem.
 This will download a small program to your computer made by Microsoft to help troubleshoot the issue.
 You may need to confirm that you want to run it.
 Wait while the utility is gathering required information regarding the software you installed.



If you do not see SpyHunter in the list, click on the above "Not Listed" option and click on the Next button.



You may find the product code by perusing the registry from the following location HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall in Registry Editor. Press F3 and search for SpyHunter.
If you got SpyHunter installed on a 64-bit Windows, it might be saved in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall instead.
 Select "Uninstalling" when prompted for the problem you are experiencing.
 Follow the prompts to remove it from your system. If SpyHunter is still sticking around, move on to the next section.

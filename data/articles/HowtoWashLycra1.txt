 A mesh laundry bag holds clothing so it is protected during the machine cycle. The tumbling of the machine makes it easy for a button or other object to get stuck in loose Lycra and stretch it. If you don’t have a bag, try an old pillow case., Don’t use anything harsh to clean the Lycra. Get a detergent made for delicate clothing or even athletic wear. Add the detergent after the machine fills with water, if possible.To remove bad odors, add a splash of vinegar to the wash. Place it in the fabric softener slot. Make sure your detergent doesn’t have chlorine in it when using vinegar.
Never use chlorine bleach to treat Lycra.
 Lycra needs to be washed in cold water so heat doesn’t ruin the fibers. The delicate setting, if your washer has one, uses cold water and minimal tumbling. Choose the lowest heat setting on your device. The water temperature should be no more than 86℉ (30℃).

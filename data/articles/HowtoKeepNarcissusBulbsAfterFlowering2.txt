 Daffodils that have been planted in containers need a bit more attention than ground-planted ones. After flowering ends, top dress your container with a fertilizer such as bone meal.


Bone meal can be quite stinky, so you may prefer to keep the container outside for a day or two afterwards.
 If you intend to keep your bulbs in the same container until the following year, give the flowers time to fade completely - usually about two months. At this point, the foliage should have begun to die away.


Once the flowers are gone, turn the container on its side for about 3 months and avoid watering it.
 Turn the container right-way up again in the fall and give it a good watering. This watering is necessary for the bulbs to flower again the next spring.


Daffodils prefer an acidic soil, so to counter the alkaline effects of tap water you can add a little Ironite (a mineral supplement) to the water. Alternately water them with rainwater.






If you live in an area with severe winters, bring your containers inside in the winter as the narcissus bulbs will not fare as well in pots during freezing conditions.
 Daffodils will survive for up to 3 years in a container, but the flowers will never be as good after the first year.


For best results, plant the spent bulbs outside after the foliage dies back and replant your container with fresh bulbs and fresh compost for the following flowering season.
The method for transplanting spent narcissus bulbs from a container to the ground is outlined in the section below.

Smooth clayboard allows you to create your own texture with the paint, while textured or rough surfaces gives the paint something to grab onto and results in a different look. There is no right or wrong type of clayboard surface, it is simply personal preference.
Just like using a regular stretched canvas, you need to determine the size of the clayboard before you begin. This is an important step to remember for watercolor artists who are used to cutting and cropping watercolor paper to the size of their final painting.;
, Since clayboard is manufactured to be ready to paint and you do not need to prepare the board for painting, your pencil lines will show up as a guide when you begin to paint on clayboard.
 If you choose to use acrylic paint, remember that acrylic can take on both translucent and opaque properties, so you must thin out your paint to create an underlying, translucent color.
,, When you scratch through the paint, the etched lines will show up white, which makes it easy to see the details you are creating.
 The etched lines begin to add texture and depth to the painting.
 You can finish your painting with etched lines that you want to leave white as a contrast to your painting, or let the etched lines simply be colored details in your painting.

 Think about what it is you love to do, and what you are good at! Something is guaranteed to come up. No one wants to get stuck running a business they aren't happy about. This process may take an hour up to a week, it just depends how quickly the spark comes upon you. Be patient, and don't fool yourself about what you want to do just because you can't think of something.;
, Study who your customers and competition are. Is your target your classmates, your teachers, adults, etc.? And what are other businesses competing with you or sharing the same product? The idea of this step is to see if your business can succeed and if it has a niche in the market.
 How will you advertise? Also, now that you know your competition, find out what will set you apart from them. What will make customers want to go to you rather than to go to your competition? This step will help you understand your market and will help with your business plan.
 Pricing is something you need, along with your calculation of profit and how you will get your product (buying from manufacturer, making it by hand, etc.) Also make charts for your products to calculate anything you need to. Don't forget things like shipping in your costs.
 This will be 15+ pages so be ready to write. Your business plan should include who you are, your experience, what you do/sell, what your market it, pricing, profit, gross income, goals for the future, where your business is headed, etc. Hint: When stating goals, don't say "We hope to...", say "We will...", it makes you sound confident and not hopeful. You need to believe in what you're doing.
 Get the word around. Just like gossip, your business could spread throughout the entire school. Set up fliers (but be sure to get the schools permission).
 Do things with your profit and enjoy yourself, reward yourself! Good luck!

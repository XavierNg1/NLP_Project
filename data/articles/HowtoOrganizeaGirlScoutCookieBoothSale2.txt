 Find out if there is someone centrally arranging booths before you start calling around as this can lead to double-calling of businesses which is bad etiquette.
 If they work at a store like Kmart, Walmart, a local grocery store, or another place of the like, they may be able to get your troop a spot selling by the door.
 Place phone calls to local businesses that you might be able to sell in front of them. You might ask other leaders what stores they've had luck with in the past. Another tactic would be to find a store that isn't as big or common as the ones previously mentioned, but still gets a lot of customers, because the waiting list for these stores won't be as long.
, Ask how long you can stay, if you can use furniture or tables (as opposed to bringing your own), and whatever other questions you may have.

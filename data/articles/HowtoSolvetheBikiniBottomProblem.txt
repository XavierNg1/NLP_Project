 How much of your pubic hair shows? If it's just a small amount, it can't be too hard to get rid of. But if it's a lot you might need a little extra elbow grease. If you have hair-removal supplies, get it out. Otherwise, go shopping at your local department store.;
, Instead, take a small pair of scissors and go at it with a few snips. Be careful not to cut the bathing suit! If you have more than just a little, it's time to wax. Don't worry, when done right, pain is minimal.
 Take off your bikini bottoms. Apply the warm wax to the area that the extra hair is located. Place cloth strip over the application and let cool. Once slightly cooled and hardened a little, pull off in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Apply pressure with hand as soon as possible. It's going to be a little painful. After the deed is done, ice the area you waxed.
 If so, then cover them up with water-proof foundation. Be confident and stand up straight. And most importantly, have fun.

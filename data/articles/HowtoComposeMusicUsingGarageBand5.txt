 This allows you to import songs from your iTunes library. To open the "Media Browser," click the icon of a musical note and roll of film in the bottom right corner of the GarageBand window.
 Type the name of a song or artist into the search bar near the bottom right of the GarageBand window. You can listen to a song by double-clicking its name in the list.
 Select the song you want, and drag it into the middle panel. Let go of your mouse button, and the song will be added as a new track, represented by the name of the song and an icon of a speaker.


You can now edit the track and combine it with your own tracks and loops to create remixes of your favorite songs.

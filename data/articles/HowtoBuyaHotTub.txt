 People install 90 percent of all hot tubs outside on a patio or deck. Of the 10 percent installed inside a home, most go in the master suite, an enclosed sun room or a finished basement.


Measure the hot tub area to ensure a comfortable fit. Be sure to allow enough room for getting in and out of the tub. Allow extra room if you plan to use steps.
Check the room for sufficient ventilation. Hot tubs installed inside the home create steam, which may result in mildew and other problems.
Look for an electrical outlet near the tub location. Be sure your service meets your hot tub requirement. Most hot tubs require a 220v electrical hook-up, however this varies from hot tub to hot tub.;
, There are many things to consider besides price when purchasing a hot tub. Your tub is a big investment, and it will last for many years. That's why it's important to make a good choice.
 Take into consideration the information you gathered when preparing to shop. If you plan to use the tub for entertaining, you will require something larger than a tub intended strictly for you and your partner.
 Some favorites include pillows, massage chairs, stereos, TV/DVD, fiber optic lighting and steps.
 Most dealers will allow you to test showroom tubs. Arrive prepared. Check for comfort, size, noise level from jets and ease in using tub controls.
, Most dealers do not offer direct financing. Those that do often have higher interest rates than banks. Your best bet for financing would be through your local bank. Other options include using a low-interest credit card or making payment by check or cash.

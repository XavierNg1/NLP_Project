 In this autoimmune disease, the immune system creates antibodies that cause the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone than is needed by the body. The disease is most common in women over twenty years old and may be genetic.Common symptoms include enlargement of the thyroid gland, sensitivity to heat, tremors in the hands or fingers, unexplained weight loss, erectile dysfunction, menstrual changes, reduction of libido, bulging eyes, frequent bowel movements, thickening of the skin on the tops of feet, and heart palpitations.Graves’ ophthalmopathy can include loss of vision, light sensitivity, inflammation of the eyes, double vision, pain in the eyes, puffy eyelids, and exophthalmos or bulging eyes.
Graves’ dermopathy, while uncommon, occurs when the skin on the shins and tops of feet reddens and thickens.;
, These mental symptoms can include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and sometimes cognitive dysfunction. Understand that even after medical treatment for hyperthyroidism these psychiatric manifestations may remain and the person may need psychiatric treatment, such as psychotropic drugs., People with Graves’ disease need to consult with a doctor or endocrinologist to manage their disease. Many people have success treating the disease with medications such as beta blockers and anti-thyroid medications. For others, radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery are viable treatment options. People with eye symptoms can benefit from eye drops, special lenses for glasses, and external radiation to mitigate inflammation., Try contacting the Graves' Disease & Thyroid Foundation.

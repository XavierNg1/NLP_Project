 Accessories come in a single size, and they fit you when you are pregnant too.


Dress up your attire with chic accessories such as elegant pearls, dramatic diamonds or other pieces of jewelry that can accent your neck, ears and wrists.
 Some women experience swelling in their feet and ankles during pregnancy. Comfortable flats or supportive wedge heels can be just as chic as stilettos.
 Instead of trying to fit into a coat, keep a pretty shawl or pashmina around your arms if your formal event is outdoors or in cooler weather.



Accentuate your chic style with a dramatic up do or a stylish short cut.
Have your hair, makeup and nails done in a professional salon if you can afford it. The little bit of luxury will take the pressure off you, and leave you feeling chic and fashionable.

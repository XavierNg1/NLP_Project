 Hay forms the foundation of a rabbit's diet. Not only is this important for nutrients, but fiber as well. Since rabbits clean themselves, they often swallow a lot of hair. Without adequate fiber, these hairballs can block the GI tract and can be fatal. Chewing hay also keeps the rabbit's teeth at a healthy length by wearing them down and preventing them from overgrowing.Feed your rabbit grass-based hays like timothy, oat, or wheat. Other hays like alfalfa may be too rich in calcium or protein for your rabbit to handle. To choose a good quality hay, look for a tinge of green and a sweet smell. Poor quality hay is completely yellow and may smell musty. Do not feed your rabbit a poor quality hay.If you cannot find a good hay at a local pet store, there are mail order companies that can ship you the right hay.Rabbits can be fed hay from birth.;
, Like with most animals, water is essential for health and well-being. Without adequate water, a rabbit can become dehydrated, go into organ failure, and die. Your rabbit should have fresh drinking water at all times.A water bottle or ceramic/stainless steel bowl are sufficient to give your rabbit water. Keep in mind that your rabbit my drink more from a bowl than a bottle, which is good for the rabbit's health. You can start with both to see what your rabbit prefers.
Whatever method of providing water you choose, be sure to use lead-free products.
Replace old water with clean water every day.
Also be sure to clean water bottles and bowls with hot water and soap daily to prevent bacteria growth. Rinse these thoroughly to make sure all soap residue is washed away.
 The best vegetables for your rabbit are romaine lettuce, broccoli, carrots, cilantro, spinach, and celery.Make sure any vegetables you feed to your rabbit are fresh. Vegetables even a few days old can make your rabbit sick.
Serve vegetables wet to increase your rabbit's fluid intake and help the food flow more easily through the GI tract.
Switch up the vegetables you give your rabbit every day. Some rabbits, when fed only one type of vegetable, can develop sludge in the bladder which may then form into bladder stones. A typical example is carrots which are high in oxalate. Feeding carrots every day can predispose a rabbit to bladder problems. To avoid this, never give the same food two days in a row. If your rabbit eats carrot one day, offer broccoli next so you're constantly mixing things up.
 Fruits should be considered a treat and should not form the base of your rabbit's diet. Generally you should limit fruit servings to no more than two tablespoons per day.All fruits are considered safe for feeding to rabbits, as long as they are in controlled quantities.
Mix up your rabbit's fruit intake daily, the same as you would with vegetables.
 Commercial rabbit pellets are generally not considered essential for a rabbit's diet- they don't provide the fiber or the tooth exercise that hay provides. They are also high in calories and can cause obesity if your rabbit eats too much of them. In limited quantities, however, pellets can provide vitamins and minerals that your rabbit needs.Remember that pellets should only be a supplement to other foods, and not form the foundation of your rabbit's diet.
Pick pellets that are timothy-based rather than alfalfa-based. Alfalfa pellets tend to be higher in calories and can cause obesity.
Pellets come in two forms: muesli and extruded. Muesli types have individual nutrients in each pellet, while extruded types have all nutrients mixed into each pellet. Use extruded types to give your rabbit all the essential nutrients he requires. With muesli types, your rabbit may pick out tasty pellets and neglect others, leading to deficiencies.Talk to your vet for the ideal portion size for your rabbit. Some recommended servings for adult rabbits are as low as 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) daily.If your rabbit starts neglecting his hay, cut back on pellets. A lack of fiber from hay can cause a fatal blockage in your rabbit's GI tract, so you'll want to make sure it is the primary food in the rabbit's diet.
 Rabbits have sensitive digestive systems and you shouldn't feed them anything unfamiliar. Specifically avoid nuts, seeds, corn, or any dessert foods like chocolate. Your rabbit won't be able to digest these foods and consumption of these could be fatal.Also avoid any gourmet rabbit treats. These can be harmful.
Always check with your vet before feeding something new to your rabbit.

 Will your rabbit be allowed to roam the whole house, or is there a specific room you want to keep him in?


Your rabbit will need several hours of exercise outside his cage every day. When choosing an area, remember that he needs enough room to explore and roam to make sure he gets enough exercise. At the minimum a full room should do.Keep in mind that the bigger area you allow your rabbit to roam in, the more bunny-proofing you'll have to do.
 Rabbits love to chew, which can not only damage your home and furniture, but can be fatal for your rabbit. You need to remove or protect certain items within the rabbit's area.Either remove electrical wires from the rabbit's reach or wrap them to prevent your rabbit from chewing through them. To wrap them, get plastic tubes from the hardware store. Using scissors or a utility knife, carefully cut the tube lengthwise and push the wire inside.Cover open outlets with child-proof plugs.

For a more concrete measurement, the minimum recommended size is 24" x 36" x 24".
Choose a cage without a wire floor. These can hurt the rabbit's feet. Instead look for a solid plastic bottom.
If you can only find a wire-bottom cage, lay a piece of wood or plastic on it to make sure your rabbit stays comfortable.
You can also substitute a dog or cat cage for a specialized rabbit cage, so long as it is big enough.
Include a small rug or mat and some hay for your rabbit to lay on.If your rabbit goes back into his cage, let him stay there and don't force him out. Rabbits often use their cages as a safe area where they can rest and relax.
Make sure the rabbit has a place to hide within the cage. Rabbits are burrowing animals and need the security of a small dark space. A simple shoe box will do as a hide, but be prepared to replace it regularly because he will probably chew on it.
 Like cats, rabbits can be trained to use a litter box.First see which corner of the cage your rabbit chooses as his bathroom. Then place a litter box there.
When he consistently uses the litter box in his cage, you can allow him to roam more outside his cage. Place more litter boxes around his area to encourage him to use them.

You don't need expensive rabbit toys- pieces of cardboard, paper towel rolls, and untreated, chemical-free wood will keep your bunny amused and entertained.Avoid rubber toys. If a rabbit swallows a piece of rubber it could block the GI tract., Rabbits are active creatures and love to play. There are some great games you can play with your rabbit to amuse the two of you and keep him in good shape.Set up some small toy bowling pins and let your rabbit go knock them over.

Struggling rabbits can break their own bones or pull muscles, and you can also drop him as he struggles. Leave your rabbit alone if he doesn't want to be picked up.
Introduce him to being picked up slowly. Rabbits are ground-dwelling animals and get easily spooked by going high into the air. Get him used to being stroked first. As he becomes more used to human company, try raising his front feet an inch off the ground. Then stay sitting when you pick him up for the first few times and hold him in your lap. Finally, advance to picking him up and standing.

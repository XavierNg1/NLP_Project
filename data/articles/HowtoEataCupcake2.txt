 Set the bottom of the cupcake down onto the center of a plate.


This technique works best for un-frosted cupcakes and cupcakes that have very little frosting since the jam can be used to add more flavor. You can also use it for heavily-frosted cupcakes, but be aware of the fact that it can result in an even messier—albeit, tastier—treat.
Note that this method works with standard cupcakes but not with filled cupcakes.
 Hold the cupcake steady with your non-dominant hand, grasping the cake portion with your thumb and forefinger near the top of the cupcake. Use a plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife to slice the cupcake in half, separating the top from the bottom.


Set the top half aside as you work with the bottom half. Place the top half on your plate cut-side-down.
You could tear the cupcake in half as you would do with the sandwich method, but cutting it in half is preferable for this method because it creates a smoother, more even division.
 Use a dull kitchen knife to smear a thin layer of flavored jam, honey, hazelnut spread, or other similar spread onto the cut-side of the bottom layer.


You can use a thicker layer of spread, but a thicker layer is more likely to squirt out from the sides of the cupcake as you eat it.
 Place the top half of the cupcake back onto the lower half, reconnecting the two cut sides. Press down on the top half slightly to secure it in place, relying on the jam to adhere the halves together.
 Eat the cupcake by biting into as you would bite a sandwich.

 For the bites, you’ll need 16 to 20 cherry tomatoes. Use a knife to cut a small slice in the top of each tomato, and hollow out the pulp from inside with a small melon baller. Discard the pulp.If you don’t have a melon baller, use a small spoon to hollow out the tomatoes.
 Once the tomatoes are hollowed out, set a piece of paper towel down on a flat surface. Turn the tomatoes upside down and set them on the paper towel. Allow them to sit for 5 to 10 minutes to drain the excess moisture., Add 1 pound (454 g) of cooked, crumbled bacon, ½ cup (116 g) of mayonnaise, ⅓ cup (33 g) of chopped green onions, 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated Parmesan cheese, and 2 tablespoons (1 g) of chopped fresh parsley to a small bowl. Mix the ingredients well until they’re fully blended.You can substitute shredded cheddar cheese for the Parmesan if you prefer.
 Once the filling is completely mixed, use a spoon to carefully add it to each of the tomatoes. Place a generous amount of the bacon mixture in each so it’s peeking out the top of the tomatoes.If you like, you can sprinkle some more chopped green onions over the tomatoes after you’ve filled them.
 After you’ve filled all of the tomatoes, place them in an airtight container or a plate that you can cover with plastic wrap. Put the tomatoes in refrigerator to chill for 3 to 4 hours. Once they’re fully set, place them on a platter and serve.You can make the BLT bites the day before, and allow them to chill overnight.

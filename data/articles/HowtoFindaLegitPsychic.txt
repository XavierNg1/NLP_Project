 Some are stronger than others. Giving a reading takes focus on a specific person or group to be able to conjure pictures or videos in their head. Example, when a medium/psychic is talking to the dead, they can't see them with their eyes, the ghosts gives off energy and sends pictures to the reader's head. If they have trouble with something like getting a name in their head, it's okay, don't freak out, but don't give them the answer right away, see if they can get it.. If they're close, tell them, and it will help them concentrate better. Again, medium/psychics aren't anything like the media, and they don't get answers off the spot. It takes concentration.;
, When questions are general, and can relate to most people, it's usually a scam. Demand personal questions, otherwise, don't bother coming back to them.
 Usually, people get too excited and answer for the medium/psychic for them! It helps people scam others! Let them give a few guesses, if they're VERY close, like, "Is your sister's name something like Saya?" "No. Sarah." They're on the right track if they say a very close name on the first try. If they do something like, "Is your sister's name Jennifer?" When her name is Sarah, give them a look that says, "Nope, try again." Just try not to get too excited about your reading and shout out all of the answers, that's how people give medium/psychics a bad name and get scammed.
 Usually, the company demands a screening before the medium/psychic becomes a member. Also, try to look for a website that allows complaints.

 The longer the stems are, the easier the braiding. Daisies work wonderfully, but you can use any flower with a long, flexible stem and no thorns.
 Pinch the stem under the flower and moving your fingers rapidly downward. Repeat until the leaves are torn off. This will make it easier to see what you're doing.


After you've made a couple chains, you can try keeping the leaves.
 Place three flowers in a row on a flat surface. Pinch the stems together, just below the blossoms.


If any of these three stems break, you'll need to start over. If later stems break, you're probably okay., Press your thumb down over the point where the stems cross. Pick up the stem on the right and bend it in between the other two., Move the left stem over the new middle stem, and under the stem on the right. Pull the stems gently to make the braid tight. Don't pull too hard or it might break.
 Move the right stem into the middle. Bring the left stem over the middle and under the new right stem. Repeat this braiding pattern three or four times.
 After a few braids, pick up another flower. Lay it down next to another stem. From now on, braid as though those two stems were one thick stem. Add another flower every 2â€“5 crosses, depending on how clustered you like them.
 When you come to the end of a stem, tuck it into a gap between the others. Keeping them all well-tucked makes the chain less likely to unravel.
 Once you're reaching the length you want, stop adding new flowers. Keep braiding until you've got about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of bare stem. Bring this back to the beginning of the braid. Gently pull apart a couple flowers near the beginning, and wrap the two ends together several times.

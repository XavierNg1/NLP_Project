 You're going to need a blender to puree some of your ingredients for your skin lightening treatment. Its recipe is based around licorice root extract, which has long been used in traditional treatments for medical skin conditions and can be found at health food stores.Including that, you'll also need:


Cucumber (unpeeled)
Fresh lemon juice (1 tbsp)
Licorice extract (several drops)
Sandalwood paste (1 tbsp)
Tomato juice (1 tbsp), But first, rinse off your cucumber to clean off any remaining dirt or bacteria on it. Once you've finished, put your cucumber in your blender. If your cucumber is small, you can puree the entire thing, but if it is a larger cucumber, you'll only need about half.
 Before anything else, drizzle a few drops of licorice root extract onto the cucumber paste. Then add to the blender one tablespoon of lemon juice, one tablespoon of sandalwood paste, and one tablespoon of tomato juice. Blend all of your ingredients until it forms a paste that is of uniform consistency., Now that your mixture is well blended, you can gently massage a layer of it onto your skin. To get the full effect and receive the full health benefits of this skin preparation, you'll need to let the mixture remain on your face for about 30 minutes, or until the mixture dries completely., The rinse should be done in two stages: the first with warm water and the second with cool. Rinsing with warm water opens and flushes out pores while washing away the mixture. The second rinse with cool water closes pores once you're done and removes any straggling bits of the mixture.To see the full effects of this skin treatment, you might want to consider applying it two to three times weekly.

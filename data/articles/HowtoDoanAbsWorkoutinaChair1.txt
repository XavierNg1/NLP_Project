 Wear flexible clothing, to get the most out of your exercises. Take deep breaths for 2 minutes before starting your routine.;
, Ensure you have proper posture, with a proper "S" curve in your spine. Your shoulders should be back, as if your shoulder blades are being pushed slightly together, and your chin should be pointed slightly upward.
 Tuck your pelvis in so your abs tightens and your hips move away from your thighs. Lean back with a slightly inwardly curved spine, until you brush the back of the chair and rise slowly, until you are sitting up in the original posture.









Do this motion in a slow, steady movement, taking approximately 5 seconds. Rest for a second when you brush the chair and come slowly up. Breathe in as you lean back and out as you sit up. Repeat this motion 10 times.

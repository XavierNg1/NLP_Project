 See the "Things You'll Need" list below for specific details. The goal is to build a frame that will fit a queen-size mattress (60" wide x 80" long). Beyond that, you'll need to visit your local home improvement warehouse to acquire three basic things:


Bed rail hangers
Wood
Wood screws;
, This hardware is essential in forming a rigid connection between all the bed rails in the frame. Secure the bed rail hangers to the end of the side-rail and head post. Double check that each placement is consistent. Repeat the process for all corners.


These hangers can sometimes be hard to find in hardware stores. If so, check online retailers.
Bed rail hangers are usually sold 4 sets to a package.
In the place of bed rail hangers, you can use 8 long lag bolts. When tightened, the lag bolts make the bed very solid. Lag bolts are also much easier to find than bed rail hangers.
 Screw the support rail to each side rail. Make sure to space the screws about 12" (30.5 cm) apart. This provides maximum weight support.
 Cut a groove into the support block and support beam, as shown. This groove should be a centered 1.5"x 3.5" slot, with the wider measurement following the wider part of the block.
 Attach each support block to the center of the head rail and foot rail with screws as shown in the image.
 Connect each rail to the post using the bedrail hangers.
 Insert the support beam between the two support blocks.
 Rest the plywood on the support rails and support beam. It should fit into the inner part of the bed frame. Once this is done, the mattress can be placed in the frame.
 Enjoy your new bed!

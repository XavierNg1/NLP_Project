, Although it really doesn't matter in what orientation your monitor is or whether or not the screen is touchscreen or not, you can get good precise measurements with this method which most computer nerds and electricians seem to know.
 If you started at the top left corner, measure it to the bottom right corner of the device. If you started from the top right corner, measure to the bottom left corner.
 Do not let any extra minute snip of a measurement get added to the reading, by allowing it to drag at the edge of the screen and measured from the border of the screen on top of the display screen itself.


Don't ever allow your measuring device to cross over and measure into the screen's border area around the screen itself. Come as close to the edge of the screen panel as possible.

 Go to the Direct Marketing Association website (i.e. DMAchoice) and go to the "Deceased Do Not Contact Registration" page.Enter the deceased person's information to stop receiving junk mail addressed to them. It should take about 3 months for the changes to take place.This may not stop you from receiving junk mail addressed to them completely, but it should cut down on the amount.
You will need to enter the deceased person's name, their address, your name, email address, and relationship to the deceased person., Then place the mail back in your mailbox. This will notify the post office and the original sender that the person is deceased. Also, notify the mail carrier that this previous resident is deceased.


If this does not work, make a visit to the post office to speak with the station manager.
Take the deceased person's mail to the post office with you. The post office may be able to forward the mail to a new address or to the deceased person's estate.
 If the mail you are receiving is not quite junk mail such as magazines, charities, or subscription services, contact the company directly and let them know the person is deceased.This is more time consuming but will get the job done. You can still write "deceased, return to sender" on these items as well if you do not want to contact the company directly.


Registering the person through the Direct Marketing Association will not stop magazine and subscription services from sending mail. Only companies that use marketing and mailing lists will receive the notification.Opening and reading a deceased person's mail is still a crime.

 On your mobile device, look for the Facebook app. It’s the one with the app icon of the Facebook logo.
 If you aren’t logged in yet, input your Facebook account username and password, and then tap the “Log in” button to proceed.
 On the upper-right corner of the News Feed screen is an icon with three horizontal bars. Tap on this. A left panel would come out.


At the top of this panel is a Search field. This field can be used to search for anything on Facebook, including groups.
Key in the group name or at least a partial keyword from the group name in the Search field.
 The list of possible matches will be displayed on the left panel. The result types can be identified by the subheading under each title.


A group can be identified by the word “Group” underneath the name. Focus on the results for groups.
 From the list of results, tap on a group you’d like to view. You will be brought to the group’s Facebook page.
 The group’s wall posts will be displayed, with the most recent one on the top. You can only see the wall if the group is public or if you’re part of it.
 Tap on the group’s cover photo. You will be brought to another screen with the group name on top. Underneath it is a description of the group.


The total number of group members will also be listed here.
 If you’d like to be part of the group, tap the “Join Group” button found towards the bottom of the screen.


If this is a closed group, group membership is subject to the group owner or admin’s discretion.

 The seed head should be completely ripe before you collect any seeds – it should look brown and possibly cracked.Cut daisy stems at the base of each plant. Place them in a paper bag tied closed with string.
 Hang the bag(s) upside-down in a dark, dry area. The seed heads should be pointing downwards.Choose a spot that isn’t cold and has decent air circulation (but no strong drafts)., Check the bag to make sure the seed heads are brittle. Squeeze flower heads so that the seeds fall into the bottom of the bag.Dump the bag’s contents onto a plate. Separate the golden-brown seeds from any debris. Pour the seeds into a paper envelope and store them in a cool, dry place away from strong light.

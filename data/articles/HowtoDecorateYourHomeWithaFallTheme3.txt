 Purchase a wreath with wheat, squash, nuts in shells, apples, etc. – any fruit or vegetable harvested in your area at this time. Weave in fall-colored ribbons, braid, lace, etc. to spice up the wreath.
 Purchase fall mums at a local grocer or garden center already potted or plant them in your own pot. Colors of burnt orange, deep red and warm yellow are ideal.If you live in a hotter climate, look for mums with a higher heat tolerance.
Mums can also be planted in the ground.
These flowers bloom for weeks and add eye-catching pops of color.
Mums can be planted as annuals and live for more than one season. Consider planting them in the spring or summer.
 Few things scream fall more than hay bales and corn stalks. Adore your home’s front door or front porch with these items. Put an equal amount on each side of the door.Consider adding fall ribbon or using these piece together with other decorative items, like flowers, rustic wood or an outdoor rug.
Corn stalks are narrow making them ideal for small front porches.
 Reclaimed wood screams fall, so think old ladders, rocking chairs, pallets and more to your porch, front yard or backyard. Old pallets can be used as planters for herbs or flowers.

 Every day, you should compliment your girlfriend. This is a simple way to keep romance in a relationship without taking a lot of time. Make her feel like a princess by giving specific compliments that show you’ve been paying attention to her.Emphasize her personality qualities—mention how creative or spontaneous she is and how much you admire it.
Express appreciation for her day to day actions. Show her that you notice she took time to do her hair in a new way or tried to put a new look together with her clothes.
Tell her how she makes you feel. For instance, if she has a certain look that she gives you that makes you melt, tell her. Even if you can’t explain it exactly, express this to her.;
, A romantic walk is free and easy to do every day. Even if you only have time to walk a mile, do so together. While on your walk, be sure to hold her hand or put your arm around her shoulder.
 A text or email each day is another free way to be romantic with your girlfriend. Pick a different time each day to send her this message to keep her on her toes. It can be anything as simple as “I love you” or you can make it specific. Try to do it at a time that she is very busy.Try putting a new twist on your daily messages by writing it on her mirror before she wakes up or by placing it on a note and putting it in her jacket pocket.
 Ask her about work or her family and listen when she’s answering you. Pick a part of her life that you’re not directly related to and let her tell you all about it. She’ll be comfortable venting in the future which can prevent fights. This romantic gesture needs to be done with genuine curiosity and concern.

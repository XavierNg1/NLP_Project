 A simple text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit will work perfectly. Enter the following code into the editor:;
, If you want to offer a file to download, you will either need to host it on your own server or point the button to the file somewhere else on the web. Use an FTP client to upload the file that you want to make available to your website’s server.
, Make sure to include the single quotes around the address, as well as the double quotes around “window.location='Download Location'". Include any prefixes such as HTTP:// or FTP:// and also include the file extension such as .JPG or .EXE.
 Replace “Button Text” with the words that you want to appear on the button. Make sure to keep the double quotes around the text. Keep the button text small so that the button doesn’t appear large and unwieldy on the page.
 You can insert the button code anywhere into the body of your webpage, and the button will appear at that location. Upload your changed webpage code, and test your new button.

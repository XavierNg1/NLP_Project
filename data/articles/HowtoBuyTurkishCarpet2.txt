 Workers at Turkish carpet cooperatives will take you on a tour of the work areas, share a cup of tea with you, and then present various carpets according to your preferences. Carpet cooperatives, which typically represent the work of hundreds of artisans from dozens of villages, do not necessarily have the cheapest prices, but they offer high quality, authentic Turkish rugs.
 If you aren't planning a trip to Central Asia or Turkey any time soon, seek out an expert dealer locally. A Turkish carpet expert can provide information about the fiber content and quality. Reputable dealers will provide comparisons between different carpets and won't try to pressure you to purchase a specific rug. Some dealers may allow you to take Turkish carpets home so you can evaluate how they look in your home before purchasing them.


Inquire about where each Turkish carpet was made. Although rugs are made in more than 750 villages and tribal areas, each area is known by its own designs, symbols and styles. An educated carpet dealer can provide insight into the origin of the rug by evaluating its design.

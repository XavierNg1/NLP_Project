 Take care not to splash or spill. Set the blender or mixer to "low."

, Try to weigh the lye quickly, as it absorbs moisture from the air. For this reason, be sure tightly seal the container you got the lye from.


The ensuing reaction between the methanol and lye produces sodium methoxide. Sodium methoxide cannot be allowed to sit for long, as it degrades in the presence of moisture.
 The process should take about two minutes. Proceed when mixture is clear, with no undissolved particles.


Again, be attentive - the sodium methoxide will degrade rapidly, so proceed to the next step as soon as the lye is completely dissolved.
 Allow the new mixture to blend for about 20-30 minutes.


As the reaction proceeds, two products are formed - biodiesel and glycerin.
 Allow the mixture to sit.


The mixture should separate into two layers - biodiesel and glycerin. Because biodiesel is less dense than glycerin, it should float, forming the top layer.
 When it has separated completely, carefully keep the top layer to use as your biodiesel fuel.


Separate the top layer from the bottom by pouring it off very carefully or using a baster or pump.
 Check with local waste disposal authorities to see whether glycerin can be thrown out with your normal garbage - it usually can.


If you don't want to waste your glycerin, consider pouring it on a compost heap to increase the rate of decomposition or using it to make soap. Consult our wikiHow on Making Glycerin Soap for more information.

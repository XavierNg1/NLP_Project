 In this method, you only need to make basic shapes, then you can draw any designs for the people as you like, onto the shapes.
 Vary the sizes according to the ages and shapes of the persons you'll be drawing (shorter for babies and kids, taller for adults). The base of the archway should be slightly wider than the paper roll you're using for the bases.


Draw as many of these archway shapes as you want to make paper persons.
 Put to one side for now.
 Cut a small round from the paper roll. Cut two slits on opposite sides of the base. These slits will hold the paper person in place for play.


Make as many of these as you've made archway shapes.
 Draw one person per archway shape, with the flat end being the base (where their feet should end) and the rounded end the top (where their head goes to). Be creative with the styles, looks, etc.


You can make use of as much or as little of the space on the archway shape.
If you like, cut out scrap fabric and glue pieces on for the person's clothing. You could add beads for buttons and jewelry, bows as hair accessories, etc.
Have kids color in the people if they like.
 Simply slide the archway shapes into the roll bases.
 The paper people are now ready for playing with.

 Try a shorter distance at first, then longer as your rat starts understanding the concept.
 As it comes to get the treat, say the rat's name (if your rat's name is more than two syllables long, try using a nickname or shortened version instead).
 When the rat knows to respond, drop the treats and use affection instead.

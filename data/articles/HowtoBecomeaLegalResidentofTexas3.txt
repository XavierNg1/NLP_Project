 If you are an adult, you must live in Texas for a full year, 12 months consecutively, to be counted as a Texas resident in the eyes of universities. In order to establish the start of this year, get utility bills in your name, just as you would to get your driver's license or ID from the state of Texas. This will prove that you have established a domicile in Texas on that date.If you have lived in Texas for longer than a year then you are already a resident in the eyes of the university system of Texas.
 Dependents, meaning someone who is still financially supported by their parents or guardians, can prove residency in ways other than a year of living and working in Texas. The ways to prove the residency of a dependent include:Graduate from a Texas high school in the year before you intend to attend a Texas university. You need to have been enrolled in that school for the three years prior to graduation for your graduation to establish residency.
Be claimed on your parent's income tax as a dependent, if they themselves are residents of Texas. This means that they need to have been working in Texas for the year before you intend to begin college. Conversely, be sure you are not claimed as a dependent if they live outside the state of Texas and you reside within.
 Follow that institutions instructions for proving your residency in a timely manner, in other words before your school year begins. Your residency status has a huge impact on the amount of tuition that you are required to pay to go to college, so you don't want any unforeseen problems arising at the last moment.

 Put on an orange jacket and matching orange pants, ideally with accents of blue or black and a white collar.


Check out secondhand stores or online stores like Ebay to look for an orange jumpsuit, or a close approximation.
Add color accents with fabric if you have some basic sewing skill. Naruto has blue and white at the top of his jacket and a white and blue band around the right leg of his pants in many illustrations and animations.You may also be able to find a premade Naruto costume at a costume shop or party store.
 Buy or make your own headband to look like the one Naruto wears, which features a spiral design on a piece of metal.Uzumaki, Naruto’s last name, translates to “spiral.” The symbol that appears on headbands and to represent the Konoha village uses this spiral shape as part of the design., Then draw on his “whisker” marks on your cheeks.


Draw the whisker marks by making three downward diagonal or slightly curved lines on each cheek.
Style hair to stick straight up using gel or mousse. The majority of your hair or wig should stick out of the top of where your headband wraps around your forehead.

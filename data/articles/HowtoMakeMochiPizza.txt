 Be sure to use Kirimochi or Kakumochi, which are hard and square, and not Marumochi (丸餅), which are round and fluffier.
 Use a neutral oil like vegetable or canola oil, although you can also use olive oil., As they cook, the mochi will melt slightly, forming the "dough" of your pizza. Arrange them into the shape you ultimately want the dough to be before they start melting. Try forming a square, a circle, a rectangle, or even a triangle with your mochi., When the bottom of mochi begins to get sticky, proceed to the next step., This will begin to steam-cook the mochi and cause it to coalesce even move. Cook, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes.,, With a ladle or spoon, coat the top of the mochi dough with sauce. The sauce can be actual pizza sauce or something like ketchup., The sky is the limit when thinking about toppings. Try the followings for ideas:

Green peas, thin pork belly, or bean sprouts for a Japanese twist
Scallions, shrimp, and corn for another okonomiyaki-style treat
Green peppers, fennel, and sausage
Salami, pepperoni, and sausage for a meat-lover's delight

, Choose your cheese wisely. With stronger-tasting toppings, you'll want a bland cheese. With subtler-tasting toppings, you may want a strong cheese., If you like your cheese extra gooey and slightly browned on top, stick the mochi pizza in a toaster oven or under the broiler for a minute., You've probably made the most interesting "pizza" in town — maybe even in your country!

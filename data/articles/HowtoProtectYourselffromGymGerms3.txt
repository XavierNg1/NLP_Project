 Before becoming a member, be sure that a gym adheres to high standards of cleanliness and is managed properly.


Ask for a tour of the gym to inspect its cleanliness.
Look for a proactive housekeeping staff.
Fitness areas need to be well ventilated to prevent the buildup of air-borne bacteria.
Check to see if disinfectant spray and paper towels are readily available.Consult the pool’s pH and chlorine log. Well managed pools check chemicals throughout the day. Look for frequent testing and stable chemical levels.
 You go to the gym to get healthy, but you may do more harm than good if you catch norovirus, fungi, or bacterial infection, all of which thrive on dirty gym equipment. These can lead to illnesses like flu, foot and skin infections, and even staph infection.


Free weights, weight machines, and exercise balls are rife with bugs from being handled constantly.Cardio machines are more likely than free weights to get wiped down but can still harbor bacteria.
Exercise mats pick up fungus that causes athlete’s foot, and even organisms that cause hepatitis., Places where people congregate, and commonly touched surfaces tend to have the most germs. Hopefully, these places are regularly cleaned by gym staff, but play it safe by taking all necessary precautions to avoid picking up airborne or surface bacteria.


Locker rooms and showers are damp environments that cause germs to multiply rapidly.
Improperly managed pools can become contaminated by pathogens spread through fecal matter which can cause diarrhea, and eye and ear infections.

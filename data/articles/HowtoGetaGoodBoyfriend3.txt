 Show that you feel this relationship is important to you by taking care of your appearance and dressing up for a date. You don’t have to wear something that makes you uncomfortable, but show that you have put in some effort for a first date. If you project confidence in your appearance, your date will likely view you this way too.
 Nonverbal communication can convey just as much as verbal communication. When you’re on a first date, positive body language will signal your interest to your date. Try these steps for conveying positive body language:


For example, maintain eye contact with your date. This demonstrates your interest in his company, and his interest in yours.
Smiling will convey that you feel easygoing, open and relaxed.
Don’t stand too far away. If you’re attracted to the other person, move a little closer in physical proximity., A cornerstone of a long-lasting relationship is friendship. When you get to know each other as friends, you will form a good foundation for a solid relationship. Even when you are first meeting, such as on your first date, talk with each other as friends, sharing interesting stories about yourselves.If your potential boyfriend shows interest in you by asking you questions and giving you time to share, this is a good sign.
 Your date is probably just as nervous as you and may make a few mistakes. Unless they’re deal-breakers, like he made really racist comments all through dinner, think about giving him a second chance.


If you aren’t sure if there is physical chemistry immediately, you might find that it will develop. Consider meeting again to see how things go.

 If you use a cell phone, it usually takes about 5 seconds or so for the call to start. Keep this information in mind and call ahead.
 Some radio programs are extremely popular, like morning shows. Research to see if there are any call-in contests on the weekdays or after the morning traffic.
 Purchase a pay as you go phone and only use it to call DJs. Program your phone to have the radio station on speed dial. As you dial the initial call on your phone, make another call on your spare phone.
 Lots of radio station prizes are for two tickets. If you have a friend or partner that you were planning to take to an event, then ask if they'd be interested in helping you. Two people have an increased chance of winning.
 Check the station's website and register to be a VIP, registered user, etc. Don't forget to opt in. You aren't restricted to winning on the air. More radio stations are also doing web based giveaways of the same prizes given away on the air.

 Create the authentic "treasure map" by aging the paper.

Make a cup of black tea.













After steeping the tea for two-three minutes, take the teabag out and squeeze out the excess water.













Using the teabag, swipe over the piece of paper.













Repeat until the paper is completely covered. Flip over the paper. Repeat again.













Set the paper out in the sun to dry.













When the paper is completely dried, begin to crumble up the paper.













Un-crumble it so that it lays out flat.













Repeat until the paper has softened and has a light texture to it.













Taking a lighter, burn the edges of the paper gently. Never create a flame on the paper, just hold the lighter until there is a light glow and then blow it out, if needed.
 Space them out so that you can easily understand the layout of the park. Try to be consistent with spacing so that your kids know roughly how far they should have to go to find the landmark.
 Using the landmarks for reference, mark a large red X where the treasure will be hidden. Connect this X to the land marks using a dashed line to indicate the path your kids should follow. Add helpful hints by determining how many "paces" they will need to travel to hit the next landmark.
 Create a border around the page and include a "compass" on the edge of the paper. Draw sea monsters, ships or a skull and crossbones. The more "detailed" the map, the more authentic it will look.
 Roll the map up and tie a ribbon around it.

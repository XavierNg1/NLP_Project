 Make sure you go to the card issuer’s website. For example, go to Walmart for a debit card you got from there. Log in to check your balance. You will need to register your card by inputting your card number and security code.Typically, the security code is three to six digits on the back of the card under a security strip you’ll have to scratch or peel off. The card number is a string of 16 numbers on the front or back of the card.
 A quick way to check your card when away from home is to use it where you know it will be accepted. For example, if you have a VISA prepaid debit card, a cashier at a place that accepts VISA may be able to show your balance when they scan your card.
 Some card issuers, mostly large store chains and credit companies, have come out with applications. Walmart has Walmart Moneycard and Bluebird by American Express has the Bluebird mobile application. Use the application to register your card and log in with the User ID and password you choose., Some card issuers allow you to send a text after you’ve registered your phone to your cardholder account. For example, text BAL followed by the last four numbers of your card to 96411 to check the balance of a Walmart card. Look on your card issuer’s website for texting options.Remember, message and data rates through your phone carrier apply.

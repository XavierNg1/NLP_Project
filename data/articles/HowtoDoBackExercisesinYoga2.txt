 The cat pose increases flexibility in your spine and can be done almost anywhere. Focus on elongating and rounding your back to its fullest by pushing the top of your spine outwards to the ceiling. Imagine an invisible thread attached to your spine is pulling you upwards, while the rest of your body is limp.
 This is another simple but effective pose, even if you only bend forward a couple of times. Remember to think about your breathing as you extend forward, keeping the pose in line with your body's natural rhythm. Challenge yourself by travelling as far towards your toes as possible.
 Like the tree pose you just did, it originates from a mountain pose, but this exercise requires more concentration to stay balanced. This pose requires a flat, straightened back as you push yourself farther down towards your mat. Find your center of balance by pushing down into the mat with your fingertips.
 If performing the complete stretch is not in your practice, try just lifting your hips and keeping your legs slightly parallel in the air. This pose will be less difficult if you build up strength in your arms, which you can do using push-ups, pull-ups, and other arm exercises.

 A road that is unusually porous with poor drainage can become a mess really fast. Be especially careful if the area has experienced heavy rains or snow recently. Before you head out on a drive, especially in an unfamiliar location, it might be helpful to take a quick look at a weather app on your phone to see if the driving conditions might include rain or snow.
 If you know that you will be driving a route with bad road conditions, try switching from all-terrain tires to a snow or mud tire. A mud tire has deeper grooves and grips, which can minimize sinking and improve traction. These tires will be louder on standard highways, as opposed to standard all-terrain tires, but the annoyance may be worth it during muddy seasons.As you are shopping for a mud tire, make sure to get one that does well on wet road conditions. Due to the deep treads, some mud tires have a tendency to lose grip on smooth, wet surfaces.
 Look in your owner’s manual or on the interior panel of your driver’s door for information regarding the proper tire pressure for your vehicle. Keeping your tires at this pressure, or just slightly under, will greatly improve the tire grip. It is a good idea to make pressure check on all of your tires part of your monthly care maintenance routine., At the start of each muddy or rainy season, look of the contents of your car emergency kit. Make sure that you have flashlights, flares, and a warm blanket. To cope with muddy conditions, you’ll also want a tow strap and a jack. The jack may come as part of a tire changing kit., Some driving schools offer classes that focus on navigating a vehicle over rough terrain and during poor weather conditions. Find a school near you by entering “off-road driving school” or “safety driving school” and your location into a search engine.For example, some schools will show drivers how to correctly attach tow straps and how to safely use other recovery strategies.

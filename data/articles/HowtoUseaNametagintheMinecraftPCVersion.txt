 When your world generates, there will always be chests in dungeons and abandoned mineshafts There is a 54.0% chance of find one in a dungeon chest (pre 1.9, in 1.9+ there is a 29.0% chance of one spawning in a dungeon chest. There is a 42.3% chance of there being a name tag in a chest minecart within a mineshaft;
, Nametags can be caught when fishing as part of the treasure category

, Librarian villagers trade nametags for 20-22 emeralds a piece as part of their tier 6 trade.
 Once you have obtained a nametag you need to get an anvil as well as several experience levels to rename it. If you do not rename the nametag it will be useless until you name it in an anvil.
 Go to the top bar and delete the text saying "Name Tag" then write whatever you would like to name the mob. After you have written what name you want go to the topmost right slot and grab the nametag. You can now rename the animal.
 This mob will now have that name whenever you scroll over it. It will never despawn (the only exceptions are, if you rename a silver fish and it goes into a block, when you mine it a unnamed silverfish will come out).
 The developers have added three Easter eggs in. This means that when you name a particular mob a particular name, something cool will happen. These are:


If you name a rabbit "Toast", it will cause it to have a memorial skin in tribute of one of the developer's rabbit's Toast.
If you name any mob "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm", that mob will be rendered upside down.
If you name any sheep "jeb_", this will make it randomly change the colour of its wool, giving a rainbow effect. This will not affect the wool dropped on death or when sheared.

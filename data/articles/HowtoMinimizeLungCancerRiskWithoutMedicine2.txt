 Taking a hot shower can help to clear out your lungs and sinus cavities, especially when you have cold symptoms. You can also sit in a hot bath or a sauna with the same effects.
 Exercising can help to improve your lung strength, and, therefore, could potentially help reduce your lung cancer risk. While this has not be scientifically proven, it's good practice to keep your cardiovascular system healthy for a number of other reasons. If you have not exercised recently, start with light exercise like walking or jogging and gradually work your way up to work intense workouts.


Cardio can help to get your lungs pumping. Cardio exercises include running, swimming, biking, and aerobics classes like Zumba or kickboxing.
 Breathing exercises can help to increase the blood flow to your lungs, which can increase the amount of oxygen your lungs receive and help your lung tissue stay healthy. Breathing deeply also increases the amount of oxygen in your blood, which can boost your energy. To practice deep breathing:


Sit in a place where you can breathe fresh air. Sit with your back straight and your eyes closed. Slowly inhale and expand your abdomen. Inhale to the count of six.
Hold your breath for six counts. Slowly exhale and as you do so, let your abdomen flatten. Exhale for 12 counts. Do not inhale for another six counts. Repeat this process.
 Being hydrated is a key element of staying healthy. The amount of water you drink each day will depend on how active you are during the day.If you are a relatively active man, you should try to drink three liters (or 13 cups) of water a day.
If you are a relatively active woman, you should try to drink 2.2 liters (or nine cups) of water a day.

 The hard boiled yolk can be frozen with the appropriate preparation.The boiled egg white, however, will turn rubbery, tough, and damp when frozen, making it unpleasant to eat. Pull apart the egg whites and eat or discard them, leaving only unbroken hard boiled egg yolks.
 Carefully place the egg yolks at the bottom of the pan in a single layer. Cover with enough water to fill the pan at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the top of the eggs.
 Bring the water to a boil quickly. Cover the pan to speed up this process.
 Remove the pan from the heat and let stand 10â€“15 minutes.
 Remove the yolks with a slotted spoon if you have one, or use a ladle to carefully place them on a colander or sieve for draining. Package in freezer-safe containers and seal tightly.

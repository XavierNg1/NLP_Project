 The floral industry is always evolving, like the fashion and art world. You should constantly be looking for inspiration in books, magazines, and everyday life. Use the inspiration to inform the designs that you create. Keep a notebook of inspirations for your designs to help you keep track of new ideas.


Inspiration can come from anywhere. A walk in the park, the architecture of a building, or a painting could inspire your next arrangement.
 Spend your free time designing and creating new arrangements. Keep a sketchbook of designs that you plan to create. Include the materials and techniques that you would like to use to create the design as well.This will help build your confidence and help you learn new techniques.
 Floral design is a creative field. Customers rely on florists to recommend different designs, arrange displays, and execute their vision. Having your own point of view will set you a part.What colors are you drawn to? Do you prefer paring unexpected flowers together? Do you like delicate arrangements? Monochromatic arrangements?

, As you study floral design (on your own or through formal training), you will find that there are foundational techniques that all florists learn. However, by combining and merging different styles, you can come up with something that is all your own. Look at designs created by other florists and identify the elements that you like. Think of ways that you can combine those different elements into something that reflects your personality. Do not be afraid to try something unusual or out of the box.


Play with different textures, shapes, and materials.

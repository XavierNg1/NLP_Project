 If it seems to break too quickly, stop, because there is a silverfish in the block. If this doesn't happen, you are safe.
 This guarantees that the silverfish will not come out.
 Of course, you can try taking them with your iron/diamond sword, but as they are small and fast, this is not recommended to inexperienced players.


Turn and run. Do not stop until you are a reasonable distance. Block up the way you came with dirt. Return later.
Or, you could pillar stack 2 dirt blocks up, camp there, and fight them off with a bow or sword.
Get on high ground (at least 2 blocks high) and place lava below you. This should take care of the silverfish that are chasing you.
Get on one of the many stairs in the stronghold and pour a water bucket to wash them away. They'll be kept away by the current.
Do not use splash potions. This will cause you to be swarmed.
 Collect the experience, if there is any.

 You want a bit of an edge to give the fake nails more to hold onto. If your nails are still longer than the fake ones, trim them, but wash them as soon as you are done.
 This will create a slightly rough surface, making it easier for the fake nails to adhere. Wipe off the dust, and remember that a thorough hand care routine can remove the roughness later on.
 Then, carefully place the press-on nail on top of your real nail. You can file them to whatever length you desire!

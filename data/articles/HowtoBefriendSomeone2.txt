 Don't be afraid to say hello to a kid you don't already know. They may not end up being your friend but it doesn't hurt to try.


Ask them about themselves, for instance what kind of games they like to play or what their favorite subject is at school.
 Ask to join a game already in progress or organize a game yourself with a variety of kids.


If you meet someone new that likes to play games or do activities that are different from what you usually do, don't be afraid to try something new and play with them anyway. You may discover a new friend at the same time as you find some new activity that you like.
 There are usually a variety of activities to choose from, so pick an activity you think you might enjoy.


Your school it not the only place to find fun after school activities where you can make friends. Search for a local community center or a boys and girls center for a variety of programs they might run.
Remember that you don't have to be an expert at the sport or activity that you choose. Part of joining a team or a class is that you will improve your skills, wherever they are to start is just fine.

 Poker is based on assigning ranked value to different combinations of cards. The hand with the rarest combination wins. Below are the different standard poker hands from lowest to highest.
 Not a made hand, so its value is based on the highest card, then the next highest, on down, comparing to other hands, and so it can tie/win when no one has a better hand. Two is the lowest and Ace is the highest.
 Two of the same value card. Example: 3(♠) - J(♣) - J(♥) - 2(♥) - 5(♦) is a pair of Jacks.
 Two groups of two of the same value card. Example: 4(♥) - 4(♦) - 9(♠) - 9(♣) - A(♠) is "two pairs, 9's and 4's", "nines and fours up".
 Three of the same value cards (a set). Example: 6(♣) - 6(♦) - 6(♠) - 3(♠) - J(♣) is three 6's, "trip sixes", "a set of sixes".
 Five cards running in order "off suit". Example: 5(♣) - 6(♠) - 7(♣) - 8(♦) - 9(♥) is the "9-high-straight".
 Five cards "suited" (all the same suit). Example: 5(♥) - 7(♥) - 9(♥) - J(♥) - Q(♥) is a "queen-high-flush".
 Three of a kind and a pair. Example: 7(♥) - 7(♣) - 7(♠) - Q(♥) - Q(♦) is "full house 7's and queens".
 4 cards all with the same value. Example: J(♥) - J(♠) - J(♣) - J(♦) - 5(♣) is "four jacks."

, The highest possible hand in poker. All cards are suited (of the same suit). Example: 3(♥) - 4(♥) - 5(♥) - 6(♥) - 7(♥) is the "7-high-straight-flush".
 Example: 10(♣) - J(♣) - Q(♣) - K(♣) - A(♣) is the "ace-high-straight-flush."

, If you have two players at the showdown each with the same type of hand, the winner is determined by whose version is higher in number. Here's how this rule plays out:


A pair of 9's beats a pair of 4's.
Two pair, Jack's and 2's, beats two pair, 7's and 5's.
A straight that runs as high as Queen beats a straight that only runs up to 10.
An Ace-high-flush beats a King-high-flush.
If hands have combinations of the same value, the hand with the highest extra card wins. For example a pair of 8's with an Ace-high remainder ("kicker") beats a pair of 8's with a 10-high. If both had the Ace kicker then you proceed to the next highest card in each hand. Kickers are very important in hold'em. If your opponent opened the pot with AK and you call with KQ, then a king comes on the flop, the pair of kings will likely make you bet higher, but now he has the Ace kicker...

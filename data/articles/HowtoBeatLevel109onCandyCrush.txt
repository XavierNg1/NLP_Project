 You should eliminate these bombs right away as, with any level, if a bomb goes off, it's game over.;
, These are the goal of your level and should be a second priority. Nothing spells rage quit more than a single block of jelly that you overlooked.
 You will need a lot of luck to make it through this level. Your main combination will be striped candies, with color bombs being a heaven sent.
 Check if you have a "good hand," meaning you have a lot of similar colors or not.


If it looks like a bad hand, exit the game without using a move and you won't lose a life.
If you do have a good hand, proceed with the game.
 Unfortunately, for jelly-covered bombs, you're only given 9 moves to eliminate them. On the plus side, they're on the same row.
 Or if you already have them, bring them down and use them on the same row as the time bombs. You'll only need to do this once, and the bombs will be eliminated.
 Start building more striped candies and use them on the row where the two outer jelly boxes are.
 These are a huge help, especially if the jellied candy on the outside of the board are the same color.
 Congratulations, youâ€™ve won level 109!

 You can use your homopolar motor to demonstrate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) propulsion. MHD propulsion is a means of using electrical current to push something through water. You'll need the following for this experiment:1 C-cell battery
1 strong neodymium magnet
2 pieces of thick copper wire
A small dish
Salt and pepper

, Pour about .25 to .5 inches (0.6 to 1.3Â cm) of water into the dish. Don't fill the dish completely. Stir in a few dashes of salt and pepper, and place the dish on the magnet.Adding salt improves the conductivity of the water. Adding pepper allows you to see the propulsion at work., Bend each piece of wire so that when you hold the wires to the battery, the opposite ends are only a few centimeters apart.When you hold the the copper wire to the battery, the wires should almost make a "Y" shape. Be careful not to let the ends of the wire touch each other., Hold one wire against the positive side of the battery, and one end against the negative side of the battery., Place one wire in the center of the dish, and the other against the side of the dish. You should see the water begin to swirl around one of the wires.The water moves due to the Lorentz force. Each wire carries an electrical current. When you dip the wires into the salt water, you complete the circuit. The current moves horizontally through the water, from one wire to the other. Because the dish of water is sitting on a magnet, there is a magnetic field moving upwards through the water. When the electrical current moves through the magnetic field, the Lorentz force causes the water to spin.If you turn the battery around, you can reverse the direction of the current, and the water will spin in the opposite direction.You're dealing with water and electricity, so exercise caution when performing this experiment.

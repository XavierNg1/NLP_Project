 You should never touch your piercing with unwashed hands. Before you clean or touch your piercing, wash your hands with hot soapy water for at least twenty seconds. Then rinse your hands with hot water and dry with a clean towel., Add ¼ teaspoon of sea salt to 8 ounces (240 mL) of warm, filtered water. Use a clean spoon to stir the mixture until the salt dissolves. Do not add more than ¼ teaspoon of salt, as a stronger solution can irritate your piercing., Take a cotton ball and soak it in the sea salt solution until it is completely saturated. The cotton ball should be almost dripping with the sea salt solution., Put the cotton ball directly on your dermal piercing. Allow the cotton ball to soak the piercing for at least five minutes. After five minutes, remove the cotton ball from the piercing and throw it away., Once you are finished with the sea salt soak, you will need to let the piercing air dry. Do not touch the piercing while it is drying. Do not manually dry the piercing as this can introduce bacteria into the piercing., You should clean your dermal piercing with a saltwater soak twice a day. It is important that you clean your piercing regularly to prevent infection and support the healing process., Crust forming around a dermal piercing is a normal part of the healing process. You can remove the crust by fully saturating a cotton ball in the sea salt solution. Place the saturated cotton ball over the crust and allow the solution to soften it. Then use the cotton ball to gently wipe away the crust.

 Off-the-grid living requires that you develop energy-independence for your home. The best option is to retrofit your home with solar panels. Consult a solar power installation company in your area to get a better idea of how you can connect your home to a solar panel system.Total installation costs of an average solar power system – including solar panels, a battery, a backup generator, and professional installation – averages around $40,000.
The costs will vary slightly depending on the number of kilowatt hours you intend to consume. If you intend to live a more energy-intensive lifestyle, you’ll need more solar panels and a larger battery capacity. Thus, your initial investment in energy independence will be larger.;
, A backup system can supplement your solar panels, which can come in handy on cloudy days. If you’re near a river or creek, you could get a micro hydropower turbine installed as a backup system. Otherwise, you could get a wind turbine installed near your house. Talk to renewable energy companies in your area about your options and, if you wish, get a backup system installed.A domestic wind turbine costs around $10,000.
Micro hydropower turbines have a wide range of costs. A small one can cost around $7,000, while a large one (which produces more power) can cost over $55,000.
 Since you’re using electricity off the grid, it’s important to take steps to ensure you don’t use too much power. To keep energy costs low, replace incandescent bulbs with fluorescent bulbs. This simple change can reduce electricity use by 75%. Additionally, turn lights, TVs, and other appliances off when you’re not using them.

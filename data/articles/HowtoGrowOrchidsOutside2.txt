 First first change the soil to a mix of sand, bark, gravel and fibrous loam. Terrestrial orchids of the Pleione, Sobralia, Calanthe, Phaius and Bletia genuses can be grown in a well-drained area with a lot of shade.
 Place some moss on the tree and set the orchid on the moss. Gently tie the orchid to the moss and branch with a nylon or fishing line. In time, the roots will cling to the tree.


Place orchids in baskets or with their roots exposed on trees if you live in an area with constant rain.
 Roots may rot if there is too much water in a pot. Make sure water can drain out of the pot through a hole in the bottom. Also, do not place the pot in a secondary pot.

 Since the document protector will go in there, keep that in mind when you cut it.


Be sure to leave an edge around it. You will use those edges to fasten the protector to it.
Use a ruler or something similar to ensure that you have a straight, precise cut.
Be sure that the hole in the box is slightly smaller than 8 1/2 X 11 (the size of paper).;
,, Be sure to leave the open part of the protector open.


It's a good idea to do something like putting in a sheet of paper into the plastic while you are fastening it to the box. This will help keep it flat and retain its appearance.
 Experiment with it to get the right results.


If you have trouble getting it to stand up, place something small and heavy (and preferably clear) in the corner of the box.

 You may be able to find scripts that were actually used by the cast and crew. They will have colored pages indicating revisions, and may have hand-written notes on the pages. They may also be autographed.
 These are usually stored in electronic form and will be printed, bound with covers and brads, and mailed to you. They may also be available for download for a reduced price.
 Some movie scripts are incorporated into books and offered for sale.

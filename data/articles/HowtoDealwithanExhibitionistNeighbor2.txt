 That is, before you run off to the police, start with someone who has authority over the property. For instance, the apartment manager or the homeowner's association will likely be willing to intervene on your behalf.Discuss the issue with the association or manager by saying, "One of my neighbors seems to have an exhibitionist problem. He stands naked at his window every day for at least 10 minutes at a time, where my kids can see. Is there anything you can do to intervene?"

, Every U.S. state has laws about indecent exposure in public places. However, what counts as a public place varies by state. In some states, an area visible from a public place, such as a road, counts, while in other places, it doesn't. In other words, in some states, what happens in the home is the home owner's business, while in other states, that goes against the law.If you live in another country, be sure to check the laws in your area.
 If you're not sure if the person is violating local laws, consider calling the police on a non-emergency number. They can help you determine if your neighbor is violating local laws, and then they can let you know what they can do to help in your situation.

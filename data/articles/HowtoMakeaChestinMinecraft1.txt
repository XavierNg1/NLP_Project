, Use the chest recipe to craft the chest: Arrange the planks in every slot, apart from the middle one.
 Always place a chest with free space above it. Otherwise, you won't be able to open it!


Note that there are a few blocks that won't stop the chest from being opened if they're placed on top of it. These include: water, lava, leaves, cactus, glass, snow, stairs, farmland, cake, beds, fence, another chest, a torch, rails, signs, and a few more (translucent blocks).

 Exercises such as Tai Chi that promote strength and balance can help reduce a senior’s risk of an unmanageable fall. Consider signing yourself up for a low-impact strength and balance class through a community center or senior service center if you are a senior individual.If you help care for a senior citizen, talk to them about a low-impact exercise routine that focuses on strength and balance. Help them find a class such as Tai Chi that is catered toward seniors.
Try to get exercise for at least 30 minutes three times a week to help keep balance sharp.
 Make sure obstacles and obstructions can be seen clearly and readily by scheduling annual vision exams. It’s important that senior citizens get their eyes checked at least once a year, and that their eyeglasses and contacts prescriptions are up-to-date.Problems such as macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma can all make seeing obstacles more difficult. Consult an opthamologist about long-term treatment and management options as a part of an overall senior wellness plan.
 Many necessary medications may have side effects that can impact vision, balance, or strength. Whether you are a senior individual or you help care for one, make sure medication is taken in proper doses and at the right times every day.Have a doctor or pharmacist review all current prescriptions every time a new prescription is issued to ensure all current medications can work together.
Use a device such as a timed pill dispenser to make sure the right pills are taken at the right time on the right days.

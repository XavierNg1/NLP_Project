 For a brief kiss, the kiss isn't the important partâ€”it's the character interactions, the plot progression, or other details.


Leigh and Drake are baking cookies for her sister Julia's party. They laugh and kiss before Julia enters to talk to her sister.
Mrs. Rivera is going on a business trip. Mr. Rivera kisses her goodbye before he is left with the kids.
Rose and George are out on a picnic. They kiss, but mostly they talk about the events that occurred in previous chapters.
 Because this is a minor kiss, the details aren't important to the scene. Spend a sentence or two on the kiss, and then keep the plot moving.


Leigh and Drake intended to French kiss, but Julia's arrival cuts it short. Blushing, they quickly go back to the cookies.
Mrs. Rivera gives her husband a quick peck on the lips. "I'll kiss you better when the kids aren't watching," she whispers, and he laughs.
George kisses Rose's cheek and smiles. "I love you," he says.

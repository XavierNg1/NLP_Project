, You will be given a series of options. Select the one that is most appropriate for your phone like "Nokia Binary" or "Motorola by SMS."

, Once you select your option, Uniring will return one or more strings of code labeled "Message 1," "Message 2" and so forth. This will be your ringtone. Use your computer clipboard to copy and paste that text file.

Provide your phone number and cellular company's name. If yours is not on the list, use your cell phone's full e-mail address.
Your phone's full e-mail address is its 10 digit number (with no spaces or hyphens), the "@" symbol and your cell company's e-mail extension. An example would be 15554443333@mobile.att.net (if you had an AT&T wireless account).
If neither option works for your phone, contact your cellular company's customer service department.
Click the "Send It!" button. You will automatically be returned to a ringtones page.

 If you decide to adopt a dog through a shelter or rescue group, you will need to complete an application. The staff of the shelter will likely interview you and ask questions about your employment and pet ownership history. They may also ask to talk with your past or present veterinarian.Each shelter/rescue has different requirements of its owners, so this process will be different for each organization.
The shelter may determine that you are not a good match for a dog and reject your application.
 You should give yourself some time to think about whether or not you really want to adopt a dog. If you decide that you cannot take care of a senior dog and return it to the shelter, it will likely die there. Dogs that are repeatedly returned to shelters or rescue groups suffer emotional and mental trauma that can lead to physical harm and illness. Sleep it over and choose carefully.Take a night and sleep on whether you are ready to adopt a dog. If you still want to adopt it, the dog will be there the next day.
 Once you have decided on a dog, you will need to complete some paperwork and pay any adoption and licensing fees. The animal’s paperwork usually has some information about its health history and documents your agreement to care for the animal. The fees cover things like the medical costs associated with the dog’s care while in the shelter. After you sign everything and pay the fees, the dog will be your responsibility.The fee can run anywhere from $20 to over $100. The adoption fee for rescue groups is often higher, ranging between $150 and $400.

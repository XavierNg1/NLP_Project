 Before measuring, clip your dog’s nails to a comfortable length to assure the best fit.


Avoid cutting the quick, which is a vein that runs into your dog’s nail. It can be painful and bloody if you accidentally cut it. When you see the beginning of a circle on the nail surface, you’re approaching the quick.
Dogs typically do not like to have their paws handled too much or their nails clipped. Be sure to have some treats nearby to reward your dog while you’re clipping its nails.;
, You will need a pencil, a measuring tape, and plain white paper or a paper bag to mark on. Dog treats are an additional essential item, as your pup may need to be coaxed and bribed to participate in the measuring.
 Gently put your dog’s paw on the paper and try to get your dog to put all of its weight on that paw. This is a good time to offer treats and encouraging words.
Be sure to measure all four paws. Sometimes, there is variation in the sizes of a dog’s paws.
 Press down gently on your dog’s paw so that it spreads out, similar to how it lands when your dog is walking.
 Make a mark at the front (including toenail) and back of the paw for the length. Also mark the outermost edges of the left and right sides for width. Let your dog walk away, and then measure the distances between the lines. These measurements will give you an accurate sense of the length and width of your dog’s paw., Add ¼ inch to your measurements for both the length and width to allow extra room for your dog to spread his toes while walking., If your dog is not cooperative while you try to mark around its paw on paper, you can try to estimate a measurement by wetting your dog’s paw. Have your dog step with a wet paw onto a brown paper bag, then measure the paw print. This won’t be as accurate as the other method, but it will be a good guide to tell you which size would work for your dog.

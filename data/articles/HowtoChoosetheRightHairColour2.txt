 The color of your veins can help you to determine if you have cool or warm skin coloring. Stand outside or somewhere with lots of bright natural light. Hold your arms, palms up and look at your wrists. Try to see what color your veins look like through your skin.If your veins look like they are blue, then your undertone is cool.
If your veins look like they are green, then your undertone is warm.
 If you have trouble seeing your veins or just want to double check your results, try the paper test. Get several pieces of colored paper. You will need a piece of paper in yellow, red, white, green, silver and blue. One at a time, hold each piece of paper next to your face.If your skin looks better with the red and yellow sheets of paper, then you are more warm toned.
If your skin looks better with the white, green, silver, and blue sheets of paper, then you are more cool toned.
 Eye hair color and hair color go hand in hand, so it is also important to consider your eye color before you decide on a hair color. If you are unsure, talk to your hairstylist about what colors will compliment your eyes.


If you have brown or hazel eyes, darker shades of brown will look great on you. Try a chocolate brown or a rich espresso brown.If you have blue or grey eyes, hair colors with cooler tones like light gold or ash work well. Try a light golden blond or ash blond.

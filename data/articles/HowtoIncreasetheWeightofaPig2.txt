 Pigs should be given between 20 and 50 square feet of space within their pens, and at least 100 square feet of outside pasture in which to move around in.There are several ways to give your pig more space, such as:


removing pigs from the pen and putting them in a separate, larger enclosure
selling pigs until you have a population that can thrive within the confines of the pen
expanding the size of the pig pen

, If your pig is having a hard time getting to the feeder or trough, take steps to help it. For instance, if your pig is being fed with several others in a communal pen, it might be pushed aside by larger, more dominant pigs.If you only keep feed out during limited windows of time, some pigs might be eating less than others.


Consider adding a feeder, or providing extra bowls of feed for pigs that aren’t at the weight they should be.
Always give your pig fresh water. Even if you add water to your pig’s feed to soften it, you should also provide a bowl or trough for water. Change your pig’s water regularly. Water should be cool but not cold. Pigs need 2-3 pounds of water for every pound of feed they consume.
 Humidity levels as well as temperature affect the pig’s tendency to eat. Low humidity makes pigs more interested in eating.


Keep the air in your pig pen circulating by opening the windows or doors. Introduce fans or a large inflatable pool into the area your pig lives. Ensure it has plenty of shade.
Ensure your pig is not too cold. If the temperature of your pig pen is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, your pig might be too cold to eat. Ensure your pig pen is well-insulated against winter. Use a heater to keep the temperature in your pig pen between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.

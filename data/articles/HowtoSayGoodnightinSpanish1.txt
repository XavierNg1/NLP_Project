Noches is a feminine noun meaning nights.


Buenas is derived from the adjective bueno. In order to agree with the feminine and plural nature of noches, the -o is dropped and replaced with -as.

Unlike other adjectives, when used as part of a greeting or social expression, bueno and its various forms can be placed before the noun it modifies.;
, As a result, the phrase does not changed based on who you say it to. Buenas noches can be used for individuals, groups of people, people you are familiar with, and people you are polite with.
 This expression serves a dual purpose. It can be used in place of the English greeting, “Good evening,” as well as the English farewell, “Goodnight", though it's mostly used as the second one.

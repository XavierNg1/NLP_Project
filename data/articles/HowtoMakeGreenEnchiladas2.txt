 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees or equivalent. Peel the dry husk from the tomatillos. Rinse them in cool water and shake dry. Use a paring knife to half each tomatillo. Place the tomatillos on a baking sheet and drizzle with a suitable cooking olive oil. Roast the tomatillos until they wilt and release their juices, about 5 - 7 minutes. Remove them from the oven.
 Chop the tops off the chilies and slice them lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Finely chop the deseeded flesh.


Avoid touching your face and eyes while you're handling chilies. You may want to wear protective gloves.
If you'd prefer not to make your sauce spicy, use poblano peppers or your favourite hot chilli.
 Finley chop the garlic, onion, and cilantro.
 Heat a tablespoon of lard, butter or oil in a large skillet or frying pan. When the fat is hot, add the chilies, garlic, onion, cilantro, and tomatillos. Crush the tomatillos with the back of a wooden spoon as you fry the mixture. Continue cooking until the vegetables break down and meld into a fragrant sauce.


Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper to taste.
To spice things up, add more chopped jalapeno or hot chilies.

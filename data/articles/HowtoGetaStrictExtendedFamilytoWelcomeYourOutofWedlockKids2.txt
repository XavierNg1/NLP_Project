 When you introduce your children to the extended family, choose a good time. You want to make sure there are no extenuating circumstances that would cause your family to get irritated or view your children in a negative light.For example, don’t choose a day when your children are really rambunctious, in a bad mood, or acting out. This will give a bad impression.
Let your extended family choose the time so they will not be rushed or meeting with you at an inconvenient time.
 When you take your children to meet your extended family, try to make it during a time when all the extended family is not together. Go to one person’s house and interact with just them. This helps reduce some of the pressure on you and your children.


By breaking up the visits, you help your family not gang up on you or convince each other to remain disapproving.
For example, a family reunion may not be the best place to introduce your children because your entire family is there. They may ignore you, feed off each other’s negativity, or talk about you behind your back. When they’re alone, you have a better chance of reaching them on a personal level.
 Until your family gets to know your children, they may not approve. This means you should let your children spend time with your extended family.


The more time your extended family spends with your children, the more they will get to know them. By getting to know your children, they may start to warm up to them and accept them into the family.
If you have more than one child and they are significantly different in age, then you could try introducing one child at a time and give your family a chance to spend time with each child individually.

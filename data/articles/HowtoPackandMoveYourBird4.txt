 If you moved your bird in a carrier, return it to its regular cage when you get to your destination. The familiarity of the cage will help it adapt to its new surroundings and limit its anxiety about being in a new place. Unpack your bird’s toys and place them in the cage as soon as you can., While you unpack and set up the house, place your bird in a quiet room away from the commotion of moving in. The chaos of unpacking will likely stress out your bird. If you can, place the bird in the location where its cage will normally be so that it can adjust to its new home., If you were able to continue your bird’s feeding habits during the move, continue feeding it normally. If you got off of the eating schedule during the move, try to get your bird back on its routine. Recreating its routine will help it acclimate to its new home., If your bird still seems particularly agitated after you have been in your new home for a while, consider taking it to a vet. It may be ill or experiencing some kind of complication from the move. It is also a good idea to introduce your bird to the new veterinarian as soon as possible.

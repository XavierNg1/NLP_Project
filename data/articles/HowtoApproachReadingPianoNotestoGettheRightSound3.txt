 Make sure that you understand the timing and play the proper note lengths.
 Imagine a snails pace. The slower, the more time you have to read, find the notes and finger them for the sound as desired.
 Practicing them wrongly will make you build a habit of using the wrong notes as if they're the right ones! The same goes for fingering the melody and chords correctly.


If you have a teacher, let him or her play it for you.
Clapping the notes is also a good way to get a feel for the time and rhythm of the song!

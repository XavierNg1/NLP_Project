 Do not try to impress co-workers by talking about others or backstabbing when that is not your nature.
 It will not take you long to identify the culprits. Once you do, stay away from those people except when you have legitimate business to discuss.
 If a work-related discussion turns into rumors or scheming, simply remove yourself from the situation.


Try to bring the discussion back to the work-related topic if you can.
 Even if you are not involved in office politics, they can affect you.


Stay on top of your work so that no one will have a reason to question your motivations, or work product. Make sure all of your work is complete and accurate. Keep yourself focused on your job.
 Many people have friends at work, but do not share too much personal information with co-workers, otherwise it can be used against you.
 A positive attitude and commitment to work can be frustrating and bewildering for those who prefer to engage in office politics.


Try not to criticize others, even if you find their gossip and politics unprofessional and disruptive.
 Your supervisors will likely notice your success at avoiding politics and staying focused. This will help your career grow.

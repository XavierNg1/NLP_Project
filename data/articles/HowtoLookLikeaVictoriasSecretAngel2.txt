 Angels generally favor long, bombshell curls for their walks down the runway, and you can easily achieve the same look by investing in a curling iron and some hairspray.Before blow-drying your hair, use your fingers to comb a body-building mousse through your hair.
If your hair is short, clip in extensions. If your hair is long, skip this step.
Curl your hair using one-inch sections. Curl the portions by your hairline away from your face.
Gently tease your hair using a boar bristle brush.
Spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to hold the do in place., Angel hair usually skews more towards beach waves than ringlets, and the secret to achieving the former look is time. The longer your hair is curled, the more time it has to fall and look natural.Curl your hair several hours before you plan to go out. This will give curled hair time to relax into beachy waves.
Add a pinch of salt water spray to the roots of your hair to increase volume.
 Conditioner is great for making hair soft, but it also tends to weigh hair down. To combat this, apply conditioner before washing your hair.If you have fine hair, use a basic shampoo and conditioner.
If you have dry hair, forgo conditioner in favor of a pre-shampoo oil treatment.

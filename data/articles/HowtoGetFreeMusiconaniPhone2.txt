 There are a variety of streaming apps that will allow you to listen to free music, usually with a few ads in between every few songs. A few of the most popular apps include the following, all of which support free music streaming:


Pandora
Spotify
Google Play Music
Slacker Radio

, Music streaming uses up a lot of data, so you'll likely want to connect to a wireless network if possible, especially if you're going to be listening for a while.
 You'll likely be greeted with a welcome screen when launching it for the first time.
 Most streaming apps will require you to create a free account in order to stream. You may be able to use your Facebook account for some apps, like Spotify. If you're using Google Play Music, you can use the Google account that you're already using for other Google apps on your iPhone.
 The interface for each streaming app is different, but generally you'll pick a station that you want to listen to and the app will begin streaming music. There are usually different stations for different genres and moods.


You may be able to search for specific artists to start stations with similar music.

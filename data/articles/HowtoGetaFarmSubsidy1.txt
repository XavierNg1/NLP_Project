 Farm subsidies are administered through the Farm Service Agency. You will want to work closely with your local FSA office, which can help you identify programs and apply. You can find your state office by visiting a USDA website here: https://www.fsa.usda.gov/state-offices/index. Click on your state.


At your stateâ€™s website, you should look for a link to county offices. Contact information should be provided.;
, The FSA runs many different subsidy programs that help farmers. Some of these programs help you in the event of a disaster, whereas others are meant to cushion changes in the price of commodities. FSA also tries to encourage conservation by paying you not to plant land. The following are only some of the programs FSA runs:


Price loss coverage. Eligible producers can receive compensation when the market price for their commodities falls below a reference price set by Congress.Agricultural risk coverage. Producers can receive compensation when their revenue falls below a predetermined average.
Dairy margin protection program. This insurance program provides payments when the national dairy production margin falls below a certain point.Disaster assistance. The FSA provides relief for losses as a result of fire, flood, drought, pest infestation, tornadoes, and other natural disasters.Conservation reserve program. You can receive a yearly rental payment from the federal government. In exchange, you agree to stop using environmentally sensitive land for agricultural purposes and instead convert it to vegetative cover. Contracts last 10-15 years., Each program has its own eligibility criteria, which you can obtain from your local FSA. You should stop in and meet the staff. You will probably find that you will work closely with them in the future.


Your local FSA can also discuss other programs not mentioned in this article.

 The manner in which you build a playhouse and choose your materials will depend on the style of playhouse. For example, if your family plans on moving to a new home soon, buy a playhouse kit that allows you to assemble and disassemble the playhouse using little or no tools.;
, Although you can choose to build a playhouse of any size, you must verify that a playhouse will fit comfortably in your toddler's room, or outside in your yard.


Use a measuring tape to help you with determining whether a playhouse will fit comfortably in an area inside or outside of your home.
 The costs of playhouse kits made by manufacturers will differ significantly from one another; however, the supplies needed for building your own playhouse will usually cost between 450 and 500 dollars (344 and 382 euros).
 The materials you need will depend on the style of playhouse you want to build. For example, if you are building a stationary playhouse in your yard, you will need to buy lumber, plywood, nails, screws, truss brackets, and more.


Read the instructional manual for your playhouse if you purchased a kit to determine if any extra supplies are needed. For example, you may be required to buy paint for the exterior of the playhouse if none was provided.
 Common tools you may need are a hammer, screwdriver, saw, saw horses, measuring tape, a pencil, or a level.

 Here, a 1 inch (2.5cm) by 1/8 inch (3.1mm) piece of aluminum flat stock is a good material to use, being easy to form and drill, and weather/corrosion resistant. Each side of the angle should be about 4 inches (10cm) long, and you will need to drill 3/16 inch (4.7mm) holes for the mounting screws on one side of each piece.
 You might rip this piece of stock (1 1/2 inches (3.8cm) square by 3 feet (91cm) long) before mounting the attaching brackets to make sure they are positioned correctly.
 A 1/4 inch (6.3mm) bolt 2 1/2 inches (6.3cm) long will hold this piece in place. You can dimple the end of the bolt where the threads come out of the nut to prevent it from loosening during use.
 Again, the aluminum flat stock is an easy material to use for this step. Form two matching pieces in a squared zee shape (see illustration), drill it for the mounting screws, and smooth the edges with a file or sandpaper so there isn't a risk of scratches when handling it.
 Then center drill it for a 1/4 inch (6.3mm) bolt (or all thread rod) to attach it. Be sure to drill as nearly in the center as possible, using a bit long enough to drill completely through.
 Then thread a nut on the end (or both, if you are using all-thread rod).
 Cut off and grind smooth any protruding bolt threads.

 Meningitis is an infection (usually viral) that causes an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can affect any breed of dog, but some dog breeds inherit breed-specific forms of meningitis, and it is not known how or why this happens. Some breeds known to inherit this disease are beagles, Bernese mountain dogs, pugs, and Maltese terriers.Common symptoms of canine meningitis include:


FeverNeck pain"Stiff" neck and rigidity (difficulty moving the head and neck)Weakness in the legsLoss of balance/equilibriumSeizures, Meningitis cannot be treated without proper veterinary care. The most common course of action is to suppress the immune response, typically through high doses of steroid treatment. Prednisone is commonly prescribed for dogs with meningitis, though your vet may prescribe other medications, either with or without prednisone., Canine meningitis is rarely curable, and while treatment options can reduce the symptoms and improve a dog's quality of life in the short term, relapses are quite common, and may be fatal. Alert your veterinarian of any signs of relapse in your pet.

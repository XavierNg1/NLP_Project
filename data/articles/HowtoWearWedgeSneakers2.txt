 You can wear wedge sneakers like you wear normal sneakers in this regard. An oversized t-shirt is not recommended, but a fitted t-shirt or tank top paired with a simple bottom and your favorite wedge sneakers makes for an updated take on daily casual wear.
 If you plan on wearing neutral wedge sneakers and a structured jean, trouser, or skirt, a fitted button-down shirt that nips in at the waist can complete your look, providing you with an appropriate “Casual Friday” type outfit. The same can be said for a fitted blouse.


Alternatively, you can also pair a plain white button-down with denim skinny jeans and a bright, single-color wedge sneaker to add a pop of color and playfulness to your outfit. This look is best accented with other pops of color in your accessories.
 While the general idea is to keep your figure looking slim and tall to balance out the additional weight of the wedge sneaker, it can also be appropriate to wear a slightly looser, free-flowing blouse, tunic, or dress over skinny jeans and leggings. This is especially true for women with thicker legs who may feel the urge to draw attention away from their legs and to another part of their body. A flowing top can look feminine, and separating it from the sneakers with a snug bottom can still lead to a balanced look.
 A tailored blazer can add just the right amount of structure and form, accentuating your curves without causing them to compete for attention with the wedge sneakers. For a more professional or chic look, stick with neutral colored sneakers and blazers. For something a little more interesting, throw over a brightly colored blazer with muted wedge sneakers.

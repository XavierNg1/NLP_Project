 Try using small letter stickers or stickers in the shapes of hearts to leave writing on your eggs. Stick the letters to the undyed eggshell. Dip them into the dye like you would any other egg. Set them to the side to dry.When the egg has dried and you are done dyeing it, gently peel off the stickers.
 Put a small amount of white liquid glue or craft glue on a paintbrush. Write words or draw a picture on an egg. Then, roll the egg in the glitter. You should have glitter writing on your egg.Allow the glitter and glue to dry before trying to brush off the excess glitter.
 You can write on your eggs with paint. Try puff paint to write three dimensional words and designs. You can also use a paintbrush to write words and draw designs on your Easter eggs with regular craft paint.You can dye the eggs first, and then paint with complimentary colors.

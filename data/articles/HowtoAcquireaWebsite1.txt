 Acquiring a website that already targets your intended market is a great way to instantly build a customer base for your current or future products and services.


For example, if you are planning to offer your services as a writing coach, then you'd want to acquire a website whose audience is made up of new and learning writers. If you want to coach writers, it would be counterproductive to acquire a website dedicated to something like gardening.;
, Many websites have plenty of great content but fail to optimize their website for maximum traffic and ad performance. If you acquire a website like this, you can quickly implement optimizations and start generating more ad revenue for yourself.


When looking for poorly optimized sites, pay attention to their advertisement placement. Sometimes you can boost a website's ad revenue simply by moving around the ads so that they are more visible. You should also look for websites with poor keyword density and search engine optimization. By improving on that, you can drastically increase a website's visibility across search engines, thus increasing traffic and exposure.
 When a website has a large community surrounding its brand, all of those community members form a potential market for your products and services. Don't just acquire any community, though. Find a large community that would be interested in buying what you have to offer.
 If you find other websites that are trying to sell similar services or products, then you may want to acquire those websites to reduce competition. By removing the competition, you gain market dominance and you increase your stability in that market.

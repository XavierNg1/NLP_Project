 Communication is key. If you are afraid to talk to the girl that you're dating, or if you'd rather do something else, you need to set some priorities. Ask her how her day was. You want her to listen to you, so you should listen to her--conversation is a two way street.;
, Ask her about her dreams and hopes. It will make her feel like you care about her. Always ask her about school and her day as well.
 If they say "Be right back, I gotta go do something", it's usually best not to ask what she were doing, as it can make a girl feel annoyed.
 Try to keep things very very positive. If she's complaining about life, don't agree. Tell her she rocks and support her.
 Girls know when you're sincere and when you're just blowing hot air. But, compliments never hurt anyone.
 You need to experiment for yourself! Remember, romance is not always an easy thing.
, Keep your daily and lifelong goals in sight. Nothing turns off a woman faster than a man who chooses to accomplish nothing, even if all his attention is directed toward her.
 Give her some room. she doesn't need you to be hanging on her, she wants to be able to lean on you, not the other way around.
 If you flirt with another girl, to make her 'jealous' then its not going to work, she'll think that you like them and might end up moving on. Not all girls get jealous the same way.
 If they love you, she will think otherwise or something... Don't fall in love with her friends either!

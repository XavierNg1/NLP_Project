 Click the Equation button (which displays the Greek letter pi) in the Symbols section of the Insert ribbon tab. Select the "Insert New Equation" option at the bottom of the dropdown menu.


You can open the editor from a new or existing document, but the Equation Editor is available only in Word's XML-based .docx or .dotx formats.
 This option button displays an "e" raised to the power of "x." Clicking the option button displays a dropdown menu with headings labeled "Subscripts and Superscripts" and "Common Subscripts and Superscripts."

, This option displays a larger dashed-line rectangular box with a smaller, raised rectangular box to its right. Selecting this option displays a similar pair of boxes in the Equation field on the document page.
 Enter the value of the base in the larger box to the left using your keyboard. If you enter a letter for a variable, it will automatically be displayed in italics.
 Enter this value in the smaller box to the right using your keyboard. If you enter a letter for a variable, it will automatically be displayed in italics.


You can also enter the base and exponent in the Equation field entirely from the keyboard by typing first the base, then the caret (^) symbol, then the exponent. When you hit Enter, closing the Equation field, the caret will disappear and the exponent will appear as a superscript.
The Equation Editor in Word 2007 and later treats equations as Word text, with the Equation Editor using a special math font.

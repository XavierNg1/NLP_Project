 Google accounts hold all of your precious data and plans, using none of your internal storage space. With a Google account, you will have not only your email, but included is your calendar/appointments/tasks, Google Docs(holds all your Word/Excel/PowerPoint files and more) Google Maps will now let you save maps and routes. This will back up all of your precious data under one safe username and password, and it will be accessible from any computer with internet access. After doing this step, you are free to throw away your needs for a paper calendar! That thing was getting big and messy anyway.;
, Buy an Android phone. Whether you are on Verizon, T-Mobile, or Sprint, there's an Android phone out there for anyone. With an Android phone, you will be able to conveniently sync with your Google account, meaning your calendar is on your screen, and it's even better than paper. You can set a ringer for an appointment so you know when to go to it, make a repeated appointment(work, school, sports, and scheduled events) and much more. Your email account will be on your phone, with you at all times, so you're always updated. Your Android device will be your new newspaper, alarm clock, GPS, maps, web browser, iPod, social media platform space, photo album (toss away those big binders), weather informer, video game console, telephone, and much more to come from Google!

, They have all formed into a little device in your pocket, at your side at all times. You will find your life much more simple, with everything falling into your Android device.
 There is so much to be found!

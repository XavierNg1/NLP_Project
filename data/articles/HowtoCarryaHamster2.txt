 Hamsters are territorial. If you have the scent of other hamsters or pets on your hands, it may try to bite you. It is a good practice to wash your hands before handling your hamster. Even if you have no other pets, any smell on your hand might upset your hamster., If your hamster bites, you may choose to wear gloves to prevent injury. Gloves can stop your hamster from biting you, which will ensure that you do not drop it out of surprise.If your hamster is acclimated to you or if it is not prone to biting, you may not need gloves.
If you do wear gloves, make sure that they are rubber ones, as hamsters like chewing on the leather gloves.
 Make sure that one hand is beneath it supporting its bottom. The other should be lightly enclosed around it so that it cannot fall. Before you lift the hamster out of the cage, face the hamster towards you. This will help prevent the hamster from jumping off your hand out of fear., Once you are done playing with your hamster, lower it back into the cage using the same method you lifted it out with. Have one hand beneath it, and one hand over it. Wait until your hand is close to the bottom of the cage before you let it crawl off. Your hamster should not jump off your hand, or else you risk injuring it.

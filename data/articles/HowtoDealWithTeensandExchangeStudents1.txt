 Remind him or her that he or she will have to share family, schools, friends and such with a complete stranger. If the teen isn't willing to do so, it will be very difficult housing your exchange student.;
, It'll be easier having him or her stay with you if he or she has already become somewhat acquainted with your teen.
 Tell him or her to be understanding and hospitable so that your exchange student may feel as comfortable and welcome as possible.
 Teens will be teens, so just keep in mind that things will get better.
 Your teen may feel that you are giving the exchange student more attention and care than you are giving him or her, particularly if your own child is accustomed to being the only child in the family.

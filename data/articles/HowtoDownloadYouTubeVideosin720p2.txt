 You will see the usual "Paste the YouTube URL" search box.
 You will be given two options at first: 360p or 720p. You can get other options, such as changing the video into an (.mp3) file for music. Don't click 1080p though, as it is not approved in audio.
 When you get the file, it will be named as "download.bin". Change the file name from (.bin) to (.mp4) or anything that's a video file. The title change is optional, but it's a challenge if you like searching for your videos when they all have the same file name.

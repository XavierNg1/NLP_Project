 Finally you are ready to apply the paint. Use brushes and/or rollers, depending on how much area you need to cover. Paint the edges of the cabinets first. Be careful to reach right into any finicky corners.


Use long, even strokes to prevent a mottled look. Be aware to remove any paint brush hairs or your own hairs that might fall onto the paintwork as you paint â€” they will cause unsightly ridges, and the paint will chip from these areas when knocked.
 Use a mini-roller to hit the inside of the cabinet, and wait for it to dry. Then go over the initial coat with a brand new brush, replacing the self hangers.
 This may mean contorting yourself a little bit, but it's worth it for achieving an overall even look.
 It is up to you where you feel most comfortable doing this; it might be on the floor over the drop cloth or perhaps resting on something else, such as a workbench. Paint one side of each door at a time (allow one side to dry before attempting the other).
 Professional contractors may hang the cabinets to dry, so that no contamination or rub-off occurs. It is often a good idea to wait for good daylight (even if this means waiting until the next day) to check that you haven't missed anything or have uneven patches of paintwork.

 You need a computer, not a mobile device, to change your profile picture directly through the YouTube site.If you only have a phone or tablet, refer to the other section instead.


Most users only need one channel, but if you wish to display a different name, or avoid linking your personal Google+ page to a public channel, visit the channel switcher and select + Create a new account before continuing.;
, Open the left sidebar by clicking the "Guide" icon, which looks like three horizontal lines to the right of the YouTube logo in the top left. From the list of menu items, select "My Channel" to visit your currently selected channel.
 On your selected channel page, click the smaller, square image to visit your Google+ page. By default, this image is a blue square.
 Mouse over the square Google+ image above your Google+ username, then click the camera icon once it appears. You have several options for selecting a new image:


Upload your image by dragging a photo from your computer to the large grey box, or select one using the Select a photo from your computer button.
Select the Albums or Photos of You tabs at the top of the page to browse your images on Google+. These will be empty if you just created a new Google+ page.
Select Web camera, if available, to take a photo of yourself using your computer's built-in or attached web cam. If prompted by a Flash player pop-up window, select "Allow," then "Close."

, Typically, you'll need to wait a short time before your YouTube page automatically updates to display your new Google+ image.


In some cases, the thumbnail version of the image may appear before the full version does. Visit your channel switcher page to see if the icon has loaded next to your channel name. If it has, the image should eventually propagate to your channel homepage as well.

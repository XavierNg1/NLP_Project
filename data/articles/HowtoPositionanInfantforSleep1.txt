 According to most medical professionals, the ideal sleeping position for an infant is on their back in the center of a crib, bassinet, or other infant bed. An infant can easily be maneuvered to lie on their back in the center of their bed from any position they were in when they fell asleep.


The following steps will help you to move your baby from your arms into a comfortable sleeping position on their bed.;
, If your child fell asleep on their tummy against your torso, use one hand to support your baby’s head and neck, while the other hand supports their bottom while you carry them to bed. This position works because it allows you to lean over your infant’s bed and ease your infant’s body away from your own until their bottom is touching the bed.


The hand that was supporting your infant’s bottom can be pulled away, and your infant’s head can be eased onto the bed.
 If your baby fell asleep while cradled in your arms, you can carry them to bed in that position, or maneuver them so that they are in the position described in the previous step.


Once you get your child to the bed, lean over until your arms are touching the bed, and then gently slide your arm out from under your child’s bottom, so that the bottom rests on the bed. Next, slide the other arm away so that your child is fully lying on the bed.
 You must make sure that items in your child’s bed do not pose a threat to their safety. Although stuffed animals, fluffy blankets, decorative pillows, and crib bumpers might look cute, they could pose a choking hazard to your sleeping baby.


If your baby rolls too close to these items, they could suffocate, so it is very important that you remove these items.
 If the room temperature cannot be adjusted to keep your infant warm enough, you can dress your child in light layers of clothing, such as a larger sleeper or a sleep sack over the sleeper they normally wear.

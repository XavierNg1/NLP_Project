 Before a lab begins, your teacher will discuss all of the necessary safety precautions for that specific experiment. They will have also detailed all safety procedures at the beginning of the year.If you are unsure of the correct way to handle something, always ask the teacher so you do everything safely.
At all times, follow any safety guidelines posted in the lab.
 Eating or drinking in the lab or during an experiment can be extremely hazardous and lead to injury. If you have a hazardous chemical on your hands and then you touch your food with those hands, you could ingest that chemical. The same goes for drinking beverages.If you need to eat or drink anything, remove your gloves and lab coat, wash your hands, leave the laboratory and then consume the food or drink.
Chewing gum is also not allowed in the lab.
 Hair and dangling jewelry can present a hazard if they catch on anything. You can also accidentally catch your hair on fire if it falls into a flame without you realizing it. Chemicals that are corrosive or irritating can get underneath a ring or a bracelet and cause irritation.


Try to come to class without any jewelry so you donâ€™t have to store it and potentially lose it.
 When you first get to the lab, put all of your things in a place where they will be out of the way and not create a trip hazard. Under the lab bench or in cubby holes at the front of the class are the two best places to store them.


When leaving class, remember to grab all of your things from under the bench or wherever they were left.
 No matter how trivial it may seem, everything must be reported to the teacher. They will know how to handle everything safely and make sure no one gets hurt.If glass breaks or something spills, do not try to clean it up until you have told your teacher about it. There might be a special way the clean-up needs to be handled.

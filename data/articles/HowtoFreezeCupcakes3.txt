 Take the cupcakes out of the freezer and place them in a safe place where they can defrost without being disturbed, such as a countertop or cooking space.
 It's not recommended to use heat to defrost your cupcakes. Avoid using an oven, microwave, or stovetop to defrost your cupcakes or they will end up soggy and/or the paper liners will peel off.Leave the cupcakes wrapped or in their container or bag when you remove them from the freezer.
 After about an hour, slightly crack open the container or Ziploc bag. If the cupcakes were wrapped in foil, remove some of the foil off each cupcake, but not all of it. Too much moisture can cause the paper liners to peel off, so it's important to let out some air for the cupcakes., Most cupcakes will take about thirty minutes to an hour to defrost, but you can leave the cupcakes overnight so they can defrost fully.Image:Freeze Cupcakes Step 12.jpg

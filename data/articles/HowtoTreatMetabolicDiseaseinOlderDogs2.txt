 Most metabolic diseases in older dogs can be managed without surgery. However, for some metabolic diseases, like primary hyperparathyroidism (cancerous parathyroid gland) and adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease (cancerous adrenal gland), surgery is the treatment of choice.Surgical treatment involves removal of the entire affected gland, not just the tumor.
Your vet will consider different factors, such as your dog’s age and overall health status, as well as whether the tumor has spread, to determine if surgery is a good choice for your dog.
As you make your decision, ask the vet questions: How long will the surgery take? How much will the surgery cost? How soon after surgery will my dog start feeling better? Are there any risks with the surgery?

, If you decide to move forward with surgery, schedule the surgical appointment. Your vet will give you pre-surgical instructions to prepare your dog for surgery. Usually, a dog should stop eating 12 hours before surgery and stop drinking water 8 hours before surgery.Either the vet or one of the vet’s staff members will contact you after the surgery to give you an update and let you know when you can pick up your dog.
When you take your dog home after surgery, you will need to perform some at-home care, such as administering pain medication and making sure the surgical incision site looks normal (no swelling or discharge).
 Your vet will want to see your dog after surgery to ensure it’s making a good recovery and its metabolic disease is under control. For example, with primary hyperparathyroidism, which causes elevated calcium levels, your vet will want to measure your dog’s calcium levels. If the calcium is too low, your dog will need calcium supplements.With adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, the cancerous adrenal glands produce too much of the cortisol hormone. After surgery, your vet may want to measure your dog’s cortisol levels.

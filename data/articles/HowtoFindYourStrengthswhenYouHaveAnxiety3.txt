 Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to get an accurate look at ourselves. Ask your friends, family members, and co-workers for their honest opinion on your strengths. Pay attention to patterns and similarities in their replies.Ask a wide variety of people to get a well-rounded picture of your personality. For instance, instead of just asking family members, try asking an old friend, a co-worker, and a classmate as well.
Some people may give you constructive criticism or tell you about your weaknesses as well. Don’t ask for anyone’s opinion unless you are prepared to deal with this.
 As someone with anxiety, you may not often focus on your strengths or think about how to build on them. Ask yourself what kind of positive feedback you get from your friends, bosses, and teachers. If people frequently point out that you’re good at something, it’s probably one of your strengths.For example, your best bud might say, "Gee, I wish I was as creative as you. My art project was terrible." This demonstrates that they think you're creative, which may be a strength of yours.
 Character self-assessments can help you get a more objective look at your personality. The University of Pennsylvania’s VIA Survey of Character Strengths is one well-known questionnaire for finding your strong points. University career centers also usually offer tests that help you identify your strengths.Answer the questions honestly, or your results won’t be accurate.

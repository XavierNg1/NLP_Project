 This requires courage, but it's a surefire way for him to at least know that you exist. If he's new to the neighborhood, go over and say a quick hello. Introduce yourself and welcome him to the neighborhood. Tell him where you live; ie. "Hi, I'm Miranda. I just live in the house across the street. I just thought I'd stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood.";
, When he is outside, go outside at the same time. Make sure that you're not just standing there staring at him; you'll need a reason to be outside, such as doing yard work, washing the car, playing, etc. so it seems like a coincidence that you're outside at the same time. The last thing you want is for him to think that you're a creepy stalker.
 Give him a reason to - play with a friend/sibling, play a very loud game, listen to your favorite song (and sing along if you're confident enough), etc. Doing this will make him start to notice you.
 If you walk by his house and see him, or vice versa, be sure to say something. You don't have to get into a huge conversation; a simple "Hi", "Good morning", or "Good afternoon" will do the trick. Once he gets used to you greeting him, he will be the one saying hello first.
 After a while, begin to actually talk to him. Saying things like "How are you?", "What's up?", "Hey, neighbor!", etc. will give him the opportunity to talk to you more, so you can learn more about him. This will help you two get closer.
 Once he's really started to notice you, feel free to look over at him. If he catches you, instead of looking away, smile and wave at him. He'll most likely smile and wave back!

, Once he's noticed you, he'll probably initiate a conversation or two. When this happens, be cool. Talk to him like you would any normal person. You don't want to freak him out, right?

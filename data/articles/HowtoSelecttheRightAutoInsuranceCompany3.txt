 If you know what kind of policy you want, check to see if an auto insurance company provides that policy or not. Read up on which claims are entertained by the company. You might decide you don't need collision coverage because your car is old and would be cheap to replace, but you do need personal injury insurance because you can't afford to take time off work.


Check what insurance is required by your state. Not all states require liability insurance, for instance.
If you have an unusual car, such as a historic vehicle, look up companies that will offer you a policy specific to your needs.
 Consider combining your insurance. If you have home insurance, call the company that provides it and ask if you are eligible for a discount if you get your car insurance from them.If you work for any sort of company, check with them to see if they have a connection to an insurance company, and can get you a better rate.


If you already have car insurance, and you have a good record with them, call them and ask for a renewal discount. This can significantly lower your premium, and save you the hassle of changing companies.
 Companies lower your rates based on occupation, driving history, gender, age, and other factors. Ask each company what discounts are available for you. Check for student discounts, military discounts, low-risk occupation discounts. Ask for safe driver discounts if you have not been involved in an accident for at least a year.

Some insurance companies offer discounts for student drivers with high GPAs.
Do you belong to AAA or another auto safety club? That might qualify you for a discount.
The features of your car might lower your rates. If you have antilock brakes, automatic seatbelts, or airbags, check to see if this can lower your premium.

 Fresh, raw peanuts actually grow underground, so they often have dirt and other residue on their shells. Before salting 2 pounds (907 g) of peanuts, place them in a colander and run them under cool water. Toss the nuts gently to ensure that they’re all rinsed well.Even if the peanuts look clean, you should still rinse them. All of the dirt may not be visible.;
, To create the brine, fill a large stockpot with 2 gallons (7.5 l) of water. Add 4 tablespoons (68 g) of salt to the pot, and stir well to ensure that the brine is well mixed.The brine requires 2 tablespoons (34 g) of salt for every gallon (3.8 l) of water. You can adjust the recipe based on how many peanuts you’re salting.
 When the brine is mixed, place the peanuts in the pot. Let the nuts soak for at least 8 hours or overnight.The longer you allow the peanuts to soak in the brine, the saltier they’ll be.
 After the peanuts have soaked in the brine for at least 8 hours, pour them into a colander to drain the water. Shake the nuts well to remove the excess water, and then spread them out on clean kitchen towel or paper towel to dry.

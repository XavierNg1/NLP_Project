 It might just be that the game tray got stuck that one time. Before you go prying it open, turn the console off. Wait for about ten seconds for the console to cool down. When you're happy that it's completely turned off, start it up again. Wait for it to fully load before clicking the open button. When it has loaded, open the tray again. If it opens, great! If it's still stuck, move on to the steps below.
 If the game tray is stuck on one side and cannot open, gently pull it to the opposite side with your finger. You may have to use two fingers or your thumb if the tray is stiff. Hopefully, this will get it open so that you can get your game out. If you can't move it with your finger, try to pry it open using some sort of tool. This will, however, void the warranty. When you do get the game tray open, remove your game but don't use it again. You might not get it open next time.
 If you can hear something blocking it from the inside, open up the PS2 and remove your game that way. If there's no game in there but you're good with the console, feel free to try to repair it yourself. This may include removing and replacing certain parts, like the game tray itself. Keep in mind that even opening the console will void the warranty.

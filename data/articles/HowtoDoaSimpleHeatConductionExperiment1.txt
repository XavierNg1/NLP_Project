 You’ll need a cooking pot, a stick of butter, and three types of spoons. The spoons you need are a wooden stirring spoon, a plastic cooking spoon, and a regular metal spoon. You need to get spoons that are relatively long. If you put the spoon in the pot the handle should be coming out of the pot by about three or four inches.
If you want a precise measurement for heat conduction you can also use thermometers. In that case you’ll need three thermometers and electrical tape.;
, Fill a regular cooking pot about halfway full with water and place it on a normal stove burner. Boil water the same way you would if you were going to make spaghetti or pasta.
 Take each of your three types of spoons and lay them in the water handle down. The bowl portion of the spoon should be comfortably out of the water. You can place the spoons next to each other or facing away from each other. The bowl portion of the spoon will be at a diagonal. Try to make that diagonal as close to horizontal as possible by leaning the end of the handle that is in the water up against the side of the pot.


If you are using thermometers to measure the heat conduction tape the thermometers to each of the spoons before you put them in the water.
 Cut three slices of butter. You should cut them about a quarter inch each, but it isn’t that important. Now place one slice in each of the spoons. Make sure they don’t slide into the water. Be careful not to touch the metal spoon as you place the butter on it.
 After about two minutes, come back and check the butter. You’ll notice that the butter on the metal spoon has melted significantly, the butter on the wooden spoon has melted a little bit, and the butter on the plastic spoon has barely melted at all.This is heat conduction at work.


Metal conducts heat better than wood, which conducts heat better than plastic.
If you are using thermometers, check your thermometer readings after a few minutes. The same results will appear with specific numbers.

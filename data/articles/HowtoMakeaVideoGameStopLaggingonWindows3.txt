 This can be done by pressing the pause button (usually two vertical lines, or, in some cases, the P key). Then, click on Options and find the graphics settings.


If there is no graphics menu whatsoever, it is probable the game is not graphically intensive and you will have to upgrade your computer to get better performance.
 This will usually be either 1920 X 1080 or 1366 X 768 by default; lower it to 1366 X 768 if your computer is currently running at 1920 X 1080, and 1080 X 720 if your computer is running 1366 X 768.In the event that your computer is running a higher resolution than 1920 X 1080, then turn it down to 1920 X 1080.
If your default resolution is lower than 1080 X 720, you will probably have to replace your computer if you want to play any kind of intensive games (this usually means your computer has either a very small screen or was released pre-2010).
 If the game is still lagging or you're already in medium settings, turn the settings down to low or minimum.


If your game is still lagging, you will probably have to upgrade your computer.
 These should not be turned on if you are trying to avoid lag.


There is a possibility the game you are playing has other advanced settings, such as detail options or MSAA. If you see these settings, turn them down.

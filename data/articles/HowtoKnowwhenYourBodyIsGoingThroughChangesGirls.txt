The first step when going through puberty is your breasts will start to develop.

Stage 1 you have a flat chest, with a mountain shaped nipple and an areola.
Stage 2 a raised bump will appear which is called a breast. The nipple will look darker, rounder, and large and will start to hurt. Some girls feel a little tenderness if the middle part of your nipple hits a hard surface.
Stage 3 the aureola and the nipple continue to grow and be darker. At this stage the nipple might be a little pointier.
At stage 4 some girls skip this stage and go straight to stage 5 which is your breasts are fully developed and are a lot more rounder than stage 1. You might see little hairs around the aureoles don't pick or pluck at them. This can cause irritation.

You might see hairs around the aureola and your vaginal area. Do not cut or pluck any of these hairs. this can cause irritation. This is not a bathing suit area, but under your arms there is going to be hair.
 You may want a pad at this point.
 You should talk to an adult whom you trust and talk about getting a pad or a tampon.



You will also start getting pimples if you don't wash your face. You may also see pimples on your forehead maybe because you have bangs. Or if you don't, it's just there for a reason. When you do start getting pimples or acne wash your face two times a day. Use a gentle cleaning wash like Cetaphil to wash your face. Never pick at pimples or acne. If you do you, it will leave a scar.

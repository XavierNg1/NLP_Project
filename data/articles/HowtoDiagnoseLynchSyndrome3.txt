 Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition. The genetic error that exists in those people with Lynch syndrome is a group of genes that code for proteins that actually help to repair genes.


This group of genes are for “mismatch repair genes,” which are those genes that repair the relatively common mistakes when DNA reproduces itself. Errors in this matching process can be repaired normally, but in Lynch Syndrome, they cannot be repaired because the genes that code for the proteins that do the repair are themselves damaged.The cause of the cancers associated with Lynch syndrome is believed to be an accumulation of these errors mutations in the DNA.
If a mother or a father has one copy out of two of this gene, there is a 50% chance that it was passed on to their child.
 If your genetic test is positive for Lynch syndrome, it means that your lifetime risk of cancer is between 60 and 80%. It does not mean you will definitely have colon or endometrial cancer, but the risk of colon and endometrial cancer as well as other cancers is increased.


The lifetime risk of endometrial cancer can range from 20 to 60%.
The lifetime risk of other cancers are increased by less than 20%., Lynch syndrome is not treatable. If your genetic testing is positive, this means that you will need to consult with a genetic counselor as well as your physician to determine your best course of action for cancer prevention and future screening.This is likely to include a yearly colonoscopy, a yearly endometrial biopsy, as well as other screening tests, depending on your gender.

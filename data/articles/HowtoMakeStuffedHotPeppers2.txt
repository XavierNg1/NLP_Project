 Using a sharp knife, cut a vertical slit into each pepper from the stem to the bottom.


The slit is used as an opening for the stuffing; do not cut all the way through to the other side.
 Season with salt and pepper to taste.
 Wrap one or two pieces of bacon (depending on your personal preference) around each banana pepper and secure each one with a toothpick.
 Broil for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.

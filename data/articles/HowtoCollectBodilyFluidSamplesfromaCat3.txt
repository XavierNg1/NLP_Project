 You may need to get a urine sample from your cat if your vet wants to test your cat's urine for health issues. Start by replacing your cat's litter with non absorbent litter so the urine is not absorbed when your cat goes to the bathroom. Time this for when your cat usually goes to the bathroom, replacing the litter right before it goes. This way, the urine sample will be fresh.You can find non absorbent cat litter online or at your local pet store. Inert litter beads are a good option, as are any litter beads that are labeled "non absorbent."
If you do not have access to non absorbent litter, you can line your cat's litter box with paper towels or bubble wrap instead.
 Once your cat has gone to the bathroom, take the litter box and carefully pour the urine into a an airtight plastic or glass container. A test tube would also work well. Wear medical gloves to do this so you do not come in contact with the urine.If you find it difficult to pour the urine right out of their litter box and do not want to get litter beads in the sample, use a clean medical dropper to suck the urine out of the box and into a container.
 If you are not bringing the sample to the vet right away, store it in the refrigerator. This will keep the sample fresh for the vet. You can also store the sample on ice in a cooler if you do not have access to a refrigerator to keep it fresh., Take the urine sample to your vet's office as soon as you acquire it, as this will ensure it is fresh and lead to the most accurate test results. Try to schedule the vet appointment in advance and collect the urine sample the day of the appointment.The vet will test the urine sample for traces of blood, as well as glucose, ketones, and concentration level. This can help your vet determine your cat's general health and if it is at risk for health issues like diabetes or a urinary tract infection.

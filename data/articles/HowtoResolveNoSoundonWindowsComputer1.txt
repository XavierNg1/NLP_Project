 It's easy to forget that you turned down your computer's volume. Before you do anything else, press the "Volume Up" button and look for an indicator that the volume is rising.

If you see something indicating that the volume is at 100 percent and you still aren't receiving sound, continue.;
, Having a speaker or headphones partially plugged into your computer will often result in no audio output.

Also make sure that the audio device(s) in question is/are plugged into the correct port(s).
 The easiest way to do this is by playing a song while plugging and unplugging devices one at a time; if you receive sound output from your computer's default speakers but not from your speaker system, the issues most likely isn't on your computer's end., Before proceeding to more stringent methods, try to reset your audio by restarting your computer. If your computer loads up with the sound is fixed, you needn't continue.

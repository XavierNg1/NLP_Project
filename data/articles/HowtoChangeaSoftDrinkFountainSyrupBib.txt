Sometimes air will get caught in the tube and it will appear to be out of syrup when it really isnâ€™t.



Check with your employer whether to empty the box completely before replacing or if it should be replaced before it is completely used.



Warning! Connecting the wrong BIB to the fountain, even for a few moments, will force you to waste a good amount of syrup to clear the wrong type out of the system (which means wasting money).



Tip: After removing hose from empty bag, place the cap from the new bag onto the empty bag to prevent leftover syrup from dripping out (it is extremely hard to clean up).



The brixing cup mixes the predetermined amount of syrup and carbonated water to attain control of the quality of the drink. The specifications must be checked periodically to account for pressure changes as well as possible changes in the viscosity of the syrup.



Not for too long, just enough to get the syrup running through the system.



Recycle box if available.

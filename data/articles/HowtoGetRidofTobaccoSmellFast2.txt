 Take baking soda and sprinkle it over your furniture and floors that smell like tobacco. Try to cover each of the surfaces with a thin coating of baking soda.You can pour the baking soda through a colander if you are having a difficult time spreading it around.
 The baking soda will absorb some of the unpleasant tobacco odors from upholstered furniture and carpet as you let it sit. You can use a rag or towel to help push the baking soda into your furniture or carpet., Run a vacuum and try to suck up all of the baking soda. Use the vacuum's attachments for hard to reach places and to vacuum down upholstery. Once you've vacuumed up all the baking soda, make sure to empty the vacuum's bag outdoors.
 Leave the room or house for an hour or two and come back. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine if the tobacco smell is gone once you've been around it for a long time. If the room still smells strongly of tobacco, you can repeat these steps until all of the odors are gone.

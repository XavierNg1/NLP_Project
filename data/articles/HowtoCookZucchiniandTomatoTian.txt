 Add red pepper slices and cook until tender. Add garlic and cook until aromatic.;
, Add the sautéed vegetable mixture and mix thoroughly. Lightly beat 2 eggs and stir into the rice mixture. Season lavishly with salt and freshly ground pepper. You may be wondering why egg is stirred into the rice. The rice is there to add substance and absorb the juices of the vegetables. It also turns the rice into a lovely, delicate, creamy crust under the vegetables, so if the combo seems odd to you, try it just this once.
 If you don’t have a gratin dish, any shallow casserole will do. Smooth the rice mixture on the bottom of the dish.
 Season with oregano, salt and pepper, and drizzle olive oil over the vegetables.

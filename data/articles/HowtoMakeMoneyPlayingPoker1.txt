 This will help you long term. Also know the basic terms.;
,, Put simply your outs are the total number of cards that will make your hand a winner; multiply this number by 4 on the turn to give you an idea of the percentage chance to win. Or times 2 on the river. Example you are open ended after the flop. So there are 8 cards that make your hand so 8X4 tells us that before the turn your chances are about 32% within about 2 percent or about 1 in 3. On the river your odds are 8X2 or 16% give or take 2 percent.
 If there are you and 4 other people in the pot, you are getting about 4 to 1 on your money. If you have a 1 in 3 chance to hit you are getting pot odds. This is the main key to money. If you call this hand down, you will win about 1 in 3 times but you're getting close to 4$ for every 1$ you have to risk.
 Limit games like 3/6 are the best place to start and take 40$ to 60$ per visit. If you lose the whole thing, better luck next time. Your total bankroll should be 10 times your daily limit. If you lose that total, make sure you are doing things right before putting more money in.
 Also note you are playing a card game. This does mean you can do everything right and still lose. So understand it. it Will happen.
 Did you do the right thing, yes/no. Be hard on yourself. Learn from your mistakes.

 While in college try to eat inexpensively and not eat out too much. Remember that fast food restaurants are not cheaper than the grocery store and look after your health by eating well.
 Most colleges require those who live on campus to buy a meal plan. Use to-go boxes to take food from dining halls to eat later, especially if it can be stored easily.
 Keep them simple. A potluck with friends can be just as fun or more fun than eating at a noisy, crowded restaurant.
 By doing so, you avoid having to pay for gas, maintenance, or parking. Plus, not bring a car keeps you closer to campus. Instead, use cheaper modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation. This is easier to do in more urban cities

, Used or rental books are cheaper than new. Compare prices those from Chegg, Amazon, and your school bookstore. Or, you can buy or share books with a friend. Sell back used textbooks after you are done with them.
 Try to pick apartments that include appliances. Unlike on-campus dorms, off-campus housing are usually cheaper (depending on the city) and don't require you to buy a meal plan. Just make sure that you don't live too far from campus and factor in grocery cost

, Stock up on storable "dorm food" that don't require appliances such as cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, granola bars,Ramen noodles, crackers, peanut butter or hazelnut spread. Save even more money by taking some food, drinks, or condiments to-go from dining halls.
 Check your university's housing options and rates. Doubles-rooms are usually cheaper than single or suite-style, but also means less room and privacy. Weigh pros and cons before choosing.

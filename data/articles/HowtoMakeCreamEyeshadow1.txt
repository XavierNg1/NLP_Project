 The jar needs to be small enough to fit ½ to 1 teaspoon of fluid. You don't want the jar to be so large that your eyeshadow sits in a small heap at the bottom. If the jar is too big, your cream eyeshadow may dry out. Here are some options to give you ideas:


Clean contact lens cases
Tiny, plastic paint jars (found at an arts and crafts shop)
Makeup jars (found online or at a beauty supply shop);
, Wash everything with soap and water, then dry it off using a paper towel. If your tools are not clean, you risk contaminating your eyeshadow. Contaminated eyeshadow can lead to serious infections.
 Try to get about ¼ teaspoon of eyeshadow. You can use all one color, or mix two or more colors together to create a custom shade.









You can also use cosmetic pigment powders, which you can find in a beauty shop or online.
 Use a toothpick or the base of a spoon to do this. Make sure that the powder is very fine and that there are not lumps or chunks. If you leave any lumps or chunks, the eyeshadow will turn out grainy.
 Make sure that you are using a lotion that is safe for use around eyes. If you are not sure, check the ingredient label against an eye cream. If you see something there that is not in your eye cream, avoid using it.You can also use Vaseline or lip balm., There should be no lumps or clumps. The color should be even, with no streaks of color.
 If the eyeshadow is too dry, add some more lotion. If the lotion is too creamy, add some more eyeshadow.

 These are basic, inexpensive frames made of wood for mounting a canvas. For a little more money you can purchase an aluminum frame that will last longer, as repeated washing will warp a wooden canvas.Many art stores now sell pre-made silk screens as well, so you could purchase a standard screen if you don't want to make a custom one.
Ensure that your frame is big enough for your design. If you don't know your design yet, or want a versatile frame for multiple designs, aim for 12x18" at the minimum.;
, You want a nice, fine mesh that allows the ink to pass onto the shirt, paper, or design. Mesh-count measures how loose or tight the mesh is, where higher numbers indicate a tighter mesh. The tighter the mesh, the more intricate your details can be. Mesh count is the number of threads in one square inch.


For the classic "athletic" or collegiate print that looks worn/speckled, aim for a loose 85 mesh count.
For a "do-it-all" mesh, aim for 110-130 mesh count.
For paper or plastic printing, go for a mesh count near 200-250.
In general, lighter colored objects work best with higher mesh counts. So if you're doing white paper, aim from 230-250., Make sure you pull the screen tight before you start stapling. You want it to be as taut as possible without ripping. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple around the wood every 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm.).


You will likely need an electric staple gun to securely adhere the mesh.You can also use framing nails.

If you want to retain a bit of length without too much work, cut off lock 1-2" from the scalp. The remaining hair should be relatively easy to untangle and comb out.
If you wish to keep more than an inch or two of hair, see the method below for combing out dreadlocks.;
, If you are not planning to shave your head, you should also condition your remaining hair with a leave-in or hot oil conditioning treatment., You can either keep going and shave off the rest of your hair, or comb out what is left.


Option 1: Shave your head using clippers, or shaving cream and a razor. Be careful not to cut yourself!
Option 2: Once the remaining hair has been thoroughly conditioned, comb out the tangles using a sturdy comb and a detangling spray, conditioner, or oil.

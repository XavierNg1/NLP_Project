 Apply one coat of mascara and let it dry. Then, dip a cotton swab or Q-tip and dust the tops and bottoms of your lashes. Put one more coat of mascara over top of the baby powder to return it to black and nearly double the length of your lashes.You should have enough baby powder on that your lashes look ashy and gray.
Clean your wand in between dipping it in baby powder and mascara to avoid clumping.
Have an extra mascara wand on hand for the baby powder so you donâ€™t contaminate your tube. You can clean off an old wand and reuse it.
 Natural oils are healthy for your skin and lashes. Apply either almond oil, extra virgin olive oil, coconut, or jojoba oil to your eyes at night before you go to bed. These are natural moisturizers that will heal any damaged lashes but will also help them to grow.Dabbing coconut oil on to your lashes will darken them and is a perfect time-saver in the morning if you run out of time for your normal makeup routine.
Vaseline is a classic beauty shortcut that can also help your lashes. Apply it at night just as you would the other oils.You can also use an old wand to paint the oils onto your lashes if you want to be precise.
 You can naturally coax your lashes to grow longer. Use your fingertips to lightly massage near the roots of your lashes in circles. This encourages the hair follicles to grow stronger and longer. Pair your massage with natural oils for a before-bed, lash-lengthening routine.

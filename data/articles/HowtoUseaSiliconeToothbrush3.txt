 There are a few different types of silicone toothbrushes you can use for a baby. You can find a regular handheld toothbrush, an electric toothbrush, or a “finger brush” that slides over the index finger. You may want to start out with a finger toothbrush and then move on to a regular toothbrush as your baby grows and more teeth come in.You should start brushing a baby’s teeth when the first tooth comes in.
 Babies and very small children can play with the toothbrush, but brushing is most effective when performed by an adult. Begin by massaging the gums with the silicone toothbrush. Then, use a toothpaste with fluoride and gently brush your baby’s teeth for about two minutes, depending on how many teeth they have.A pea-sized amount of toothbrush is ideal.
 Rinse the toothbrush off after every use. Boil the toothbrush, or it run through a dishwashing cycle to sterilize. You should sterilize the toothbrush after use when your child is sick, or for a deep cleaning every couple of weeks.

 The heat will soften it up and accelerate the break-in process.


Use this method in moderation and at your own risk. Most glove manufacturers say that you should never put a glove in an oven or microwave. Excessive heat will dry out a glove too much (or even destroy it by making it hard). Too much heat may turn the glove more flexible at first but ultimately render it too hard to use.
 Anything longer than that is going to cook your glove. You can tell the glove is ready when it smells like a steak cooking.
 Throw the ball into the glove as hard as possible to help form the pocket to your liking. Your glove should start feeling softer and be much easier to play with.

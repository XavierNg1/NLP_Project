 Scaling and polishing treatments can be done every six months by your dentist to heal and prevent gum disease.


This is a procedure where the plaque and tartar deposits are removed from your teeth with the help of an ultrasonic cleaning instrument or sometimes with hand instruments.
Scaling itself shows dramatic improvement in the health of the gums. Polishing helps to remove any superficial stains and make the tooth surface smooth. This slows down the build-up of plaque on your teeth, preventing future gum disease., Root planing is a procedure where the surface of the tooth root is cleaned by deep scaling, using specialized instruments.


Bacteria on the root of the tooth is removed and the root surface is debrided to provide a fresh new surface available for the reattachment of the gums.Local anesthesia may be required to carry out this procedure.
 Flap surgery is done in advanced cases of gum disease (such as periodontal disease), especially when several teeth are involved.


Under local anesthesia, a gum flap is raised and the tooth surface is cleaned to remove bacteria and infected tissue. Bone graft is placed wherever the bone loss is significant and the flap is sewed back into place. Sometimes a soft tissue graft will also be necessary or the bone surface will need to be reshaped to prevent easy growth of bacteria.
Following the surgery, a dressing is placed over the wound and the patient is asked to return after a week for removal of the sutures/dressing.
Antibiotics like amoxicillin /doxycycline may be prescribed along with some painkillers like ibuprofen/crocin etc.

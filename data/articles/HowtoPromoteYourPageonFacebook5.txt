 Visit the Facebook website on a new web browser tab or window. Enter your email address and password at the top right corner of the page to log into your Facebook account. You will be directed to your personal account’s News Feed page.
 All the Pages you manage are listed on the left side of the home page. Take your mouse and click the Page name to go to its Timeline.
 On the Page’s Timeline is a small text box with word hint “What have you been up to.” Click inside that box and write the details of the competition. For instance, let followers know the details of the competition (e.g., what it is for), the prize to be won, how to participate, and the period of the competition.


An example of a competition would be asking your followers to tag photos on your Page and then share with friends. The photo that gets the most likes gets to win something.
 Underneath the box mentioned above is a bluish “Post” button. Click on that button to have your competition published to your followers.

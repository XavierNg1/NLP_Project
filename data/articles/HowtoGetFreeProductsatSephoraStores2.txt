 Sephora’s website offers all of the products they have in their stores. Of course, you won’t be able to smell the perfumes or feel the products on your skin. However, the website offers some exclusive deals that you won’t see in the store., This page contains a long list of coupons and promotions to help you get free products. It can be difficult to locate this page from the Sephora homepage. If you can’t find it, simply type “beauty deals” into the search bar., Most deals have a promo code that you’ll need to enter at checkout. Many deals are only for “Beauty Insiders”, so you may need to register before you can take advantage of them. Registering as a Beauty Insider is free and easy, so it’s worth it if you want to get the deal.Unlike shopping in the store, you always have to buy something in order to get something for free online.
Take note of the deals you want. If they require a promo code, write down that deal's promo code. You'll need to enter it at checkout.
 Some deals require that you purchase specific items. For example, a certain brand might offer a free clutch if you purchase a bottle of their perfume.

Make sure to fill your cart with the right items to be able to get the deal., Click the link toward the top of the page that says “3 Free Samples.” There will be a long list of items that you can request.

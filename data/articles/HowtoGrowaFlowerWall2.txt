 This can be an existing shoe bag that you no longer want or you can purchase a new or used one. The only requirement is that it be a cloth one, as all-plastic ones will likely heat the flower roots too much and could kill them during warmer weather periods.
 It will need to be at least as wide as the shoe bag.
 Either place two hooks on the wall at the same space across as the shoe bag hanger holes are, or knock in two nails. Whatever you use, it must be solid and strong because once you add soil to the shoe bag, it'll be hanging heavily.
 Adjust if necessary to ensure that it is sitting straight and taut.
 Old grocery plastic bags or freezer bags are ideal.
 Add any well-rotted manure or compost, or other fertilizer to help the flowers grow well.
 Continue until the whole shoe bag is filled with flowers.
 Water regularly but gently, so as to not over water the plants. Mulch to keep the soil moist. It can also help to add a saturating aid to the soil, to evenly distribute and retain the water.
 Consider using other items you don't need anymore to make a flower wall, such as cloth bags, stitched up denim shorts or jeans, etc.

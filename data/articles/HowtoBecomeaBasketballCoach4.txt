 In practice, you likely made note of the five-player unit that worked together the best. Getting off to a fast start is important in basketball, so make sure you have the optimum lineup on the floor for the opening tip. You can tinker with it as the game progresses.
 Some days, a player just doesn’t play well. Other times, certain players tire more quickly than usual. Keep an eye on these developments and adjust accordingly. If your best shooter misses his or her first 7 attempts, try having someone else take the shots. If your center looks gassed running up and down the court, give a quick hook and get him or her a breather.
 You’re probably going to be talking to your players a lot over the course of the game, so make sure everyone can hear you, especially when the action takes place on the far end of the court. Leave no doubt as to what you want your players to do.
 If you’re winning late, run longer possessions to chew time off the clock. If you’re behind late, quicken the offensive tempo and try to score quick baskets. If you have a one-sided lead, give all of your players a chance to see the floor (something you should be doing regardless of the score if you’re coaching in a non-competitive league). Tighten the defense on players who are making a lot of shots. Get the ball to your hot shooters. Adjust appropriately to any situation, and you’ll increase your chances of success.

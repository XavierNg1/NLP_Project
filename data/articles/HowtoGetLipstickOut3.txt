 If there are any clumps of lipstick, take a plastic knife or spoon to remove them. Try not to spread them over the upholstery as you do this.
 Apply some toothpaste to the clean cloth and rub it around so that it’s evenly spread over an inch of the cloth. You can use any toothpaste that you have handy.
 Using the cloth, toothpaste side down, begin scrubbing. Add toothpaste if you notice that it has spread too thin. As you scrub, you’ll see the stain gradually begin to lift off of the furniture and onto the cloth.
 Once the lipstick coloring has come off of your upholstery, you may have some left over toothpaste. Simply wet the area and wipe it down. You may have to do this a couple times to get rid of the remaining toothpaste, but it will leave you with clean upholstery.

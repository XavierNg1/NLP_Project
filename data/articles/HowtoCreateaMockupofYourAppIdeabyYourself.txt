, This is to get the best out of your app and know all it’s pros and cons inside out. Therefore, describe the target demographic of your app, your potential customers.
 If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand pictures. Add description and demonstration of the functionality, layout and flow of your app.
 Needless to say this method is convenient but at the stake of your precious time. To save your time create your app screens on a Prototyping tool and see the change. There are several tools available for prototyping such as Fluid UI and Proto.io. The below steps have been written for Proto.io.
 Make your screens with the native UI elements available, but don’t add any interactions yet. Just re­create what you did on paper. You will be able to drag and drop UI items like title bars, menus, lists and images on the canvas of each screen. They are redesigned at their default size according to the specs of the mobile OS manufacturer (Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android, Windows, etc.) so you will not have to worry about sizing, how much space each element consumes on the screen, and so on.
 This would help you to improve your user experience. You can easily add interactions on UI items on your canvas, or just add interaction areas on top of your UI items and modify your design elements as you go along. After the designing and the flow of your app has been set, iterate your app at a regular basis as your original ideas would definitely need improvements. This is the best part of Proto.io that allows you to make changes now and then according to the user experience.

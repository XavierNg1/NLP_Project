 Get together a picnic and spend the day in your local park! Take a camera with you to capture your fun day out.;
, Not only will you meet new people, you will become fitter and healthier too!

, Go into town with your friends and go shopping!

, If you can't afford to go shopping, go window shopping! Just go to look, and try on the most ridiculous outfits you can find!

, Try something new with your make-up and wardrobe and see how you like it!

, Pitch a tent in the garden and sleep outside! Or if you are brave enough, sleep out under the stars, just you, your friends and your duvets.
 If you live in the countryside, go for a long walk, you may discover somewhere new to go! if you live i the city, be adventurous, just go anywhere and everywhere!

, (Unless it's miles and miles away) See where you end up!!

, Find a cheap concert or festival and just enjoy yourself!!

, Get them to bring all their old or unwanted clothes, and swap, a whole new wardrobe, for free!!

, Whenever you look back through the scrapbook, the good times will come flooding back!!

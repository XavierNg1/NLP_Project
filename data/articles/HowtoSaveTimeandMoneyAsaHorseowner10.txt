 People are more likely to take it away if it's bagged, but you probably won't be paid for it.
 This involves some maintenance, but the resulting compost will be in high demand, and you could even sell the resulting compost.
 They will probably have the equipment to collect it directly from the heap. The older the manure, the more demand there will be.
 With less room manure will have to be bagged and at least partly composted (3 months - 6 months is best) to sell or give it to allotments. If you have a car, you can offer to deliver it to them for a fee.
 If the land is used to graze horses it must first be composted to kill any parasites, but this is the best way to manage your muck heap as it will also save on fertiliser costs.
 This is expensive and wasteful, but removes the need to handle and dispose of it, and is necessary in some areas.
 This is an effective and cheap way of getting rid of manure, but it is wasteful, polluting and illegal in some areas.

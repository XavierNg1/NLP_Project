 It's very simple and easy and especially quick. (If you find any Lapis Lazuli on your way digging down, consider yourself extremely lucky)! (Sorry for no pictures, I forgot my account password).;

The first choice is to simply place ladders to get back up to the top (note this will make future steps harder)

,, Bedrock is level 0. You want to get to the 17th to 19th levels. Build corridors going left, right and forwards. Backwards is optional so do it if you can. (This is why the ladder choice is harder).


You should find the Lapis Lazuli after half an hour or so. If you don't know what it looks like just type in "Lapis Lazuli ore in minecraft" on google images. It is an ore with many dark blue spots on it. Not light blue because that's diamond.

 The animals that prey on earwigs will help reduce the population and keep it under control. This means making your garden of interest to birds or toads, by having food sources (plants they like, etc.) and shelter opportunities.


Attract toads by allowing plants near your house but not adjacent to your house to grow wild. Or place some bricks on the ground, lay boards across them and put plants across the boards. Either of these steps will create a shady environment for toads.
Draw birds in by putting out a bird feeder or nest boxes. Plant bushes and trees that supply berries, etc. that you know for sure the local birds like. Birds may also visit a clean bird bath.

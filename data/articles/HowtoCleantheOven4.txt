 If you're cooking something messy, place a baking sheet on the rack below it to catch grease and food spills.
 When something does bubble over onto your oven floor, you can begin the cleaning process even while your food is still cooking.


Sprinkle salt over the affected area, then close the oven door and finish cooking your food.
After you remove the food and turn off the oven, wipe up the spill immediately with a damp sponge.
Use a half-vinegar half-water solution for tougher messes.

 If the damage is to the tip top alone (broken or grooved guide ring), you can simply replace the tip top with a new one. If the damage is to the rod blank at the tip, you'll have to cut the rod tip cleanly as close to the end as you can.
 If you didn't have to cut the rod to remove the old tip top, you can remove it by applying heat to the glue holding it onto the rod tip and twisting gently to remove it. If the tip won't come off, you'll have to cut the rod at the end of the tip top as though the rod itself had broken there.


Avoid using too much heat, or you might damage the rod tip itself.
 You'll need a tip gauge, which is a card or piece of metal with holes. Insert the rod through each hole until you get a tight fit; whichever gauge size that hole is will be the size of tip top you need.
 Apply the glue to the rod tip, then affix the new tip top, gently twisting it into place so that it lines up with the other rod guides.


As the tip top guide is more prone to wear than the other guides, if you have to replace the tip top, you should get a replacement with a guide ring of either tungsten carbide or aluminum oxide, both of which are more resistant to grooving than steel. They are more susceptible to side impact damage (crushing), however.

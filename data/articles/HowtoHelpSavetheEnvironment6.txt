 Visit thrift stores and consignment shops to find secondhand clothes and other items.
 Instead of throwing away items, consider giving them away. Donate usable clothes and household items to charity. Many organizations will send a truck for pickup.


Craigslist.org is another useful resource for buying, selling, and giving away used items locally.
 Turn useless junk into something fun and cute, or fresh and funky. Make jewelry, household accessories, and restyled clothing from things you already own. Look around wikiHow to find tons of articles about how to make different things.
 Bring them with you whenever you go shopping. Many communities have banned stores from giving out plastic bags, but even if your community still allows them, move to using reusable bags instead.

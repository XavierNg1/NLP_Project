 After being sterilized for the first use, bottle nipples can be cleaned with dish soap after each use. The only exception is if you live in an area with contaminated water or water that comes from a well. Otherwise, pediatricians believe warm water and soap sufficiently clean the bottle nips after the initial sterilization to give the nipple a fresh start.Dish soap is the best cleaner for everyday use. Avoid using harsh chemicals, such as undiluted bleach, because they can be harmful to your baby and can break down the bottle nipple materials, causing it to not work as effectively., Simple, everyday cleaning can make a big difference in your child’s bottle experience. Cleaning the bottle nipple after each use is much easier and safer than risking mold growing in dirty bottle nipples.
 Fill the sink with hot water and mild dish soap. Rinse the nipple and allow it to soak for five minutes. Use a sponge or the nipple cleaning attachment of a bottle brush (available at baby stores) to get into the folds of the nipple.
, Bottle nipple cleaning is fairly simple and doesn’t need to be pushed beyond the basic instructions. A general rule is to be gentle about how you clean the nipple. If there is food residue on the nipple, let it soak and gently rinse it off instead of scrubbing vigorously.


Scrubbing too hard can hurt the nipple and stop it from performing like it should by interrupting the flow from the bottle, which makes it harder for your baby to drink.
 Drying racks are effective and can be beneficial, but aren’t a necessity for drying bottle accessories.
 Mold is a dark substance that doesn’t easily come off a surface. You may be able to recognize bits of food from the dishwasher as things you’ve eaten recently, but mold sticks around for a while. It also tends to be porous and has soft edges that can grow quickly.


If you notice mold or other substances growing in the bottle nipple, throw it away and start with a new nipple.

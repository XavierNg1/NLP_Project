 Goriyas in this game are different from other versions. Instead of randomly walking or throwing boomerangs at you, there are two types of Goriyas that reflect the movements of your character: a green Goriya and a red one. Once you encounter a Goriya, stop moving and study the environment your character is at.
 Goriyas will do the opposite of your movementâ€”that is, if you go one direction (left, right, up, or down), they go the other way, respectively. Move around the floor so that the Goriyas stops in your line of sight.
 Once the Goriyas are in your line of sight, equip your bow and shoot an arrow at the monster to kill it.


Green Goriyas do not attack, but red Goriyas will throw a fireball at you once you get into its line of sight. Swiftly shoot an arrow at the red monster once it falls into your line to quickly kill it before it can fire at you.
If you manage to get close enough with a Goriya, you can just use your sword to kill the monster.

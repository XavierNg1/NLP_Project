 After your purslane is harvested, put it in a plastic bag and insert it into your refrigerator. This will keep the purslane good for about a week. Be sure to wash the plant before eating, especially if it has been foraged.

If a refrigerator is unavailable, store the purslane in a cooler bag or similar container. This will keep the purslane fresh for several days., Transfer harvested purslane to a colander. Rinse the plant under a stream of clean, cold water. Shake excess moisture from the cleaned purslane, pat it dry with paper towel or a clean dishcloth, and itâ€™s ready to eat.While rinsing, use your clean hands to spread the leaves to ensure bugs and dirt have been removed.
 When the purslane is clean and completely dry, put it in a freezer bag. Excess moisture may cause freezer burn or worsen the quality of purslane once it is thawed. Write the date on the bag, store it in your freezer, and use it within a year., Once your purslane is clean, remove the leaves from the stems and spread the leaves in a thin layer on a baking sheet. Set your oven to its lowest setting and insert the sheet. When the purslane becomes brittle, it's finished.

Keep a close eye on purslane while in the oven to prevent it from burning. Handle the hot baking sheet with an oven mitt or potholder when removing it from the oven.
Dried purslane can be kept as whole leaves, crushed, or powdered. To crush or powder the leaves, pulse them on a low setting with a blender or food processor until the desired fineness is achieved.
You can add purslane to smoothies or sprinkle it in with other recipes to add some extra nutritional value. Powdered purslane can also be used as a thickener.

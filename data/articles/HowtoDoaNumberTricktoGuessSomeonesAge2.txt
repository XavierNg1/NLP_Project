 For the sake of this example, let’s say the person is 35 years old. They can use a calculator or scratch paper for this. Let the person know that they must hit the equal (=) button after each instruction you give.Example: 5 x 3 = 15.



Example: 15 + 3 = 18.



Example: 18 x 2 = 36.



Example: 36 + 5 = 41.
 The answer will be their current age.Example: 41 – 6 = 35.

 Use a vegetable scrubber and wash the potatoes.;
, Leaving the skin on, use a hand grate and grate the potatoes on paper towels. You can use a food processor if you want thicker pieces.
 Drain or remove as much moisture you can from the potatoes to achieve crispier hashbrowns.
 Mix the grated potatoes and salt in a large bowl.
 Brush the vegetable oil lightly around the waffle iron and preheat it.
 Add 1 1/2 cups of the potato mixture in the waffle iron. Cook for about 15 minutes, or the desired crispiness of your liking.
 Enjoy this with eggs, toast, or your favorite meat.

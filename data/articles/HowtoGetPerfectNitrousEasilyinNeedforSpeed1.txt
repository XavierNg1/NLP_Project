 Do this by double-clicking its icon on the desktop, if you have it installed there, or by clicking its icon on the Start Menu.;
, Once the pre-game cinematics have played, press Enter. This will take you to your NFS Rivals Garage. On the Garage menu, choose the first option, “Exit Garage.” This will exit you from the Garage, and show you a map of Redview County, the fictional location where the game’s story is set.


Press Enter to enter the racing world—the streets and roads of Redview County. A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm the action. Press Enter again to confirm.
 Once you are in the racing world, drive your car using W to accelerate, S to brake/reverse, and the Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left or right, respectively.
 As you drive, use the minimap on the bottom left corner of the screen to find a straight section of the road.
 Once you are at the beginning of the straight section, press and hold Spacebar while still accelerating to start using up your Nitrous. The amount of Nitrous you have left will be displayed in a dial marked “Nitrous” at the bottom right corner of the screen.


If you manage to deplete a full bar of Nitrous without smashing into any objects or other cars on the road, you will have recorded a Perfect Nitrous. A notification confirming this will flash in the top part of the screen, right below where your Speed Points tally is displayed.
To avoid hitting other cars or objects, press the Left and Right Arrow keys very subtly each time you need to switch lanes. Turning too sharply at such a high speed will cause you to spin out and crash.
If you hit an object/car before you are able to record your Perfect Nitrous, wait for the Nitrous dial to refill again, and then repeat steps 4 and 5 to try again.

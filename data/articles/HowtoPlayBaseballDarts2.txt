 In each inning, the player throws three darts. As you throw the darts, aim for the number that corresponds with the inning. Also, keep in mind you get more runs if you get your darts inside of the rings of the dart board. Aim for the rings as well., At the end of each turn, add up your score. As the innings progress, add your scores together. For example, say you scored 5 runs in the first inning and a 2 runs in the second. By the end of the second inning, you have 7 runs. Keep adding runs to your total score as you go. Whoever has the most runs after 9 rounds wins., Some people like to play with a special "7 inning stretch rule." Players who do not score any runs in the 7th inning will have their total score cut in half. This can make the game more fun as it adds some tension. However, if you and your friends are new to the game this may only add frustration. It can take awhile to aim and throw darts correctly, making scores very low when beginners are playing baseball darts. The 7th inning rule is best used for more proficient players.

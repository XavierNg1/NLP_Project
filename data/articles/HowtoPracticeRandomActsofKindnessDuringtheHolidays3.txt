 Go out there and drop random acts of kindness in the biggest possible way you can during the winter for your neighbors.
 Occasionally see how they are doing when the temperatures drop. Help them with any house decorations, especially if it requires something above their heads.
 Create small mix jars of holiday ingredients, such as hot cocoa, gingerbread cookie mix, or peppermint mixes with a list of additional ingredients they may need and directions.
 Help firefighters by "adopting" a nearby fire hydrant and clear an easy access to it after it snows.

 Will all the the clothes you are planning to take fit?

,, Try to lay them flat, next to each other.
 Try to buy small bottles of your preferred products or put small quantities into clear bottles. Your underwear - items like this can be stuffed into socks and it doesn't matter if they get creased. Swimming costume - You can roll this up into a little corner, if required, as it does not crease easy. You should consider taking two costumes. Pyjamas - one pair should do and you should really only need a pair of shorts and tee.
 You will need around seven outfits. Choose first from your "you must take" pile and working down to the "you could live without" pile. You don't have to take your whole wardrobe with you! Fold articles of clothing into squares, ironed. You may not need full outfits if you are on a beach holiday - mix and match shorts and tees will be good enough for lounging, and you can re-use outfits of a night-time.
, These items should be things required on a plane journey or immediately as you get into your new country. For example, pack a book to keep you entertained; a cap to keep your head protected on arrival; sunglasses to prevent glare; something to eat on the plane to save purchasing something; a bit of money in your destination's country.
 You want something comfortable and cool, that still looks smart.
 Enjoy your relaxation time.

 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Spray a 9 x 5-inch (23 x 13-cm) loaf pan with cooking spray. This will prevent the bread from sticking to the pan., Measure all of the dry ingredients into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together for about 30 seconds, so they're incorporated. You'll need:2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour
1/2 cup (100 g) white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

, Melt 1/4 cup (56 g) of unsalted butter in a separate mixing bowl. Add 1 cup (240 ml) of buttermilk and 1 large egg. Whisk the wet mixture until the egg is well mixed.If you don't want to use butter, you can substitute the same amount of olive or vegetable oil.
 Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula to gently stir the mixtures together until they're just combined.If you'll be adding optional flavors, it's fine if there's still a little dry mixture in the dough.
 You can easily make sweet or savory flavored quick bread. Just stir the added flavors in until they're just combined, since you don't want to over-mix the dough. You can add up to 1 1/2 cups of mix-ins (like the dried fruits or nuts), or add seasonings and herbs according to your taste. Good options for quick bread include:Fruit: cranberries, dried cherries, apples, blueberries, orange zest, raisins

Nuts: walnuts, pecans, almonds

Herbs and spices: dill, pesto, caraway seeds, chili powder, garlic powder

Cheese: parmesan, cheddar

, Scoop the no-yeast quick bread dough into your prepared pan and put it in the preheated oven. Bake the bread for 45 to 50 minutes. To test if the bread is done, stick a toothpick into the center of the loaf. It should come out clean. Cool the loaf in the pan for 15 minutes. Then take the bread out and serve it.While the quick bread is best the same day it's baked, you can wrap it tightly and store it for a few days.

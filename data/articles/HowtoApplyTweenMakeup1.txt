 This includes mascara, a subtle eyeshadow that matches the color of your skin, lip gloss, concealer, and blush or bronzer. You can choose either lip gloss or lipstick, but please avoid using both. Keep in mind that lipstick lasts much longer and looks more sophisticated and subtle, while lip gloss is more moisturizing, but does not last as long. However, lip gloss is easier to slather on at school, whereas a compact mirror is often required for applying lipstick. Use eyeliner only if you feel that your eyes are a little too small, and that you would like to enhance their beauty.;
, Only apply taupe (This is the light sparkly brown), light pink, light purple, so basically pastels, lip gloss and, if you need it, foundation.
,, After,you add some taupe or brown on top of it.
 Lightly apply some on just your upper lashes. While applying mascara be very careful because if you rush, it may end up where you don't want it to poke your eye.
 Lip liner is a nice touch, but you do not need it.

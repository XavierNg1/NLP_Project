 While unfinished cigar boxes can be bought from many craft stores, you may be able to find them for free by asking at cigar stores, liquor stores, bars, or any place else that sells cigars. Make sure the box is not warped or damaged.

Use only wooden cigar boxes or other wooden craft boxes, which are available at most craft stores, some discount or hardware stores, or from online craft sites. Do not use cardboard cigar boxes, as these will not work well for this project.;
, Some cigar boxes may have stickers or labels; the glue can be removed with a clean cloth and nail polish remover. Fine-grade sandpaper, available at your local craft or hardware store, can smooth out any rough spots or remove any glue residue. Finally, coat the outside with polyurethane (available in aerosol spray or liquid form) and let it dry thoroughly., These will add a nice decorative touch and add stability to the purse, particularly if you plan on using it as a functional purse., You can purchase different types of purse handles from most craft stores, but you can also use drawer pulls or a small length of chain (available from craft or hardware stores) to create a regular or shoulder-length handle.

For a chain handle, you will need to attach 2 eyelet hooks to the box (you should be able to screw these in by hand) and attach the chain with pliers by bending one of the links slightly to slip it through the eyelet.
 Clasps and different metal closures can be purchased from a craft or hardware store; you might want a sturdier clasp if you plan to use the purse as more than a decorative item., Your cigar box purse can be as simple or as ornate as you like, so it's useful to gather some ideas before you begin decorating.

You can use anything from favorite photos or pictures to jewelry, beads, or buttons to decorate your cigar box purse. You can either purchase decorative items from your local craft store or use what you have already have handy for decorations your cigar box purse.
A decorative theme is a great idea if the cigar box purse is to be a gift. You may fit the theme to the recipient's favorite hobby, such as stamp collecting or bingo, or you might decorate it with a holiday theme for Christmas or Mother's Day.
 This will protect your design from scratches and preserve the decorations longer. Allow your cigar box purse to dry thoroughly, according to the directions on the package., You can line the purse with cloth, felt, or any type of fabric that you like. The lining must be cut ï¿½ inch (6.25 mm) longer than the box on each side; either measure carefully or place the box on the lining and use it as a template, cutting an extra length of fabric all around. Turn this extra length in to create a hem and use a warm iron to set the hem. You can then sew the hem or secure it with fabric glue. Use craft glue or a craft glue gun to secure the lining inside the box.

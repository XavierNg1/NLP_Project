 If you have over-plucked your brows in the past, or they simply grown in very sparse, work to make them thicker.









Apply Rogaine or another balding foam to your eyebrows. This will help to encourage new hair growth, giving you the fullness your brows need.
Pencil them in. Although you never want your eyebrows to look very obviously penciled, balding brows aren’t desired either. Use your brow pencil in soft, short strokes to gently fill in sparse patches. Avoid harsh lines which look very fake.
 Having eyebrows that don’t match your hair color is very common, especially if you have light hair. To help even out your hair color, apply an eyebrow tint to darken them to a natural tone.









You can get an eyebrow tint done at local spas and salons, or you can buy a kit to do it yourself from a beauty supply store.
Be sure to apply it to your entire eyebrow and let it sit for the right amount of time so that the tint is effective.
Tint is not as strong as straight-up hair dye, and will rinse out over time. If you have an accident and need to remove the tint however, you can use nail polish remover on a q-tip to gently wipe it off.
 Whether from a salon accident or genetics, sometimes uneven or misshapen eyebrows come up. To fix them, it is very important to let them grow in. Hands off your tweezers for at least three weeks!


Your hair grows in stages, so waiting at least three weeks will give enough time for hair at every stage to grow in.
Create a very clear shape, and stick to it. Be careful about getting absorbed looking at your eyebrows close-up without seeing the big picture. Take a step back from the mirror occasionally to check that your shape is in line.
Don’t change the shape of your brow often. This will make it look odd over time. Stick with one, natural looking shape and maintain it.

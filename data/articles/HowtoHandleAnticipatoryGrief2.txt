 If you know your time is limited, reflect on how to create meaningful experiences with your loved one. Do activities or have discussions that are meaningful to both of you. Go to places that are special to you or bring items that evoke pleasant memories.Be open and honest about what the person is going through. May people are too afraid to bring up the subject of death with someone who is dying, and it may be a relief to them to talk about it openly. Ask how they are dealing with the process.
If you need to cover logistical conversations, have those, too. Don’t spend all of your time discussing advance directives or funeral plans, but do have these discussions to make sure you respect your loved one’s wishes.
 Spend time talking about the good memories you have together. Especially if it’s difficult to do activities with your loved one, talking about pleasant events and memories can fill both of you with positive feelings in this difficult time. Reflect on the meaningful times, funny times, and memorable moments.Even if your loved one has problems with memory due to Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, talking about positive memories can still be meaningful.
 If you know that loss is coming, it allows you time to say goodbye and even make amends if necessary. Make time to let your loved one know that you love them, appreciate them, and that their relationship was meaningful to you. Say “I’m sorry,” or, “I forgive you.” Say anything you need to say.If you feel like your loved one is holding on because others aren’t ready to let go, say that they can leave when they are ready.

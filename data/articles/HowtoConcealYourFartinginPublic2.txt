 You won’t be able to prove that someone else farted, but there are ways that you can raise suspicion that it was another person, not you.


Use the rule of three or more. This means that you should only let the fart out when you’re standing in a group of three or more people.
That’s because it will be easier to diffuse the blame and harder for people to tell who did it with a larger group. The key here is to let out the fart as silently as you can. You could blame someone directly or just indicate you’re disgusted by the smell and question who did it.
Don’t react until others start to do so, though. When you see them sniffing the area and starting to realize someone has farted, that’s your chance. Act disgusted by the smell, and point it out only after someone else has started to do so. If you blame another person too fast you might identify yourself as the farter following the old adage “whomever smelt it, dealt it.”

, This might sound terrible, but if you want people to think the farter was someone else, choose the right person to stand near.


For example, babies and toddlers can’t talk to deny they did it, and most people wouldn’t be surprised if a baby or toddler let out a little gas.
A person who is dressed in dirty clothing or who doesn’t always have the best hygiene would be another good choice.
Senior citizens and pets can also make good patsies, but it’s really not very nice to blame grandma for something you did.
 You might actually gain points if you just confess, and admit that you’re the one who stunk up the room.


Apologize and then act as if it’s a normal thing to do. People will probably laugh or act a little uncomfortable, and then they will forget it.
You could refer to a cartoon character like Peter Griffin in the Family Guy, who has been known to fart in public before.
Just say, “Yeah, yeah, it was me. I’m really sorry. I tried to stop it, but it clearly didn’t work.” Almost everyone can relate. We’ve all been there.

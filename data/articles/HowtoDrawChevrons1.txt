, This should form a series of squares resembling a chess board.
 However, leave the topmost and leftmost side undivided (leaving them as rectangles).
 Do this by tracing lines connecting the low-left corner to the top-right corner, then diagonally down to where the squares intersect, then diagonally up again to the next corner, and so forth. You should see right triangles being formed.


It is helpful if you utilize these little squares to form your pattern.
, Remove the vertical lines B, D, F and so forth, following this pattern of alternating erasures.
 By now you would have chevrons pointing upward.
 If you desire to have a continuous zigzag pattern of chevrons, remove all vertical and horizontal lines.


Alternately color in-between zigzag lines.

 Go to the application called "Mii Maker" and select "Create a new Mii."


From here, you can choose to take a picture and make a Mii based on it (select "create from photo"), or you can start from scratch. Select one, and the 3DS will explain how to create a Mii from there.
If you select "start from scratch", you will be given a "starter" Mii that you can edit and change to meet your requirements. You can change the face, hair, eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, height, width, and extras (mustache, beard, glasses, sunglasses, and even a mole).
If you select "create from photo" you will be asked to select gender, skin tone, eye color, hair color, and hair style. Then, you take the picture according to the guidelines that the 3DS shows you. Once the photo is taken, the Mii gets a box encasing its head with the picture on it, and when it takes the box off (after struggling for a while), you have your Mii! From there, you chose a face from a variety, and edit it the same way you edit a "start from scratch" Mii.;
, A screen pops up that says, "What do you Want To Connect To?" If you want to send a Mii from the 3DS to the Wii, select Mii Channel. If you want to download a Mii from the Wii onto your 3DS, select Mii Maker.

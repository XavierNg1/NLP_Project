 Find some and set it up in the fire pit, in readiness for burning. Also have a pile of kindling and wood fuel ready to throw on the fire progressively, as the fire takes hold properly.
 This wood serves as the base board.
 It might be a strong stick or whittled down branch; old fence posts, chair legs, etc. might work too.
 Do this faster and faster; eventually the friction will produce a tinder, and this will ignite your pre-made pile of tinder.

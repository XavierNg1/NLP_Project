Create a new Flash file by selecting "New" from the File menu.
Draw a menu shape that is large enough to allow all of your buttons to fit inside. This shape will decide the layout of your menu, so if you want to create a side menu bar you may want to create a tall vertical rectangle so your buttons can be listed inside.
Go to "Window" in the top menu and click on "Library" to see your Flash Library.
Drag your buttons from the Flash Library and place them within the menu shape. Put the buttons in the order in which you want them to appear in your Flash menu.

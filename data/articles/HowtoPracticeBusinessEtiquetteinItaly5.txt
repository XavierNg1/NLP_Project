 It is simply a reflection of the accepted Italian way of discussing and sharing information, which includes speaking a lot and making a point loudly to ensure it is actually getting across.Italian business people will be loud to be heard over others and it isn't considered rude or demeaning.


Avoid seeming too reserved or detached; a lack of enthusiasm may be interpreted by any unwillingness to engage excitedly in the discussions., Italian meetings are not dominated by the agenda; indeed, there may not even be an agenda.It can feel rather chaotic to you if you're used to itemizing meetings but it works for the Italians, so you need to go with the flow.


Interruptions are normal, as is expecting anyone around the table to have a say in the meeting as they wish.
Side conversations are commonplace, so are comings and goings.
 Italian business people will negotiate price and delivery times. Make sure you are up to the task and will manage to get a good deal. As with any business, knowing what you want from the meeting before attending it, sets you in the best stead.


Most decisions will be based on how you present ideas rather than facts. Make sure that your delivery of ideas is perfect. If you need to practice this beforehand, then do so. And visual aids can also help, such as graphs, diagrams, photos, short films, etc. but don't make anything too formal, as that is not the Italian way.
Be prepared to be persuasive. Persuading and debating are art forms in Italian culture and are considered to be part of the business dealings.

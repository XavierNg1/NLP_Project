 A quick online search for “verify social security number” will generate many responses for private companies with names like SpyFly.com, records.com, usatrace.com, and many others. These companies are generally not affiliated with the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Homeland Security, Social Security Administration, or any other branch of the government, and do not give verifiable, official results. You are not required to be an employer or have any particular authorization to be able to use their services.


Employers who are verifying social security numbers for official purposes should limit their searches to the authorized, governmental sites. This method is for more personal inquiries or private searches.
You will likely find verification services offered by the major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, TransUnion or Experian.Agencies like these are able to check your social security number using the Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification System (CBNVS) discussed in the previous section of this article.
 You will usually be asked for an individual’s name, address (or at least state of residence), social security number, or whatever other information you know. The more information you can provide, the better and more accurate your results are likely to be.
 In many cases, you will have to pay a fee for the report or join a subscription with the company in order to see the results. Rates can vary from a few dollars up to $50 or more., Unofficial, non-governmental sites do not provide the same security and protection that the official sites do. You should be careful when giving out your social security number.

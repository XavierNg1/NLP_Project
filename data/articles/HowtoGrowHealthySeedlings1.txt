 Most plants benefit from a seedling stage. It provides them with the opportunity to grow in optimal conditions.;
, If you are raising seedlings from seed, make sure that the seeds are fresh and healthy. This ensures that the seedlings get an excellent start in life.
 Don't reuse seed-raising mix; that risks transferring plant diseases that can decimate your seedlings.
 This means:


Wash and sterilise all pots, planters, trays, etc. to be used unless they are new biodegradable trays (these can be obtained at nursery stores for a very low cost)
Wash down benches where you are handling the seedlings
Wash your own hands!

Animals, vehicles, toys, flowers and letters are good designs for a wooden mobile.
 These are a standard toy for most young children. If painting or varnishing these blocks, be sure to use non-toxic additions, as little mouths will often suck wooden blocks., Choose an animal such as a duck, a kangaroo or a dog and cut out the shape from wood. Attach wheels onto a stand, attach the shape to the stand and insert a hook at the front for the pull-string. Tie a pull-string on tightly. The item can be painted if wished.

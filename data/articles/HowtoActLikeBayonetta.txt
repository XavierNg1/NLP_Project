 Bayonetta makes funny things and has really good sense of humor.;
, But that doesn't mean you have to say something always. If you don't have anything smart to say, just be quiet.
 Bayonetta hates them very much, as you can see from her meeting with Cereza.
 When fighting the most powerful angels, Bayonetta is always cooled down. She never shows her fear, anger or any other feeling that person wants to see on its rival. Completely avoid that feeling because Bayonetta know that makes enemy feel stronger.
 Bayonetta's best friend and rival is Jeanne. Make a best friend that you sometimes fight but you still love her.
 Words like Let's rock baby! or "I'm sorry. I forgot to mention one of the reasons I hunt your kind. You're much too ugly not to put out of your misery." should work

, Except for your friends.
 Just stay cooled and try your best.
, Run very fast, but not sloppy.
 Like Bayonetta named Luka Cheshire or Cereza The little one

, Be a loner and avoid hanging out with your friends, only if you REALLY have to.
 That doesn't mean you have to be so strong that you can carry a truck with a little finger. Try to be on the same level of stamina and strength with boys or maybe stronger than them.
 Long black coat, tight jeans and feminine elegant boots could work.

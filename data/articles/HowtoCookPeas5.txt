 It would be a good idea to do this, even if you bought the peas packed.
 Place the peas into a strainer, and place then under cold, running water. Sift them with your hand and keep rinsing them until the water runs clear. Turn off the water and shake the beans to remove any excess water.
 The quickest way to soak them is to place them in a pot of water and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Cook them, uncovered, for 2 minutes, then cover the pot and remove from heat. Let the peas stand for 1Â½ to 2 hours. Do not add salt.Split peas do not need to be soaked., This will get rid of any indigestible sugars that can cause gas. Do not use this soaking water for cooking.
 Don't add any salt. How much water you use will depend on what type of peas you are cooking. Here are some basic guidelines:You will need 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water for each cup (225 grams) of split peas.
You will need 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water for each cup (225 grams) of whole field peas.
 As the beans cook, you may notice some foam on top of the water. Use a slotted spoon to remove the foam off the surface of the water.
 Once the peas start to boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir the peas from time to time so that they don't stick., This may involve adding them to a soup, a dish, or tossing them with a sauce.

 Compression software allows you to extract RAR archives into their original, usable forms. No operating system has built-in support for unpacking RAR files, so you will need to download a third-party application.


While there are a variety of free options for extracting files from a .rar archive, the only way to create a .rar archive is by purchasing a commercial program.
 Once you have compression software installed, you can extract the archive. To do this, either double-click on the .rar file or right-click on it and choose your compression application from the context menu. Your compression program will ask you where you want to save the unpacked files.


Many compression programs allow you to quickly extract an archive to the current folder through the right-click menu.
You may be prompted for a password if the original owner added a password during the compression process.
 The default location for extracting a .rar file is into the folder that it is located in. Usually it will create a new folder with the name of the .rar file, unless you specified differently when you opened the .rar. After unpacking, you can safely delete the original .rar archive.

 For this, you’ll need to use your thin nail art brush and some pink polish. Once the ears are completely dry, carefully create smaller triangles within the ears. This will create the inside of the cat’s ears., You can purchase a dotting tool at your local beauty supply store. If you are interested in nail design, this is a worthwhile investment. If you do not want to purchase a new tool, you can use the rounded tip of a bobby pin or any other small, round tip.

Dip your dotting tool into black polish. Press them down onto the cat’s face to create two black eyes.
Then, use the dotting tool again to create the whites of the eyes. Use less pressure, so that the polish doesn’t fill in the entirety of the black dot you’ve already created. After this step, the eyes should look like white dots with thin black rims around them.
Finally, dip your dotting tool into the black polish again and create very tiny black dots in the center of the white dots. These are the pupils. Use a very light hand in order to make them very small.
 Using your smallest nail art brush, you’re going to add the final details to the face. Create a small black triangle for the nose, with two curves extending from the nose to create the mouth. Then, add three lines extending from either side of the face to look like whiskers.

If you need some help figuring out how your cat face should look, a quick Google of “cartoon cat face” will bring up a few simple sketches for you to copy.
 A topcoat will seal in in the beautiful design you just worked hard to create. It will also protect your nail from chipping and damage, helping it last longer. Make sure to apply a swipe along the very tip of your nail as well.

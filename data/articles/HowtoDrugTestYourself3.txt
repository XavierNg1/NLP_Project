 You can find kits that detect a specific drug or multi-panel kits that test for up to twelve drugs. Decide which drugs you need to test for, and choose a kit that fits your needs.Multi-panel tests are more expensive, but most companies that drug test administer multi-panel tests.
 There are now inexpensive kits available at most dollar stores, however they’re often inaccurate. Before making a purchase, check a kit’s label to make sure it’s certified by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration).For locations outside of the U.S., look for a comparable certification seal, such as the CE (European Conformity) mark.
 Most test kits have a shelf life of one year. After the expiration date, the reagents that detect drugs start to degrade, which makes the test inaccurate.You should be particularly careful about purchasing tests online. Make sure any product you purchase has a guarantee or return policy in case you find that it’s expired when you receive it.
 If you’re concerned about getting the most accurate results possible, look for kits that include lab testing in the purchase price. If you yield positive results, you can mail the sample to a lab for confirmation.While more expensive, a lab can rule out false positives caused by foods, drinks, and over the counter products, like cold or allergy medications.
 In addition to home urine, saliva, and hair tests, there are kits that can test a substance itself. If you’re concerned that a substance contains a harmful additive, testing it can determine its purity.Don’t take a substance that tests positive for anything other than what you believe it to be. While testing a substance can detect undesirable additives, remember that no illegal drug or substance of abuse is safe.

 Romance, obviously, but romance is hard to do well when it's by itself. Do you want it to be a slice-of-life comedy about two schoolgirls who begin to date? A fantasy story about a princess who falls in love with a female knight? Or a sci-fi about an alien and an earthling falling for each other?;
, High school? The future? The past? A different world completely?

, Obviously, these are going to be the people in love. Who they are depends on the genre and setting of your story. For example, if your story is set in a high school, they can't be a princess and a mermaid.
 List what they look like, how old they are, what they like and dislike, their backgrounds... anything that can help you make them more fleshed-out.
 A popular theme in the yuri genre is to have another, older, wiser lesbian couple who know what your main girls are going through. There are so many possibilities. Maybe one of the main characters is in a love triangle with the other girl and a boy? Maybe one has a supportive best friend?

, How will they do it? You can change your mind later, but be sure to have some idea when you start out.
 Don't have them meet in chapter one and begin going out in chapter 3. (The only exception is if they're both out of the closet and comfortable with dating women.) Have them meet, become friends with some hints of attraction, add some sexual tension... THEN the real attraction can begin.
 This goes for all romances, really. Have them fight. Have them have certain traits that simply clash (a liberal with a conservative, for example). Have them disagree on some things.

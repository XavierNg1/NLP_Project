 Silicosis is a long-term lung disease that is developed when someone inhales silica or quartz dust over a long period of time. People’s occupations lead to silicosis. If you work with stone, clay, rock, or sand, perform stone cutting and sandblasting, or work in a mine, quarry, or foundry, you are at a high risk for silicosis.People who have occupations in stone masonry, construction, demolition, paving, pottery, ceramics, or glass making are at risk.
 Symptoms often take decades to develop. Most of the time, it occurs after breathing in silica dust for 10 to 20 years. The main symptom is trouble breathing, especially after physical exertion. You may also experience shortness of breath when you are resting.


A severe cough also occurs with silicosis. It may be dry or produce phlegm. You may also experience chest pain.
Fatigue, lethargy, and general weakness is also a sign.
Some people lose weight and have a decreased appetite.
 If you at-risk or are experiencing any symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Don’t put off going to the doctor. The symptoms won’t get better, and the earlier silicosis is diagnosed, the better your doctor can help you manage the symptoms.


Your doctor will give you a series of tests. You will first have a chest x-ray, and then more than likely a CT scan of your chest. Afterwards, you may have to have a breathing test to evaluate your lung function.

 From now on, ask yourself how you are feeling every day, and always be honest. Also, make sure you are honest about your feelings with the close friends you selected in week 1. There is no point in denying your feelings, because you will begin to think you are over your ex, when really you aren’t, and this can bring back the pain you felt when you first broke up, and you will have to start this process all over again.
 From now on, every day tell yourself that there are other people that care about you, because there are.
 It’s fine if you want to use these things with friends and to have fun. But never start using them on your own, and to escape from your problems. This is very, very tempting to do, but you will not help yourself at all.
 It will eventually make it a lot worse and could result in other problems.
 Yes, it will hurt and it will remind you of your ex, but it will also remind you that there are other people who understand how you feel.

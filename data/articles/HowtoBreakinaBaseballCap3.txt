 This is a great way to give your bill a permanent curve, as it is very effective and easy to do. Curve the bill inward so that the ends are touching, and slide it into a coffee mug. The curved bill should fit into the coffee mug with no problem. Allow the cap to sit in the mug overnight, and it will be perfectly curved when you remove it in the morning., You'll need a can (soda can, beer can, soup can, etc.) and a rubber band to secure it in place. Leave your hat wrapped like this overnight, and you'll have a nice, subtle curve in the bill of your baseball cap.


You can also use a baseball instead of a can or glass. This will be a bit harder to hold in place with a rubber band, but is doable and will get you similar results.
 Turn your hat upside down so that the inside is facing upwards. Curve the bill so that the ends of it are touching. Then, fold the bill towards the back opening of the hat, and slide the curved bill into the hat's opening. The opening will hold the bill in place. Leave the hat in this position overnight. This method will give you a less intense curve in the bill of your baseball cap.

 As well as the rooting hormone, the medium used to place the cutting into is an important part of determining the success of the rooting. The rooting medium should have the following features:It is low in fertility.
It holds water well without being soggy and drains well. It stops the cutting and roots from drying out.
It supports the cutting sufficiently but is flexible enough to provide space for the growing roots.
It is free of non-beneficial bacteria, fungus or disease-causing organisms.
It is free of insects and weed seeds.
 Standard rooting materials include coarse sand, perlite, vermiculite (but take care as it can become too compacted or soggy), sand or perlite mixed with peat moss, etc.However, it is important to find out what the particular plant you're trying to root from cuttings does best in, as some mediums will work better than others. For example, some plants will prefer a more acidic medium, while others a more alkaline one.


Water is not ideal as a rooting medium for many plants, unless they're succulent plants like mint, ivy, philodendrons and coleus.

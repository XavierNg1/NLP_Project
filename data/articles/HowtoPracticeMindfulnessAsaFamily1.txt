 In order to practice mindfulness with your family, it is important that you model mindfulness behaviour in your own life. Your family will actually learn more from modelling your behaviour than they will from most attempts at teaching mindfulness.For example, you could set aside five minutes each day to practice meditation. During this time, focus on all of your senses and maintain steady deep breaths.
You can also practice self-compassion during stressful moments of the day. For example, acknowledge that you are stressed and ask yourself "What do I need?";
, One way to model mindfulness is by being present. If you are always distracted and on your phone when you are around your family, you are teaching them that listening isn’t important. Instead, crouch down to your child’s level and make eye contact when you are speaking with them. If you notice your mind wandering, ask questions and refocus on the present.Model active listening skills to demonstrate that you are paying attention.
For example, try to rephrase and repeat what is said to you during a conversation. This will help you stay focused.
 In order to model mindfulness, it is important as a parent to take time for yourself. When you are juggling your career and family, life can get stressful. Parents often put unnecessary pressure on themselves to be perfect. Take time for yourself so that you can stop and really focus on enjoying the moment.For example, try exercising, visiting a spa, reading, or simply taking a nap.
Alternatively, you may want to spend some quality time with your partner, away from your children. Try implementing a monthly date night to allow you to focus some of your attention on maintaining a healthy relationship.

 Analyze the site to see if it gets enough traffic and reaches your target audience. Just because it's your favorite website doesn't mean that it's popular. You can also get an idea of the site's popularity if it has a lot of comments, "likes" on Facebook, or comes up near the top of search engines.;
,, Sometimes this is very prominent, and the site will have an "advertise here" link or an advertising category in its navigation. If it is not that obvious, look on the bottom of the page, the "About Us" section or the sitemap.
 Let the owner know you are interested in advertising and ask how to advertise on your favorite websites. Give information about your products and what you'll be advertising, and ask about rates and ad placement.
 If the site is a blog, see about adding your blog to its blog roll; you should add a link to the site on your blog roll to reciprocate. If it features articles, find out if you can publish an article on the site that links back to your website or blog. If the site offers product reviews, contact the owner and ask if they would be interested in reviewing your product. You will have to send a sample.
 Many sites do not handle advertising on their own, but work with an Internet advertising company. You'll have to register with the advertising company's site and specify which sites you want to advertise on.
 AdWords offers low cost, targeted ads that match your product or site with words people use to search for it. If your favorite websites are related to your products and use AdWords, it's likely your ad will end up there, and you'll also have the benefit of having your ads appear on other relevant sites.

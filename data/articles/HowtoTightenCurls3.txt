 If your curls are looking a little limp, give your hair a quick blast with a diffuser, scrunching as you go to encourage the curls to tighten back up. Use a small amount of curl cream or styling gel to boost your ringlets. Flip your hair over and diffuse as you scrunch to revive hair that’s gone a little flat.


You can also get your hair lightly damp prior to diffusing to intensify the effects.
 Shower steam can reactivate your ringlets without you having to rewet your hair completely. Pull your hair up to keep it from getting wet and take your morning shower. Crank up the warm water to make sure you get plenty of steam going. When you step out of the shower, take down your hair and use a little leave-in conditioner or curl crème to enhance your curls further. Give your hair a few scrunches before you head out the door., If you like, put a shower cap over your hair. Leave it like this for a few hours or even overnight. Take out the scrunchie, shake out your curls and use a small amount of curl cream as you fluff and scrunch your hair into place., Sometimes a simple trim is all you need to tighten up your curls! Damage and split ends cause your hair to lose elasticity, wreaking havoc on ringlets. The additional weight doesn’t help your curls, either. If the ends of your hair look straighter than the virgin hair growing from the roots, it’s definitely time for a trim. Snip off those split ends and your ringlets will spring back into place.

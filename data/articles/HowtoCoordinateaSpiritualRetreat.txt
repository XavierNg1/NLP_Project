 The sooner you set your dates, the sooner you can encourage your community members to save the date.;
, Choosing a theme is the foundation for planning your entire event, yet there are almost unlimited choices. Consider your community, and what would be the most beneficial and timely topic. Then build your activities around this central theme.
 One way to unify the participants is to have t-shirts or some other item custom-made, which includes the name, logo and date of your event. This makes a wonderful (and relatively inexpensive) keepsake for attendees, and immediately helps to garner interest from future participants in next year’s event.
 Certainly, you will need some fun icebreaker activities to help participants loosen up and get to know each other. But it’s also wise to include activities that deepen the experience.
 In order to truly create a cathartic group experience, participants need “down time” for rest and unstructured recreation. Allow breaks to facilitate the development of social bonds, during which time participants can break off into impromptu small groups, participate in various sports, or simply spend time alone to reflect and sit with their thoughts.
 If possible, take measures to ensure that participants get the opportunity to enjoy meals with different people, as opposed to staying in their usual cliques at mealtime.
 For a truly memorable experience, rent a projector to help display inspirational images, to assist the speakers with visual aids, or to recap photo memories captured throughout the weekend.

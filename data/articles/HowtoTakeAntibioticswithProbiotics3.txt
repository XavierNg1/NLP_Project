 If you do decide to try a supplement, make certain the probiotic contains many different strains of bacteria. Some strains to look for include L. acidophilus, L. Fermentum, L. rhamnosus, B. longum, and B. bifidum. Some products also include a yeast, Saccharomyces, which helps protect gut bacteria.Make sure that the supplement has at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs). If you are looking for a prebiotic supplement that contains inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), then the supplements should also contain galactooligosaccharides, or GOS.
Opt for controlled-release forms. Stomach acid can kill probiotic bacteria, so it is best to choose a probiotic that dissolves after it has passed through the stomach. This will help to ensure that the probiotics will be able to thrive in your digestive tract.
 Make sure that you check the label for an expiration date and also look for a “USP Verified” seal. The USP seal indicates that a non-profit lab, the USP, has checked the product and found that the bacteria and other ingredients listed on the label is what is actually in the bottle. Some other things to look for include:Company name and contact information
The recommended dose

, Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on any supplement that you are taking. You can also ask your physician for advice. Since it may take a while for your body to rebalance the bacteria after you finish a round of antibiotics, it is a good idea to use probiotics for a month after you are finished taking the antibiotics.

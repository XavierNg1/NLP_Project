Lips: A natural or pink gloss is a safe bet. For special occasion or if you're just feeling particularly dressy, a deep berry or magenta lipstick could be applied sparingly.






Eyes: A moderate amount of black or purple eyeliner can be applied on the top lid, with a small wing if desired. A soft, smoky eyeshadow is optional. Make sure to keep your eyebrows groomed and neat.






Face: Keep your face smooth and unblemished- if you have zits, obviously, treat them and apply cover up. A light powder or foundation is optional- make sure, however, not to cross the line into cakey makeup. A light coat of berry colored blush right on the apples of your cheeks will give you an extra boost of cuteness.

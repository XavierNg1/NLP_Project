 Only use heavy cardboard, undamaged boxes for this craft.;
, Consider using canvas fabric because it wears better than other types. Purchase more than enough to cover the number of boxes you plan to create. For example, 1 yard (0.9 m) should cover two diaper boxes.
, You will need fabric (for example, if you are covering one diaper box you’ll only need about ½ yard), but can use the glue and scissors from the rest of your supplies.

,,,, You may take as much time as you would like to return, here is a system to decide approximately when you will return.

Less than 5 minutes- you are talking to a good friend and are having a good conversation, you actually mean you'll be right back.






5-15 minutes- you aren't really leaving, but you want to get out of the conversation for one reason or another, you might actually be going somewhere, but you don't really intend to return to the conversation, this is an easy way to end a conversation short.






More than 15 minutes- you never really wanted to talk to this person, so right when the conversation is initiated you respond "hold up, brb" but never return, you probably don't like this person very much, and they are not a good enough friend to be honest and say that you are too busy to talk to them at the moment.

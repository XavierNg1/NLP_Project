 Fangs are the hallmark of a vampire. If you’re dressing up like a vampire and you want people to understand what you’re dressing up as immediately, fangs will do the trick. If you do wear fangs, find small ones that don't look tacky. Plastic fangs from the coin machine at the grocery store will just look silly. Tooth caps are much easier to speak with than a full mouthpiece, and they look more natural.
You can also make fangs with acrylic, bits of straw, or even pieces of a fork.
Apply lip stick after fitting your fangs to avoid a mess.
 You want your cape to be either dark colors or red if you would like to stand out a little bit. Capes are another very recognizable component of vampire style. You can make your own cape out of fabric or drape, or buy one at a local party shop. , If you want to really take your costume to the next level you should try wearing elegant and slightly outdated clothing. For men, a ruffled tuxedo shirt, black pants, and black shoes are the perfect costume. You can even wear a cummerbund if it appeals to you. For women, an elegant top and a long flowing skirt will perfectly compliment your fangs and cape. Remember to wear dark colors. , Using eye shadow to darken your eyes and white face paint to make your face look paler will add a huge boost to your vampire costume. You also can paint your nails purple or red. Male or female this will make you look even more haunting.
 The eyes of a vampire are used to hypnotize others, so it's good to give your eyes an extra little something. Sparkly or shiny contacts can be a nice touch for a vampire costume or look. Be as creative as you want with them, and explore different colors and options.


Gold colored contacts will give you the look of a Twilight vampire. If you wish to be a bit more extreme, try blood red, black, or even "cat eyes."
Be as unusual and creative as you wish.
Many vampires wear sunglasses during the day, so that the bright sunlight doesn't hurt their eyes.

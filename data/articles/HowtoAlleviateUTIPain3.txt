 To help prevent a UTI from developing, wear cotton underwear. Nylon underwear traps moisture, which provides a perfect environment for bacterial growth.Although this growth happens outside the urethra and bladder, the bacteria can travel up the urethra.
 Women and girls should not take baths with perfumed bubble bath soap. Perfumed bubble bath soap can cause inflammation of the urethra, which can provide a good environment for bacterial growth., Women and girls should wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from your stool and anus being introduced into the urethra.Your stool is rich in bacteria necessary for the digestion of your food, but shouldnâ€™t get into your bladder.
 Another way that bacteria can get introduced to your urinary tract is through sex. To prevent bacteria buildup, urinate right after you have sex. This will flush the urethra of any bacteria that may have gotten inside it during intercourse.

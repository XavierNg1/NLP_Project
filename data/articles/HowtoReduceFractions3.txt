 Leave a large space to the right hand side of your paper -- you'll need it to write out the factors.
 Keep them in separate lists. It may be easiest if the lists line up on top of each other. Start with 1 and work your way up, listing them in pairs.

For example, if your fraction is 24/60, start off with 24.
You'd write: 24 -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24






Then, move onto 60.
You'd write: 60 -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60







, This may be referred to as the GCF in your textbook. What's the biggest number that goes into both the numerator and the denominator? Whatever it is, divide both numbers by that.


For our example, the biggest number that is a factor of both numbers is 12. Therefore, we divide 24 by 12 and 60 by 12, leaving us with 2/5 -- our reduced fraction!

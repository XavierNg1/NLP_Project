 You'll need an open area (with nothing flammable nearby) and your materials:


Plastic garbage bag (The cheaper the better--they should be very lightweight. 20 liters is not too big, either.)
Fire starters (Original Zip works very well)
Mechanical wire (around 18 gauge)

, One should be much shorter than the others--about 4 inches long (10 cm). The other two should be 24 inches long (61 cm).
 Using the long wires, form an "X," twisting them around each other like you would a twist tie. 5 or 6 times should do the trick. This structure will keep the bag open as it flies.


Twist the short wire around the center of the X. Leave the ends exposed; they'll carry the fire starters. They should be pointing up towards the balloon when you put it in place.
 Bend the end of the wire over to secure. Do this for each side, using the full width of the bag. You should have a loose square shape.


Are the ends of your short wire pointing toward the balloon? If not, adjust them now.
 Most fire starters come in a big block. You may have to experiment a couple times to find what works as one package is far too much. Break off two medium-sized pieces and attach one to each end.


If they are too big, the bag will melt. If they are too small, the bag won't fly. A couple inches each (5 cm) in diameter is about right, for a lightweight 20 liter (5.3 US gal) bag.
 Adjust the bag as necessary to allow the bag to inflate completely. It will start to become buoyant and seem to want to fly. When you being to exert effort to keep it down, give it a gentle push and let it wander into the sky.


Be careful! If your fire starters are too big, the bag may melt. Stay alert.
For this method, it works best to do it in cold weather. The difference in temperature allows the heat to work more efficiently.

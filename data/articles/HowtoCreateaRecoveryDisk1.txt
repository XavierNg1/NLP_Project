Recovery flash drives are recommended because they can not only repair system issues, but also return the computer to its factory settings.
The flash drive must be blank and at least 4GB for 32-bit systems and 8gb for 64-bit systems. All data on the flash drive will be erased in the creation of the recovery drive.
A system repair CD/DVD will NOT be able to reset the computer back to factory settings, but it can repair the current operating system and run diagnostic tools. Any blank CD or DVD will do the trick.;
, Regardless of which type of recovery media you decide to create, all options will appear in the “Create a Recovery Drive” dialog.
 It doesn’t apply to users creating a CD or DVD.


This option is called “Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive” in Windows 8.
If the check box is grayed out, there’s no recovery partition on the computer. You’ll be able to use this disc or drive to boot and repair the computer in the event of an emergency, but not to reinstall Windows.
 You’ll now be able to choose between creating a flash recovery drive or recovery discs.


To make a recovery flash drive: Plug the flash drive into a USB port, then select it from the list. Or, just select it from the list, if it’s already plugged in.
To create CDs or DVDs: Click “Create a system repair disc with a CD or DVD instead,” then select your CD/DVD ROM drive.
, The recovery drive creator will format and copy necessary utilities to your flash drive or CD/DVD.
 The recovery partition is a special section of your hard drive dedicated to reinstalling the operating system in the event of an emergency. You should leave it intact so you can build a new recovery drive if necessary.


If you no longer want the ability to make a recovery flash drive at a later date, click “Delete the recovery partition.”
This option will not appear if you don’t have a recovery partition.
 Make sure you store the recovery media in a safe place.

 This option can be a little risky, since he can call it right then and see if it is actually your number. However, it can be a way to get someone to stop asking you out in an indirect way.Also, make sure the number you're giving isn't someone else's number. You can look up most numbers online to see if they connect to a person. You don't want to be giving out a person's number to a stranger.
If you happen to run into him again and he asks you about it, just ask to see the number, then say "Whoops! Wow, I spaced out. I totally wrote down one of the numbers wrong." And when he asks for the number again you can do the same thing. (If you're going to see him more than twice, it's best to just tell the truth.)

, Some hotlines have been designed specifically for rejecting guys. Others are just a silly way to give a fake number. Either way, you can use these numbers to hand out to the guys you meet so you don't have to give your number.Another option is the rejection line. It explains to the guy that you've given him a false number as a way of rejecting him with a bit of humor thrown in. The number is (605) 475-6968., Another option is to take a guy friend with you when you're out who's willing to pretend to be your boyfriend. That way, if you need to reject someone, you can use him as a decoy.


You could say, "Oh, I would if I were single, but I'm here with my boyfriend." It helps to grab your decoy boyfriend's arm at this point.

 If you have a stand mixer, that's best. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface and the mixture begins to foam. These are the signs to look for to know that the yeast is doing its job.;
, Mix it well, and once that flour is fully combined, start adding the rest of the flour in bit by bit until you get the stromboli dough to the consistency you want. It should be a little tacky, but when you touch it nothing should stick to your fingers.


Using a standing mixer will greatly eliminate your woes. This is doable by hand, but it'll be a workout. Be patient.
 Turn a timer on and keep those arms working until it buzzes -- resist the temptation to stop any earlier. After six minutes, the dough should be smooth and easy to work with.


It may be tempting, but don't cave. If you overwork the dough, it becomes harder to work with, the consistency becomes undesirable, and it won't raise properly.
 If you don't, it'll dry out. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, set it on your counter, and let it rise for 1-2 hours. Try to use it as shortly after this period as possible -- it's freshest when recently risen.

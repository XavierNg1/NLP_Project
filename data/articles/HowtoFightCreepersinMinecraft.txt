Before attempting to fight a creeper, you must always back off and wait until it has calmed down, otherwise you risk get blown up.
 Hit them once, then back away and wait for the creeper to stop making the hissing noise. If you have a bow, now's the time to use it! Shoot the creeper to it's death. If not, move forward, hit it and back away again. Keep doing this until the creeper is dead.

 Before you can even approach a woman, you must observe their body language. On average, men tend to miss out on initial inviting body cues from women.

Here are some body language cues that should signal a woman is approachable:

Tossing of hair.
Exposure of neck.
An open torso.
Wrist exposure.
Showing of hands.
 Conversation is very key to making a good first impression. In general, conversation and talking makes a huge impact on a woman's interest in a man; it opens the opportunity to make a connection, and most women do connect through conversation.

Do your best to find common grounds. Similar interests and similarity in general is something that naturally attracts us to one another., Avoid sounding like an expert on topics; it comes off as desperate to be authoritative not to mention you'll avoid connecting with her by making it all about you.

To avoid this, ask questions that invite her to talk and build off of what she has already mentioned with follow up questions., Once conversation is ignited, return to paying attention to cues to see if the woman is intrigued with you and your approach.


Notice if she is getting close to you. The closer a woman allows herself to be with you, the more interested she may be.Pay attention to the conversation. If she carries things beyond introductions and small talk, she might be gaining comfort in your presence.
Her eyes speak to you. If she makes eye contact and scans you from head to toe, that's a sign of intrigue.

 If you want to write the long form of a date, you need to know and be able to spell the names of each of the months in Spanish. Knowing how to spell the names of the months also is essential to recognize the abbreviated form of the name.January is enero.
February is febrero.
March is marzo.
April is abril.
May is mayo.
June is junio.
July is julio.
August is agosto.
September is septiembre.
October is octubre.
November is noviembre.
December is diciembre.
 It's true that you don't need to write out the word for the day of the week when writing the date in Spanish. But understanding how the words are spelled will help you when you're reading a written date aloud.The first day of the month can be written as "uno" ("one"), "el primer d√≠a" ("the first day"), or "el primero" ("the first").
Two is dos.
Three is tres.
Four is cuatro.
Five is cinco.
Six is seis.
Seven is siete.
Eight is ocho.
Nine is nueve.
Ten is diez.
 Since there are as many as 31 days in a month, you can't stop learning the numbers at 10. In Spanish, the numbers 11 through 15 have their own names, while the names for the rest of the numbers follow a pattern.If you don't already know number words in Spanish, reading and writing dates can be a good way to practice.
 Just as you don't typically have to write out the day in Spanish, you certainly shouldn't ever have a need to write out the year in words. But it's still helpful to understand it so you'll say the date correctly.Spell the year out in thousands and hundreds. For example, the year "1900" would be spelled out in Spanish as "mil novecientos," which translates literally to "one thousand, nine hundred." There is no Spanish equivalent to the phrase "nineteen hundred," which is how you would say it in English.
Follow with the tens and ones after the thousands and hundreds. For example, you would write out the year "1752" in Spanish as "mil setecientos cincuenta y dos."

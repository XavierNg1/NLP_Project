 There are a wide variety of materials used for laboratory containers (such as PVC, LDPE, PP, and many others). Different acids will have divergent effects on these materials. As such, it is crucial to determine which material will be best suited for storing and transferring the acid (or acids) you will be using.


For example, chromic acid (at 10%-50%) can be safely stored in LDPE.
Acetic acid (50%), however, should be kept in PP.
It is important to reference a chemical compatibility chart to determine the best material for your containers., In addition to selecting the correct material for your containers, it is very important to ensure that your containers are intact. Carefully inspect each container for leaks, cracks, or other damage before use.


If you determine that a container is unusable, be sure to dispose of it according to the guidelines of your lab (Often, there will specific disposal bins for various materials.)

, An excellent safety measure is to conduct all operations involving acid underneath a fume hood. It is best to work at least six inches inside the fume hood, to ensure the highest level of contaminant capture.
 In addition to selecting a container of the proper material, it is most safe to use a container of the correct size. Use of a container that is too large or too small can result in spills, leaks, or other hazards.,


Always label acids before storing them.
Consider using a color-coded cap system (acetic acid = brown, phosphoric acid = white, hydrochloric acid = blue).

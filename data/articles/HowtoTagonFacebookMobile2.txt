 Find the app on your phone's home screen and tap it.
 First, tap your avatar icon next to the status entry bar near the top of the page. Then tap the Photos button in your profile page. It will be between the About and Friends buttons.
 Browse through your albums, or the list of Photos of You, and find the photo you would like to tag. Tap it to open it.
 The icon will look like a price tag. If you don't see any icons on the bottom, click anywhere on the screen to see the icons again.
 There will be transparent squares around the faces of people in the picture. If you tap one of those, it will give you the option to type the name of that person. Type their name and then press done.


If you want to tag someone or something that doesn't have a transparent square around it, tap wherever in the photo you want to place the tag. Then type the name of the person or page you want to tag.

 For example, if you only learn or sing popular songs, it's probably not a good idea to enter an opera competition. Make sure you know what you will be expected to do before you enter. Look in your local rec guide if you're just starting out. Sometimes you can have a lot of fun singing with the people in your community. If you've been singing for a long time or you’re ready to do a competition in a big city, look online. Sometimes, you have to audition for certain competitions.;
, You're not the only good singer in the world, there's a lot of talent in this world. Get a good band to back you up or a karaoke track. Make sure you are totally organized at least a week before the competition. You need to get the answers to these questions:


Are you eligible?
Do you need a band or karaoke track?
Do you have an audition, if yes when and where?
For a better chance to win, pick a song that shows off your voice and is age appropriate. Try to get a list of things the judges will be looking for.
 This is also part of being prepared.
 You can even work out your dancing with a dance teacher, but don’t overdo the choreography.
 Keep your warm-up simple so you don't strain your voice before you compete.
 It’s so important to believe in yourself, but do not boast or be convinced you'll win.
 If you lose, congratulate the winners even if they brag or tease you.

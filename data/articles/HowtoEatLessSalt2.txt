 It is easy to over-salt your food as it can add flavor to an otherwise bland dish. However, if you need to add flavor to your food, try swapping salt with black pepper. Foods like pastas, eggs, and soups can be flavored with black pepper instead of salt.Eating foods seasoned with pepper over salt may test strange at first, but give it time. Your taste buds will adjust.
 Store bought soup stocks and gravies are often loaded in added salt. Instead of purchasing these items at the store, make them yourself at home. Opt for recipes that do not require a lot of added salt.You can also try replacing some or all of the stock in a soup recipe with water, which you can season with spices and black pepper instead of salt.
 When cooking things like pasta, rice, beans, or vegetables, do not salt the water ahead of time. This is an easy way to cut some salt out of your diet.For flavor, try adding other spices to the water like garlic powder or dried basil.
 Try to see cutting back on salt as an adventure rather than a burden. Explore different kinds of flavors and recipes that do not require a lot of added salt. For example, you can add basil, rosemary, cayenne pepper, garlic, and vinegar to recipes for added flavor. You can look up unique flavor combinations online, such as cajun blends, that can add flavor to your favorite foods without over-salting them.If you're consistent about trying new flavors over salt, your taste buds will eventually adjust. Give it time and eventually you will appreciate new recipes and spices and stop missing salt.
You can also add a drop or two of hot sauce. Hot sauce has sodium in it, but if you only use a drop or two then it wonâ€™t add too much.
 Things like mayonnaise, mustard, and soy sauce have a high salt content. You should reduce using these foods to add flavor to your dishes. If you want mustard on your sandwich, use a small coin-sized dollop rather than spreading mustard over an entire piece of bread.

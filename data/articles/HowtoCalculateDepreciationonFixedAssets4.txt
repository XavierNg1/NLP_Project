 This will be in table format and it's great to use a spreadsheet for this type of calculation.


Your table should have 6 columns and one row for each year in the asset's life plus a header row.
 Use the following headers: Beginning Book Value, Total Depreciable Cost, Depreciation Rate, Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation and Ending Book Value.
 As an example, assume a purchase price of $1,000 with a lifespan of five years and a salvage value of $200.
 In this example, the value is $1,000 purchase price minus $200 salvage value equals $800 depreciable cost.
 As the method name implies, you'll do this by summing up the years.


Sum the numbers of the years in the asset's depreciable life. Using the example of 5 years, that would be 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15).
In the first year, divide the sum by the last number (5 / 15); in the second year the sum is divided by the second-to-last number (4 / 15) and so on down the column to find the percentage of depreciation rate for each year.
 You'll use the sum you derived above to reach this value.


$800 x (5/15) = $800 x 33.33 percent = $266.67.
 That number will give you the Ending Book Value for that year. It will also be the second year's Beginning Book Value.


For example: $1,000 - $266.67 = $733.33.
 You'll follow the same pattern with the subsequent years, using the beginning book value for each year as the starting point and using the appropriate percentage based on the year (4 / 15 in the second year, 3 /15 in the third year, etc.).


In year 2, the depreciation amount is $213.33 ($733.33 x 26.67%); in year 3 it is $160 ($520 x 20%); in year 4 it is $106.67 ($360 x 13.3%) and in year 5 it is $53.33 (253.33 x 6.67%).
 All the percentages in the Depreciation Rate column will total 100 percent. The Accumulated Depreciation will equal the purchase price less the salvage value (in this case, $200).

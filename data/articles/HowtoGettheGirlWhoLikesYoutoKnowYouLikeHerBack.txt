, Don't stare at her for a long time, but if she likes you, she would be happy if you noticed her. If you look at her, and she looks back at you, smile.
 If you are going to sit down, sit next to her. If you are standing in a room, walk over to her and say, "Hi, (insert name)!"

, If you are standing outside a classroom waiting to enter, go up to her and say hello, or hi. Ask her out, and then ask her for her phone number (But only if she looks like she is able to get out a piece of paper and write down her number.) If she likes you, she would probably say yes.
 However, make sure its just the two of you, because if she's with a group of friends and she says no, you'll be humiliated.
, Talk to her but not for too long. If she is in a group of friends, never shake her hand first or talk to her first. Talk to the group and go around. Make the whole group laugh. Have a friend with you so he distracts the group while you talk to the girl you like. Don't talk for too long.
 When you leave say it was a pleasure talking to her, and then leave. As you are walking away, look back to see if she is staring at you. If she is, smile with a little smile, and turn around and keep going.

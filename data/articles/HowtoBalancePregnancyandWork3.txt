 Doctors often offer early morning or early evening appointments as well.


In general, doctor's visits while pregnant are about once a month and become more frequent as your pregnancy progresses. If you can't find time to schedule your appointments during a break, consult your supervisor or human resources professional about using your sick time to cover your absence from work.

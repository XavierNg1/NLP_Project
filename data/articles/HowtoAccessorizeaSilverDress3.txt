 Pair one or two key diamond pieces with non-diamond jewelry. For example, you could wear a diamond pendant or choker with thin silver bangle bracelets.


Avoid matching diamond jewelry with black or gunmetal accessories. Diamonds look best when paired with other feminine pieces, and many black and gunmetal pieces are too masculine to coordinate well.
 Match a simple diamond pendant with a dainty diamond bracelet and diamond stud earrings.
 For instance, you could wear chandelier earrings with a simple diamond pendant, or a glamorous diamond tennis bracelet with diamond stud earrings.
 Diamond jewelry may blend in with the silver fabric. For bracelets and earrings, this does not pose much problem. This can, however, make selecting a diamond necklace difficult. Avoid long necklaces that position the diamond element directly above the material of the dress. Also avoid extravagant diamond necklaces that throw too many diamonds directly above the dressâ€™s neckline.

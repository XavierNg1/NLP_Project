 When it comes to accessing websites that are blocked on your network, there are a few terms that will be useful to have a basic understanding of.


Server - This is a computer located somewhere else that is processing your request for a webpage and sending you the data. All websites are stored (hosted) on servers.
Proxy - This is a server that acts as a "middleman" for your webpage requests. You tell the proxy server what website you want, and then the proxy retrieves the website data and sends it on to you.
VPN - VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, and acts like a "tunnel" through the internet to a server. This server then handles all of your webpage requests. It is similar to a proxy but much more secure (and costly).
Encryption - When you connect to a website using a secure connection, such as with a VPN, your data is scrambled, or "encrypted". This prevents someone from intercepting your data and stealing your information.
 Chances are that Facebook and other sites are blocked for a reason. If you use any of these methods at school, you can face suspension or expulsion if discovered. If you use these methods at work and are found out, you may be reprimanded or terminated.

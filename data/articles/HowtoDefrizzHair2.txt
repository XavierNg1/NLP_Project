At some point you should take the time to get those knots out with a finer brush, but if you need to head to a party without frizzy hair a wide-tooth comb will do the trick.


If your hair still gets frizzy using a wide-tooth comb, then try running your fingers through your hair while in the shower rather than using a comb or brush afterwards. Wrap it in a towel and keep it damp to prevent early frizzing.
 Frizzy hair is a sign of dehydration and can also mean you're lacking in essential fatty acids found in fish, nuts, and seeds. Try to adopt a diet that could help strengthen your hair.

 Elaborate briefly upon how you heard about the listing, then make an offer. If you're not yet sure how much you want to spend, put a range. Alternately, if you are willing to spend any amount of money to purchase this house, simply inquire as to how much the seller is asking.
 You might also want to ask to inspect the property, especially if you have only seen it once or twice or you suspect that it might be in need of repairs.
 Keep a copy of this for yourself just in case.

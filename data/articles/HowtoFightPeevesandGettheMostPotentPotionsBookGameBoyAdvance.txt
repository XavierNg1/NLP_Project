 If you haven't gone in already, Hermione and Ron will be standing there, and they will take you into the bathroom. But if you already have gone through, then keep walking. Go all the way down the hallway, and turn when you see a door that says 'Library (Restricted Section)'.;
, You will see Peeves the Poltergeist in there. He will talk to you, and say that you can't harm him, he's a ghost...this is not so.
 If it isn't, change it by hitting the Start button and Then the L or the R button until you have the spell icons and select the one of the hand with the sparkle thing.
 It can be used quickly by just being pressed once. That use is how you can break those green vases. Or, you can hold it down. If you hold it down until the little meter fills, then launch the spell at Peeves, it will make him turn white for a split second. That stuns him, and it works for stunning anything else you'd need to. If you do it a few times at him, he will fly over to a knight and its shield will move, giving you the opportunity to launch flipendo at it. Keep doing it until it breaks.
 Stun him a few times, and he will clear off.
 No, it isn't the potion book, it's actually a spell book introducing you to the spell 'Skurge'. It will tell you all about it. Then you can launch it at the slimy door and go off to find the potions book!

, To activate it, press Start, and press either the L button once or the R button a few times until you see the map. Look around on the map using the arrow keys, and you should see a little X; that labels where you need to go. It's easy enough to find.

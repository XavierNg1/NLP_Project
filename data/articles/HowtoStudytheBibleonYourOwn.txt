 Preferably a letter from Paul. (Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Thessalonians, etc.)These letters were written to various churches at that time, instructing the Christians how they should live.;
, Take a chapter each week and spread it out to last each day.
 It doesn't have to be the same everyday. You may want to read in the mornings some days, and the afternoons or evenings on others, it doesn't matter. The important thing is that your spending time with your heavenly father!

, If you don't, that's okay! Try picking out a few words that jumped at you and looking them up in a concordance to find other verses talking about the same thing.
 You don't have to write a lot... Start small! This helps to show you what God is revealing to you through His Word! Write out ideas or verses or thoughts that come into mind as you read. Then look them over and pray about it.
 The Psalms are very intimate prayers and songs written to the Lord by various authors. This will help you get a better understanding of prayer and worship.
 God won't hold it against you if you slip up and miss a day or two. He is our heavenly father, we can come to Him as we are!His love for us stays the same. He will NEVER leave us or forsake us.

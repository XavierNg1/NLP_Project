 Because you don't have a weight machine to help you maintain the proper form, you have to pay careful attention to how you lift the weight.
 If you can't lift and lower the weight slowly and smoothly, choose a lighter weight.
 If you can't complete the last couple of repetitions, you could find yourself trapped under a barbell or straining your muscles in an attempt to maintain control. A spotter will help you lift the weight safely so you can finish your set. You can often ask another member to spot you in return for being his or her spotter.
 Make sure you have the same weight on each side and that they're secured with collars.
 Both dumbbells and plates are racked in order of weight.

 Nearly every one hates this part. You probably like your thesis topic, but writing hundreds of pages about it can be really horrible. If you have some publications, definitely use them to fill chapters. Just add more general comments, but the description and figures save you labor and definitely should be included in your thesis anyhow.
 You'll be tempted to explore some topics further or you'll be reminded of something you meant to do earlier. And your mind will probably be trying to find *anything* else to think about.
 You fill in the verbiage last, usually. Figure out what you need to say, divide it into chapters, and work on the supporting figures next. You'll need plenty of figures and tables to support your conclusions. Additionally, reviewers on your committee may not read *every* word, but they usually look at all of the figures and read the captions to get the gist of what's going on.
 it often helps to say it out loud - explain the items as if you're giving a complete talk on the subject, and record it. Then you'll have everything covered and it makes sense - you just have to translate it to a more passive tense.
 Give yourself a time span where you allow yourself no option of doing anything else but writing. Sometimes it helps to write in the same office/coffee shop/etc. with another student working on their thesis, if you both can keep each other on task. You can take breaks together and take the heat off a bit.

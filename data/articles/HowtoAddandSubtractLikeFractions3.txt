 For lunch, Jenny eats 2 slices of a pizza that is cut into 8 pieces. Christine eats 3 slices of the same pizza. How much of the pizza did Jenny and Christine eat combined?

Since the pizza is cut into 8 pieces, 8 will be the denominator for both fractions.

Since Joellen ate 2 slices, 28{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}} represents the amount of pizza that she ate.

Since Christine ate 3 slices, 38{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}} represents the amount of pizza that she ate.

Together, Joellen and Christine at 28+38{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}+{\frac {3}{8}}} of the pizza.

Adding the numerators, you get 2+3=5{\displaystyle 2+3=5}.

Placing the sum of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 28+38=58{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}+{\frac {3}{8}}={\frac {5}{8}}}. So together, Joellen and Christine ate 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} of the pizza.
 Evelyn silkscreens a roll of fabric. She cuts the roll into 12 pieces. She sells 5 of the pieces to Catherine. How much of the roll does Evelyn still have?

Since the fabric is cut into 12 pieces, 12 will be the denominator for both fractions.

Since Evelyn begins with the entire roll, 1212{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}} represents how much of the roll she starts off with.

Since Catherine buys 5 pieces, 512{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{12}}} represents the amount of fabric she takes away.

To find out how much of the roll of fabric Evelyn has left, you must calculate 1212−512{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}-{\frac {5}{12}}}.

Subtracting the numerators, you get 12−5=7{\displaystyle 12-5=7}.

Placing the difference of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 1212−512=712{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}-{\frac {5}{12}}={\frac {7}{12}}}. So, after she sells some fabric to Catherine, Evelyn has 712{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{12}}} of her fabric left.
 Donna and her friends are collecting a set of baseball cards. Donna has 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of the cards in the set, with no duplicate cards. She gives 36{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{6}}} of her set of cards to Essie for her birthday. Then Donna gets 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} of the set from Grace in exchange for some candy. What fraction of the full set does Donna end up with?

To find out how much of the set Donna has after giving cards to Essie, you must calculate 56−36{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}-{\frac {3}{6}}}.

Subtracting the numerators, you get 5−3=2{\displaystyle 5-3=2}.

Placing the difference of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 56−36=26{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}-{\frac {3}{6}}={\frac {2}{6}}}. So, after she give some cards to Essie, Donna has 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} of the set.

To find out how much of the set Donna has after Grace gives her some cards, you must calculate 26+26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}+{\frac {2}{6}}}.

Adding the numerators, you get 2+2=4{\displaystyle 2+2=4}.

Placing the sum of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 26+26=46{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}+{\frac {2}{6}}={\frac {4}{6}}}. So, after she gets some cards from Grace, Donna has 46{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{6}}} of the set.

The fraction 46{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{6}}} can be reduced, or simplified. The largest number that evenly divides into the numerator and denominator is 2.


4÷2=2{\displaystyle 4\div 2=2} and 6÷2=3{\displaystyle 6\div 2=3}. So, Donna has 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} of the set of baseball cards after both exchanges.

 Sweat has no odor; it's the bacteria on your skin that's causing the smell. Trimming your armpits will help a lot, too.
 Hygiene is a basic thing in society, yet some people do not have this in their routine as a priority. Always leave time in your day to shower in the morning/night (or in the morning and night), brush your teeth in the morning and night for two minutes (time yourself if you need to), and optionally (but not a necessity), shave.
 Many smelly dishes are prone to be irritating to others. Some buses and trains even have policies against this.

Try creating just a small wing if you do not want to look too dramatic, or go for a longer wing for a high drama look.

Just place the business card against the outer edge of your eyelid at an angle and trace along the edge with the liquid liner.You can also use tape to create wings. Place some tape on your lower lash line so that it is at an angle. The tape should be right up against the outer edge of your lower lash line and extending up towards your eyebrow. You can tilt the tape as much or as little as you want, but keep in mind that more tilt will look more dramatic. If you want a less dramatic look, reduce the amount of tilt in your tape.

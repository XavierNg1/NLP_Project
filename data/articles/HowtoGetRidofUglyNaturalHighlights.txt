 Is it light brown, with golden natural highlights? Dark brown with light brown ones? If the highlights aren't extremely prominent, you may have to look carefully, adjust the light around you or examine your locks for some time. Some highlights can be very subtle, not too far from the main colour. But you should be able to separate the two fairly easy - the highlights should show up in a certain light, and be in smaller sections. Identify both colours. The main colour is the color you'll be dying your hair.;
, Since you'll be darkening your hair, you most probably won't need a permanent dye. Brands like Herbal Essence create dyes that wash out in up to 6-8 shampoos. They usually take a bit longer than that, and are a great way to decide if that's the color you'd like to keep your hair. Shop around, if you're not completely sure, and ask friends and hairdresser's on their opinions about hair dye. Don't be roped into something extremely expensive that you don't need, but don't use a cheap dye and pay for it, either. Look for solid good brands if you don't want to use Herbal Essence. Be sure to pick a shade a little lighter/darker, but close enough to your natural colour. The colour on the dye box/package should be the same colour as your skin tone. When trying to dye over highlights, it's important to stay close enough to your natural colour.
 Although your hair doesn't need to be spotless before dying (a little oil protects the scalp), don't use too many hair products before dyeing. Test out the dye colour first by applying it to a few strands of your hair. If you're not completely satisfied with that color, go back and try a darker or lighter one, or try using Liquid Tide for a couple of days to lighten it. Rinse in cold water afterward, and your unattractive highlights are gone!

, Take good care of your hair and use a suited shampoo (perhaps colour enriching, if you like) and conditioner to enhance your colour and shine - as just one colour.

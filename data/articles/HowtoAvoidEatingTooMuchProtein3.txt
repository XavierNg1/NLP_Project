 Alongside eating the right amount of protein, you must ensure that youâ€™re getting the right type of protein. Overly-processed sources of protein can be high in preservatives, additives, and antibiotics, which do not make good fuel for your body. Skip the processed stuff when you can.Avoid:


Lunchmeat.
Lunchables.
Breakfast meat, like bacon and sausage.
Highly processed meats (such as fast food hamburgers and hotdogs).
 Your best bets for clean, lean protein are organic chicken and turkey and sustainably farm-raised fish. Include small portions of chicken and fish at least a couple of times a week.Bake salmon topped with Dijon mustard (40 grams of protein per 0.5 ounce fillet).
Use chicken breasts in soups and stews (43 grams protein per 1 cup chicken breast).
Use organic ground turkey in recipes instead of beef (27 grams protein per 100 grams of turkey).
 An effective way to avoid eating too much protein, while still getting the right amount of this vital building-block, is to give up meat altogether. Instead, you can get all the protein you need from plant-based sources.Make lentil stew or veggie chili with beans.
Sautee sliced tofu in olive oil and eat on a sandwich.
Include nuts and seeds in salads.
 You can also ensure that you consume the right amount of protein by choosing healthy snacks. Keeping snacks with you in case you get hungry will help you avoid making poor food choices. Ideas for foods to toss in your bag include:


Kind bars.
Mixed nuts.
Fruit, such as apples, oranges, or banana.
Chopped veggies with hummus or peanut butter.

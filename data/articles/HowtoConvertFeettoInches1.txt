 Converting feet to inches is quite simple. First, write out the number of feet you're dealing with. Label this number "feet" or "ft."It's helpful to follow along with a real-world example to see how feet are converted to inches. Let's say that you want to know how long the wall of your room is in inches. If the wall is eight feet long, start by writing this measurement down, like this:
8 feet;
, Next, multiply your number of feet by 12. Since there are 12 inches in every foot, this will give you your original foot measurement in inches.


In the example problem, you would continue by writing a "× 12" after the foot measurement, then multiplying to find the answer, like this:
8 feet × 12 = 96


, Don't forget to give your answer the label "inches" or "in." to specify that it is in inches.If you don't, your answer may be confusing to someone who reads it (and, if you're doing this for schoolwork, you may lose points.)


In the example problem, label your answer like this:
8 feet × 12 = 96 inches


, If you ever want to get your inch measurement back into feet, just do the reverse of the multiplication you did to get it in inches: in other words, divide it by 12. Don't forget to re-label your answer in feet.


To convert your answer in the example problem back into feet, divide it by 12 like this:
96 inches ÷ 12 = 8 feet

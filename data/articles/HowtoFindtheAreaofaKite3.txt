 The formula is A=xy2{\displaystyle A={\frac {xy}{2}}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the kite, and x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} equal the lengths of the diagonals of the kite., This information should be given to you. Make sure you are substituting for A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if your kite has an area of 35 square inches, your formula will look like this: 35=xy2{\displaystyle 35={\frac {xy}{2}}}.
 Substitute for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, if you know one of the diagonals is 7 inches long, your formula will look like this: 35=7y2{\displaystyle 35={\frac {7y}{2}}}.
 This will remove the fraction in the formula.

For example:35=7y2{\displaystyle 35={\frac {7y}{2}}}35×2=7y2×2{\displaystyle 35\times 2={\frac {7y}{2}}\times 2}70=7y{\displaystyle 70=7y}


, This will give you the length of the missing diagonal.

For example:70=7y{\displaystyle 70=7y}707=7y7{\displaystyle {\frac {70}{7}}={\frac {7y}{7}}}10=y{\displaystyle 10=y}So, the length of the missing diagonal of a kite, given an area of 35 square inches and one diagonal of 7 inches, is 10 inches.

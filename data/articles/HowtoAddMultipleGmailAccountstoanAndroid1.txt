 Tap the App Drawer button (icon made of small squares) at the bottom of your Android device’s home screen to open the App screen.;
, Inside the App screen you’ll find an item called “Email.” Tap this icon from the App screen to launch your device’s dedicated email client.


Note that the icon design of the email client varies depending on the manufacturer of your phone (e.g., Samsung, HTC, LG, etc.).
 During the first launch, the Set Up screen will be the one showing. Enter your Gmail account’s address (e.g., “johndoe@gmail.com”) and password on the text fields provided and tap the “Next” button to begin the setup.
 If your Android’s email client app allows you to set its notification settings, like with Samsung Android phones, just simply put a check mark on this option to either enable or disable notifications whenever you get a new mail. Tap the “Next” button to continue.
 Enter the name you like for the account you’ve just added so it would be easy for you to tell one from the other when you have several Gmail accounts working inside the app. Type in the name you like on the text field provided using your Android on-screen keyboard.
 Tap the “Done” or “Finish” button once you’ve reached the last page of the setup to complete the process and add the Gmail account.


The email app will then start downloading messages from the server.
 After adding the first Gmail account, press your Android’s menu button at the bottom of the screen and select “Settings” from the slide up menu.
 Inside the Settings screen, tap the “Add Account” button to start adding another Gmail account and the same setup screen displayed in Step 3 will appear.


From here on, all you need to do is to repeat Steps 3 to 6 to set up another Gmail with the email client app. Do this for every Gmail account you’d like to add.

 Australian Shepherds have beautiful thick coats. Because of the weight and length of their coat, they need to be brushed at least once a week, if not more. This helps reduce any tangles in the fur.By brushing your dog often, you help minimize shedding and keep their coat healthy.
A slicker brush works well with your dog’s thick coat. It will help remove dead hair.
 Since your Australian Shepherd has longer, thicker fur, regular bathing helps your dog’s coat stay free of mats and debris. You don’t need to bathe your dog every week. Bathe them every few weeks or when they get muddy or extremely dirty.You should also check and clean your dog’s ears. This helps remove wax and debris.

Brush your dog’s teeth regularly.
 Keep your dog’s nails short to help prevent cracking and keep their paws healthy. When trimming their nails, make sure not to trim the quick because this part is still alive. Give your dog a treat after trimming their nails.


If your dog won’t allow you to trim their nails, you can get their nails trimmed at the vet.

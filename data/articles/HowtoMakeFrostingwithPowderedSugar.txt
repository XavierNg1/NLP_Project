, Put 2 cups (226g) powdered sugar into a medium bowl. Whisk out any lumps.
 Add 3 tablespoons of cold milk to the sugar, and whisk until well-blended.









Add more milk if desired, for a thinner texture.If it's too runny, cream in a bit more butter and sugar.
 This recipe is so simple, it lends itself to creative experimentation.









Add lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon (2 or 3 ml) at a time, to taste, for a tangy sweet topping.
Add vanilla extract or other flavor extracts. Add 1/4 tsp almond extract for a perfect topping for bran muffins, or try the same amount of banana extract for banana bread.
 This optional step makes for for festive frosting to match any season:









3 or 4 drops of red for Valentine's Day.
3 or 4 drops of green for St. Patrick's Day.
Spring is all about fresh, light colors. Water down red, blue, green, and purple food coloring, then add in small amounts to to the frosting and create spreadable pastel-colored goodness for Easter cookies.
Make separate batches of red, white, and blue frosting for Independence Day celebrations.
For fall frostings, orange, yellow, and brown (orange with just a dab or two of green food coloring) will give your autumn cookies a seasonal glow. Add a bit of nutmeg or nutmeg extract to the frosting, for a delightful flavor!
Winter holidays are always better with white (no coloring) or pastel blue frostings. It may be cold outside, but on top of a butter cookie, these will bring a warm smile to almost anybody. Of course, separate batches of red and green frostings (and some sprinkles) will make Christmas cookie frosting fun for kids of all ages!

 You can become dehydrated when you have Zika, and having a fever can make dehydration even worse. Drink at least the minimum amount of water each day (8 cups of water per day is recommended as the minimum), if not more.


Drinking non-caffeinated tea and/or electrolyte sports beverages is also a good way to stay hydrated.
Stay away from coffee and alcohol as you recover because they will dehydrate you even more.;
, Try to get at least eight hours of sleep every night until you have recovered from Zika.


You may also want to take a few days off work and avoid any stressful or physically demanding activities as you recover.
Try some relaxing activities as well such as reading a good book, watching a program on TV, or listening to some soothing music.
 Since you will be relying on the natural strength of your immune system to fight off Zika, using strategies to boost your immune system may help. Be aware that there are no peer-reviewed studies supporting the use of supplements or vitamins to bolster your immune system. All evidence is anecdotal, so the following may or may not have an effect (but may be worth a try anyway).



Vitamin C. Take around 500 to 1000 milligrams of vitamin C daily to help boost your immune system.Zinc. The recommended daily intake of zinc for adult men is 11 milligrams and the recommended daily intake for women is eight milligrams.Garlic. Try drinking a tea made from a few cloves of crushed garlic or add a few cloves of minced garlic to your food each day.Echinacea. Drinking a few cups of Echinacea tea daily may help as well. You can also take 300 milligram capsules of Echinacea capsules three times daily.

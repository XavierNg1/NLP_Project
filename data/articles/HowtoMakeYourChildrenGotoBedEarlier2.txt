 Set a quiet mood in the house by turning the lights off early you can even have a candle light dinner. Follow this with a dimly lit bath time when your children prepare for bed. After bed time preparations, hand out flashlights to your children and have a story time in bed. All of this helps create a sleepy atmosphere in the house and can help your children fall asleep sooner., Try hiding all of your children's nighttime gear around the house; hide his or her pajamas on a coat rack, his or her toothbrush in the food closet, and his or her toothpaste in the refrigerator, for instance. Your child will have fun running around the house looking for all his or her nighttime gear, and it will help to get him or her ready for bed sooner., Tell your children that the last one into bed each night has a number of tasks to do: turn off all of the lights in the house, lock all of the doors (make sure to have an adult double-check the locks), and close all of the blinds. Make sure your children do not fight or cheat. This activity will help your children want to get in bed sooner by tiring them out!

, Simon says is a game where a person instructs someone to do something by saying "Simon says..." before the command. If the person does not say "Simon says" before a command, it is not valid. Before bed, say "Simon says find your favorite pajamas" and "Simon says brush your teeth". Go through the whole nightly routine like this to add some fun to bed time. Games such as this will help reduce your child's unwillingness to go to bed.
 Each time your children go to bed at the time you specify, give them a star. When a child has achieved five stars give them a gift, something like a candy bar or small toy. This will add incentive for the children to go to bed when you tell them to.

 If you have met the requirements, there will be an opening in the side.
 Go in the cave & keep going in one direction until Giratina is there. Here, it is level 70, has the moves Shadow Force, Earth-Power,Slash, & Heal-Block.
 Then, its just a matter of about 40 dusk balls, or less if you're lucky.

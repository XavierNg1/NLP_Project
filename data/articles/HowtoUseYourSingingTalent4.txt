 Talent competitions are not common, but they do happen from time-to-time in most communities. Check local news sources for information about a talent competition that might be coming up.


Area schools often have talent shows, if you are a student. Talent shows are also sometimes held as part of community events, such as fairs.
You can also look for televised talent shows, such as American Idol, America's Got Talent, X-Factor, The Voice, and Britain's Got Talent, to name a few. Oftentimes, these televised talent shows hold auditions in a variety of cities in the country in which they are filmed.
 You may be asked to submit an application, audition your talent, and/or meet certain requirements in order to enter. Be sure you know what you have to do to enter.Mark any dates for auditions on your calendar so that you do not miss them.
 Be sure to take time to choose the song you want to perform, learn the appropriate voice part for it, and practice it daily.


If you will need accompaniment for your audition and/or your performance at the competition, then be sure to regularly practice with that accompaniment, whether it be piano, guitar, or another instrument.
For televised talent shows, it is recommended to audition with a cover song, rather than an original song., Once you audition, and assuming that you are accepted, take time daily to practice. You may be performing the same song for the competition, or you may be selecting a different one. Either way, you need to practice.


Again, be sure to practice with accompaniment if you are using it.
 When the time comes, perform your song with confidence for your audience. Give it your best!

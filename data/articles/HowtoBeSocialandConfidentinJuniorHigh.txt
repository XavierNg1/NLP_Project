 You're probably nervous. Don't be. Just take a few deep breaths and when you go on that bus for the first day, sit down and relax.;
, Make sure you know where everything is that you will need in the morning.
 Sometimes it's hard to fall asleep when you're nervous. Just try to relax.
 Don't just wet your hair because you won't have much time drying it.
 Are you tired of your appearance? Well, try a new hair style and remove pimples. If you wear glasses, ask your parents if you can get some contacts. It doesn't matter the age you are to have contacts, it just depends on if you are mature enough to wear them. Remember to take them off at night. Although, You can be beautiful in glasses too.
 This will build character.
 That's how you will make friends. There's a lot of activities to choose from.
 Don't wait until someone says Hi to you. If you want to be social, just go up to a person and start a conversation. Like say Hey, are you in _th grade? What's your name? What classes are you in?

, It may be scary but just walk up to them and start talking to them in confidence. You can then bring up the question.. you may get turned down and you may not.. if you do then just don't let it get to you, just say "I tried". It's a lot better than wondering, "What would have happened?".
 Walk with your head held high, smiling, laughing or talking to your friends.

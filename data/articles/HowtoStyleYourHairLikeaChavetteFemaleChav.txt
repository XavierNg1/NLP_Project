 Try to get it really clean. This will give your hair a sleek and super-soft look and feel.;
, Dry it with a hairdryer until it is completely dry. Be sure to comb it through first.
 Get it as straight as you possibly can because it will make it look better.
 You may have to get hair extensions. It would be best to only try this hairstyle if you have longer hair.
 Make sure it is a straight as it can be.
 Do this by sliding both your hands round to the back of you head and grabbing all your hair. Slowly start lifting it upwards and smoothing down all the sides and the top of your hair as you lift. This will prevent bumps.
 If you have a fringe, use the hairspray to slick it back on top of your head.
 After slicking it back, jolt it slightly forwards to make a small coif-like bump. Spray it violently with hairspray!!! After some practice it should look really good!

, Once again, lightly spray all of your hair to keep it in place.

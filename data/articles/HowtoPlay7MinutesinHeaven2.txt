 If there are no rules limiting how far you can go when playing this game, it's a good idea to set some personal limits with the person you'll be sharing your 7 minutes in heaven with. If you don't, the other player might misinterpret the signals you are setting and go too far.You might say something like, "Can we just talk?" or "Let's talk first. I might be OK with a kiss, but I don't want to rush into it."
You could also establish a firm boundary by saying, "Kissing is OK, but I'm not OK with other touching.", Sometimes something will make you feel uncomfortable without you knowing it beforehand. When this happens, you should use straightforward language to tell the other player that you feel uncomfortable and want to stop.For example, if you are touched in a way you don't like, you could say, "No. I don't want to be touched there."
It can be difficult telling someone "No," but if you don't, things might go farther than you intended. You should never take part in something that makes you feel uncomfortable., This includes things like hand-holding, petting, or other kinds of touches that might exceed the personal boundaries of the other player. This way, you don't accidentally violate someone's boundaries without knowing.


It only takes a quick second to ask, "Is it OK if I hold your hand?" or "Is it alright for me to touch you like this?"

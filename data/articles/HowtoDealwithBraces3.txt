 When you're first adjusting to braces, eating can be difficult. You may find yourself struggling to chew and food may be harder to swallow. Chewing slowly can help you get a feel for how to eat with your braces. It can also cut down on cuts and other injuries.Try to make a habit of chewing a set number of times, like 10 times, for each bite.
You can also try to time how long it takes you to eat a meal. Strive to make every meal last 20 minutes, for example.
 At first, you should only eat softer foods when you have braces. Harder foods can be hard to chew and cause pain. Stick to things like mashed potatoes, soft fruits, soups, noodle dishes, and other foods that are easy to chew.This can be frustrating, but remember it's only temporary. The longer you have braces, the more comfortable you will be eating with them. Eventually, you'll be able to enjoy a wide variety of foods even though you have braces.
 Some foods should be mostly avoided while you have braces. Certain types of chewy or sticky foods can easily stick to your braces. Even after you've adjusted to your braces, you should still avoid the following:Gummy snacks
Foods with tough textures, like bagels and apples
Corn on the cob
Hard snacks like pretzels and nuts
Chicken wings, beef jerky, and wings
Pizza crusts
Pickles
Bubble gum

, At first, it can be frustrating not to enjoy the foods you love. However, remember to have patience. With time, people are able to adjust to their new braces. As pain decreases, and you get more comfortable chewing, you can enjoy a wider variety of foods while wearing your braces.

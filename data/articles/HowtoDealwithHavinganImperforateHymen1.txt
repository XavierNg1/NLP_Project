 Imperforate hymens are often diagnosed in newborn babies, but if not you might not notice a problem until you get your first period. If you have an imperforate hymen you will not have a normal period because the hymen is blocking the blood from coming out of the vagina. You will still have menstrual cramps, though, so if you have abdominal pain every month but no period you should get checked.You might also have other symptoms like back pain, difficulty urinating, or constipation.
Some girls will be able to feel a hard mass in the lower abdomen below the belly button, which is the menstrual blood stuck in the uterus.;
, Girls get their first period at a younger age now than girls used to in the past. The average age for first periods in the United States, for example, is 12 to 13 years old.Guidelines recommend seeing a gynecologist if you have not gotten your first period by age 14 1/2 to 16 1/2African-American girls often mature faster and get their periods a year earlier, whereas Caucasian girls tend toward the older end of that range., Other than going by age, you can watch for signs that your body is changing with puberty. Two big things that indicate puberty are needing your first real bra and getting armpit and/or pubic hair. At this point you will probably start your period within 3 to 6 months if you haven’t already. If you don’t get your period within two years of these changes, see your doctor.A "real" bra means one with a cup size attached to it, like 34B, as opposed to small, medium, or large.
, During a pelvic exam, your doctor will have you lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet in supports called stirrups. The doctor will assess your vagina by looking and feeling.


If it looks like you have an imperforate hymen, your doctor might do a test called a pelvic ultrasound to make sure there aren't any other problems causing your symptoms.Ultrasounds don’t hurt, it’s similar to how we look at babies in the womb!

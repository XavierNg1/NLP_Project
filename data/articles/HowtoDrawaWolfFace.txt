 The ears of a timber wolf have slightly round tips. There's fur inside the ear on each side and the ear is shaped almost like a triangle.;
, Â Cheek fur should be organized in a row of fur strands that point downwards. Head fur should point to the right or left but be almost flat.
 A wolf's muzzle is not too long but not too short, having thick black lips, a round, slightly triangle shaped nose with circular nostrils. The snout is blocky.
 The eyes are small and circular. They have a smaller round black pupil in the middle and are surrounded by something black called the wolf's conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is pointed at the end of the eye that leads to the snout but round at the other end of the eye.
 Draw some neck fur that points downwards.
 You should use colored pencil for better results if its hand drawn. The lines of coloring should point the same way the line art does and be thin. For shading, press the pencil down harder. The eyes of a timber wolf are usually bright yellow, but in rare cases they may become green or permanently stay blue.
 This can be whatever you want it to be.

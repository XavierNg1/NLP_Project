 All children exhibit some fidgety behavior, which helps them concentrate and perform complicated tasks. However, fidgeting can become problematic when it is disruptive and distracts others. If your child exhibits some fidgeting behavior but is not disruptive, it is best if you try not to curtail it.Forcing a child to not fidget will cause them to spend all of their mental energy trying to sit still and distract them from whatever task they are working on.
 Fidgetiness can be a hyperactive or impulsive symptom of ADHD. However, on its own, it is not an indication of the disorder. ADHD manifests as multiple reoccurring conditions. These symptoms tend to fall into two categories, inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, and include things like extreme restlessness, an inability to listen, forgetfulness, excessive talking, or talking out of order.In order for your child to be diagnosed with ADHD, they will need to exhibit at least six symptoms of the disorder in more than one setting, for at least six months.
 If you believe that your child has ADHD, you should visit a mental health professional and have them assessed. It is important that a professional evaluate your child in order to receive a correct diagnosis and course of treatment. A mental health professional will likely give you some strategies for handling your childâ€™s ADHD that may include things like medication or increased activity.In some instances, children with ADHD also have other disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, as well as behavioral issues like conduct disorder and oppositional defiance disorder. In order to help your child, it is important that a mental health professional diagnoses all of the disorders that they may suffer from.

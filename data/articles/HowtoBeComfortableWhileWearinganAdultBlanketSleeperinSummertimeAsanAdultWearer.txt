 With the exception being your normal underwear, consider wearing only your sleeper during these months and nothing else.;
, The cooler air can help keep your body slightly closer to normal air-temperature nearby. As long as the air has a large amount of surface area to cover, this can help immensely.
 Let the cooling system focus on that room first, before the cooling must occur in any other part of the house. Use other cooling methods for kids rooms, unless the cooling is a whole-house air conditioner.


Make sure the thermostat on the air conditioner is down to a temperature that is as low as the thermostat can possibly go, to ensure the cold air will be chilly enough to keep you at normal room-temperatures.
Consider closing off any doors that you may not be using at the current time. Even if you are in the room with the air conditioner, make sure all other doors that enclose the room can be closed most of the way or all the way.
 These smaller sized socks can help wick away moisture from your feet. If you wear a sock that's any higher, the sock would hold in more heat, and thereby help your feet sweat which can travel to your brain and cause the signals of "feet getting too hot" to become major signs. And if the blanket sleeper has Jiffy Grip-styled skidproof-bottoms, the socks can hold back the remainder of the moisture that will for sure accumulate at the bottom of the feet when you walk or do some activity that requires exertion on the feet., Most of your body's heat gets lost through the head (or so scientists make us believe), so why would you want to add more layer of latent heat to your ensemble in the process, when you in turn want to reverse that and loose some heat?

, Again, cotton can help wick away moisture, and even if you're not used to wearing no shirts to bed, cotton can help become an intermediate mediator over not wearing an undershirt at all while still keeping your body cool.

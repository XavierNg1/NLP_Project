 If you're not up for sewing and want a fast and easy bed skirt, you can use a fitted bed sheet instead. Simply put the fitted sheet over the box spring instead of the mattress, and tuck the elastic band along the bottom under the box spring. Voila! You've now successfully covered the box spring with a sheet that already matches your bedding and decor.Using a fitted bed sheet will not cover any space under the box spring, meaning that under-the-bed storage will be exposed.
 If you want the ruffled look and storage cover of a real bed skirt without the sewing, you can simply pin some fabric in place. Measure the distance around the perimeter of your bed and the height from the floor to the top of the box spring, and cut a long strip of fabric that meets these dimensions. Pin this in place using straight pins along the edge of the box spring. Put the pins on the top of the box spring, so that when the mattress is replaced, you can't see that your skirt is actually just pinned in place.
 The final easy no-sew alternative to a traditional bed skirt, is using a piece of fabric large enough to cover the entirety of the box spring and then drape to the floor. The best option for this, without spending loads of money? A regular dropcloth. A linen dropcloth will cover the entire space of a queen size bed or smaller, and have enough excess fabric to reach the floor. Just spread the dropcloth out over your box spring, and use pins to hold it in place around the perimeter. You're done!

, Myspace will ask for your email, first and last name, password, and other personal information. They are not trying to stalk you, they just want to know more about you. By answering these questions honestly and using your real name and most commonly used email address, you make it a lot easier for people to find you. After all, that's the point of Myspace, isn't it?

, A profile without a photo is like a sandwich without bread. A photo will be your face on Myspace. Ideally, you should choose a flattering picture of yourself. If this is impossible, feel free to be a bit more creative. For maximum safety, do not use a photo of yourself, but rather one of something you like. For example, you might use a picture of your favourite band (for all you music lovers out there) or a your favorite kind of cat (for all you pet lovers in this world of mysteries and evidential suspense).
 If you would like to invite some friends to make a Myspace as well, you have your opportunity now. But don't worry, you can skip this for now and go back to it later. Just remember, the more friends you have on Myspace, the more enriching your experiences there will be.
 Enter as much or as little information you feel comfortable sharing.
 You're officially a Myspace citizen and people from all over can now view and judge your life. Everything you ever wanted,right?

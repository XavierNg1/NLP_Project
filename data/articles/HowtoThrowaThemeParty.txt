 The size of the venue can determine the number of people, the function of the party, and the financial limits; which can determine the degree to which you will have to provide for your guests (will you be providing the food and drinks or will it be a potluck/BYOB?).;
, Whether it be a dinner party, a dance party, Halloween bash, a Sonic game party, etc.
 Sometimes the theme will come automatically to you, and you can just move forward from there. If you do not have a theme in mind, try brainstorming with all the hosts. If you cannot come up with a theme you can all agree on, a good way to compromise is to make a list of themes that none of you are opposed to, cut them up, place them in a container, and pick one at random. Or you could just use the first thing that comes to mind and turn it into a theme( ex. If you were thinking about summer Olympics you could have a party revolving around it).
 This includes food, beverages, decorations, and costumes. All of these things can run from simple things which bring the theme to mind, and to extravagant items that are undeniably related.
 Make sure that they're related to your theme!

 Before you season a non-stick pan, it’s a good idea to deep clean it to take off any stains or food particles that can be partially responsible for the pan’s stickiness. Begin by adding 1 cup (236.59 ml) water, 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) baking soda and ½ cup (118.3 ml) of white vinegar to the pan., Place the non-stick pan onto the stovetop over medium heat. Heat the pan until the vinegar mixture is boiling, about ten minutes, then take the pan off the heat., After you take the pan off the stove, pour out the vinegar mixture into the sink. Then wash the pan as usual with gentle dish soap, being sure not to use steel wool or other abrasive tools that can scratch the non-stick pan further., After washing out the pan, dry it with a soft dry cloth. It’s important to have a completely dry pan before you season it with oil so that the oil can stick to the surface of the pan.

 You want your classroom to be a calm environment, but you don’t want it to be boring. Be strategic about when to be an energetic teacher and when to be relaxed and serious.You should show the most enthusiasm when you are teaching content or engaging in content-related discussions with your students.
Be calm and controlled in periods that are not related to the lesson. This includes transitions, when students enter and leave the room, and when students misbehave.
 Children tend to misbehave when they are not interested in the lesson. Kids are less likely to be bored if they are engaged in what is going on in the classroom. Every lesson won’t be like a day at the amusement park, but you can mix things up to keep student interest alive. Prepare activities that are both educational and fun.Bring in review games, songs, videos, scavenger hunts, artistic projects, or pop culture related topics.
 Talk to your students in the beginning of the year to find out what kinds of things they enjoy. Do they like movies? What kinds of snacks do they like? How much do they care about their grades? Are they competitive? This will give you a sense of the kinds of incentives to create for learning.


For example, you can create a system where students are awarded points for exceptional behavior or outstanding work. Allow students to turn in their points at the end of the month in exchange for snacks, a movie voucher, or extra credit. Add more excitement by turning the point system into a competition., Always be on the lookout for good behavior. Create a positive environment by focussing on what students do well. Remember that praise should be genuine and truthful.For example, try saying, “I see you’re listening carefully, Alana,” or “Jordan is doing a great job focusing on his worksheet.”

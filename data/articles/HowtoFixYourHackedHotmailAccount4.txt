 If you think some of your mail has been deleted when your account was compromised, it may be recoverable. The “Deleted” button is one of your mail folders that appears in the sidebar on the left.
 Successfully recovered will be placed into the “Deleted” folder.


There is not a specified time range in which deleted emails can be recovered. Any emails that could not be recovered are lost forever., Messages that remain in the Deleted folder will get deleted and removed periodically. Moving the messages you want saved out of the Deleted folder will make sure that the emails are not lost again.

 Line a suitable sized box with chocolate holding trays or make your own small cardboard dividers and line with wax paper. Add a bow or other decoration to the box and seal.


If the truffles are already in mini paper cases, the wax paper or lining is not required unless it's for decorative effect.
 While truffle chocolates can be refrigerated (covered), it is better for taste if they are keep in a cool, dark and dry place and eaten at room temperature. However, if you're in a hot climate or room temperature, refrigeration is the safest option, as the truffles are made from cream.

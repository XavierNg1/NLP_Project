 Place your dominant foot forward slightly. Bend your knees, so that you could move your feet if you needed to, and hold your hands up near the top of your chest.;
, You want to stand in a T-formation, with solid posture through your back and shoulders. Flex your core muscles in as you try to execute the following punches slowly:


Do a jab. This is a swift punch aimed straight at your shadow's head. In boxing, it is used to stun, rather than deliver a knock out. You can do this with your right or left hands. Do a combination of a left jab and a right jab, while keeping your body tight and steady.






Do a straight punch. This is a punch with the right or left arm that is delivered with strong power. This is a knockout punch to your shadow's head.






Do a hook. A left or right hook should start with your fist near your chin. A right hook should go slightly to the right, before turning back in a leftward motion on your shadow's chin. The left hook should go in the opposite direction.






Do an uppercut. Drop down about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) by bending your knees, and then send a swift and strong punch upwards toward your "opponent's" chin.






Do straight punches to the body. Bend your knees slightly and aim punches to the left and right sides of your shadow's body.

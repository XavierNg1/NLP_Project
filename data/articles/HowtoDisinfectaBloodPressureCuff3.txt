 Consult the box or cuff to see if the manufacturerâ€™s guidelines. Some hospitals have special machine washers for cuffs. At home, you may be able to wash yours in a laundry machine. Do not machine wash if the manufacturer advises against it.


Do not put the tubing the washing machine. The tubing and inflated pump must be hand washed. You can clean the tubing by rinsing in warm soapy water and spraying down with rubbing alcohol. It is important that no water enters the tubing, as it will render it unusable.
 Choose a gentle laundry soap that will remove stains and fluids during the cycle. You can wash multiple cuffs in the same load.
 Warm water is better for cloth cuffs while cold water should be used for vinyl. Select a high or medium water level for the load. The water will rinse away bacteria and stains more effectively without damaging the cuffs. Do not use hot water. Hot water may form a protective layer for bacteria and could damage the material.
 Air-dry the cuffs by hanging them on a clothesline. Make sure both the outer and inner cuff are completely dry before use. Do not place cuffs in the dryer. Make sure the cuff is completely dry before reinserting the tubing. You may need to dry it overnight.
 Before you use the cuffs again, wipe down the cuffs with rubbing alcohol or a bleach solution. Let them sit for between ten and twenty minutes before patting dry. This will kill any remaining bacteria that may have survived the washing process.

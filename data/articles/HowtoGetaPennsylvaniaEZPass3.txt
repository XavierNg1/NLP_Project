 If you plan to travel immediately and don’t have time to wait for your application to go through, you can purchase an EZ-Pass transponder at select retail locations. It has an initial balance of $38, which includes $35 in prepaid tolls and a $3 initial annual fee. At some locations, an additional convenience fee may also be added.You can find E-ZPass Go Paks at participating Pennsylvania AAA offices, Turnpike Service Plazas, and the Harrisburg E-ZPass Customer Service Center.E-ZPass Go Paks are also available at select Walmart, Wegmans, Kuhn’s, Giant Eagle, GetGo, Acme, Karns, Giant, and Martin’s stores.
 Once you’ve purchased your Go Pak, you need to register the transponder to establish an E-ZPass account. You will need to provide the transponder number and PIN, as well as a credit card, e-mail address, and license plate number. You’ll also be able to set up online account access with a screen name and password.Keep in mind that you must register your transponder within 72 hours of purchase.
You don’t have to choose to have your account automatically replenished with a credit or debit card. Instead, you can opt to manually replenish it when necessary. However, you need to pay a deposit for the transponder. Contact the E-ZPass Customer Service Center to discuss your options.
 Once you’ve registered the transponder, you need to place it in your car, so you’re ready to the hit the road. Go Paks include interior transponders, which should be placed on the windshield, behind the rear mirror and below any tinting.To ensure that the transponder adheres well to the windshield, clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol. Make sure to dry it with a clean, dry cloth before mounting, though.
The transponder is self-adhesive, so you only need to remove the clear plastic strips from the back to install it.
The E-ZPass logo should be upright and facing you when you install the transponder.

 Just jiggle it around a bit on one side (the part where it is twisted). Don't unwrap the end! The Smarties just need a bit of wiggle room to move around. The wrapping should remain mostly intact.;
, You can do this with your hands in a back and forth motion or with a hammer, mortar and pestle, your shoe, or anything heavy. Watch for a powdery substance to form that you can see clearly. Do this to all the candies in the package.









Once the smarties have produced a fair amount of dust, you're ready. Grind it for one or two minutes, experiment, then retry with the remaining chunks of Smarties.
 Flatten it out and place your mouth on this end. Suck in with your breath and let the powder get on the top of your throat. You don't want the dust in the bottom of your lungs -- just in your mouth. Smartie dust is not the same as oxygen.









You want to flatten out the end so the Smarties that are still in chunks stay in their packaging and don't get lodged in your throat. It's smoking with Smarties that's the goal, not choking on Smarties.
 You should see a bit of a fog produced. This looks just like smoke -- the Smarties lose their color when ground. Unfortunately, because pink and blue smoke would be awesome. Alas, you'll have to settle for normal wisps of white smoke.

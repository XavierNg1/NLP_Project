 Don't let your emotions become the story by blowing your top or breaking down in tears; if you overreact, you'll only end up embarrassing yourself and end up digging a deeper hole. If you stay calm, chances are high that those around you will stay calm as well.


Even if you know what you did was wrong, don't reveal it by showing strong emotion.
Try taking a few deep breaths before you say anything.
 Have you ever seen a performance, and known that a performer made a mistake, only by the way the performer reacted to it? There is a chance that no one but you knows what went wrong, but if you react to the mistake then everyone will know. Pretend instead that it was all part of the plan.


For example, if your parents accuse you of staying out past curfew, act like you didn't realize it had gotten so late.
Keep a straight face, and act slightly surprised if they push the issue.
 A good explanation of why you were doing what you were doing determines whether it is believable or not. In forming a good story, consider these factors:


Keep it simple. Don't make up something that sounds extraordinary. For example, if you were out past curfew, you could say you kept hitting red lights.Make sure it is a story you can stick to. Changing your story is one of the biggest signs that you were lying.
 Maybe a good story will help you cover your tracks the first time, but eventually you'll be seen as someone who isn't trustworthy. When you're caught doing something wrong, it's usually best to own up to it.

 Mix food coloring with water, until the water is a deep, rich shade of green. Pour the water into your vase.


Cut the ends of your flowers under running water, and then stick your carnations inside the vase the night before your celebration. The flowers will soak up the food coloring during the night, making the petals green.
 You should find your favorite sugar cookie recipe and work with that. Buy small green sprinkles, a round cookie cutter and a clover stencil.


Mix your dough together, roll it out on a cutting board and cut out rounds that are about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thick. The cookie cutter should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.
Place the clover stencil over each round and sprinkle the green sugar sprinkles in the area inside the stencil. Transfer each round to the baking sheet. Repeat until all your sugar cookies have green shamrocks in the center. Bake according to the recipe's directions.

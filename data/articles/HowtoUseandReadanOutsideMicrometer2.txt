In between those whole numbers are three lines that represent twenty-five thousandths of an inch; in decimal form, it would look like .025.
The thimble has evenly spaced lines that represent one-thousandth of an inch; in decimal form it would be .001.
Above the whole number scale on the sleeve are lines that measure to ten-thousandths of an inch; in decimal form it looks like .0001.
 The last visible number will read as the thousandths. For example, if the last number you can see on the sleeve is 5, then it would read 5 hundred thousandths, or .500. ‚Äù

, Look at the individual markings exposed next to the 100 thousandths and multiply each marking by .25.. In this case 1 x .025 would be .025.
 If it's closest to 1, then it would be .001.
 In this case it would be .500 + .025 + .001 = .526.
 Read that line that lines closest with the sleeve. If, for example, it lines with 1, then the measurement will will read .5261

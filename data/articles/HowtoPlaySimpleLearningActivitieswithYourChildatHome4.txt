 Not gambling... you don't want to create a bad habit.
 The child will grow up understanding them and will not need to "memorize" terms like "Equivalent", "equals", "Probability", "Chance" later on.
 into geometric shapes with plastic cutters, etc. You can bake them after they are shaped up.
, Say and show, "Two fourths make one half."

Fold paper 1/4 in half again and talk about "1/2 of 1/4 is 1/8" -- as the words, not as the numerals; just say: "one half of one fourth is one eighth". Say and show how, "Two eighths make one fourth."


"Pizza Math:" Slice pizza or cake, etc. in half and then ask:

Talk about "1/2 of 1/2 is ____?" . Explain that "each of the 4 pieces is one fourth".

Have them prove it... by slicing "half of the two halves" and then talk about two 1/4's makes ____? . Let them count all the 4 pieces created; say, "Each of the 4 pieces is one fourth of the whole pizza", and then talk about two 1/4's makes ____? Talk about "1/2 of one fourth" is ____? Have them prove this, too... by slicing each fourth into halves of the four fourths. Let them count all the 8 pieces created; say, "Each of the 8 pieces is one eighth of the whole pizza", and then talk about two 1/8's makes ____? .
 But, "No!" it is one fourth. The "th" which makes a soft "thuh" sound may sound silly or like you are not speaking clearly.
Explain the sound of a "four" compared to a "fourth" as simply as possible (not even mentioning the spelling for a young child).
Don't try to make them say "thuh" -- if it may be too hard to make that sound, just explain lightly and quickly! Move on to more simple, fun activities, of course...


Say "'One out of four' or 'one of the four' equal parts of pizza" (for example) to be clear in grouping parts as fractions of a larger thing which is very different in meaning from "one group of four things" which are not in that case being interpreted to represent fractions. This should be explained and understood clearly after the child is getting the idea.See fractions as pieces of the "same size of circle":

, Make them carefully.


Draw dividing lines for equal fractions across from side to side, exactly through the center to make fractions of the circular pizzas.
Out of one pizza circle, draw and cut 2 equal parts and say that each is called one half (not one, two). Later they can learn to write 1/2, but now it is probably oral, by word of mouth.

Use the second pizza shape to draw and cut 4 equal parts so that each is called one fourth (not one, four) and written as 1/4.
Use the last circular pizza shape to draw and cut 8 equal parts called one eighth (not one, eight") and written as 1/8.



Allow (coach) the child to place 2 of "1/8" size on top of 1 of the "1/4" size to see that those quantities are equivalent. So 2/8 = 1/4 and also 1/4 = 2/8.
 Use pieces to lay on top of an equivalent larger piece as explained above. Or, lay the 1/4 on top of the 2/8 (made of 2 of 1/8 pieces). Celebrate a little for a getting and demonstrating the right answer.
 . 2 pieces of the 8? 2/8 = ??? , 3 pieces out of 8 equal pieces is called ??? and 4 pieces makes 4/8 = four eighths = regroups to make what? Have him or her prove it with equivalent pieces. Smile and laugh and do a dance when it is done.
 Have him or her prove it with the pieces. Smile and laugh and do high fives. as a reward.
 Say, "Prove it!" Smile, laugh -- and shout, "Hey! Right!" or something to celebrate.See fractions as pieces of the "same size of shape":

, Now redo all of the pizza math from above... Squares have all four sides equal and all corners are 90 degrees, called right angles.


Why are they called right angles? Well, if the angle of a building's walls compared to its "level" floor is not 90 degrees, then that would not be right! It would not stand "upright".

If a building has "plumbed" walls (perfectly vertical) and level floors and ceilings (perfectly horizontal) then that is usually what is wanted: so that is "Right!", ie: not wrong... That's where the word comes from.
 Be careful to divide it into equal rectangles. Rectangular shapes have different length compared to the width.
 Divide the candy bar in equal pieces as before.

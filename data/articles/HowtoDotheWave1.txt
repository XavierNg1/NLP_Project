 You need to be present at a sports game to truly create the wave. It doesn’t matter the caliber of the sporting event you’re attending. If there are bleachers and fans, you can start the wave.


Professional and college games tend to have the most team spirit, but high school and middle school can also pass. It only matters how willing the crowd is feeling.;
, An easy way to begin momentum for a wave is by having a group of willing participants. The wave is completed smoother when more audience members know about the wave. Make a plan with your group to talk to the surrounding people in the stands.


Talk to a group of friends you're planning to go with.
 To help inform the people in your section, you’ll need to project your voice. Consider using a megaphone so you don’t have to strain your voice., The best ways to start a wave is to stand in a visible spot in front of your section. From this front spot, you can coordinate with the audience members in your section.


It helps your chances of reaching more members, if you coordinate with the audience with a group., Now it is time to countdown to the audience. You need to tell the audience, “do the wave in 3-2-1.” After counting down throw your hands up. If you have a group helping you, other people could be in the aisles. Once you start counting down make sure your group is synchronized.
 Even after organizing, it can take a few tries to get a successful wave started. Stay in front of the audience and try again. Wait about a minute until trying again. If you’ve tried three or more times, the crowd might not be into it.


When your team is performing poorly or there is low morale, it can be hard to start a successful wave.

A good squeegee rubber is the first and most important tool of the trade. Squeegee blades are cheap, change them often.
Always start the job with a clean scrubber or lamb’s wool applicator.
Scraper blades are changed at the beginning of each day.
Every job also gets a fresh clean bucket of soapy water.
Last but not least are two lint free towels. One will be used to dry your squeegee after each pull and the other is for your final detailing of the corners and window sills.;

Pressing too hard or not hard enough will both leave streaks. They are heavy enough that not much extra pressure is needed.
For the beginner pulling from side to side is best.
The top of the squeegee will lead at an angle so the water runs down the glass. Meaning it’s ahead of the bottom of the squeegee.
 If you don’t dry your rubber you’ll have too much water on your next pull and that will leave streaks and rubber marks.

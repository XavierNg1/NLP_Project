That is, if you work out regularly, you will see better results than if you work out only occasionally., People usually immediately think of doing Sudoku or Crossword puzzles to keep their brains sharp, but these "brain exercises" are actually less efficient at challenging your brain than carrying on a conversation. A conversation forces you to listen, absorb information, and process it in order to form a response., The more often you do something, the less challenging it becomes. If you can decorate a cake without even thinking about it, it is requiring very little from your brain.

Faking interest isn't going to challenge your brain., Our brains are encoding (or forming memories) during our waking hours and are vulnerable to all sorts of distractions. Until your brain turns that new information into a long-term memory, those everyday distractions can lead to the loss of the information. Sleep is the perfect environment for your brain to process and turn your new memories into long-term information.Napping between study sessions is a good way to let your brain absorb everything you just learned.

 This exit code signals that you're about to dial an international phone number.


You'd dial the same exit code if you were calling from Canada, but other countries have their own exit code. For example, 00 is the exit code for most of Europe.;

The country code stays the same, no matter where you're calling from.
 In Belgium, large cities are assigned 1-digit area codes, and 2-digit area codes apply to other areas. Examples of major Belgium area codes include:


Major cities: Brussels, 2; Antwerp, 3; Gent, 9.
Other areas: Hasselt, 11; Leuven, 16; Kortrijk, 56; Ostend, 59; Charleroi, 71; Verviers, 87.
Cell phones: Belgian cell phone numbers start with 04. But if you're dialing in from the United States, leave off the "0" and dial only 4, then the rest of the mobile number.



The area code and phone number usually add up to a total of 8 digits. If you dialed a 1-digit area code, the phone number will contain 7 digits. If you dialed a 2-digit area code, it's followed by only 6 digits.

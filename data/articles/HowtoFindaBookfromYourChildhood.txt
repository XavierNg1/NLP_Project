 Anything that you remember about it is worth detailing. The librarian may be able to assist with looking for the book using a card file or may now search using the library computer. Sometimes the librarian knows the book.;
, Hopefully, one of the books will be the lost book.
 Do a search by topic. A trip to a used bookstore is another way to search for a lost book. Look through various book titles in the children's section.
 They may remember the title which is all you need to know. Your parents might remember too as they will have read stories to you, or might even have kept copies of your books.
 The Internet is a great source. Try using Google and type in the part that you remember, or part of that, in double quotes. A correct return might just happen!

Common applications include ceiling or hallway light switches, a cellar or attic light, a ceiling fan or chandelier, or an outdoor patio light.
A single-pole wall switch usually has a lever or toggle that completes the circuit when it is flipped up to turn a light, device, or appliance on.
When the toggle is flipped down, the circuit is broken, and the power goes off.
Single-pole switches have 2 brass terminal screws on the side, and newly purchased switches usually have a ground wire.;

Locate your circuit breaker box and the circuit breaker specific to the switch to be wired.
Turn off that circuit breaker.



Remove the faceplate from the switch with a screwdriver.
Touch a non-contact voltage detector near each of the 2 screw terminals.
If the voltage detector lights, electricity is still on, and you are at risk, so return to the circuit breaker to determine if it is off and/or if it is the correct circuit breaker.
If the voltage detector does not light, the electricity is off, and you can proceed.



Measure the height, width, and depth of the electrical box in place to determine if your new light switch will fit.



Keep the wires separate; the wire from the top terminal should be positioned differently from the wire from the bottom terminal.
,


Use needle-nose pliers to shape a loop at end of each wire.
Place loops over terminals and tighten terminal screws with screwdriver.



Attach the ground wire to the ground post in the box.
Clip a grounding clip to the bottom edge of the box if there is no grounding post.



Try to fold the wires like an accordion to avoid crowding.

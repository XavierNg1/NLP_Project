 Allow the bamboo to dry completely.
 All bamboo has this layer, and it will prevent the bamboo fibers from accepting the stain. Pay particular attention to the rough areas of the bamboo that may be difficult to get to. If you leave any of the waxy layer, the bamboo will accept stain in some areas, but not in others. This will give the bamboo a mottled look.


Be aware that sanding the bamboo will change the character of the bamboo since it removes the bamboo's natural sheen and reduces the nodes.
If the bamboo you desire to stain has been left out in the weather for several months, it may have turned a light gray color. Bamboo that has been weathered has lost its tough, waxy outer layer and will readily take a stain, varnish, or paint.
, Pay attention to the node areas.


If you find that the bamboo is not taking the stain, wipe off the extra stain with a rag and allow the area to dry. Try re-sanding the area and then re-stain.
 Add several coats as needed to get the desired color.

,, Gently move the torch back and forth down the length of the bamboo until the desired color is reached.


Work in 6-inch sections, and turn the bamboo as needed. Work all the way around before moving on.
Finish with a wax paste to add shine to the bamboo and preserve it.

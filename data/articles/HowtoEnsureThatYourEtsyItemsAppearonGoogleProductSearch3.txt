 Using keywords and phrases in your content enable shoppers to find your Website via search engines such as Google. A Website that is optimized for search engines has more chances of being displayed in earlier search results.
 This convenient tool will help you find the best performing keywords and phrases.


Launch Google’s Keyword Tool.
Type keywords or phrases in the Word or Phrase box. Enter only one keyword or phrase per line.
Fill out the CAPTCHA form. You have to do this in order for the service to know that you are not a robot.
Click the Search button. The Keyword Tool will automatically reveal how often your keywords are searched and how well they are performing in the market.
Go through the list to find similar keywords that present better search results.
 Enter your keyword in Etsy’s search bar. This will bring up a list of suggested keywords, which customers use to find similar products.


You can also use major search engines such as Google and Bing to conduct similar keyword searches.
 Include the main keyword at the beginning of your product item title. This will help search engines to easily find and match your title for keywords.
 Do not stuff your title with too many keywords. It may appear boring or will not make sense to both search engines and your visitors.


Incorporate your keywords and phrases in the most natural-sounding way within your Website content.
 Use tools such as SpyFu or SEMRush to understand what keywords your competitors are using. Then use similar high-performing keywords in your own content.
 Check your Etsy shop stats to know about your shop’s sales, user behavior, visitor traffic and more.

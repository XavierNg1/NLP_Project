 Locate the Bitcasa app on your Android device. It’s the app with a green background with a house on a cloud drawing. Tap on it to launch it.;
, Tap the “Log In” button found at the bottom of the screen. You will be brought to the Login screen. Enter your Bitcasa email address and password, then tap the “Log In” button.
 After successfully logging in for the first time, you will be welcomed with a camera backup option. The menu “Keep Your Camera Backed Up” will appear.


The purpose of this menu is for you to enable the camera backup functionality so all your photos and videos on your Android device will be backed up and stored in the cloud.
Toggle or enable the first option in the menu for “Automatic Camera Backup.”
This method is only applicable during your first time to log in. If you’re already logged in or have already previously logged in on the same Android device, do Method 2 instead.
 The second option is for enabling the use of cellular data. If you’d like Bitcasa to continuously connect to the cloud and upload all new photos and videos right away, enable this option.


Do note that doing this will eat up your data plan and will probably cost you money.
If you leave this off, automatic camera backup is still enabled, but it will only be done when you are connected via Wi-Fi. This is the cheaper option, though you will have to hold on to your new photos and videos while you’re not connected online yet.
 After enabling “Automatic Camera Backup,” you can also upload all existing pictures and videos from your Android device. Tap the tick box for “Also upload existing pictures & videos” to do so.
 Once done, tap the Go Home link found at the bottom left side of the screen. You will be brought to Bitcasa’s main screen, which gives you easy access to major categories of your files.

 Cut your peaches into thin slices and place those into a saucepan on the stovetop. Add the sugar and the two cups of water (16.65 fl oz.), bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer. Use a spoon to press and squash the peaches to release more juices. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Then cover the pan and allow the syrup to steep for a half-hour., Pour the other 16 cups of water (133.23 fl oz) into a pot. Bring it to a boil. Add your tea bags or loose tea. Steep your tea for four to five minutes. If using loose tea, pour the tea through a strainer into a pitcher. Otherwise, throw out the tea bags and pour the tea directly into a pitcher.If making iced tea, place the pitcher in the refrigerator to start cooling it down until the simple syrup has finished steeping.
 Once your syrup has steeped for 30 minutes, set a container on the counter. If the opening is narrow, set it in the sink in case you spill any syrup as you pour. Pour the syrup through a strainer into the container.The sliced peaches can either be discarded or used as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, ice cream, yogurt, or whatever you like.
 Pour the simple syrup into your pitcher of tea and stir to combine. Alternately, serve the tea by itself to guests, with the simple syrup on the side. Allow each to add as much syrup as they like.Also consider slicing additional peaches to add to each glass for more flavor.
To serve cold, add ice and/or allow the tea to refrigerate for a while after brewing.

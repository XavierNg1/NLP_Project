 If the ingrown nail is minor, you can lift the nail yourself. Soak the nail to soften it, and then place something underneath the nail to help separate the nail from the skin so it can stop growing into the skin. Try putting clean bits of cotton gauze or cotton balls or dental floss underneath the edge of the ingrown fingernail.If you are using cotton, take a small piece of cotton and roll it between your fingers so that it forms a cotton tube about ½ inch long. It shouldn’t be too thick, but thick enough to lift the nail away from the skin.
Tape one end of the cotton tube on the side of your finger. Lift the corner of the ingrown nail up and out with the opposite hand. Work the free end of the cotton tube under the corner of the nail and out the other side so that the cotton is between the skin and the nail and lifts the nail away from the skin.
This can be painful and it can be awkward. The taped end is there to help you maneuver the cotton tube under the corner of the nail. You may need someone’s help in placing the cotton.;
, You can use a dab of a topical antibiotic ointment on your finger to prevent infections. Spread the ointment over the area with a clean Q-tip, then cover with a clean bandage.You should change the bandage and apply more antibiotic ointment daily.
 Infected ingrown fingernails can cause a lot of pain. To help with this, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for daily dosages.Try acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen sodium (Aleve) to help with pain.

 A triangular prism has two identical triangular sides and three rectangular faces. To find the surface area, you must calculate the area of all of the sides and add them together. The surface area of a triangular prism is SA = 2A + PH, where A is the area of the triangular base, P is the perimeter of the triangular base, and h is the height of the prism.For this formula, A is the area of a triangle which is A = 1/2bh where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height.

P is simply the perimeter of the triangle which is calculated by adding all three sides of the triangle together.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.
 The area of a triangle is 1/2b*h where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. Because there are two identical triangle faces we can multiply the formula by two. This makes the calculation for both faces simply, b*h.The base, b, equals the length of the bottom of the triangle.
Example: b = 4 cm

The height, h, of the triangular base equals the distance between the bottom edge and the top peak.
Example: h = 3 cm

Area of the one triangle multiplied by 2= 2(1/2)b*h = b*h = 4*3 =12 cm

, To finish the surface area calculation, you need to know the length of each side of the triangle and the height of the prism. The height is the distance between the two triangular faces.


Example: H = 5 cm

The three sides refer to the three sides of the triangular base.
Example: S1 = 2 cm, S2 = 4 cm, S3 = 6 cm


, The perimeter of the triangle can be calculated simply by adding up all of the measured sides: S1 + S2 + S3.


Example: P = S1 + S2 + S3 = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 cm


, Remember, the height of the prism is distance between the two triangular bases. In other words, multiply P by H.


Example: P x H = 12 x 5 = 60 cm2


, You will need to add the two measurements from the previous two steps together to calculate the triangular prism's surface area.Example: 2A + PH = 12 + 60 = 72 cm2.

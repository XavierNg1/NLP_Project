 Just as the joker has the freedom to tell jokes, you have the freedom to protest and discuss consequences. Take a deep breath, excuse yourself to the restroom if need be, and compose yourself. Then state the problem as clearly and politely as possible.


For jokes about inappropriate subjects, you can tell the Joker, "please don't joke about that; it's kind of a sensitive topic for me."

, Understand that your intentions may be misunderstood as well, so be careful of engaging in potentially hurtful teasing.Model the type of behavior you'd like others to adopt.


If you aren't sure how to engage in humor without possibly offending others, try making fun of yourself. Self-depricating humor actually helps to put others at ease and reduces tension., If the tone of banter has gotten too negative or abusive, pause the dialogue. Explain you feel the interaction is headed in a problematic direction and propose rules to right course. You can suggest topics to be off limit and even establish consequences for violating the terms of the parley.


Making a game of setting rules will change the direction of the conversation without dragging down the intended tone.

 Locate your minecraft.jar folder in //AppData/Roaming. Next, simply right-click the minecraft.jar file. Create a new folder (you may want to call it Minecraft Backup) anywhere on your hard drive and paste the minecraft.jar file into this new folder.

Remember to download the version of Modloader that matches your version of Minecraft. For example, if you have Minecraft 1.5, be sure to download Modloader 1.5.

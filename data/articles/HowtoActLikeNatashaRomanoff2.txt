 Natasha's hair is naturally red/auburn; if you wish you can dye your hair or wear it straight or curled. As long as you look well-kept and clean, there is nothing to worry about. Some appearance suggestions would be:


A black PVC zip-down jumpsuit/catsuit with the S.H.I.E.L.D logo on both of the upper arms, black boots, and a utility belt containing her various spy gear;
A beige leather jacket, silver arrow necklace, white t-shirt, black jeans, and high-heeled brown boots (Captain America: The Winter Soldier);
A red t-shirt with a black sweater over the top, a beige leather jacket (different to the one worn in Captain America 2), black jeans, and black heeled ankle boots;
A black cocktail dress (Iron Man 2)
Getting booked in for a haircut; a trim and clean-up will do;
A french manicure or painting your nails with clear polish (make sure your nails are short but not bitten - long nails would break on spy missions!);
Pale pink lipstick or chapstick, with a little foundation and mascara.
 Natasha is often running towards danger or fighting danger. Go jogging or running, and lift weights to improve your arms. Learning how to fight is not recommended, but a useful skill if you want to be as much like the Black Widow as possible. Suggestions would be karate, kickboxing, or Muay Thai martial arts.

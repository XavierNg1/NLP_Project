 Bring your kite down and turn it so your friend can grab it. Your friend should then grab the kite by the inflated edge and put it down with this edge on the ground. They should then place your board or a weights bag on the kite to stop it blowing around too much in the wind.;
, Take off your harness, walk up to your kite and disconnect all of the lines. Take the bar and grab the two outside lines on it and hold them in the middle. With your other hand, grab the rest of the lines and wrap them in a figure of eight around the bar.
 Remove the weight from your kite and flip it over so the inflated edge is pointing upwards. Undo all of the valves to let the air out. Once the kite is flat again, fold one wing tip over and then just simply roll your kite up till you get to the middle and then repeat this the other side. To hold your first roll in place use your board. Now you can fold your kite to fit bag in your bag.

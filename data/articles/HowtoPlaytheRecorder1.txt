 If you are a complete beginner, you can start by purchasing an inexpensive plastic recorder. Plastic recorders are usually used for teaching school children, as they require very little effort to maintain.


Once you have mastered the basics and you are still interested in playing, you can consider upgrading to a more expensive, wooden version. Wooden recorders tend to have a more pleasant tone than their plastic counterparts, but are considerably more difficult to care for.
Both wooden and plastic recorders can be found at good musical instrument stores, or online.;
, Recorders usually come in three parts, the top part which has the mouthpiece, the middle part with finger holes and the bottom part which has a bell shape. Gently twist the pieces together.


The bottom piece should be turned so the hole is slightly to the right when viewed as you would play it.
Some recorders, typically those used in schools, are only one piece.
 Pick up the recorder and place the mouthpiece on your lips. Gently hold it between your lips and balance it with your fingers. Remember to put your left hand at the top.


The back side with one hole should face you. The front side should face away from you.
Do not bite the mouthpiece or allow it to touch your teeth.

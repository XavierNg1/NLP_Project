 CMS uses notes, rather than in-text citations, to cite references. Place a superscript as soon as possible after the quote or clause being referenced. The corresponding note (either a footnote at the bottom of the page or an endnote at the end of the chapter or book) should include the following:


Author's full name, followed by a comma. If the note is the second citation for this particular work, include only the author's last name, followed by a comma. Use the same method for listing multiple authors of the same volume.
The textbook's title as it appears on the title page, written in italics, followed by a comma. If this is the second citation for this particular work, use an abbreviated version of the title.
Next comes the following information contained within parentheses: the textbook's place of publication, followed by a colon, followed by the publishing company, followed by a comma, followed by the date of publication. Example: (New York: Penguin, 1999). If this is the second citation for this particular work, omit this information entirely.
Page number, or range of page numbers separated by an en-dash, followed by a period. Example: 99â€“104. The same format is used for succeeding references to the same work.
 Include all of the following information, or as much as is available to you, in the bibliography:


Author's name, last name first, ending with a period. If there are multiple authors, list them in the order they appear on the title page, separated by commas (including a terminal comma). Preface the last author's name with "and."
The textbook's title as it appears on the title page, written in italics. End with a period. If the book is not a first edition, include the edition number after the title, but not italicized. End with a period. Example: 2nd ed.
City of publication, followed by a colon, then the publisher's name, followed by a comma, then the year of publication followed by a period. For example: New York: Dover, 2003.

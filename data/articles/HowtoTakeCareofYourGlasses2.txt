 When you take off your glasses, use both hands to remove each temple (or arm) of the glasses from behind your ears. This prevents your glasses from becoming misaligned.


Do not push your glasses on top of your head when you are not wearing them. This could also cause them to become misaligned., Touching the lenses can leave fingerprints and smudges behind. When you handle your glasses, touch only the temples of the frames, not the bridge. This will prevent any accidental contact.
 Even clean surfaces can leave scratches on lenses. When you set your glasses down, make sure that they are resting on the temples, not on the frames. The frames should be facing up.Do not leave your glasses on a cluttered, wet, or dirty surface such as a bathroom counter.Soft cases are often made of a microfiber cloth that can be used to clean off occasional smudges.
 There are certain situations when you should not wear your glasses. Keep your glasses in their case until you are finished. These situations include:


SportsShowering

 Your ascot should stand out in your outfit, and therefore should contain different colors or patterns. Patterned ascots are currently very popular among men that want to add a sophisticated spark to their outfit.
 Every man walking around the financial district of your town is wearing a standard black suit, so how do you stand out? By adding an ascot! Personalize your suit to fit your style by using your ascot as a statement piece. Any color or pattern can be used to jazz up your standard black and white suit.
 If a suit isn't your thing, sport an ascot with casual apparel to relax the class a bit.


Shirt: Short or long-sleeve button-up shirt. Choose a light, solid-colored shirt to help make your ascot stand out. You can also wear a polo shirt on top, just make sure that the material does not clash with your silk ascot. Unbutton your top at least one button to allow room for tucking your ascot into your shirt. You won't always need a jacket, but when you do, add a V-neck blazer over your shirt.







Pants: Sport jeans with your ascot. A dark wash pair of denim jeans is perfect for a polished look that transitions well from day to night. For an even more casual look, you can rock some lightly destroyed jeans, but try to maintain a dark wash. Light wash jeans tend to clash with the fancy look of an ascot.







Shoes: Here's where you can get creative depending on the time of day or type of event you are building an outfit for. For a formal, nighttime event, wear black or brown leather dress shoes. For a daytime affair, opt for a more casual look with a pair of topsiders, cloth or brown leather. You can choose a colored pair of topsiders that compliments your ascot, but be sure that your ascot and shoes aren't exactly the same color and don't have clashing patterns.

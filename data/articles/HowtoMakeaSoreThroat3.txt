 You can't suddenly come down with a horrible sore throat. Plant a seed the night before by going to bed a little early. Just let them know you're not feeling so great. When you wake up the next day with a sore throat, it won't seem like just a convenient excuse to get out of your plans.
 A sore throat is not usually a sign of severe sickness, and you can usually tough it out if you want to be somewhere.However, if you come down with a sore throat when you have choir practice or to clarinet lessons, it can be very difficult to perform such tasks. If you just want to get out of going to class or your uncle's house, you might want to catch something more severe.
 You want to make it seem like you're willing to go, if it wasn't for this horrible affliction. Instead of whining and refusing to get out of bed, get up and get dressed.
 Only do this to ask your parent to make you some tea or if you have any medicine for a sore throat. If your parent sees how uncomfortable you are they will want you to do whatever it takes to get better.
 If your parents make you go, keep the performance going anyway until the next day. The worst thing you can do is to blow your cover just because you didn't get out of it. If you do, your parents will always suspect you of faking an illness.


If your parents say you can stay home, then congratulations. Unfortunately, if they are home, too, then you need to spend the rest of your day playing sick so they don't figure out you lied.

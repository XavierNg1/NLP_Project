 House is a such a good Diagnostician because he is able to see very subtle clues about people and be able to determine underlying factors from them.
 It is very rare that House does not have a snappy comeback for something.
 Make sure it is true sarcasm and not simply adding, "...not!" to the end of phrases or starting them with "NO!" in an over-the-top way.
 Say what is on your mind and do not be afraid to offend people. Of course, this only applies to people who deserve it, such as stupid people or people you work with all of the time.
 If you do not get your way, manipulate people by finding something that annoys the particular person the most and doing that. For example: Sally hates squeaky shoes. So, whenever you are near Sally make your shoes squeak. Usually this is something that requires some amount of planning and is not something as simple as making an annoying sound or face.
 While many times they will anger you and you do the same to them, they prove to be more loyal than most.
, House is the best doctor there is, for example. It would be extra House-like if you did it not to help people, but because you enjoy solving puzzles or figuring things out.

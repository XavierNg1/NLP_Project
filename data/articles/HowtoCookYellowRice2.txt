 This helps to distribute it throughout the rice as before cooking. You can skip this step if you want to cook the dish as quickly as possible.
 Place the rice, coconut milk, spices, lemongrass and leaves in the pot. Use a large spoon to stir the ingredients until they are mixed well. Cover the pot.
 Place the pot on the stove over medium high heat. Bring the contents to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Continue simmering until the rice has absorbed the water.









Check the rice while it's cooking to make sure it doesn't burn. If it looks like it's getting dried out, add a little water.
You can also moisten the rice by adding extra coconut milk.
 Remove it from heat and extract the lemongrass and leaves from the pot. Fluff the rice and spoon it onto a platter, or mold it into the classic cone shape. Serve immediately.

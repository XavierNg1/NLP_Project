 If you find things are beginning to take on an unpleasant taste, or if food you have enjoyed in the past is no longer desirable, this may be indicative of a larger problem. There's a long list of causes for a lingering bad taste, from the side of effects from over-the-counter medication to use of tobacco products and so on. If you find yourself looking to dull bad tastes often, consider an appointment with a physician., A good, well-kept hygiene regimen is crucial to having your taste buds at their best. However, normal brushing and flossing won't always remove every last lingering bacteria which might cause consistent foul tastes. Tongue scrapers are inexpensive and using them is an easy addition to your morning and night routines.Many toothbrushes today include their own tongue scrapers on the reverse side of the brush head. Look for these for an economic option.
 Many unpleasant tastes might be the unfortunate consequence of perception or circumstance. Maybe something you ate or drank prior made something taste poorly, or perhaps whatever you're eating might not have been made as best it could. In any case, don't be afraid to revisit things that have put you off in the past.


If there's a particular cuisine you avoid, consider it again at a restaurant you've never patronized. One which is well-recommended online or by friends. Never let one bad experience turn you away from something entirely.
If there's a particular dish which you've found middling or inconsistent, try looking up recipes online and learning to cook it yourself. When you cook for yourself you'll have ample opportunity to alter the dish to your taste.

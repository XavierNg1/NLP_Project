 International calls can get expensive, especially if you have to make them frequently. You can save some money by investing in an international calling card online or from your phone provider.With a calling card, you pre-pay for the minutes. This can stop you from receiving high fees as you'll have to make sure you do not let calls run too long.
However, read calling card contracts closely. Some have a variety of hidden fees, and you can rack up extra fees fast. You do not want to end up spending the same amount, or more, on a calling card.
 If you need to make calls to Australia frequently, an international calling plan can help. Your service provider may offer a discount or specialized plan, depending on your services.A country specific calling plan is best. If your calling plan assures you can make calls only to Australia, it may not cost as much as a general international calling plan. If you only make calls to Australia, you will not need to pay for other services.
As with a calling card, be wary of hidden fees. Read any contract you sign closely and scan it for any fees that look suspicious or extravagant.
 If calling is getting expensive, look into alternatives. There are other ways to communicate besides over the phone.


Use social media to your advantage. Add international friends to social media accounts and communicate with them via things like Facebook and Twitter.
You can also email. You can agree to email back and forth with a friend to update him or her on your life. This can be a free way to stay in touch with a long distance friend.

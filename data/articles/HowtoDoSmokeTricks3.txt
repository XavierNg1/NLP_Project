 You may want to subtly puff your cheeks out to make this easier. You need to keep the smoke in your mouth, however. The more you can keep in your mouth, the better the trick will be.
 Hold your bottom lip out, as if your had an underbite. Smoke should start to escape from your mouth, drifting upwards.
 As the smoke escapes, drifting up from your bottom lip, inhale slowly as possible from your nose. You should get a reverse waterfall cascading across your upper lip and into your nostrils.
 Can you blow a ring through your mouth and inhale it through your nose? How about a French Ghost, popping out a bit of smoke from your mouth and then grabbing it back through the nostrils. The French Inhale is a way to practice using both your nose and your mouth together for tricks.
 This trick involves little but patience. To do it, take a very big drag. As you open your mouth for the French Inhale, lightly and slowly exhale, pushing the smoke out and up as it hits your outstretched bottom lip. If you've inhaled enough smoke you should end with your face obscured in a thick, ghostly cloud.

Using a HomeGroup is the fastest and most pain-free way to share files and printers between two or more Windows computers.;
, It usually doesn't matter too much which computer creates the HomeGroup, but there are a few restrictions you should be aware of:Windows 8.1 RT can join HomeGroups but it cannot share files or create a HomeGroup.
Windows 7 Basic and Starter can join HomeGroups but they cannot create one.
All other versions of Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 can join and create HomeGroups.
 You can access the Control Panel from the Start menu in Windows 7, or by opening the Windows 8 Charms bar, selecting Settings, and then Control Panel.
 If you are in Category view, select "Network and Internet" and then click HomeGroup.
 This will launch the HomeGroup wizard.
 Your libraries will be listed, along with drop-down menus allowing you to pick what you want to share with the other computers connected to the same HomeGroup. You can also select the share any connected printers or other devices.
 Windows will generate a password that you can use to allow other computers to connect to the HomeGroup.
 Open it from the Control Panel like you did on the computer that created the HomeGroup.
 After opening the HomeGroup tool, your computer will scan for any available HomeGroups. When the group you just created is found, you'll see the Join now button. Click it and enter the password that was generated when the HomeGroup was created.
 Once you are connected to the HomeGroup, you can select what libraries you want to share and if you want to share your connected printers and devices.
 Now that you have both computers connected to the HomeGroup, you can access the shared files from your Explorer window. Expand the "Homegroup" section of the navigation frame and expand the trees to see all of the shared libraries for each computer.
 If both computers are connected to the same HomeGroup, you can select the shared printer from the Print window on any of your programs as if the printer was connected directly to your computer.The computer that the printer is connected to will need to be turned on and logged in to access the printer.

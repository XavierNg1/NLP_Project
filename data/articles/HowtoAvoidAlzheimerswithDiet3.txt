 The MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) Diet includes all of the suggested foods in the other two diets, plus includes a few more suggestions that help you use diet to avoid Alzheimer’s disease. This diet can dramatically decrease your risk of Alzheimer’s disease.One the MIND diet, you will need to:


Eat plenty of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat or fat free dairy products.
Include seafood in your diet at least once a week and poultry in your diet at least twice per week.
Have at least six servings of green leafy vegetables per week.
Get two or more servings of berries per week.
Have beans three times per week.
Cook with olive oil instead of butter, lard, or other oils.
 One big difference between the MIND diet and the Mediterranean and DASH diets is that the in the MIND diet, red meat is okay in moderation. With this diet you can have up to four servings of red meat a week and still avoid Alzheimer’s.For example, you might have a hamburger for lunch on Saturday and then a grilled steak on Sunday.
Later in the week you could have meatballs for dinner on Tuesday and meatloaf on Thursday.
 Some studies suggest that moderate amounts of alcohol, like red wine, may reduce the risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.The MIND Diet recommends having one glass of red wine a day if you are trying to avoid Alzheimer’s with diet.Although a glass of red wine is recommended, other alcohol like beer or whiskey may not have the same health benefits.
Remember that excessive drinking can cause more health problems than benefits.
 There are certain foods on the MIND diet that need to be severely limited. These foods include:

Butter and margarine—no more than 1 tablespoon per day.
Cheese—no more than one serving per week.
Pastries and sweets—no more than five servings per week.
Fried foods and fast foods—no more than one serving per week.

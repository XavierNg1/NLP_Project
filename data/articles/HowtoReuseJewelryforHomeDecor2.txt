 If you have a lamp that turns on and off when pulling a chain, you can spruce up the chain with an old necklace. You can try weaving an old necklace around the existing chain to attach it. You can also snip off most of the existing chain with pliers, leaving only a small end sticking out, and then glue one end of the necklace to the end of the old chain.Use industrial strength glue to secure the necklace to the chain. This will work best., Stop by a local thrift store, craft store, or department store. Get a large, circular ring, such as a wire ring you would use for a sewing project. You can then make a chandelier by stringing old necklaces around the ring. Attach some wires or strings to hang the object from your ceiling when you're done.Some necklaces can be tied to the wire ring. However, things like gold and silver chains will probably need to be glued.
 Pearls can make an elegant decoration, and look particularly striking on a vase. Remove pearls from their existing string and insert them into light-gauge wires. You can do this by cutting off any snaps or holders on the edge of the string of pearls. Then, remove the pearls with your fingers. Wrap the wire around a vase for an attractive embellishment., Cover the back of a picture frame in decorative cardboard from a craft store. Then, hang an old necklace over the cardboard, so the pendant hangs halfway down the frame. You can then frame the cardboard and hang up your new decoration in your home.Make sure to pick decorative cardboard that matches the color of your necklace.

 Both types of storms are most commonly associated with the Sahara and Gobi desert regions, they can occur in any arid or semi-arid climate. If you live in or are traveling in a dusty or sandy place with high winds, prepare yourself in case you get caught in a storm.
 Dust storms are most likely to occur on hot summer days under certain atmospheric conditions, and meteorologists can frequently predict the possibility of these storms. Tune in to local TV or radio broadcasts before traveling in hot, dry conditions, and consider rerouting or delaying your trip if dust storms are predicted. Roadside signs may also be available to warn you of dust storm danger.


If there's a good chance you'll get caught in the storm, it's advisable not to travel at all. Stay home and batten down the hatches so you won't risk getting hurt or damaging your car.
 If you are in a storm-prone area, you should always be aware that a storm could occur. If you'll be outside for a long period of time, wear long sleeves and pants to protect your body. Carry a satchel or keep a box in the trunk of your car filled with items you need in the event of a sand or dust storm. Fill the emergency kit with these items:


A mask designed to filter out small particulates
Airtight goggles
A water supply
A warm blanket, in the event of a winter dust storm, which can quickly lead to hypothermia.

 Pour cool water into a clean pot, tub, or container large enough to completely hold and cover your turkey. In this case, you will ideally want the container to be round. The water must be no warmer than 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius) to avoid bacterial growth.Since you will be stirring, ideally the container will be round or cylindrical.
 Salt helps reduce the freezing temperature of water.The chemistry behind this is why it is used during icy weather. While your turkey isn't a winter highway, it can use some ice too.Add a generous helping of salt to the container. Half a cup of salt per gallon of water is a good place to start.
 Place the turkey, breast side down, in the water. It can remain in its original packaging, but this will be quicker if you remove it so that water can circulate in the chest cavity. Since you won't be changing the water you won't have to worry about bacteria-laced water dripping around.
 You can either stir the water or spin the turkey with a ladle or large wooden spoon. By keeping the turkey in motion, you speed the rate at which it comes in contact with the water and transfers heat.This is why a round container is helpful. You'll need to work much less hard to keep the water circulating.
 The time you need will depend on the size of your turkey as well as your stirring skill. Test the turkey by prodding the breast to see if it is soft. If you think it is done, confirm by examining the chest cavity and removing the giblet bag. If the chest cavity still has ice crystals, or if the giblet bag is still frozen in, you need more time stirring.

 Mint gum works great for nausea. It relieves it and is great if you're going somewhere. Just pop a piece in your mouth and watch nausea minimize immediately.;
, There are 3 teas. First is lemon-ginger, we've all heard about ginger for nausea and it really does work great. If you don't like a spicy like flavor, try Chamomile. This tea is a miracle for those mild nausea moments, it also calms you down/relaxes you. It tastes kinda sweet so this one is great. Not a fan of sweet things? Try peppermint. For generations, peppermint has been used for nausea. Don't drink peppermint tea if you have GERD/ acid reflux, it will only make it worse.
 Slowly sip any nonacid fruit juice (not orange juice or other acidic juices). It really helps. Or go for a popsicle and eat it slowly, but don't down the whole box.
 This drug really helps to fight nausea and vomiting on a daily basis.


,, Get comfortable, and don't move around much unless you are not vomiting or gagging (about to vomit).
 Make sure you are aware of side effects first.
 If you drink it when it is highly carbonated, it may make you more nauseated and bloated which is not what we're going for.

 The two main varieties are Imperial and Murcott. Imperials have thin, waxy leaves and soft, dark green fruit. The fruit hangs mostly inside the tree, hidden from the sun, draped down off the branches in big patches. Murcotts can be identified by an abundance of thorns, dense, hard fruit in large patches, and high exposure of fruits to sunlight.;
, Mark the spot which you begin, and circle around the tree, moving clockwise if you are right-handed, and counter-clockwise if you are left-handed. Murcott fruits burn easily and grow together in thick patches of doubles, triples, and quadruples; leave no doubles or triples and space each fruit a fist apart minimum. remove external fruits on the outside six inches for the bottom sixty centimeters, and the outer twelve inches above that. Keep the larger and unmarked fruits. Imperials have more smalls, which must be removed, and the internal fruit is least valuable, so all outside fruit must be left on and spaced properly. Any sunburned fruits can also be removed. Moving once around the tree is sufficient.
 Throw the ladder inside the tree, hooking the ladder over branches if necessary to reach the inside and top of the tree. Remove all fruit off the top twelve inches of a Murcott. Simply space the Imperials and remove the smalls.
 Climb inside the tree, up the branches, reaching all the remaining fruits hiding or otherwise out of reach.
 Go around the tree once more to check your work. Look for any remaining spacing, sizing, or quality issues and correct them. Examine the tree from different distances, looking at the bottom external branches, inside and under the branches, and outside the top.

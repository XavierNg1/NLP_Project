 If your fear is rooted in the possibility of an accident taking place, know that elevator accidents do occur, but they are rare. In fact, the fatality rate has been calculated to be 0.00000015% per trip.Knowing the statistics can be reassuring. If you are anxious during your elevator ride, remind yourself that the probability of an accident occurring is very low.


Poor maintenance and rider errors, such as attempting to get out of an elevator that’s stopped between two floors,are the two most frequent causes of elevator accidents. However, you can find comfort in the fact that all states require regular inspection and maintenance of elevators, and rider errors should not occur if you stay put during your ride., Thoughts related to fear are often unrealistic and unnecessarily negative. Seeing them laid out prior to stepping into the fearful situation can help you evaluate them and in turn reduce your concerns.


For example, you may think: “The elevator will get stuck and I’ll have a panic attack.” Write this down, then ask yourself: do you have any evidence to suggest that this will be the case? Is there contradictory evidence that this will happen? For example, have you ever been in an elevator that has broken down before? What would you say to a friend with the same fear? You might tell them that the likelihood of this hypothetical coming true is low. Apply this reasoning to yourself and to your fear.
 If you fear is so debilitating that you behave uncharacteristically, such as by turning down job offers, avoiding visiting relatives or friends, or forcing yourself to climb stairs even when you shouldn’t, it may be time to see your doctor. Phobia sufferers may benefit from medication, therapy, or a combination of both.If you suffer from panic attacks related to riding in elevators, consider seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist. They can work with you to understand your fear and gain coping skills.

 If you are a beginner, dolphin plank pose may be too advanced for you. You may be unable to control your muscles, maintain your balance, and breathe deeply while in the pose.








Resting your knees on the floor rather than rising to your toes will give you more stability and support your core.
You also might consider dropping to your knees if you find it difficult to keep your back flat.
 If you have a weak neck, or are recovering from a recent neck injury, you might want to place a block between your forearms and rest your forehead on it to reduce the pressure on your neck.








Putting a block between your forearms also can help you keep your upper body in correct alignment, with your elbows straight below your shoulders and your forearms parallel.
 If you've mastered the dolphin plank pose and are looking for something a little more challenging, you might try the side variation, which requires you to balance on one arm and the side of one foot.








From dolphin plank, slowly shift your weight to one side. Roll over to the side so that your weight is evenly distributed between one forearm and the edge of one foot. Raise your other arm towards the ceiling, straight out from your shoulder.
Look towards your outstretched arm, pressing your forearm and the edge of your foot into the mat.
Breathe through the pose, holding it for 30 seconds to a minute before lowering.
Rest in dolphin plank for a minute, then shift your weight and repeat side dolphin plank on the other side.

 Line a glass or metal baking pan with aluminum foil. Brush with olive oil.
 Take care to rinse out all of the cavities. Pat dry with a paper towel.
 Use a sharp knife to slice off the bottom fin, then run your knife along the bottom of the fish's belly from head to tail. This will open up the cavity to the oven's heat.
 Drizzle the fish with olive oil, both on the outside of the fish and inside the cavity. Smooth it over the entire fish using your fingers.
, You should be able to fit four to five slices inside the fish, overlapping them slightly. Close the fish back up.
 The fish is ready when the flesh inside has turned opaque and flaky, and the outside skin is crispy.
 Remove the skin and the fins. Cut each side of the fish in half and serve.









Whole baked fish are often brought to the table whole before they are cut up for serving.
Be sure your family or guests are aware that the fish still contains bones.

 This cut will give you heavier layers on the top of your hair. If you’ve recently washed your hair, you needn’t wash it again. You can simply wet it using a spray bottle and some fresh water.
 If you don't want to turn upside down to cut your hair, you can also do the high ponytail method while standing upright. Just hold the high ponytail up over your head in one hand as you follow the rest of these steps.
 Do this while you are still bending over at the waist, with your head pointing downward.


To ensure that your hair is as even as possible, aim for a ponytail that is right at the centre and top of your head. Use a mirror to help you determine the position of the ponytail.
 Put this first band close to your scalp so that your hair cannot slip out of it.
 This second elastic band will sit just below where you want to make the cut.
 Holding the bottom of your hair firmly in one hand, hold scissors in the other hand and use them to cut through your hair.


Do not try to cut through the entire ponytail of hair all at once. Make small snips until you are all the way through the ponytail.
 Remove the elastic band and shake out your hair. Brush it and run your fingers through it.
 If it looks too blunt or uneven, flip your hair over once more, again securing it into a ponytail at the top centre of your head, then, holding the ponytail in one hand, trim any stray hairs that hang out of the end of the ponytail.


There shouldn’t be many stray hairs. If you see a lot of them, move the ponytail around on your head until the hair is mostly even when you grasp it in your hand.
For a more natural look, you can make some small, upward cuts into the ponytail. This will soften the ends of your hair so that the cut looks less blunt. It will also give it more of a shaggy look, incorporating any unevenness into the style.

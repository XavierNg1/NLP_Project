 If you’re unable to find an identifying sticker or acid stamp, check to see if it’s made of genuine crystal or just glass. Find a piece of glassware that’s about the same size and shape for comparison.
 Make sure the piece acts as a prism. Twist it slowly in front of the light source. Look for a rainbow to appear when the light disperses.Do the same with the glassware and note that it does not produce a rainbow.
 Tap the rim. Listen for a musical chime that’s high in pitch. To contrast, do the same with a piece of regular glassware and listen for the dull thud that comes when you tap it., Hold the glassware in one hand and your crystal in the other. If your piece is truly crystal, it should feel significantly heavier due to its higher lead content., If you’re satisfied that your piece is truly crystal, have it examined by an expert to confirm whether its design matches one of Waterford’s, or research it on your own with a book identifying Waterford’s various designs. However, due to the high value of Waterford crystals and the high number of counterfeits out there,seek out a professional opinion for better peace of mind.

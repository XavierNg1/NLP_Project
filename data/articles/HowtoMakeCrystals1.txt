 Any jar will do, as long as it's clean, since debris could interfere with the crystal growth. Using a clear jar will enable you to watch the crystals form. You could also use a glass, a vase, or any other dish that will hold water.;
, Start by adding about two tablespoons of your chosen crystal base, then continue pouring in more base and stirring until no more base will dissolve. You'll know it's time to stop when you see a fine layer of crystal base collecting on the bottom of the jar.


Rock salt makes a cheap, accessible crystal base. Epsom salt also works, and is available at most drug stores.
Alternative crystal bases include alum, a substance used for making pickles, or borax, which is available at hardware stores.
 Within an hour or so, crystals will begin to form on the bottom and sides of the jar. As the water in the jar evaporates, the crystals will grow larger. The longer you let the mixture sit in the jar, the bigger the crystals will get.


If you want to make an individual crystal you can use as a decoration, remove a piece of crystal from the bottom of the jar and tie a string around it. Tie the other end of the string to a pencil and rest the pencil over the mouth of the jar with the crystal suspended in the water. Let the crystal grow as large as you want before removing it and drying it off.
You can keep the crystals in the jar for as long as you like. To prevent them from getting dusty, cover the jar with a lid after the water has finished evaporating.

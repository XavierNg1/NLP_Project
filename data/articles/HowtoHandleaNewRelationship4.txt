Even though the relationship is new, talking about how you both think it is going will help the two of you solve any problems that you foresee. Discuss what works for you and what you like about the relationship, as well as what doesn’t make you so happy., Have a realistic and honest conversation about where you see the relationship heading. Making sure you are both thinking the same about the future of the relationship will make it easier for you the two to build your new relationship., Sometimes relationships don’t work out and the sooner you admit it, the better for both people. If you have gotten to know one another, tried communicating, and spending time together (and apart), talked about the relationship and either of you aren’t happy, you should consider talking about whether the relationship should continue.

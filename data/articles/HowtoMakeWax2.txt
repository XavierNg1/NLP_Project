 The pot you choose should be big enough to comfortably hold all of the fat and be filled to the top with water.









A dutch oven or large stew pot should be the right size for this purpose.
Consider choosing a pot that you will dedicate to tallow-making in the future. The process of melting fat and creating tallow will leave a waxy residue on the pot that is hard to clean off, so you may not be able to use it again for cooking.
 Slowly bring the water and fat to a boil. When it begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer.









The fat should melt slowly; don't boil it until it's melted.
You can put a lid on the pot to speed things up, but don't leave it covered during the entire melting process. The production of steam could slow the melting process.
Each pound of fat will require approximately 10 minutes of simmering time. Therefore, if you use 5 pounds as recommended, plan on cooking the fat for around 50 minutes to 1 hour.
 As the fat melts, it will separate from the tallow and become liquid fat that needs to be strained. Place a large piece of cheesecloth inside a colander set over a large metal bowl. Pour the liquid into the cheesecloth-lined colander to strain the fat from the tallow and water.









Be very careful during this process, since the melted fat will be hot and might splatter.
There may be bone fragments or other solids in the fat that require removal. These should be strained out with the fat.
 Set the animal fat aside to be discarded. The liquid in the bowl now contains tallow and water.

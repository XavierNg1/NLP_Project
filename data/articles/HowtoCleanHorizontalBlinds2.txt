 If you’re cleaning blinds in the kitchen, or if you have pets in the house, your blinds may need more than a simple dusting to get clean. Turn the stem to close the blinds. Get the slats flat and straighten them out to expose as much dust and dirt as you can.You might choose to remove the blinds from their setting before cleaning them by hand, but in most cases this won’t be necessary., Run a feather duster, dry towel or vacuum with a brush attachment over the slats of the blinds lightly. Remove whatever dust has collected on the surface. Any stuck-on dirt and grime that is left behind will need to be cleaned by hand.White plastic or vinyl blinds are especially bad about showing dirt and discoloration.
 Combine a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Take a microfiber towel or coarse washcloth and soak it in the soapy water solution. Wring out the excess water. The towel should be just slightly damp to help dust stick to it without wetting the blinds.Avoid using abrasive cleaners on blinds, even the synthetic types. Harsh chemicals can eat through the finish of the slats.
Wooden blinds, especially, should not get too wet. Standing water can soak into the wood and cause it to warp and discolor., With one hand, take hold of the outer edge of the top blind slat. Pinch the slat damp towel and drag your hand from one end to the other, cleaning the entire length. Repeat this process with each individual slat, moving from top to bottom, left to right. Go over particularly dirty spots as many times as needed.Stop and rinse the towel after every few slats to wash away the dust and grime that has built up on it. You may be surprised how much dirt you’ll pick up cleaning this way!
Grip the blind slats lightly to keep from bending them out of shape.

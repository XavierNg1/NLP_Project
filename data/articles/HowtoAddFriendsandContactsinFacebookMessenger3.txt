 Messenger users and businesses can create codes that can be scanned by the Messenger app, much like a barcode. Messenger Scan Codes are circular with dots, dashes, and circles surrounding the user's profile picture.


You can see your own Scan Code on the Profile screen in Messenger.
 You can scan codes from the People screen.
 The process is slightly different for Android and iOS:


Android - Tap "Scan Messenger Code" at the top of the "Messenger" list.
iOS - Tap "Scan Code" at the top of the "All" list.
 Fit the entire circular code into the circle in the view finder. Make sure to hold your phone steady as it scans the code.
 After adding the person or business, you'll be able to start chatting.

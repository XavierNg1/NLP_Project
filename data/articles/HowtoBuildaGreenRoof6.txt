 Hopefully your heat-tolerant, drought resistant varieties won't clamor for water. While the plants are getting established on the rooftop though, they will probably need more water than for the remainder of their growing life.


If it's raining, assume that's the watering done for you.
 Check blockages quickly and mend them; any backup of water being unable to escape can result in roof landing inside your home.

 Consider the purpose of your usage and the kind of printer you own. Do you mostly print personal e-mails or use it prepare materials for official usage on an in jet or laser printer. Do you print heavy-coverage documents, like signs and flyers? Do you do double-sided printing? All these factors are involved when in comes to choosing the right paper according to your needs.;
, At 20 pounds, standard paper is an economical choice that’s perfect for everyday printing and copying.. Mid-weight such as ,22 to 24 pounds provides crisper images and less show-through hence, making it ideal for customer-facing documents and double-sided printing. And the heavy-stock ones are perfect for sturdy signs and flyers. They are also ideal for vivid colours and flawless finish.
 The brighter the paper, the crisper your letters and images appear. Especially the colour and monochrome ones. Ratings of 98 or 100 provide the biggest factor.
 Be environment friendly and choose recycled paper. Don't worry about the quality it is just as high as the non-recycled ones. Look for FSC logos as they are the eco-friendliest of all. The Forest Stewardship Council certifies that the pulp used to make the paper came from responsibly managed forests.
 i.e, order the correct amount by knowing the terminology. A “ream” has 500 sheets, and there are 10 reams in a case. And consider buying by the case as You’ll save money, and you’ll never have to worry about running out.

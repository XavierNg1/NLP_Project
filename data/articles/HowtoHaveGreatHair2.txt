 It is important to choose a shampoo and conditioner that will help to keep your straight hair from becoming fine and limp. Preferably one that adds volume (especially if your hair is naturally fine). If regular shampoo doesn't work for you, try a sulphate and silicone free shampoo.
 The brush will not only tame your strands but also polish your hair and smooth it.
 To make your hair look glossy, apply a light volumizing mousse before you blow dry. If you need hold, use a flexible-hold hairspray.
 If you need to flat iron your hair, choose a tool with variable heat settings. Use the lowest heat setting that effectively irons your hair to avoid heat-related damage and always apply a heat protectant before you use a heat-styling tool.


Use a curling iron or curling wand if you want to create a wavy appearance in your hair.
 A simple braid or an elegant one can be worn on days when you don't want to or shouldn't style your hair. Occasional hot rollers are okay, but you should mostly embrace your straight locks.

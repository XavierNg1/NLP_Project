 If the tree is already dead, you can count the rings on the exposed stump. The number of rings indicates the number of years the tree lived.









Keep in mind that most trees produce a two-colored ring per year, within the annual ring the thinner strip is the phloem and the thicker is the xylem. Thinner rings represent colder years whereas thicker rings represent warmer years.
 This will take a small sample from the tree bark to the pith (tree centre). It's a way to count the tree's rings without cutting down the tree. The length of the borer should be at least 75% of the tree's diameter.









Position the borer at average chest height (1.3 m) from the ground.













Drill a sample.













Confirm that your sample contains pith. If not, you will need to re-drill.












Count the number of rings.

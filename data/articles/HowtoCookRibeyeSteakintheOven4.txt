 Make a mixture of fresh rosemary leaves, fresh thyme leaves, minced garlic, and lemon zest. Dry the steak off, and spread a layer of salt on it. Rub the herb mixture into the steak, and place the steak in the fridge overnight (or at least for 4 hours). Take the steak out before cooking, and rub the mixture off with your fingers. Let it come to room temperature. Rub it with oil, and cook as usual., When flipping the steak in the oven, you can add a pat of butter on top of the steak. The butter will melt over the steak, adding additional flavor, but the butter won't have a chance to burn.You can also use an herbed butter at this point instead of plain butter.
 A reverse sear is when you start the steak in the oven on a baking sheet at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius), then finish it over high heat in the skillet. This process allows you to add more delicate flavoring at the end.For a 1 1/2-inch ribeye, you'll cook it in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes for rare. Add 5 minutes for every level up you want to go in doneness (so 25 to 30 for medium rare, 30 to 35 for medium, and 35 to 40 for medium well). Have the skillet heating on the stove near the end with oil in it, and sear each side of the steak for about 30 to 45 seconds, including the edges.
Before searing, you can add items like garlic cloves, thyme, and shallots to the oil for extra flavor.

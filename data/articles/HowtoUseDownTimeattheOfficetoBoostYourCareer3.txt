 You can boost your career during downtime by taking a class online that will teach you something new. Maybe you take an online class on public speaking or networking on social media. Or perhaps you take an online class that focuses on a specific program you want to learn or a specific skill youâ€™d like to get better at.Make sure the online class you are taking relates to your job in some way. This way, you will be using downtime to further your career, rather than just for personal interest.
You can find many online classes by searching for the content online. The online classes may be free or have a small fee.
 If you are looking for a way to fill a short amount of downtime, you may do online tutorials. Tutorials are often much shorter than a full class and allow you to learn a new skill in a few minutes. You may search for tutorials on a certain skill you have always wanted to learn or on a certain issue you are trying to troubleshoot.For example, you may search for an online tutorial on how to draw an image in a computer program. Or you may do an online tutorial on an issue you are having in Microsoft Word.
 Another way you can expand your existing skills is to reach out to your colleagues and peers. Set up a learning session in the office where everyone can share their skills and ideas. You may make it a brown bag session where coworkers come at lunch to exchange ideas or thoughts on a particular topic.You may also create a learning session for others during your downtime, where you share a skill or idea with your coworkers as part of a planned teaching session.

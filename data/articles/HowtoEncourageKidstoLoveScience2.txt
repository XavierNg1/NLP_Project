 Science is not a monolithic entity. There are many types of science, so if your kids aren’t into biology, don’t be discouraged. Introduce them to astronomy instead. If they don’t care for astronomy, try to share some geology instead. Make an effort to expose your kids to a wide variety of sciences., The scientific instinct to dissect and dismantle common objects can be powerful. Allowing your kids to act on this instinct will help them love science (even if they don’t know they do). When your kids want to dismantle an old computer, help and encourage them to do so. If they want to pluck the petals off a flower, don’t insist that they are ruining it. Making the process of discovery fun is an important way to help kids love science.Your kids might also have fun dissecting more complex organisms. Dead frogs, for instance, are easy to obtain from companies that provide science kits to homeschooled kids. Owl pellets are another common dissection opportunity that kids enjoy.
Make sure that your kids’ natural curiosity is manifest in a safe way and doesn’t, for instance, lead them to stick knives in the electrical socket.
Teach your kids safety by always insisting that they should not experiment or dismantle things without your approval and oversight. Additionally, teach them to use insulated gloves and safety goggles when handling electrical parts.
 Give your kids time to observe animals and wildlife by taking them to local parks and recreation centers. If you live near a large lake or near the ocean, take them to the shore to see what sorts of shells and strange creatures they can find. They might be drawn to certain bugs, plants, or animals. From there, your kids’ natural curiosity will take over.When you’re visiting these natural habitats, engage your kids in conversation. Ask them to describe what they’re seeing and provide explanations for anything unusual.

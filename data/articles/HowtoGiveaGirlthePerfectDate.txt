 It shows her you respect her and will make her feel special.;
, In that case, have an idea ready as a backup. Try not to pick anything you really like- remember, it's about her. It does not have to be expensive, she wants to get to know you, it should not be about the wallet- but don't be a cheapskate either.
 You're going for style here- sorry guys, this includes all messy foods "oh man no ribs!"

, Yes you are paying but whatever you shell out is worth it.
 This will keep the conversation going if you run out of things to say. For example, if she likes dancing, then maybe ask "So how is your dancing going?" or something of the like.
 If she just wants to hold hands then that's fine. Take it slow- even the players play the long game. What you don't get today she might give you tomorrow; respect her.
 Compliment her personality (that never hurts) but don't overdo it or you will lose all sincerity. Casually drop these compliments in over the date.
 She may not be as keen on monster trucks as you or get that weird sense of humor you have so go easy and reveal yourself more over time- too much too soon may give her the impression that you're too forward.

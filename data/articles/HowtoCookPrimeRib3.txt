 Sharpen your carving knife, if necessary, using either a sharpening rod or stone.


To use a sharpening rod, pull the edge of the knife down and across the rod, holding it at a 22° angle (you know what that looks like, right?). Repeat this process 5 to 10 times.
If you're using a sharpening stone, hold your knife at a 10° to 15° angle to the stone. Push back and forth in smooth, steady strokes., If you have one with a well at one end to contain the juices, good for you. First things first, remove the cooking twine with a knife or scissors and dispose.
 To make it easy on yourself, use a carving fork to hold the roast in place. Turn the platter to where the rib bones are on your left if you are right-handed, or on your right if you use your left hand to carve.


Using your ultra-sharp carving knife, make one cut, slicing off the chine bones (the bones on the large end) to sever the meat from the bones in one piece.

Save the bones for nibbling on later. Or, if you're crafty in the kitchen, make a scrumptious soup!



, Slice the meat across the grain to the thickness you prefer. 1/4 - 1/2" (.6-1.25 cm) is fairly standard. Serve, enjoy, loosen your belt a notch, and moan away in prime rib ecstasy.

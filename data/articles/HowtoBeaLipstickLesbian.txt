 Wear as much or as little as you would like. If it makes you happy, go ahead. You don't have to wear makeup, however.;
, For a more feminine feel, opt for skirts and dresses. They don't have to be short or revealing, just any shape or style that you are comfortable in. However there is no textbook way how to dress. The idea of a 'Lipstick Lesbian' is somebody who retains a feminine appearance but this doesn't mean you have to be in dresses all the time.
 Heels work well, if you can survive wearing them, and kitten heels work well for those who find them difficult to wear. If all else fails, pumps are cute and girly, and will work just as well. Just like the outfit however, you should wear what makes you comfortable, and there is no textbook 'you should wear these shoes'.
 If you are asked whether you are straight, don't just shy away and agree. Be proud and honest about your sexuality.
 Some people may not believe you are homosexual because you seem too feminine, and many have the cheek to demand you prove it. You don't have to prove it, because if they don't believe you in the first place, why are they worth proving it to? However, you are free to do so if you choose. It is your own decision.
 'Lipstick lesbian' is at best, a label, but you do not need to conform to any label. Do not feel pressured to adhere to a particular style to represent yourself in a way that makes you uncomfortable. Be true to yourself!

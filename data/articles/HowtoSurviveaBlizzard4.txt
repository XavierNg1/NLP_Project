 If you arrive home after being stuck outside, change out of your cold, wet clothes as soon as possible. Frostbite can happen quickly, and it's important to warm yourself up as soon as possible. Wear a full set of warm, comfortable clothing for the duration of the storm.
 The room you pick should be one that contains your heat source and supplies. Try to choose one that has few windows or doors to help keep it insulated. Close off the rest of the house by shutting all windows and both internal and external doors. Cover windows with blankets and stuff towels under the doors., Periodically check the latest weather news for your area. This will help you determine how to stay safe and ration your supplies.


If you have power and cable, watch the weather or local news station. Check online for immediate updates.
If your power or Internet is out, listen to your radio for news. While you may be tempted to use your phone's Internet service, save the battery for emergency calls.
 Unless absolutely necessary, do not leave your home. Remember that there may be downed power lines nearby that you can't see in the low visibility of a blizzard. Only leave to start and maintain the generator, retrieve extra firewood, or if someone in your household has a medical emergency.

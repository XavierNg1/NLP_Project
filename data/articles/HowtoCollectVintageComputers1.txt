 People often donate their older, outdated computer models to thrift stores or sell them to consignment stores.;
, Some repair shops may have vintage computers that have been resting in storage rooms for extended periods of time.
 Although pawn shops are less likely to pay for outdated computers provided by patrons, they may acquire vintage computers specifically for selling to collectors.
 In some cases, store clerks in thrift shops, consignment stores, surplus, or repair shops will lower the prices of computers if they have had them in stock for long periods of time.


Ask the store clerks specifically when sales will occur. This will allow you to revisit the store when sales occur, and purchase the vintage computers at lower prices.

 Add 3 ounces (85.04 grams) of butter and 12 ounces (340.19 grams) of cream cheese to an electric mixer or a bowl and combine them. Continue to mix the butter and cream cheese until it's well blended.When using an electric mixer, use the paddle attachment.
If you don't have an electric device you can use a hand beater or fork.
 Add 1 1/2 teaspoons (7.393 milliliters) of vanilla extract to a bowl. Slowly incorporate the sugar into the mix by pouring four ounces of sugar in at a time. Continue to do this until you've mixed in all the sugar. The sugar will thicken the frosting and make it sweeter.

Add more sugar to make your icing thicker.
You can elevate your frosting by adding flaked coconut, cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, or blueberry syrup., Before you use your icing, it should be refrigerated for five to ten minutes so that it can set.If your frosting is not the consistency you desire, consider using a thicker or lighter cream cheese next time. You can make your icing in advance if you don't want to make the cake all at once.

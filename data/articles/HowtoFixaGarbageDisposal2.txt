 If it is wet, you have a problem with the hoses and/or seals.
 The color and contents will tell you where the leak is coming from.


If the liquid is brown and discolored, then the leak is probably coming from a dishwasher intake or drain pipe.
If the liquid is clear, it is most likely a leak from the sink.
 You may be able to feel where water is dripping.
 This may solve your problem without requiring further repair. Turn on the water to see if the leak continues.



You may need to shut off the water source, take apart the hose and remove the seal. Take the seal to a hardware store to make sure you get the right item.
 Tighten the mounting bolts and try the disposal again.

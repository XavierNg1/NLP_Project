 For legal purposes like registration or changing title on a vehicle, the state needs to verify that the VIN on the car is correct. You generally cannot do this by yourself, but you may still have some options.


Some states require you to take your car only to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Nevada is one state that uses this system.Some states will allow you to get a verification from a local police station or the DMV. Examples of this are Montana,Massachusetts,or Vermont.Some states have private, licensed VIN verifiers who are more conveniently located, but will charge a small service fee. California and Floridaboth use this system.;
, Go to the authorized verification center, police station or DMV with the car in question. Call ahead to find out if you can make an appointment. Make sure that you take along whatever paperwork you need to have verified. For example, you may need the carâ€™s title and registration, or some states just have a simple form that verifies that the VIN is accurate.
 If you are going to a private verification center, you will need to pay a fee that generally ranges from about $10 to $40 for the verification.
 Collect the verified paperwork and return it to the Department of Motor Vehicles as required to complete your transaction.

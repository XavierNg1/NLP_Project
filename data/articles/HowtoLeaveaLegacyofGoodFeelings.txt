 First impressions are key to how people will think of you later on. Always smile at people. It will make them smile too, or at least make them remember you with a smile on your face.;
, Whether you like the person or not, show them respect. It will make others respect you.
 Show your friends and family that you truly do enjoy their company by spending time with them. Take them to dinner. Host a party. Do something to show them you care.
 Give people a call to wish them a happy birthday, or just to catch up. Send them flowers for their anniversaries. On serious occasions, be there for them. They will remember all the times you were there for them.
 No one likes someone who's always negative. It brings people down. Infect people with your happiness.
 It might go without saying, but no matter how nice and positive you are if you have B.O. or bad breath, people will remember that. Brush your teeth, shower, deodorize, wash your hair. Keep on top of that, so bad breath or body odor won't distract people from your great qualities.
 Always listen to what people have to say. Talk about the other person, and stay interested. Make eye contact, nod, talk less about yourself.
 If you're having fun, others will remember you as a happy person. Have fun in healthy ways, never at the expense of another.
 If you know you were wrong, always admit it and ask for forgiveness from the other person. Always forgive them for wrongs they've done. Don't make enemies.

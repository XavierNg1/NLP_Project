 First, head over to fists of guthix and train to 13 magic. Buy about 500 fire and mind runes, and a staff of air.;
, Try getting 99 hunter, hunting red chins from 80 + and then collecting 100 dragon imps (quite hard i know, but the chins will sell for over 40 mill and imps will sell for about 30+ mill). Buy the following: all scimitar's from Iron to Rune, a few Dragon scimitar's and Dragon Dagger's, full initiate armour, full proselyte armour, about 1k noob food (like trout) and 500 good food (like monks or sharks), an amulet of fury, full mystic robes (any colour you want), 10+ Amulet's of Strength, around 30-50k bronze knives, full leather armour, full studded armour, full snakeskin armour, all Dragon hide chaps from green-black, a cannon with 30k balls, a regen bracelet, a pair of climbing boots, and spend the rest on dragon bones, leaving beside about 3 mil.
 Wielding full iron, the best scimitar you can wear, an amulet of fury, any cape you want (hunter skillcape recommended), head over to the monks, where you will train to 30 strength and 40 attack. Now go to rock crabs with that armour and a rune scimitar, and a few food, train to 60 attack, 65 strength. Now for that range, useful for so many quests. The fastest method is to simply set up a cannon and the rock crabs (do the quest first), and fire away to 70 range =).
 Wear your new cape in pride.
 You will now be 29 defence, at which point train to 30. Wear prosylyte helm and plate, and a Regen bracelet with black Dragon hide chaps, climbers (climbing boots), and a fury amulet and fire cape. You will look pwnage.

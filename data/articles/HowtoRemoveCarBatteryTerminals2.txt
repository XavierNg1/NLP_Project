, This special brush has two parts, one to fit over the battery posts and another to fit inside the cable terminals. A battery terminal brush is specially designed for this job and will eliminate the need to use your fingers for cleaning. In a pinch, any wire or bristled brush will do, but, a small one will work best inside the terminals. If your brush will not fit into the interior of the terminals, try an old toothbrush or, as a last resort, use a rag draped over your finger to scrub inside each terminal.
,, The petroleum jelly will help to prevent future corrosion from building up.

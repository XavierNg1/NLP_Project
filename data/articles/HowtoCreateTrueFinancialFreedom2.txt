 Set aside part of your income each month until you have a balance equal to 6 months of income. If you lose a source of income, you can make up for it by drawing from your emergency fund while you find a new income source. You can also use your emergency fund for unexpected expenses that aren't covered by insurance.
 Save a part of your income each month in an account that pays interest not only on what you've contributed to the account, but on the interest you earn. Compound interest adds up quickly, and you may find that your account balance is large enough that you can afford to withdraw the interest each month as a source of income.
 This is particularly important if your employer contributes to it. Your employer's contributions are basically free money for you, and the tax rules for retirement plans make them a good financial bargain.

 Eye black strips come in a package much like a package of stickers. Cutting off the top of the package and sliding the adhesive black strips out of the package is an effective way to access the strips.
,


Adhere the strip below your eye so the middle of it aligns with your pupil.
Press down the eye black strip about 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) below the base of your eye.
Repeat the process of placing a strip onto your face below the other eye.
 Remove and replace them correctly if they are not.

 If you want a more tousled style but have silky, flat hair: saltwater spray is great for adding more texture to the hair. It will make the hair a bit more coarse so that it's easier to ruffle it up. This should give your hair more "hold."


Saltwater spray doesn't impart the same firm grip as hair spray. In general, this makes it look more natural, and makes it easier to brush out.;
, If you tease your hair (i.e. brush "upwards" against the strands with a brush, comb or your fingers) you can gain more volume. This can be helpful if you want to, say, add a bit more volume in the base of your hair. Make sure that you are gentle with your hair if you want to tease it. Don't tangle it up too much. Otherwise, you might fray the hair strands., The tighter the braid, the sharper the edges of the locks will be when you take it out. When you wake up, simply take out the braid(s), then separate the locks. Spray in some salt water spray and take the hair in your hand, "crunching" it upwards to create some texture and curves. Tease it a bit more if you want to add more volume or create a messier look.One bigger braid will make larger locks, whereas two or more braids create smaller ones.
Separate the locks with a brush for a neater look. Use your hands to keep it looking extra tousled.
Spray with some hair spray if you want the style to stay in place for a long time.
 A tousled look is easy to do touch-ups on during the day. If it ends up looking too neat, simply tease it gently. Then, ruffle and crunch it a bit with your hands. With the texture that's already in your hair, it should be easy to ruffle up.

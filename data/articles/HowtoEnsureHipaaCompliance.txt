 Having active and up-to-date virus protection on your networks and all computers on it will help keep patient's medical data secure.


Computer security not only protects the privacy of your patients or clients, it also protects you from legal liability if that information is stolen or released from your organization.Antivirus programs ensure your data is protected from being corrupted or destroyed by computer viruses or malware.If your computers came with antivirus programs pre-installed, make sure they are updated regularly. You also should make sure that any network you've created for your offices has sufficient security and antivirus protection.
If you've ever been the victim of a computer virus, you know how they can destroy files and corrupt data in your system. If the affected files and data contained private medical data protected by HIPAA, you would be in violation of the law.;
, Saving all data to an off-site location ensures the data is secure and protected in the event of hard drive or server failure.HIPAA covers all health information in any form that personally identifies the patient. The HIPAA security guidelines ensure patient health information doesn't fall into the wrong hands, and isn't accidentally altered or destroyed.Backing up your data at an off-site location ensures that private medical information will be protected from loss or corruption if a disaster such as a flood or fire occurs in the office.Back-ups also ensure that any files or data accidentally deleted can be recovered.Consider also creating a contingency plan to recover data in the event of an emergency or accidental deletion. Any such plan should be written down so it can easily be implemented if necessary., All machines with private medical information on them must be password-protected and kept in secure locations.For example, you shouldn't put a computer in a hallway or high-traffic area where anyone other than staff would have access to it.
Computers should time out after a brief period of inactivity, and passwords must be kept secure. Staff should memorize computer passwords rather than having them posted on or nearby the computer itself.Make sure employees don't leave documents that contain patient's private medical data in scanners, printers, or fax machines.Your computer system should have an audit trail feature in place, so that you can pull up the history of a particular file and have a record of every employee who accessed the file, when they accessed it, and what changes were made., If you get new computers or other equipment, you must make sure that it has the same levels of protection in place.


You also should make sure any new equipment or machines you put into service have sufficient security features themselves.
Keep in mind that a machine may have appropriate security but not be compatible with your current system. Likewise, new equipment that's compatible with your existing system may require upgrades to ensure data is secure., Using encryption on emails and mobile devices can help keep patient's medical data from being accidentally disclosed.


HIPAA doesn't prohibit the use of email or mobile devices to transmit patient information, nor does it specifically require that emails be encrypted. However, encryption can be put in place fairly easily and is a cost-effective method to ensure the data is secure.Even if you don't encrypt your emails, you must have a policy in place on how private patient information is handled in emails and mobile devices.To determine whether you should use encryption to comply with HIPAA, you must conduct a risk assessment to analyze whether private patient information is at risk of being accessed by unauthorized users. If the risk is relatively high, then you generally should use encryption.In most cases, it's better to err on the side of caution and encrypt electronic data, even though it's not specifically required by HIPAA.If you allow patients to request or access their medical information using email or a mobile app, include a disclosure statement and make sure they understand the risks involved in accessing their information that way.If your organization allows storage of private medical information on mobile devices, you should have policies to protect that information and regulate the removal of those devices from your office.Patient contact information also must be kept secure, including any mailing lists or other programs that could connect names or email addresses to particular medications or types of treatment., If you have contractors or tech companies that service or maintain your systems, you must make sure that they understand the security required by HIPAA.


Keep a list of all the hardware, software, and network components such as routers that your organization uses. Make sure all of them have adequate security in place, such as encryption or firewalls, when they are installed.You also should make sure that any tech vendors with whom you contract understand HIPAA requirements and are willing to work with you to ensure each of the separate components of your computer systems are coordinated to meet the security standards., To best ensure HIPAA compliance, make sure your policies are universally applicable to everyone in your organization who handles or has access to patient medical data.HIPAA requires written policies that include mandatory employee training and sanctions for policy violations.All policies and procedures should be thoroughly documented in writing and generally available to all employees.Any agreements you have with other business associates that may handle medical data also must reflect a commitment to HIPAA compliance. If you have any existing agreements executed before the law went into effect, make sure they're updated so that the continuing relationship reflects HIPAA requirements.Keep in mind that there's no one-size-fits-all policy mandated by HIPAA. Rather, you must create policies and procedures that address your organization's particular privacy and security needs., Your officers should fully understand and be up-to-date on all aspects of HIPAA.


HIPAA security standards require that you appoint at least one person to work as your security manager. This person not only needs an understanding of the legal requirements, but also of your particular organization's systems and how they work together., Each patient generally should sign a written document acknowledging receipt of your organization's policies.Your written notice must explain to patients their rights regarding their health information and tell them how their health information will be used or shared.In addition to giving patients their own copy of the notice, make sure you have the notice posted in a prominent place in your office so anyone can refer to it as needed.Patients are not required by law to sign the form, but if a patient refuses to sign you must make a record indicating that you didn't get his or her signature.If you need to share a patient's private medical information for some reason other than treatment or bill payment, you must first obtain the patient's authorization., If an employee does not follow your organization's policies or procedures, he or she should be disciplined accordingly and the violation logged.


Keep in mind that if you don't document something, you won't be able to prove it happened later. If a breach in protocol or gap in security is revealed, you must thoroughly document how the problem was found and what steps were taken to eliminate or alleviate the risk.If there is a breach in security, you also must notify any patients' whose information was involved.If the breach affects more than 500 patients, you also must notify major media outlets in the state or region where those people live., Each employee should have his or her own copy of the policy for reference.HIPAA requires a written policy, and this must be shared with all employees who have access to private medical information.You should review and update your policies regularly to conform with HHS regulations or opinions.All employees must be trained and quizzed on the policy and on HIPAA requirements before they begin working with private medical information.Keep in mind that other individuals who may have access to private medical information, including volunteers or interns, also must have training regarding HIPAA requirements, even if you don't pay them or consider them employees., Continuing education ensures your employees don't forget correct procedures.


HIPAA is enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). You can request an OCR speaker to discuss health information privacy with your staff by filling out the form on the HHS website.Document your training efforts so you can demonstrate to HHS that the training is in place and employees who deal with private patient information understand HIPAA's requirements., If your policies change, you should make sure your employees are educated on additional requirements or new procedures.


Staff should be regularly tested to ensure that they understand HIPAA's privacy and security standards. Keep the scored tests in each employee's personnel file so copies are available for your OCR auditor., Employees should understand the consequences of violations, and discipline should be applied consistently and universally.


Employees who violate your privacy policies should be sanctioned, and there should be no exceptions to your procedures. Making an exception creates a gray area regarding how secure patient data is kept, and won't be tolerated by HHS., Use a company not connected with your organization to conduct your risk assessments.The firm must be familiar with HIPAA requirements and run tests using federal HIPAA standards and guidelines.Since you will be subject to regular audits from the OCR, you must keep records of the company with which you contract and the results of the risk assessment for review by the auditor., You should have the company run risk assessments at least once a year to ensure your systems are in compliance.Risk assessments are especially important if you are using computer systems that were installed before HIPAA took effect. Newer systems are more likely to be in compliance than existing systems that weren't required to secure data in any particular way.The risk assessment should compare your computer systems to the type of system required by HIPAA, and identify any gaps not covered by your system that the law requires.Even if your organization has a high level of compliance, the best risk assessment companies still will uncover areas where your system can be improved., If security risks are uncovered by the assessment, take the steps necessary to remedy the problem.


When revisions are made to HIPAA, or new regulations are issued by HHS, you should review your systems and determine what changes need to be made to make sure you remain in compliance.If a breach in your security protocol has occurred, you should investigate it immediately and document the results of that investigation. Depending on the type of breach that occurred, it may be necessary to notify affected patients or to notify HHS or other authorities., Some risks uncovered in your risk assessment may require developing new procedures to best secure patient's medical data.


If changes are necessary to ensure HIPAA compliance, make sure you communicate with employees who will be affected by the change and make sure they're on board.Communication within particular departments is essential, especially since employees who work within the system on a regular basis may have better ideas for how to implement the change more efficiently.

 Red or white is best but any color will do as you can cover them to create the desired effect. This process won't ruin the noodle so they can be reused after the holiday season and thrown back into the pool or lake.;
, Measure the noodle into three equal parts. Only bend the top third of the noodle. This will create the cane-like shape. You’ll want to keep it in place like this for about 20 minutes. You can do this by simply holding it, sitting on it or placing books on top of it.


If you want to save time, simply eyeball the appropriate bend spot and bend according to your preference.
 Tie the fishing line around the two parts of the bend. This will ensure the shape holds.


You can always readjust the shape later if you don’t like it.
 If the noodle is red, use white electrical tape to create stripes or vice versa. If you’ve chosen another color like purple, you will cover the entire noodle in a solid color of tape first before creating the alternating colored stripes. Diagonally, wind the red or white tape around the noodle and presto! You’ve created a foam candy cane.


If you’d like your stripes to be extra precise, measure two to three inches for each stripe (or larger if you prefer giant stripes). Make a small mark with a pencil. When winding the tape around the noodle, let the marks serve as a guide along the way. This will keep your stripes even and a consistent size.

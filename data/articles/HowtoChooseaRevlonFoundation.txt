 Some foundations, such as Beyond Natural, Custom Creations, Colorstay Mineral Mousse and Colorstay Aqua require only that you choose a general shade, such as "Light," "Light Medium," "Medium," "Medium Deep" or "Deep." Others, such as Colorstay, Age Defying, New Complexion, and PhotoReady offer a wider range of shades. In choosing a shade, it is helpful to bring a tube of your old foundation (provided it was a good shade match) to compare to bottles in the store. Another tip is to hold the bottle next to your neck and see if the shade matches. Once you've found your shade, write it down or memorize it for future purchases.

 The more, the merrier and the longer the game will go for. Have them pair up in their team.;
, These two lines should be at least three metres apart. One of these lines should be designated the "starting line".
 Have each pair face one another. One person should stand at one line and the other player opposite on the other line. Make sure that the opposing pairs have sufficient space between them to try to avoid collisions during play.
, The aim of the game is for each starter person to sweep the balloon to his or her team-mate opposite. The team-mate then takes the balloon and sweeps it back to the start line. The first one back is the winner and the other pair is eliminated.
 The final two pairs represent one team each and the winner of this gets the Quidditch trophy.

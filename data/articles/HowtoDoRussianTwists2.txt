 For this challenge, assume the starting position. However, instead of placing your feet under a couch or having a friend hold them down, lift them up off of the ground. Then, resume the exercise as usual with your feet lifted., When you are ready to add another challenge, use a dumbbell. Choose something light to start off with, for example, 5 to 8 pounds (2 - 4 kg). Instead of clasping your hands in front of you, hold the dumbbell straight out in front of you. Then resume the exercise as usual and donâ€™t forget to lift your feet.Make this step even more challenging by using a medicine ball, or by increasing the weight of your dumbbell.
 You can always add more sets or repetitions to challenge your body further. Add more sets, but keep the number of repetitions the same, for example, four sets of eight to 12 reps. Alternatively, you can add more repetitions, but keep the number of sets the same, for example, three sets of 15 to 20 reps.

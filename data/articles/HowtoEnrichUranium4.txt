, The gas is blown into the cylinders in such a way that it is induced to spin in cyclonic fashion, producing the same kind of separation between 235U and 238U as is achieved in a rotating centrifuge.


One method being developed in South Africa injects the gas into the cylinder on a tangent. It is presently being tested with light isotopes such as those in silicon.

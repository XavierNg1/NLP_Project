 The breath-holding technique temporarily increases the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood which is suppose to help with relaxation and reduce anxiety. Before using this technique while peeing, practice holding your breath.Start by holding your breath for 10 seconds and seeing how you feel.
Increase the length you hold your breath by 5-10 seconds at a time. Always stop and assess how you’ve reacted to holding your breath. If you don’t feel well after holding your breath — stop — this technique may not be right for you.
Try holding your breath in different locations so you get use to the technique.
Once you can hold your breath for 45 seconds, try using the technique in a real bathroom situation.
 This comfortable bathroom might be at home or in an empty public bathroom.Stand or sit in the bathroom as you want and breathe normally.
On one of your exhales, stop exhaling about 75% of the way through so you do not empty your lungs.
Hold your breath for 45 seconds. Hold your nose closed if you have to.
After 45 seconds you should be able to start peeing.
You may need to perform the exhale technique a second time if you stop peeing midstream.
 This technique only works if you continue to practice in various situations and locations. You may find yourself altering the technique slightly so that it works personally for you — for example, you might decide to start holding your breath as you walk into the bathroom.

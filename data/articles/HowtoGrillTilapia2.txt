 Doing this will prevent the fish from sticking and crumbling during the cooking process.
 If you are unsure of how to reach medium heat on your specific grill, err on the side of less heat than more, since you do not want to char the fish.
 Cook the first side of the fish for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. For grilling, medium or conservative heat is the best option throughout the grilling process. You never want flames from the grill to actually touch the fish filets, as this will burn the tender meat.
 Slide the spatula underneath the fish gently, as to not tear the flesh, lift it up and set it back down on the other side. Cook the fish for another 3 to 5 minutes.


During the grilling process, flipping the tilapia frequently will cause the tender meat to fall apart. To properly cook the filet, turn it over just once.
 You will know they are done when the meat turns opaque and white. Its juices should run clear.To check to see if it is cooked all the way through without leaving a big cut in your fish, slide a butter knife into the thickest part of the fish. The meat should be opaque.

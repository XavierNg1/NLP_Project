 Choose a time at the end of the day, when it is likely that neither of you will have anything to do afterwards. You want to be sure that you aren’t rushed in your conversation and can take some time for yourselves afterward., Schedule a time where the two of you can meet in person. Do not break up with him via text, phone call, or email. You owe him the courtesy of an in-person meeting.Pick a place where you can talk privately. A place that’s filled with memories of your relationship (such as the place where you had your first date or your bedroom) might not be the best place to talk. Try taking a walk around the block.
If you’re in a long-distance relationship, get as close as “face-to-face” as you can. Have a conversation over Skype or FaceTime.
 Tell the guy that you want to have an important conversation. You want him to know that a serious conversation is going to happen so that he’s not taken completely off guard.Try saying something like, “I need to have an important talk with you later.”
You could also say, “Can we talk later? I have something I want to discuss with you.”

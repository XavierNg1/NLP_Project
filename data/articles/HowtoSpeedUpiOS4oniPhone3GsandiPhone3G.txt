, Go to the Cydia Search bar and type in SB settings. And then scroll down until you see an app called SB settings from Big Boss. Select it and then tap install.
 If you look at the bottom part of the screen you could see an icon saying manage. After tapping on that you'll end up looking at another screen which you could select packages, sources and storage. After that you must tap on sources and you'll see a list of websites/urls or whatever they are called. Tap on edit on the top right corner which says edit and you then press add on the top right corner. And you'll see a pop up which allows you to enter a URL. These URLs are available online.
, After that, go to the icon which says processes. Tap on the red button thingy thing and then delete it (unless you want the app to stay open) and then you must tap and the FREE UP MEMORY BUTTON and your memory will free up. As memory frees up your device will have more RAM to run and that will make your device run smoother. Do it regularly too because RAM will become inactive over time.
 After that you will see the speed intensifier icon. After that you must go and tap on it and get inside. After you get inside, go ahead and set the +amount value to you hearts content.(the higher the value the more iOS animation is cuts down making apps and stuff like that launch faster.)

, After that go ahead and tap on the tiny icon which says re-spring.

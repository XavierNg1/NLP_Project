 Hold the deck in your dominant hand. Use your index finger and thumb to cut the cards in half. Slide one-half of the deck under the other half of the deck and put it in your other hand. You should have half of the deck in each hand., Put the two halves of the deck perpendicular to one another and tap the edges of the decks together. This move is intended to throw off anyone watching you shuffle the deck., While still holding the bottom half of the cards, spin your hand in a circle so the bottom half of the deck does a full 180-degree motion around the top half of the deck. This will look like you made a circle around half of the deck with the other half of the deck., Now throw the bottom of the deck onto the table. Even though it's always been the bottom side of the deck, an untrained eye will become confused and think that you threw down the top half of the deck first because of what you did in the last step., Now you'll complete the illusion by slapping the top half of the cards over the bottom half of the cards. The cards are now in the exact same order, but people will think that you cut them.

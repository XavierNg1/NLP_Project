 You should be kind and friendly to everyone of course so you'll need to make an extra effort with the boys you really want to like you, or maybe even consider to be boyfriend material.;
, If you choose, apply a subtle amount of make up, like a little mascara or a bit of eyeliner to bring attention to your eyes, and maybe just a bit of lip gloss. Generally, lipsticks or heavy eye-shadows are not very attractive on younger girls - just make sure whatever you put on is neat, evenly applied, and UN-smudged. Guys will always notice if you're wearing too much make up, or if it's messy or lopsided. Looking good isn't flirting though. To make your appearance part of your appeal to a boy, you need to make him think you have done it just for him, for example, pat your lips with a tissue before to speak to him.

If you're still just getting his attention and he doesn't really know you so well, simply smile if he looks at you when you pass in the hallway- take steps forward if you want, present yourself and be outgoing. The boy doesn't always have to make the first move.
 This will just complicate things more, and things will be ruined if he ever finds out you're a fake.
 Sometimes guys can be shy and if you start a conversation it will feel good to him knowing that you are interested. Â If you always let him do the talking he may think your not interested and he's talking into a brick wall.
 This is middle school, you're not getting married. Flirting isn't a major commitment. And if he asks you out, great! If not, so what?

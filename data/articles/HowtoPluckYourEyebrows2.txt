 This is different for every face, but the same technique may be used to find anyone's brow line. Take an eyebrow pencil or another long instrument and line it up from inner corner of your eye to the edge of your nose. Use a white pencil to make a dot above the spot where it crosses your eyebrow. This is where your brow should begin. Repeat with the other nostril.









Feel free to move the dot a little forward or backward. This technique shows you the general spot where your eyebrows should begin, but your personal preferences can also come into play.
Make sure the instrument you use to find your brow's starting place is very thin. If you use something thick, it will slightly throw off where you place the dot.
 Nicely groomed eyebrows arch around the eye, and the place where they peak can make a big difference in your final look. Take the same instrument, and this time line it up from the outer edge of your nostril to the outer edge of your iris. Mark the spot where it crosses your brow, and repeat on the other side.
 This time line up the instrument from the edge of your nostril to the outer corner of your eye. Mark the spot where it falls across your brow. This is where your brow should naturally end; repeat on the other side.
 There is no "perfect" thickness for eyebrows; it all depends on your face shape and style choices. You should have a thickness in mind before you start plucking, so you'll avoid plucking too much or too little. Consider the following factors:


The size of your eyes. If you have large eyes, you might want to balance them with thicker brows. If you have small eyes, balance them with thinner brows.
The space between your brows and your eyes. If your brows are set high on your forehead, you may want to go with heavier brows to help frame your eyes. If you have a low-set browbone that slightly juts over your eyes, go with thinner brows so they don't look too heavy over your eyes.

 Put some rubbing alcohol in an empty spray bottle. Use the bottle to spray a light layer of alcohol all over your leather piece. You want the item to be damp but not drenched. Allow the alcohol to dry to give your leather a duller, weathered look.You can use a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol to apply it to hard-to-reach spots.;
, Acetone can lighten or even remove dyes that have been used to color your leather. Pour a small amount of acetone nail polish remover on a soft cloth, and rub the cloth over any spots you want lightened. Focus on areas that would naturally fade in color, such as the bottom corners of bags or the elbow creases of jackets.This technique will work differently depending on the quality and color of the dye. If your piece has been heavily dyed rather than just receiving a surface dye, you may not be able to completely remove the color. Darker colors may not fade as well as lighter ones.
 Dampen the leather with a slightly wet cloth. Then put enough powder on the piece to create a paste. Scrub it into the leather using a soft-bristled brush, and then leave it on for about an hour. Remove the paste with a damp cloth and dry the leather.Powdered cleaners with bleach are best. These will remove layers of both dye and gloss from your leather. Don’t apply pure bleach to your leather, as it’s too strong in its undiluted form.
If you want to scratch up your leather as you do this, use a wire brush instead.
To darken your leather back up, apply some shoe polish. This will let you keep the aged quality while also restoring some of the color you’ve removed.

 If you struggle to remove nail polish due to a preference for glittery polishes, there is a way to take preventative measures to make removal easier. This method must be done before you paint your nails but can be a great way to avoid nail polish removal problems down the road. You make a mixture of glue and water that you apply prior to glittery nails.









You will need white elementary school glue, an empty nail polish bottle, and water. Fill the bottle with about a third of the way with glue. Then add water and swirl around until the mixture is thin enough to be spread on your nails., Paint your nails with one layer of the glue base coat before adding your polish. Wait about five minutes for it to dry thoroughly before applying the next coat.If you normally use another kind of base coat, such as one to prevent staining, apply that after your glue base coat.
 The glue has hardened on the nail, and the polish hardens on the glue. Luckily, the glue comes off of your nail easily with some force, making it much easier to remove.
 Place your nails in warm soapy water for a few minutes. You can also run your fingers under a tap while lathering with soap. This will soften the polish so that it is much easier to remove without damaging your nails., You can peel off the nail polish using your fingers. However, you can also use a cuticle pusher, a toothpick, or some other thin, blunt object if you're having trouble doing so. Gently push it under the nail polish at the base of your nail until the old polish slides off. It should be easy to pop off completely all in one sheet.

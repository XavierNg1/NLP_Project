 If you have small, uniform beetroots, you can steam them whole. If you have larger beetroots, cut the roots into quarters before you steam them. Next, cut off the top part of the beetroot attached to the stem and the pointed tip at the end. Discard these pieces.


Donâ€™t peel the beetroots before cutting them as the skin will help hold in nutrients and color.
 Place a metal stovetop steamer basket on your stove over medium-high heat. Pour about two inches of water into the steamer reservoir and bring the water to a boil.


Read the manufacturer instructions before using a stovetop basket steamer. Some steamers have specific limitations on heat and water levels.
Stovetop basket steamers can be bought at most grocery stores and baking supply stores.
 Add the beets to the basket. Cover the basket with the lid and steam the beets for about 45 minutes. Check the water level periodically and add more if needed. Check for doneness by spearing the beetroot with a fork. The fork should slide into the root easily.


Steaming beetroots is faster than baking beetroots. However, steaming is less healthy as nutrients are lost to the water., Use a damp, clean dishtowel to rub the beetroot skin off the beetroot sections.Rinse the beetroot sections under cold water and place in a bowl. Next, drizzle the beetroot with olive oil and toss it with salt and pepper. These beetroot sections can be served as a side dish or added to a salad.

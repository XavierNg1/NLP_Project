 Make sure the costume you choose for your dog is not too heavy, both in terms of weight and breathability. Costumes that are too heavy can possibly injure your dog, or cause your dog to overheat. Lightweight costumes also facilitate movement.Weigh your dog before buying their costume. Then, buy a weight-appropriate costume.
If you notice your dog panting after wearing the costume for 30 minutes, take the costume off and return the costume. Try to avoid costumes made with 100% wool or cotton.;
, The costume should not cover your dogâ€™s eyes or ears. Your dog should also be able to stand, walk, sit, and lie down, as it normally would, while wearing the costume., Before buying a costume, examine it closely to see if it has any small parts that your dog can easily pull out, ingest, or choke on. Avoid costumes with small parts like buttons, little plastic objects, or excessive fabric., Costumes with moving and noisy parts should be avoided. The noisy or moving parts can stress out your dog. If your dog is pacing or pawing at the costume excessively, these are signs that your dog is uncomfortable with the costume. Take it off immediately.

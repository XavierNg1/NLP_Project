 Using a good vegetable peeler, serrated or not, start at the rounded shoulders and peel toward the point. You won't be able to peel everything, because some parts will be in the dents or pleats, and not accessible to the flat blade.








Peeling peppers makes them more delicate to bite and flavor. The skins are somewhat bitter, especially with green peppers, as well as being tough to chew.
 Place the pepper point-side down on a cutting board, or hold firmly in your off-hand if you're comfortable cutting in-hand. Insert a sharp knife’s point into the top of each pleat, at the stem, and cut downward until you reach the point. Rotate the pepper and repeat until the flesh is separated into sections. Pull the sections outward, away from the stem, and they'll break off neatly.
 Now that all the flesh is accessible, complete the peeling process.
 Lay the sections flat on the board, and either cut the veins and seeds free or else pinch and pull them off with your fingers. Cutting is cleaner and faster, but it does mean using a knife quite close to the off-hand fingers.








Most of the seeds and veins will have been removed in step 2, but there will likely be some still stuck here and there. If you’re not looking for perfectly clean julienne or dice, you may be able to skip this step.
 Turn the sections so they run front-to-back, parallel to your knife. With a smooth cutting motion guided by the knuckles of your off hand, cut the flesh into strips of the desired thinness.
 Rotate the julienne strips 90 degrees on the board and cut again as before, creating even dice.

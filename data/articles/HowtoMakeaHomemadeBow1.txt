 Take a walk outdoors with your hand saw and pruning scissors to find wood for your bow. Search for a live sapling or tree limb that is ½ inch in diameter. Cut down the sapling or limb with your hand saw. Remove any branches or small limbs with your pruning scissors. Cut the limb or stick so that it falls just below your belly button when one end is placed on the ground., Place your bow on the ground. Wrap your thin, strong string tightly around the top end of your bow. Tie the a knot in the string.


Consider using a braided nylon string., Flip the bow over, placing the top of the bow on the ground. Use an exact-o knife to create a notch across the bottom end of the bow. Place pressure on the end of the bow to bend it.The notch should be thick enough for your string to sit in.
 Pull the string tightly up the length of the bow and over the end, letting the string sit in the notch you created. Wrap the string around the bow 6 to 8 times and then tie a knot in the string., Wrap the string with electrical tape to secure the ends. Wrap the center of the bow with electrical tape to create a hand grip. Place a small piece of electrical tape around the center of the string to mark where the arrow will rest., To create arrows, you will need wooden dowels, electrical tape, and feathers.


Cut the ¼ inch or 5/16 inch wooden dowels 18 to 24 inches long.
Place a piece of electrical tape around the top and bottom of the dowel.
Use an exact-o knife to slit the end of the arrow.
Cut a feather in half with an exact-o knife.
Glue one half of the feather to each side of the arrow near the end.

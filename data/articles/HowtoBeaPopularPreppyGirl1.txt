 One important thing about looking preppy is the look. Wear the latest styles, but try to add your own twist. Here are some basic suggestions:


Shirts: Wear good quality shirts, in preppy colors. You can also wear brightly colored shirts, but try to team these with a pastel.
Pants: Own about two pairs of dark wash skinny jeans and jean shorts (depending on the weather). Have at least one pair of khakis and a few patterned pants in stripes, plaid, etc.
Shoes: Own a pair of brown riding style boots, Toms, Uggs, loafers, topsiders, canvas shoes, flats, or fuzzy boots - any of these shoes will be great. Have one pair of good quality tennis shoes too.;
, Accessories are the fun part and they can be very stylish. Try pearl earrings in your ears, which can look quite preppy. Always carry around a purse with you. Wear a watch, colorful or showy––a FitBit wouldn't go astray these days. Have a classy piece of jewelry other than the pearls, such as a charm bracelet or necklace. Some preppy charms for a charm bracelet are a tiara and a tennis racket. Get studs, a silver necklace, and small hoop earrings.


Don't forget the hair. Have pretty hair bows in pink, green, and/or navy blue, use these to tie your hair up in a high ponytail or pigtails. It is also cool to get bows in your school/team colors.
 Shampoo and conditioner every day, and blow dry after, if that is your thing. Do a high ponytail with an adorable hair bow added to it. You can also put your hair in a bun, put it in pigtails, or in a French braid. The perfect haircut has long layers, side bangs, and is straight. Wear your hair in curls on special occasions.
 Some sheer gloss is really all you need. If you have bad skin, use facial cleaning products. Don't cake on the foundation but do apply mascara and blush. A thin line of eyeliner looks classy.

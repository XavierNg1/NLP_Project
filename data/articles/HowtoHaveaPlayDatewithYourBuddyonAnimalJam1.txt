 Use a big den, since big dens have lots of space to use. Create a kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom. For the kitchen, put in a Cake Bake Kitchen, a coffee table with dinner stools, a fridge, and maybe a fireplace. For a bathroom, do a tree stump chair with shoji screens. For a living room, use a few member curved couches and a TV, and for the bedroom, use a regular nonmember bed in your favorite color, some toys and plushies, and anything else child-like.;

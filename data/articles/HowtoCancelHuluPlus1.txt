 Navigate to Hulu at http://www.hulu.com. Log in with Facebook, or log in with your email and password.;
, Click on your name or picture in the upper right hand corner of the screen, and then select "Account" from the drop down menu.
 In the lower right of the Account tab, locate and click on the "Cancel subscription" link.
 Hulu will play an 11-second plea saying "don't go." If you remain unmoved, you can proceed with the cancellation.
 It's about eight pages long, but is more about signing up than signing off. The terms pertinent to cancellation say, in essence, that you have to pay for the services you received. It's recommended that you review these for yourself before proceeding.
 Once you're satisfied the terms are acceptable, and you want to go ahead with the cancellation, click the gray Cancel button.


When your cancellation is finalized by Hulu, you'll receive an email confirmation. Keep this for your records.

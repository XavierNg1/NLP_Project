 First, find a big piece of any colored fabric for the overskirt. It needs to be lightweight, in order to move when you wear it, but should also be stiff. A vintage flat bedsheet is ideal.


Note that most traditional poodle skirts are made using felt fabric for the overskirt. If you don't have felt, or don't wish to use felt, you can also consider using taffeta.;
, Then add 2" for seam allowance — we will call this number 'W'. Now take a measurement for your desired length (around knee length is traditional) and add 2" again — we call this 'L'.
, So if your waist measured 21 1/4" + 2" seam allowance, your semi-circle would be 11.5" wide.
, The waist requires another calculation: c = π(d) or d = c/π. Remember that radius is half the diameter and π = 3.14 — this will give you how far down from the point to cut.


So if your waist is 21 1/4, divide by 3.14 to get a diameter of 6.77. Half of this is your radius, so divide by 2 (3.38) and this is how far down to cut from the point of your fold. Remember to measure the hem from this line as well rather than the point or your skirt will be several inches too short.
 It may help to pin the layers together if your hands aren't steady. It'll resemble a giant donut once you're all done cutting.
 Afterwards, stitch around the cut edge.
 Don't stitch all the way around; leave a gap of 2" open.
 The elastic should measure 0.5" less than your original waist measurement (in this example 29.5").
 Since most fabrics won't stretch to form a folded circle, tiny clips may be necessary to make the fabric lay flat.
 If you don't wish to sew on the appliqué, use a steam-adhesive product such as Steam-a-Seam, which are available in craft stores and online. If you want to experiment with other appliqués as well. Popular designs include:


Dogs
Hot-rods or other '50s cars
Flamingos
Flowers
Really large initials. Remember the L for Laverne?

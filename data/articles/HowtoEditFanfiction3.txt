 Is the story intended to be a comedy? A tragedy? A grimdark fic? A slice of life story? Look over the story and tell the author if the story had the effect and feel that the author intended it to have.
 The pacing should be pretty consistent throughout the story, excluding scenes that have a dramatic mood shift from the rest of the story. If the story feels too rushed or scenes are unnecessarily drawn-out, then let the author know and suggest places to add/remove details.
 Most stories should have a beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and conclusion, although it might vary slightly depending on what type of a story it is. For short one-shots, only the the basic elements are really needed, whereas for longer stories, there might be multiple story arcs and sub-plots. If the story is missing a conclusion, falling action, or any other element, or if a sub-plot is forgotten about, then inform the author. These are essential building blocks to a good story.
 Is the plot too complicated for anybody but the author to understand? Is it hard to follow?

 Select a bag large enough to fit your cut of meat when sliced in half. If you are reusing a previously used bag (or if you are simply extra cautious), check the bag for any holes to avoid leaks., Ensure that you wonâ€™t have to clean your fridge after marinating your meat. Choose a tray, dish, or any other container whose sides will easily fit your bag. Set the bag inside so the dish catches any leaks, just in case the bag is somehow punctured later on., Set your meat on a cutting board. Slice away any extra fat along its surface. Then slice it in half.Use a long-pronged fork to poke holes in both halves so the marinade can penetrate further in more easily., Insert your meat into the bag and then pour your marinade over it.Or, do the opposite and pour the marinade in first.Whichever you prefer.
 Once your meat and marinade are both in the bag, seal it shut. Lay the meat flat inside the dish so as much surface area as possible can soak in the liquid. Transfer the dish to your refrigerator. Let the meat soak anywhere from 8 to 24 hours before cooking. Flip it over periodically during that time so both sides are evenly soaked for consistent flavoring.

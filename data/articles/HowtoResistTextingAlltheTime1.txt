 A simple way to reduce the amount of time you spend texting is to turn off your notification sounds. Since you won't know every time a text comes in, you won't check your phone as frequently., The app Live2Text helps you manage your texting addiction by allowing you to silence incoming texts for a period of time. The app will send callers a message saying you can't be disturbed at the moment.Consider using this type of app while you are in a meeting, when you're at the movies, or when you are driving.
 Assess your addiction by installing BreakFree to monitor the number of texts you send and receive – it may be more than you'd expect. The app will give you a daily “score” to warn you when you are using your phone too much, and lets you set limits on phone usage.
 If you have a friend who understands what you are trying to do, ask them to take care of your phone when you're together. You can ask them to check it in a couple of hours, in case there is an emergency, or just ask them to keep it until you go home.
 Be the kind of person who does exciting things. You won't have time to text so much, and you will have more interesting things to talk about when you do text.


Learn a new skill – take a dance class or guitar lessons.
Plan a trip, and learn a new language to use while you're there.
Take up a new hobby - go skydiving, biking, or hiking.
 Switch your phone off and pay attention in class. You'll be showing that you respect your teacher's time, and your grades will probably improve as well.


Put a key charm with a bell on your phone. You won't be able to check your phone during class without jangling the bell.
 Switch your phone off and take care of business. Limit message-checking to your lunch break and you will probably see an improvement in your work.

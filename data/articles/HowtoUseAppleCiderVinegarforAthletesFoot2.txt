 Unprocessed, cloudy honey has proven antifungal properties.Mix four parts honey with one part apple cider vinegar.Apply it to the infected area and let it sit for 10-20 minutes.
Wash it off and dry thoroughly.
 Like apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide is an effective antifungal.Indeed, it is even stronger than vinegar, which is why it is best not to use it as a daily soak. Instead, alternate one day with apple cider vinegar and the next with 2% hydrogen peroxide.Purchase 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Dilute the hydrogen peroxide by adding water in a ratio of 2 parts hydrogen peroxide to 1 part water.
If you experience burning or a rash, dilute the hydrogen peroxide further by adding more water.
WARNING: Do not mix vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together, or treat your foot with one after the other. Mixing the two can form peracetic acid, a caustic chemical that can both burn your foot and damage your lungs through its fumes., Colloidal silver (tiny particles of silver suspended in liquid) at a strength of 100 ppm (parts per million) is an effective antifungal and antibacterial agent. After you have soaked your feet in apple cider vinegar and dried them, apply colloidal silver solution to the affected areas and let it air dry.


WARNING: Never ingest colloidal silver. It has no benefits and can build up in your skin causing permanent, bluish-gray discoloration.

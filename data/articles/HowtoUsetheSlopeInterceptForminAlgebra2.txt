 Let's say you're working with the equation, 4y +3x = 16; write it down.
 Just move the x term over to the other side so that the y term is by itself. Remember that whenever you move a term (by adding or subtracting) to the other side of an equation, you have to flip its sign from negative to positive and vice versa. So, "3x" moved to the other side of the equation would become "-3x." The equation should now look like 4y = -3x +16 by doing this:4y + 3x = 16 =

4y + 3x - 3x = -3x +16 (by subtraction)


4y = -3x +16 (by rewriting, simplifying the subtraction)

, The y coefficient is the number in front of the y term. If there is no coefficient in front of the y term, then you're done. If there is a coefficient, however, then you should divide each term in the equation by that number. In this case, the y coefficient is 4, so you have to divide 4x, -3x, and 16 by 4 to get the final answer in slope intercept form. Here's how you do it:4y = -3x +16 =

4/4y = -3/4x +16/4 = (by division)
y = -3/4x + 4 (by rewriting, simplifying the division)

, If you're using the equation to plot a line, then you should know that "y" represents the y-coordinate, "-3/4" represents the slope, "x" represents the x coordinate, and "4" represents the y-intercept.

 As you build each aspect of the game, play it to ensure that it remains fun and cohesive. If an area or idea feels weak or poorly implemented, refine it or cut it. Once all of your levels or puzzles or play areas are complete, play through it to make sure it is fun from beginning to end.
 Throughout the development process, you should be constantly checking to see that your game is attaining that philosophy. Make sure that you are sticking to your feature list, and that you aren’t getting bogged down by more and more additions.
 Constantly go back over your art, sound, and game design to smooth rough edges and bring out your game’s distinct style. Your ability to quickly polish will be heavily dependent on the art style you have chosen to use.

 These should be vertical for the mouth and nose and a horizontal for the eyes and ears.;
, Use a long, curved line to represent the body's movement, a vertical rectangle for the torso, and a horizontal rectangle for the lower body. Use straight lines for the hands and legs (with circles for joints). Sketch rectangles for hands and feet.
 Make sure to define the waist and chest, and have the upper legs slightly thicker than the lower.
 Draw the left eye opened and the right one closed, a small nose, and an open, laughing mouth (following the guidelines). Make eyebrows above the eyes. Draw ruffled bangs on the forehead and two hair buns on either side of the head, with accessories in them and a V-shaped diadem on the forehead.


Don't forget to draw Sailor Moon's right hand over her face in a sideways peace sign.
Carefully erase the guidelines.
 Draw a sailor costume with a short, ruffled skirt, big bows at the back and on the chest (with a round brooch at the center), long gloves on her hands and long boots on her legs with a crescent on each one. Make long ponytails coming down from the hair buns.


Add crescent earrings and a neckband with a crescent on it.
 Sailor Moon's usual outfit is red, white, and blue as shown here, but you can give her whatever color scheme you'd like.

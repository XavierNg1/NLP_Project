, You can use one of your own old sweaters, or you can go to a garage sale or thrift store to buy an inexpensive sweater. Launder the sweater so your stocking will be clean and look new.Cable knit sweaters look great as stockings.
 Use kraft paper, poster board, or other paper to cut out a stocking shape to use as a pattern. You can also print a pattern out to use. Cut out two stocking patterns that are exactly the same., Sweaters typically have patterns, so it’s important to plan out where to cut the stocking shape out so your stocking looks great. Lay out the sweater on a table and observe it to find the perfect place to cut out your stocking shapes., Place the patterns on the sweater where you want to cut. One pattern should have the toe facing left and one should have the toe facing right.

Make the top of the stocking out of the bottom edge of the sweater to easily create a finished edge on your stocking if you don't want to sew a cuff on.
Use very sharp fabric scissors to get the best cut.
Pin the pattern onto the sweater to make it easier to cut.
 Line up the two stocking pieces with the outsides facing each other, and pin them in place. The stocking should look inside out. Carefully use a sewing machine or hand sew the two pieces together. You will want to use a long stitch to sew them together.You can also hand sew the stocking together with yarn.
 Flip the stocking so that the outside of the stocking is now on the outside. Make sure you push the toe completely out so that your stocking is the right shape.

Sew on the ribbon. Carefully hand sew the ribbon in a loop on the side of the top of the stocking to create a hanger. You will want to sew the ribbon on very securely to be able to hold the stocking when it’s hung.

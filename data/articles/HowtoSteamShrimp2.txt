You could line the pan with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper, if necessary, but cooking spray or shortening is preferable.
 For oven-steaming, shrimp should be left in their shells, so you do not need to peel them. Instead, cut open a small slit in the back of the shell and remove the vein through it.

Use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut into the shell and just barely into the flesh of the skin just above the shrimp's back.






Dig the vein out with the tip of a paring knife.
 Place the shrimp in a colander and rinse lightly under cool, running water. Drain the excess water over the sink.


Place the colander onto a few layers of clean, dry paper towel after draining the majority of the excess water out. Doing this will allow any remaining water to drain, as well, without making a mess on your counter.
 Place the shrimp in your baking pan in a single, even layer.


A single layer is preferable since it promotes the most even cooking, but strictly speaking, it is not completely necessary. Just make sure that the shrimp is in even layers, and avoid creating more than two full layers of shrimp in the pan.
 If desired, also add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and any other desired shrimp seasonings.


Toss lightly with a spoon or spatula to coat each piece of shrimp evenly and thoroughly.
 Cover loosely with aluminum foil and oven-steam for a total of 7 to 8 minutes, turning once after the 5 minute mark. Note that larger shrimp may take longer to cook.

If working with jumbo or colossal shrimp, steam-cook for another 2 to 4 minutes.
Turn or stir the shrimp with a slotted spoon, spatula, or tongs after the first 5 minutes.
Cover the pan with a loose layer of aluminum foil to trap more of the steam inside., Drain any excess liquid and transfer the shrimp to a serving dish.

 Esophageal diverticulum is often caused and aggravated by a disease called Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). GERD often causes acid from the stomach to rise into the esophagus, weakening the muscle lining and encouraging diverticula to form. To prevent your esophageal diverticulum from worsening, you can reduce the chance of acid reflux by eating a bland diet. This means that you reduce spicy, fatty, and acidic foods in your diet.Some things you may eat include:


Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and peas
Legumes, including kidney beans, black beans, and tofu products
Lean meats such as chicken, lean ground beef, and fish
Starches, such as brown bread, rice and pasta

, For some people with esophageal diverticulum, swallowing can be painful or difficult. To help maintain a healthy diet, you should look for soft, semi-moist, or liquid foods that will go down easily. You may need to puree, mince, or blend harder foods so that you can swallow them more easily.Some good foods include:


Baked sweet potatoes
Apple sauce
Pudding
Soft white bread
Scrambled eggs
Soup
Cottage cheese

, Water can help reduce acid reflux while helping flush food safely down to your stomach. It may also help prevent food from becoming stuck in the diverticula pockets. Always drink a glass of water after finishing a meal.Avoid drinking too much alcohol and coffee, as these might increase acid reflux, which can in turn worsen esophageal diverticulum. Alcohol may also weaken the mucosal layer of your esophagus, leaving it vulnerable to more diverticula., It is important that your food can pass undisrupted down to your stomach after you eat. To prevent regurgitation, you should rest after every meal sitting with your back and neck straight. You may also stand if that is easier. Avoid strenuous activity, and do not lie down. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to rest.

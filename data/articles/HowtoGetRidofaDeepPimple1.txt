 To keep oil and dirt away, you will need to commit to a cleansing routine where you clean your face twice a day. Use a plant based oil cleanser or a commercial cleanser than is non-comedogenic, meaning it will not clog your pores. Do not use products that contain alcohol, as they can irritate and dry out your skin.


When applying the cleanser, use your fingertips and be gentle. Massage, rather than scrub your face, as scrubbing can cause permanent scarring on your skin.
Make sure you also wash your face and body after any heavy sweating, such as after a workout.;
, It may be tempting to try to pop your pimple so it goes away more quickly. But irritating the deep pimple can make it worse and lead to scarring as well as the development of other pimples.
 Try not to hang out all day in direct sunlight without sunscreen on or in tanning beds. The UV rays from the sun can damage your skin cells and weaken your skin.

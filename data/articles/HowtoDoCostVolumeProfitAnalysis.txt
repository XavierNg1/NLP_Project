 This is a difficult job, because the price of the product must be known. While it may certainly depend a great deal on costs, certain other factors come into play. Among these are:



Pricing policies per the demand curve and other considerations, such as growing the business at a certain pace.
Market research studies
Past sales volume
General economic and industry conditions
Relationship of sales to economic indicators such as GNP, personal income, employment, prices and industrial production
Advertising and other promotional budget
Quality of sales force
Competition
Seasonal variations
Production capacity






Long-term sales trends for various products, i.e. where in product life cycle it is.
Research and development allocations in the recent past - product improvements.;
, Products may not be sold under cost due to anti-trust regulations and legislation. Some costs have a mixed fixed-variable component basis, which is fine to allocate between so long as treated on a consistent basis between planning periods.
 For example, a manufacturer of ski apparel will have velcro that fluctuates with jackets and warmup pants sold, as well as seasonal changes in production, and fill, etc., as well as a color mix to consider (which may need to respond rapidly to changes in consumer tastes).
 For example, the ski apparel's unit price for a jacket might be $150 and the unit variable expenses $75, or 50% of the price. The unit variable costs include direct labor, machine production such as cutting and sewing 4 basic sizes for 2 sexes, then adult and children's, oil for the machinery and repairs to it as budgeted and are standard, etc. standard indirect labor such as color consulting, etc. The contribution margin of this jacket is $75 times the number of jackets projected to be sold, let's say 7812.5 (there are a few 1/2 size infant outfits made for special order). So that's $585,937.5 in total Contribution Margin towards Fixed Costs from this one jacket. Multiplied by 16 distributors of 8 jacket sizes and 8 pant sizes of 4 colors each size, that's 16*(32 + 32) * $585,937.5 = $600,000,000.00. We plan to increase our sales distribution marketing to 32 and double our sales if sales take off early in the season.
 The breakeven point equals the volume of sales it takes to cover all costs, and it is calculated by dividing the company's FixedÂ Costs by the Unit Contribution Margin (mixed, but here grossly simplified to be the same selling price and variable cost for pants and jackets, the only two products). For example, let's say the Fixed Costs for this Apparel Manufacturer are $300 Million. $300/50% = $600 Million Breakeven Point.
 Here, as mentioned, the Contribution towards Fixed Costs based on a reasonable sales projection of selling 7812.5 units of each of 8 jackets and 8 pants of 4 colors each at 16 distributors for $150/selling price per unit will total 1,200,000,000 and that our BreakEven Point is $600,000,000. You'll therefore anticipate a profit of $0 on sales of $150*7812.5* 1024 = $1,200,000,000.00, which is a ROS (Return on Sales) of 0%, and a Return on Fixed Costs of $0/300M = 0% -- so you can pretty much roll with seasonal changes every two years and stay right with the fast-moving market of ski fashion, in which there's almost always a role for the high-end warmup pants and jacket customer, and just break even.
 If we do increase our marketing efforts to 32 distribution points with sales of $2,400,000,000, we'll make a profit of $600,000,000 -- enough to purchase a new factory, or rather, set of Fixed Costs. The ROS would then be $600M/$2,400M or 25%, and the return to Fixed Costs would be $600M/300M or 200%.
 The Total Fixed and Variable Expenses line has been crossed at $2.4M (consisting of $600,000 in Fixed Expenses and $1.8M of Variable Expenses). So, by subtracting the Total Fixed and Variable Expenses of $2.4M form the Total Sales Revenue of $3.6M, one learns that the profit forecast equals the difference of $1.2M. At $0 of Sales, the Fixed Expenses of $600,000 must still be paid, and that would also be the amount of Loss incurred.

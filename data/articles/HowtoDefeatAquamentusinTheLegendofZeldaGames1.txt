 In the Legend of Zelda game, Aquamentus guards the Boss Room in levels 1 and 7 of the “First Quest,” and levels 1 and 4 of the “Second Quest.” Enter the Boss Room of these levels by unlocking it using the Boss Keys you acquired while playing through the dungeon;
, Once inside, Aquamentus will start firing three balls of fire at you, vertically aligned. As these balls of fire come near you, it will start separating from each other, giving you a very large space to walk between these fireballs.


If you do get hit by any of these fireballs, you will incur damage equal to half a heart container. Make sure that you get hit the least times as possible.
 If you've slipped through the gaps between the fireballs, you’ll find your character much closer to Aquamentus. Using your sword, slash at the single horn protruding from its head, and Aquamentus will start blinking, signifying that you've successfully damaged it.


Once Aquamentus has sustained enough damage (around 5 to 7 sword slash), it will explode and turn into a heart container.

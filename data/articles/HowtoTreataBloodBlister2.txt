 Most blood blisters will heal on their own over time, but keeping the area clean and dry will allow the healing process to proceed as quickly as possible.Keeping it exposed to the air helps the healing process, but also limits the chances of infection.
 If your blood blister is in an area that would normally be rubbing up against something, such as your heel or toe, take precautions to limit the friction against the blister. It is more likely to tear or burst if it is subject to a lot of friction, which is caused when it rubs up against another surface, such as your shoe. Using a donut-shaped moleskin or felt pad is the most straight-forward way to do this.You can get donut-shaped pads made of thick adhesive felt or moleskin to reduce the friction while still leaving the blister exposed so it heals more quickly.Make sure that you position the blister in the center of the pad to relieve the pressure and friction., Blisters that rub against something regularly, such as those on the feet or fingers, can be covered with a loose bandage for additional protection.Bandages lower the pressure on the blister and reduce the friction, the two key things in helping a blood blister heal and lowering the chances of infection. Be sure to use a sterile dressing, and change it regularly.Before applying a dressing clean the blister and surrounding area.
 If the blister is extraordinarily large, make an appointment with your doctor. These blisters do sometimes need to be drained, and it is best to do so under professional supervision to prevent infection.

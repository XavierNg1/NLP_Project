 Grate finely.
 Add the grated carrots. Cook gently for 20 minutes or until cooked through. (This is "sweating" the carrots.) Be sure to stir frequently to prevent the carrots burning.
 Drop in 2 tablespoons of the slivered or flaked almonds and the semolina. Fry for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat once browned.
 Bring to the boil, then add the cooked carrot mixture and the almond and semolina mixture.
 The halvah will begin to thicken at this stage. If you don't think that it is thickening enough, add a touch more semolina to help.
, Set aside to cool for about an hour. Cut into pieces, sprinkle with extra nuts and raisins and serve. Alternatively, serve freshly cooked and warm, in a less formal heaped shape. Again, sprinkle with raisins and nuts to decorate.

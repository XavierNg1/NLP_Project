 Be sure that your lashes are free of any makeup and/or oily residue. Not only does this speed up the application time, the adhesive will stick better to clean lashes;
, This means shower before your appointment and/or wash your hair & body separately.
 No saunas, hot yoga, sweaty gym sessions, etc.
 Oils in your makeup remover, skin care products, makeup, etc will breakdown the adhesive on your lashes. Ask your Lash Stylist for recommended products.
 This will also breakdown the adhesive and cause your extension to fall out prematurely.
 If they're criss-crossing, use a disposable mascara wand to comb through your lashes, root to end.
 The less eye makeup you wear, the less your play with your lashes, the longer they will last.

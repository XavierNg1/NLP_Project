 Chances are there are plenty of new things you've never seen before on the road, and you want to soak everything up. Also, offer suggestions about what you want to do while on the road. If you spot an ice cream shop that looks awesome, tell your parents. They may not listen to you every time, but it's nice to have some input on where to go., You're probably going to be with them for a while, so why not make the most of it and have a good time? Road trips can offer lots of bonding experiences as long as you turn off the phone and just hang out.

Play games such as License plate A-Z where you have to try and find a license plate for each letter of the alphabet in order, or play "fortunately/unfortunately", where you and your siblings make up a story and take turns saying something unfortunate and something fortunate that happens in the story. It will definitely make your parents happy seeing you and your siblings spending time together and also take some stress away from them.

,, The players must all hide at least 5 meters (16.4Â ft) away from the "home base".
 The aim of the game is for the hiding players to return to home base without being tagged.


Hiding players must run to the home base and say loudly "123 home base!". If a player gets tagged first, they're "it" next.
If you're "it" next and you don't want to be, you must do 10 push ups or do the Harlem shake.

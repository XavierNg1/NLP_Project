 Many places offer money orders, including banks, post offices, places like Western Union, gas stations, grocery stores, and big box stores. You should be able to find a location near to you that offers money orders., A money order is similar to a check, in that you must address it to someone. In this case, you need to make it out to the company whose bill you're paying. You also need the payment amount, as the money order is made out in that amount., The plus side of money orders is that you can use cash, a debit card, or a credit card to pay for the money order. Also, because it's prepaid, it will never bounce like a check can. A money order is basically a check that you prepay for. You tell the person how much goes on it, and then you pay for it. You'll also pay a small fee per money order, usually a dollar or two.You'll need a separate money order for each bill you pay.
Keep the receipt. That's the only proof you have that you created a money order., Like a check, the money order needs to be signed by you before you send it, and you sign it on the front. You can also add in a memo about what the payment is for. For example, if you need to add an account number for the bill, it can go in the memo line., Once you have the money order, you can mail it. A money order is safer to mail than cash because it is tied to the recipient, meaning it can't be used by other people, just like a check. However, you should still use a secure envelope to mail it, the kind that has a design inside to obscure what's being mailed.Don't forget to add anything that needs to go with it, such as the return receipt for the payment.
 Once you mail it off, all you need to do is wait for the recipient to cash it. They will need to take it to the bank and provide proof that they are who they say they are before they cash it and apply it to your account.

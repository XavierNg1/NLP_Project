The puppy will sniff around and get his scent on things as he does so. Make sure that you keep track of the puppy to keep him from getting lost or hiding somewhere. After the puppy has had time to wander, put him into a room or his kennel., After you have put the puppy away, let your existing dog back into the house and let him wander freely. He will be excited to sniff the places your puppy wandered around. Repeat this process daily until you are ready to make a face to face introduction., Once your old dog becomes less interested in the smell of the new puppy, the two dogs should be ready to meet. Observe your old dog closely during these sessions to see how he reacts to the scent of the puppy.To be sure that your old dog and the new puppy are ready to meet, try introducing them on neutral ground.

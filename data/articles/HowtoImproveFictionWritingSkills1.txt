 Write in the voice of a character in your story or novel. Keep the journal for a few days or weeks. This can help you get into the voice of your character and really see the world from their perspective. You can then use phrases and lines from the journal in your story or novel about the character.


For example, you may write in the voice of a female main character from a short story you are working on. Or you may write in the voice of a minor male character in a novel you are struggling to complete.;
, Write about a setting using sensory details. Take a setting in your story and describe it as much as you can, from the layout of the setting to the objects in the setting. Write about a particular setting from a character's perspective. You can also do writing prompts that focus on setting by looking at a list of prompts online at Writerâ€™s Digest.com.
 A freewrite is when you sit down for 10-15 minutes and write about an idea or prompt without stopping. Freewrites are a great way to let your ideas flow without judgement or second guessing yourself. Put music on in the background while you do the freewrite to help you get inspired.Make it habit to do a freewrite once a day in the morning or at night before bed. Choose a writing prompt or make up your own prompt by choosing a line from your own writing.
You may find that the content you create during the freewrite can be used in your own writing or to help you start a new piece of fiction.
 Another good writing exercise is to use a specific emotion or location as a writing prompt. Write about a strong emotion like rage, fear, excitement, or desire. You may decide to write your own feelings about the emotion, or write about the emotion from the point of view of a character in your fiction.


For example, you may do a writing exercise where you take a character that is passive in your story and write about anger or rage from their perspective. This can help to add dimension to the character.

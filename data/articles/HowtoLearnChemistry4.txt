 Reviewing your materials daily will help solidify your knowledge. Studying for a shorter amount of time every day for a week will give you better results than studying the whole day before a test.Just like athletes practice their sport every day to get better, you have to do the same to learn and get better at chemistry., Writing down important information will help you to remember it. If you are taking a class, write down all the important concepts from a lecture. Write down central ideas in your textbook, too. Even if you feel like you know it, writing it down will help you to remember it later.
 Two heads are better than one. Learning is much easier when you have someone taking the journey with you. If you ever struggle with a lesson they may be able to help you understand it by explaining how they figured it out. Likewise, you might reinforce your own knowledge by explaining concepts to them.
 Your teacher or professor will have office hours. Go visit them and ask questions about elements of the material that you don't understand. Teachers are happy to give students a little extra help if they ask.Just don't ask your question at 10:45PM the night before your exam and expect an answer.


Your professor may also give you a copy of an old exam to look at. This will help you determine the type of questions you may see on your exams, but it won't tell you exactly which specific questions you'll have to answer.

 You will need to replace the old one on your Honda IACV before returning it back to its place under the hood.;
, You will find it at the back center of the under hood area, near the throttle body (TB) and mounted on the rear of the intake manifold (IM). You will have to remove the TB intake hose in order to gain access to area of the IM that is connected to the IACV.



Unscrew the 2 bolts attaching the IACV to the intake manifold. You will have to feel around for the lower bolt, which will be just out of plain sight.
Pull out the gray plug from the right side of the Honda IACV.
Remove the blue plug from the throttle body.
Locate the coolant hose that attaches the IACV to the TB.
Use needle-nose pliers to pull back the clamp that holds the coolant hose in place and then pull the hose out. This will provide enough slack to pull the Honda idle air control valve to the front so you can completely remove it.
Detach the last 2 hoses from the IACV in order to free it for cleaning.
, Note the areas with the heaviest concentration of filth, as you will need to pay special attention to them during the cleaning.
 Spray the valve with the carb cleaner, being sure to thoroughly saturate the heavy buildup.

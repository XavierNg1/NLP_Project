 Book clubs use lots of different methods to choose new books. Typically, the book selected for the next club meeting is decided during the prior meeting.Books on the “100 Best Books” list of a major periodical are good choices, as are current bestsellers.
Consider both fiction and nonfiction when choosing a book.;
, Some book clubs can be hosted in your home. If your home is too small to host the book club, or if you simply don’t want to host the club meeting at your home, choose a communal location like a library conference room or a cafe.If you plan on hosting at a library, be sure to reserve a conference room well in advance of the book club meeting. You might not be able to get one at the last minute.
 If your book club has a regular meeting date and time (for instance, 8:00 every first Monday of the month), there’s no need to set the date and time. However, if the date and time of your book club varies, decide when the meeting will occur and let the club members know.There are many ways to let club members know when the next meeting will be. You could, for instance, call each of them with the information. You could also send a mass email containing the date and time.
If you prefer a more personal touch, you could mail out an invitation with the relevant information.

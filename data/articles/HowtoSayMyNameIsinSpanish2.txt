 For example, if your name is John Smith, say “Mi nombre es John Smith.” The correct pronunciation of “Mi nombre es” is “Mee nohm-breh es,” and its literal translation is “My name is.”Use “Mi nombre es” in situations in which you’re introducing yourself to someone you don’t know via the telephone or when leaving a voicemail. This introduction method is considered extremely formal and serious, and is often only used in situations that don’t take place face-to-face.

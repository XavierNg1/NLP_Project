If you feel rushed and behind, then stop to notice what you've chosen to do.
Choose to do a few extra things per day and save the rest for another day.
Be realistic about the time you have and how long it takes to accomplish a certain task.
Allow extra time for the unexpected.
Change your schedule and stay in control of your day.;
, We tend to move at the speed of the technology we've chosen.


Writing a letter takes longer than sending an Email.
Doing dishes takes longer than using the dishwasher.

Try the slower option every now and then.
 Everyone needs a retreat. Spend five minutes or five hours to replenish yourself.


Remove distractions.
Try the bubbly warmth of an aromatherapy bath.
Sit in your favorite corner of the couch.
Lounge in the shade of the backyard.
Take in the view from the kitchen window.
Daydream.
 Water can be a boon to psychic health and well-being.


Listen to running water on an audiotape.
Have lunch near a fountain.
Jog along a river.
Soak in a whirlpool tub.
 As you get in your car, while at your desk or as you say goodbye, just stop and take a deep breath. Stop and slow the day for a moment.

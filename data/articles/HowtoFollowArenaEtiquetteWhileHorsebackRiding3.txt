 Each discipline and each barn has different rules about the show arena. Look up the specific rules of the horse show you’re attending. Be aware of what other riders are doing and how it differs from your home barn. If you have a question, ask. It’s safer to ask than to assume.


For example, many barns have a rule where you need to let riders know that you're coming into the arena by saying "Door" or "Coming in!"
Many barns also have rules where you can't be on your cell phone while you're riding.
Dogs are also prohibited at many barns because they can spook the horses.
 The only people in the warmup ring at a show should be the people who are competing. Do not bring your horse into the warmup ring if he is not competing, even if you are and are riding a different horse., Your trainer should be on the outside of the ring, giving you directions. However, do not stop on the rail to talk to your trainer. Other people may be riding in the ring, and you should try not to be disruptive., You should always have your number displayed at a show. Some shows require numbers for both horse and rider, but some only require one. Make sure that you know the rules and obey them.

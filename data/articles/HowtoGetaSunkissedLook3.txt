 If you wear makeup, it is important to remove it before going to bed. Removing makeup gives your skin time to breathe. Failing to remove it can clog your pores, which causes acne and blackheads. Use a cotton pad and makeup remover, or apply a small amount of olive oil to your face to remove dirt and makeup., It is important to apply SPF even when you aren’t tanning. UVA and UVB rays can cause skin damage even with minimal sun exposure. Apply sunscreen even on cold or cloudy days. SPF 15 is the minimum, but it is better to buy a sunscreen of at least SPF 30. Rub it on your face and any other exposed skin.Look for a sunscreen with a label that says “nonacnegenic” and “noncomedogenic” to prevent pore clogging.
 An unhealthy diet consisting of a lot of junk food can dull your skin and cause acne. Make sure to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Eat fruits and vegetables daily. Consume foods rich in vitamin C to promote glowing skin. You should also consider a low sugar and fat diet.Bland foods like rice and oatmeal are better for your skin than spicy and fermented foods, like fried food and salt.
 Exercise at least three times a week. If you can exercise more, at least thirty minutes a day is ideal. Running, jogging, and yoga promote blood circulation and can accelerate your body’s cleansing process.

 The method above is the easiest to understand, but requires extra math to find the number of singles. Here's a way to skip that step and find the total bases using Hits instead: Total Bases = Hits + Doubles + (2 x Triples) + (3 x Home Runs).


This works because one base per Hit takes care of all the singles. Since this also awards one base for each double, you only need to add 1 more base per double to find the total. Similarly, add two extra bases for triples, and three extra for home runs.
 Just as before, the slugging percentage is equal to the total bases divided by at bats.

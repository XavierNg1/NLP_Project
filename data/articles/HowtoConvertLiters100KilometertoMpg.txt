 This is based on the fact that 1l/100km = 235.214mpg (that means that if 1 liter could go 100 km then 1 gallon would go 235.214 miles). Notice using an italics l so it is easier to tell which is the letter l versus number 1:


______ l/100 km

*

1 g/100 km
3.7854 l/100 km

*

        1        x g/100 km
*

62.1371 mpg 1 100 km/g

=
 ? mpg

;
, Note the 1/(x g/100km) represents the reciprocal of x g/100 , which was found by the preceding two calculation and then inverting that with 1/x which represents a common button on calculators for reciprocal, l/100 km and miles.

The first operation we perform in the formula is to change the volume in gallons to liters. We use the common conversion factor of: 1 gal per 3.78541178 l in the ratio
The next multiplication is to take the reciprocal of the current value. We do this because our current units (gallons/100 kilometer) -- like reading divide as "/" as "per" -- is volume/distance and our end result needs to be miles/gallon which is distance/volume.
The final step is to convert kilometers to miles. We use the common conversion factor of 1 km = 0.62137119 mi, although in our case we are dealing with 100 km, so we multiple 0.621371 by 100 to get the conversion value of 62.1371

, You can use this to check your work.

62.1371 mpg 1 100 km/g

=
23.5214 mpg




Congratulations, you've just converted liters/100 km to mpg!

 You are going to create what appears to be a floating tree so as you search for limbs consider how they will fit together, as well as fit inside or on top of picture frames.

Consider taking a single limb and simply breaking it up amongst the frame.
Only use viable, un-rotted limbs.
Choose limbs that will work well within your frame size.;
, Before you saw limbs to fit frame, lay out how the limb will fit/look within the frames. Lay the frames on a flat surface and then place the single or multiple limbs over the frames to get a rough idea of flow.

Go for interest instead of a pedestrian design. Consider adding limbs to jut out off to the side (as long as it remains inside the frame boundaries) or climbing up through the frameâ€¦play around with ideas until you find one you love.
 Before you saw, mark cut areas with the pen or pencil so you know exactly where your branch will begin and end within the frame., Sand the tree ends to ensure you remove any additional broken wood or splintering areas., You can approach this project two ways: removing the glass and laying the branch directly on the background or placing branches beneath the glass.

Remove glass and mount branches on background. If necessary, remove advertisement paper covering before applying branch. Add glue along the back of the branch and affix on the background.
Replace glass if you plan to keep the branches behind glass or discard glass (safely).
Allow ample dry time before hanging pictures.


Ask a friend to help you lay out frames on the wall to obtain the ideal look. Or use a level and ruler to measure and position frames on your own.

, What about her makes you want to act like her? If it's her Caster abilities you're after, well, then you're out of luck - she was born with them... you probably weren't! But if you like her mystery, her sense of humour, just the kind of person she is, then you're definitely on the right track.
 Lena was never popular; she only had two friends: her boyfriend, Ethan Wate, and his best friend, Link. You don't have to give up your best friends, but all the extra people you sit with at lunch don't really need to be there. You have to be mysterious! Don't reveal your whole personality when you first meet someone. You have to enjoy your alone time as well, because being alone adds a sense of mystery.
 When Lena was just a sophomore, she was taking trigonometry and a bunch of other advanced classes. You don't have to spend all your time studying, but make sure being smart and learning is one of your biggest priorities.
 Lena was always drawing and writing in sharpie. Her hands always had things written all over them. Writing is a good way to get those deep feelings out. Poetry is great. Or if you're a good storyteller, write a fiction novel! Just write what you feel.
 Lena had a necklace full of pieces of junk that meant the world to her. She dressed pretty simply, jeans and tees, and sometimes a long skirt or long dress. She wasn't preppy, or trashy, or colorful. And she always wore a pair of beat up, low top black converse with things written on them in sharpie. You could also colour your hair, but keep in mind most hair-colouring products are permanent, so you can't switch back to your natural hair colour very fast.
 You can use perfume, deodorant, body lotion, or something else that smells like lemons. Maybe you also can do some rosemary in your pockets. Make this smell your signature!

, And, although it sounds cheesy, it works. To be like Lena you have to think like her too!

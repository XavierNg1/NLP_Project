 Press the “ON/OFF” button at the top of the camera. The camera will power on and the lens will come out.;
, At the top of the camera is a switch. Bring it to the far-left mode. The icon for that is a camera.
 Press the “FUNC SET” button on the middle of the circular button at the back of the camera. This will bring out the toolbar on the screen. Go to the shooting mode or shooting scenes, and select “Smart Shutter.”

The icon for Smart Shutter is a camera with a smile.






The camera will enter Shooting Standby mode, with the Smart Shutter icon displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.
 The camera’s Smart Shutter mode has three submodes—Smile Detection, Wink Self-Timer, and Face Self-Timer. This can be changed by pressing the “DISP” button on the circular button at the back of the camera. Press this button once, and select the first icon for Smile. The camera is now in Smile Detection mode.
 You can input how many shots under this mode the camera will do. Press the up or down buttons while in the submode selection to set the number of shots. It can be between one and ten.


This is the number of continuous shots the camera will take once a smile is detected.
 Once done with the Smile Detection mode and the number of shots, press the “FUNC SET” button to finalize the setting.
 With the Smile Detection mode on, the camera will start monitoring faces wherever it’s aimed at. At this point, you can’t adjust the focus, zoom, or composition anymore.
 Once the camera detects a smile, it will shoot based on the number of shots and take the required pictures.


Have the subjects turn the faces toward the camera and open their mouth wide enough to make their teeth visible. The camera will be able to detect the smiles easily this way.
 Press the “Play” button at the back of the camera to view the pictures. Navigate through them by pressing the left and right keys from the circular button.

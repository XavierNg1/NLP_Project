 Each folder is labeled "Art", "Nature," "Plants," etc." and contains a set of high-resolution photos to choose from.


In newer versions of OS X, there is only one folder, called "Desktop Pictures," with Apple-supplied desktop images.
 As with solid colors, you can immediately set your desktop background by clicking on one of the choices.
 If you have photos imported into Apple's iPhoto application, you can also choose a photo straight from your iPhoto library from this menu.

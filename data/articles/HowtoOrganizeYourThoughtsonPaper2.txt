Now you'll have the distinct lists for each category you've created, making it easier to get the tasks done., You may need to draft the lists more than once depending on how involved your project is. Sometimes you may even want to put one list away and re-write the list from memory, and then bring the old one back to see how you’ve prioritized differently. Drafting can give you a good sense of what you want out of your lists and how to accomplish it.

 Cut clean cotton cloth into squares that are roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) along each side.Cotton works well because it is a natural fiber and relatively breathable. Avoid fabrics with fibers that are spaced too tightly together. Also avoid synthetic fabrics.
You can use a rag or old piece of cloth for this, but make sure that the material you use is clean.
 Fill a small spray bottle with undiluted distilled white vinegar. Spray both sides of each square until moist to the touch.


Let dry slightly. The cloth can be moist, but it should not be dripping wet by the time you add it to the dryer.
The vinegar is the only element in this fabric softener formula that lends itself to actually softening your clothes. It may not be as strong as a liquid fabric softener using vinegar, but some of the effects should still remain.
 Drop 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil onto a cloth square. Spread the drops out so that they seep into the fibers of the entire square.


The essential oil will give your clothes a pleasant yet mild fragrance. You can technically use this method without the use of essential oils, but since the softening effects are less powerful than a liquid fabric softener alternative, it would make more sense to take advantage of the deodorizing and re-scenting abilities of this method.
 Place the scented fabric softener sheet directly into your dryer as you prepare to dry a load of clothes. Run a standard drying cycle. You do not need to do anything special from this point on.


Each dryer sheet can be used for two or three loads, but you may need to refresh the scent by adding 3 drops or more of the essential oil before use. Refresh the softening properties by giving the sheet another quick spray of vinegar.

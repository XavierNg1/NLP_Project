 A nutraceutical is a food supplements with a drug-like action. Nutraceuticals are side-effect free and therefore safer than pharmaceuticals; they also have the advantage of being non-prescription.


Two nutraceuticals relevant to joint health are chondroitin and glucosamine. These two molecules are "synergistic", which means they have a greater effect when given together, than either does by itself.
 The theory behind glucosamine and chondroitin is that they provide the building blocks for cartilage repair and also improve the quality of joint fluid.


The aim is to nourish cartilage and optimize its health to protect against further chips and damage. They also help to increase the viscosity (or thickness) of joint fluid, which makes for better lubrication.
However, there is a great deal of debate among veterinary scientists as to whether glucosamine and chondroitin can live up to these claims. Despite this, a lot of animals do seem to benefit, and since the supplement is unlikely to do any harm, and if cost is not a factor, there is nothing to be lost by using this supplement.
 Glucosamine and chondroitin are marketed in palatable veterinary formulations, but human supplements are also suitable for use in dogs.


A typical dose for a dog under 10kg is 500mg of glucosamine and 400mg of chondroitin, daily. Overdose is unlikely.
In arthritic animals, these food supplements must be taken for life.

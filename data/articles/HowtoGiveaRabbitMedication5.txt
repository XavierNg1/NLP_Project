 Sit down with your rabbit on your lap. Position the rabbit so they are facing away from you. Then, using your non-dominant arm, hold the rabbit under your arm like a football. Be sure to keep the ear upright.
 Your ear drops or ointment should have come with a plastic applicator. Some applicators will already have the medication inside them, and others will not. If your does not, insert the applicator into the medication and pull-back the plunger until you have the right amount. Then, gently insert the applicator tip into the ear canal.


Don't push the applicator too far down, or you could risk damaging the middle ear.
As always, check the medication packaging for information on proper dosages.
 Keep a firm grasp on your rabbit, as they are likely to squirm. Then depress the plunger on your applicator and administer the medication into your rabbit's ear.
 Finally, rub your rabbit's ears for a few seconds. This will allow the medication to reach inside the ear.Repeat this process on the other side, if necessary.

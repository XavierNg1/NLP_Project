 On your computer’s web browser, head to the website of Inbox by Gmail.
 You can log into your account by looking for the field at the top of the screen that asks for your Google email address and password. Click inside each box and enter your information, then click the “Log in” button.
 Simply look through your inbox and all your bundles will be at the top of the page. Click on it and a box will pop up, followed by the emails that are being bundled.
 Look inside the blue box right below the bundling button. The box will alert you to what bundling is, and you will see a button that says “Disable Bundling” on the bottom right side of the box. Click this button.


Once you click “Disable Bundling,” a box will pop up letting you know that the emails inside the bundle are going to be put back into your inbox. Click “OK” and your emails will now be unbundled.

 This is the most obvious thing to do. Start a conversation before the bell rings. Ask them what kind of music they're into and what movies they've seen.
 If school just started, or if there was just a vacation break, ask the people who sit by you what they did over break. You can share stories and it's an easy way to make friends!

, Even if you don't need one, it's an easy way to talk to the person sitting next to you. Ask for a piece of paper if you're taking notes, a pen, marker, or highlighter if you're checking homework or highlighting. Or ask for a pencil or eraser.

 Check the Knock Out rose for pests like aphids, mealybugs, scales and spider mites a couple times each month. Knock Out roses are rarely bothered by them but they may do some damage. One tell-tale sign that these pests are making a meal out of a Knock Out rose is a sticky clear liquid called honeydew that they often secrete on the rose leaves while they are feeding.


Look under the leaves and along the stems for the pests.
 Aphids are small, oval insects that are usually green or red but can be nearly any color.


Mealybugs and scales are flat, oval insects that attach themselves to the leaves or stems and rarely move.
Spider mites are very tiny pests that are usually first noticed when they spin a very fine web between the leaves or branches.
 If these pests are detected, spray the Knock Out rose thoroughly with a strong spray from the garden hose in the morning to knock the pests off and wash off the honeydew.


Aphids usually canâ€™t get back on the shrub and spider mites hate moisture.The rose may need to be sprayed once or twice each week to keep the pests under control.
 Mealybugs and scales can be rubbed off with a thumbnail or a cotton ball soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol.

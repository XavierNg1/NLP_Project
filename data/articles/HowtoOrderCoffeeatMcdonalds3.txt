 Since McDonalds is an extremely busy fast-food restaurant, your order may be incorrect. It's a good idea to double check your order to make sure it is correct. This is especially important for more complicated orders, like milk substitutions and flavor additions.
 It's never a good idea to be rude to people who are preparing your drinks or food. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, so be polite to the cashier if your order is incorrect. The more polite you are, the better and faster your drink will be prepared., Once you've gotten your correct drink, enjoy it! If you ordered a hot drink, let it cool before you drink it to avoid burning your tongue. If you ordered a cold beverage, drink it slowly to avoid getting a brain freeze.

 You'll find many ice-melt mats on the market. Many are systems that are installed under the driveway, which may be more expensive. Some mats may allow you to lay them out on top of the ice to melt it., Use a pot on the stove or an electric kettle to boil as much water as you can safely carry outside. Pour the water around on the ice to melt it. If you have a metal watering can, this is a great way to spread the water around.If you have a way to attach a hose to the hot water in your house, this is a great way to spray down the icy driveway.
You may need to shovel the melted icy slush after you pour water on it.
 Use a ratio of 1:1 of warm water and vinegar. Once you have mixed it up in the can, pour it around on the ice. Let it sit for a few minutes to start melting the ice. Use an ice chisel or a heavy metal shovel to chop up the melting ice.

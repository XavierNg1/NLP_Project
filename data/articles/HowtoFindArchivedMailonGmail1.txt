, Archived messages will still appear as search results, so if you know the sender, subject, part of the body, or any other part of the message, search for it using the search bar at the top of the page.
 If a label was applied to a message that was archived, it can still be found sorted by that label. Browse through your labels on the left side of the page.
 This will display all of the mail in your Gmail account, regardless of its label or whether or not it's archived.


Archived messages are not indicated by any label or other indicator. An archived message simply has the "Inbox" label removed so that it no longer appears in your inbox.
 It will be returned to your inbox and sorted by its original date.

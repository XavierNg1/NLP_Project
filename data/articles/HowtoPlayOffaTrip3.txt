 If you fell completely, then quickly get up. Quickness is key here because you don’t want to be on the ground for too long.
 Along with the eye contact, make sure to glare and express anger in your facial features, especially your eyebrows. This step is to express your anger towards the object that tripped you. If you are wearing sunglasses at the time, remove them in a distinct manner.
 Make what ever tripped you feel less human for getting in your way and impeding your stride. Use phrases like, “Are you serious?” or “Why are you in my way?” Make sure to use an angered tone too.

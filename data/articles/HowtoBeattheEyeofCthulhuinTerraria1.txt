 If you have discovered the Crimson/Corruption, you can craft an Ebonwood/Crimsonwood Sword.
 A Copper (or Tin) sword simply will not do. Look for Gold (Or platinum), or at least make a Silver (or Tungsten) sword., As the Eye of Cthulhu floats in the air, unless you want to be constantly jumping, a Spear is a good choice. Strong Spears can do, but there are better beginner Spears. Explore the ocean (Trident), break Crimson Hearts (Rotted Fork), and find them in surface chests., The Flail technically falls into the category of Ranged, but can do as Melee. Either craft the Meatball (the Crimson flail) or break Shadow Orbs to get the Ball 'o Hurt (Corruption flail).

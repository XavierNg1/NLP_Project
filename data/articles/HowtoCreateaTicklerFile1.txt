 You will need a file cabinet or hanger, as well as 43 files. This will allow you to create a file for each month, along with 31 files for each day in the month.There are a variety of ways you can create tickler files, but this is generally the most accepted and easiest to keep track of.;
, You will need to label 12 of the folders with each of the months. Then label the remaining folders numerically, 1 through 31.
 Place the folders into the year's current month, starting with today's date. For example, if the date is June 15th, place folders 15-31 in the June folder, and 1-14 in the July folder.


Note: June only has 30 days, but keep the "31" folder at the end of the month so that you can easily move it to the next without getting things out of order.
 Now that the folders are organized, it's time to start filling them. Place anything you need to remember in the appropriate folder. You can put in sticky notes with reminders, bills, letters, or anything else that needs your attention that day.


Place all of your future information in the appropriate monthly folders. When you reach that moth, you can then sort the items into the appropriate daily folders.
If your to-do item is going to take several days, be sure to file it on the day it starts and not the day it's due!

, Your tickler file will only be useful if it is easily accessible. It should be within arm's reach of your primary work area. This will allow you to access the file without having to get up, which would be detrimental to its continued use., At the start of each day, remove the items from the day's folder and place them on your desk to take care of that day. As you finish each item, file it away in permanent storage or discard it. Move the daily folder to the end of the list in the next month of the tickler file.

 The cam is the wheel-shaped object where string and cables attach to the bow limbs. It manipulates the draw weight for more efficient energy storage, which is why compound bows can be so powerful.Some bows have two cams, one at each limb tip, while others have one cam and one idler wheel. Each cam should have a small hole or other mark along the edge to assist in finding the right timing, but the exact placement varies with manufacturer., Draw the bow fully back. Have a friend watch the cams as you do so. If your bow has two cams, did each one hit the "draw stop" at the same time, or are they not in sync with each other?In a single-cam bow, wheel timing is not as critical, but if the timing mark is not close to where the manual says it should be, make adjustments below.Never shoot your bow without an arrow, as the bow is only designed to release its energy through the arrow.
 If your bow's timing is off, you'll need a bow press in order to adjust the cables. Because using a bow press incorrectly can cause serious harm to yourself or the bow, it is recommended that you bring your bow to a professional for adjustment. Only use a bow press without expert supervision if you know it is suitable for your bow, and you are experienced with its use.
 The control cable is the cable the stops on the cam touch when the bow is fully drawn. Once the bow is safely in the bow press and the tension is relaxed, remove one end of this cable and give it a half twist (180ยบ) before reattaching. Remove the bow from the press, then test the cam timing again. If the timing is still off, return the bow to the press and repeat this step until the timing is correct. Reverse the direction of the twist if the cam timing is worse than before.


The cam timing can change significantly with a small twist, so it's best to go one half twist at a time.

 Save the workbook into a logical file folder. If you tap on the green font "Ticklezzz" below, there will appear an animation of the curve to be created; hit the browser's Back button to return from YouTube here. It was done with random number generation at the tips and pi approximation to 15 digits for a constant recalc, and recorded in QuickTime Player.

Set to whatever pleases your aesthetic -- chaos is possible herewith tho! Low values work better. Notice that inputting a 2 gets rid of all those wonderful little Errors in the data!? Error which should probably rather be kept, as will be explained."; B1: Enter the column heading Neutrality Formulas; C1: Enter in the Defined Variable Name Converter; D1: Enter w/o quotes the formula "=(PI()^2)/((PI()^2)-(205))" and Insert Name Create in Left Row name Converter for cell $D$1 and Insert New Comment and edit in "D1: The original value is formula (to be entered in the formula bar as copied from here) of: =(PI()/180)^-0.1414  ….

F1: Enter 95 and Insert Name Create Left Row Name CFactor for cell $F$1 and do insert New Comment and edit in "F1: The original value is -5. Try entering 0 or 1 or 6 or =-PI() or =-EXP(1) (a fave) ..

Currently= 95.", A2: a; B2: b; C2: sin a; D2: cos a; E2: Factor sin a; F2: cos b., In cell A3, enter w/o quotes the formula "=Degrees" and Insert Name Define name Top for cell $A$3 and do Insert New Comment and edit in "A3: This cell has the Insert -Define(d) Name of "Top", as used by cells below it in their formulas. Its own reference is to the "Degrees" variable."; Edit Go To cell range A4:A363 and with A4 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula "=A3-((2*Top)/360)" and Edit Fill Down and select cell A4 and Insert New Comment and edit in "A4: The effect of this formula,  "=A3-((2*Top)/360)"  is to decrement a series automatically through +Top to -Top (cell A3=Top), eg. When Top=1, the result in cell A363 at the bottom will be -1, the series having decremented thru 0 (in cell A183). If instead Degrees=360, then Top=360= cell A3's new value in the formula. A3=360. So 360-((2*360)/360)= (360-(720/360)) = 360-(2) = 358. Cell A362 near the bottom = -358 and cell A183 still = 0. The decrementing is uniform. If Degrees=Top= (-1), then the formula increments up to A363=+1 uniformly."., But the cell-formula below is different!"; B4: Into cell B4 enter w/o quotes the formula "=-A4/(1-(1/A4))" and do Insert New Comment and edit in "B4: This cell's formula, "=-A4/(1-(1/A4))" is also a Neutral Operation -- that of a-b = a/b. So the effect is that there are rotating formulas thru various Neutralities." B5: Enter in w/o quotes the formula "=A5/(A5+1)" and insert New Comment and edit in "B5: This cell's formula, "=A5/(A5+1)" is another Neutrality., of a-b = a*b." B6: Enter into the cell w/o quotes the formula, "=A6/(1-(1/A6))" and Insert New Comment and edit in "B6: This cell's formula, "=A6/(1-(1/A6))" is another different Neutrality of a-b = a/b. Edit Go To cell range B7:B363 and Edit Fill Down, which will repeat the 4-sequence formulation above to the bottom., The ±Top and Decrement in cell-column A, e.g. In A3, is divided by twice the Neutrality-result in B3, so that's "A3/(2*B3)". That result is multiplied by both CFactor, say = -5, and Converter, say = 1.7725501863 or =(PI()/180)^-0.1414. Then the SIN() function is applied to that result. The SIN() function returns a value from 0 to 1, having to do with a point on a curve, say a circle or an ellipse or a flower's edge. The above result is multiplied by a COS(ine) function performing the same way. So it's multiplying together 2 parts of the same angle. If sine is y/r and cos is x/r than it's achieved XY/r^2, right?  Then, by adding to the above total product the LAST formula term, "+COS((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)", it's setting the result in a path around a circle (or cycle). For cell C3 in Row 3, the ROW() function returns the row the formula is in, row 3, and subtracts 3 from it; 3-3=0, so I'll get the COS of 0 which is 1. The "*PI()/180" part of the formula is Excel's way of converting sine formulas from angles to pi-radians and vice versa.  Performed over 360 or 361 rows, the full circle is completed by the last term, as modified in form by the previous XY/r^2 relation ... that's it in a nutshell. Why's it called "sin(a)"? To fool intruders? No, that's just how the sheet formulas evolved, so it helps keep track of the Form-Evolution-Path." , The formula, "=(SIN(CFactor*A3/(2*B3)*Converter)*SIN(A3*CFactor*Converter))+SIN((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)", is different in 2 respects: 1) the 2nd term, "SIN(A3*CFactor*Converter)", for sine = distance Y over radius r, i.e. y/r, is fully squared, so I get Y^2/r^2, instead of XY/r^2 as explained in cell C3; 2) the last term "SIN((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)", works with and against the final COS() function in cell C3 to complete the points around the circle, since elements of set {X=COS(), Y=SIN()} give the coordinates of circle points on the circumference (unless and until otherwise modified, as done here by the other terms), relative to a constant radius r. But the whole point is to modify the constancy of radius r to get the fun design! To understand this better, see the explanation of the formula in cell C3's comment please, or ask.", These next two steps may be skipped therefore, but they're easy. Into E1, enter "Sin(C3)" and Edit Fill Down to E3:E363. Do Insert New Comment and edit in "E3: The new formula, =SIN(1/CFactor*C3*(1/Converter)), is an attempt to see a Side View -- see Chart at bottom in blue and white. This formula, "=CFactor*C3" merely re-applies whatever's the value or formula-value-variable in CFactor in cell F1 to the formula in C3 … from the outside, as it were. Whereas earlier, Cfactor gets used internally in cell C3's formula. The column title, "Factor sin a" tells the story of what I'm doing. Currently the formula is set to =SIN(C3)" instead. , Charting cell range E3:F363 I leave as an exercise to do. Perhaps Cos and Sin should be switched. , Edit Go To cell range C3:D363 and use either Chart Wizard to create a new chart page or use the Ribbon and select Charts, All, scroll down to Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter and OK and Cut or Copy the chart to the Chrys Chart worksheet's A1 cell. Hover over the lowest right corner until the double headed arrow appears and pull the chart open into a large square, Click on the Plot Background and choose Radial Fill dark Green right and Black left radial from Center, Double click on the series plot line and change the Line weight to 1 and color white. In Chart Layout, get rid of the axes and chart label, etc. unless you want to leave formulation notes and that is done via Chart Title Text Box options for MS Excel 2011 for the Mac. You are Done! The above jpg shows how it should have turned out

, A good time to make your approach is between the opening act and the headliner. You can ask how they liked the opening band, or if you think they're a good match for the headliner. It's also a good time to talk because you won't have to shout or make them listen to you when they want to listen to the performers.


Ask them if they go to a lot of concerts, or if this was special. They could be avid concert goers, or following band, or may even personally know people in one of the bands. Chances are good that they will know a lot about the band or bands on stage.
 Find out what they like, musically, and who their favorite artists are. You can say things like "I think the guitarist is pretty good, but I like the guy from "Stapled Ear Drums" better.


Be wary of letting your inner geek out. It's one thing to offer a gentle critique, but can become very tiresome, very quickly if you say things like, "I find his reliance on modal scales, particularly phrygian and locrian modes applied to otherwise pedestrian pop derivatives then fed through loopers and flangers to be highly emblematic of...." Don't worry, you won't need to finish the sentence. Your formerly-potential-conversation-partner will either have fallen asleep or simply wandered off in a daze.

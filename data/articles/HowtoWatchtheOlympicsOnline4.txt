 Both the IOC and NBC are offering video highlights of the games on YouTube. In the case of the IOC YouTube channel, they are also offering videos of historic moments in Olympic history.
 Neither Facebook nor Twitter will be offering live feeds, but both will be constantly updated by NBC, fans, and every news source in the world.



Facebook offers the NBC Olympics page, including exclusive content, fan commentary, and more.
Follow NBCOlympics on Twitter to keep up with events, moment by moment.
 Apps can be installed on your iPhone, Android, or Blackberry, and include in-depth information and guides for the games. Find an official app from the IOC, NBC, or another reputable source.
 To view the highlights of previous Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee has an "archive" of previous Olympic Games from which videos of highlights can be accessed.

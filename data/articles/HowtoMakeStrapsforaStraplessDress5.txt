 You need to turn the dress inside-out because you will be sewing the straps to the inside of the dress. This way the stitches will be less visible when you are wearing the dress. , Place the straps so that they start two inches below the neckline of the dress. Pin them close to the top of the neckline, a little further down from where you will be sewing. , If your dress has a lining, sew the straps only onto the lining of the dress. This way you won't be able to see the stitching when you are wearing the dress. If your dress does not have lining, make sure to use thread that matches the color of the straps to make the stitching less noticeable. Hand-stitch vertically so that the two inches of strap fabric is stitched against the dress. Then stitch horizontally about ¼ inch from where the straps hit the neckline.
If you are sewing halter straps, this is the final step. Halter straps tie at the neck, so you do not need to sew the straps in the back.
 If you are sewing straight back straps or crossover straps, you will need to also pin and sew the straps to the back of the dress. Keep two inches of the strap below the neckline. Pin the straps to the lining about ½ down from where you will be sewing.


If you are making crossback straps, you will need to cross the straps diagonally so that the straps are pinned to the opposite sides of the dress as in the front.
 Follow the same sewing procedures as you did when sewing the straps to the front of the dress. Make sure that you are only sewing the straps into the lining of the dress if your dress has lining.

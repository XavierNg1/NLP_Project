 To add an additional challenge to your lunge, add an arm raise. An arm raise can help open your upper body as you open your hips with the lunge. Step forward into your lunge. Then, lift your arms straight overhead.Your arms should be straight lines from your fingertips to your shoulders.
You can lift your arms at the same time you lunge forward for a simultaneous action.
 A variation for the arm raise is a lateral raise. In this move, you lift your arms out to your sides instead of overhead. To start, step into your lunge. Then, lift your arms out to the sides until they are at shoulder height. Keep your elbows slightly bent.Your arms should be parallel to the floor.
You can lift your arms at the same time as you lunge if you wish.
 Another variation for an arm raise is a front raise with your lunge. To complete, step forward into your lunge. As you step, raise your arms in front of you. Keep your palms facing the ground. Alternately, you can turn your palms so they are facing each other. Stop when your arms are slightly higher than parallel, about level with your shoulders.You can raise your arms at the same time as you step into your lunge if you wish.
 If you want to add an extra challenge, hold dumbbells as you complete your lunge and arm raise. Start with small weights, like five pounds. Complete the exercises the same with, just holding weights in your hands.Make sure to watch your lunge form as you add weight. You should still be able to complete the lunge with proper form even while holding hand weights. If the weight messes up your form, you should go back to arm raises with no weight.

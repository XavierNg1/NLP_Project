 Even if you don't feel very confident, take a minute to build yourself up before approaching a a potential date. Envision the conversation going well in your mind. If you are going into a conversation expecting to be rejected, it will show in your body language. Make sure you make eye contact and stand up straight and speak clearly.
 Sometimes a drink or two might be necessary to loosen up your inhibitions enough to talk to a good looking guy, but know when to stop. Going over the line can lead to some embarrassing situations. Drinking too much impairs your judgement, including your ability to decide if you have met your dream guy or not.
 Nothing will make you seem more lonely and desperate than revealing everything about your past right away. You don't want to seem like you're on the rebound and desperate to feel validated., Just because you met a good looking guy at a party and feel like you can talk to him all night does not mean you should. This is the time where you excuse yourself. Spend some time talking with your friends or meet some other new people. Just be patient and make your way back in bit. Leaving them wanting more and let them see your whole life isn't going to crumble the second you stop talking together!

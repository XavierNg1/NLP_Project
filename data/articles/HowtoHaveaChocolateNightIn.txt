 Invite friends or even family around beforehand, and plan where the chocolate night will take place in the house. Its probably best to take place somewhere where there will be a TV - or at least comfy chairs and lots of atmosphere!;
, Buy sweet, sugary snacks for everyone to enjoy. This includes:




Hot chocolate
Slushie drinks
Tea
Sugar (to add to drinks)
Full fat cream/gold top milk
Chocolate chunks
Popcorn
Big multiple chocolate bar
Chocolate milkshake
Whipped cream
Chocolate sprinkles
Marshmallows
Chocolate flakes



, Before the guests arrive, make sure you have good presentation. Take a few snacks, like a bowl of popcorn and chocolate milkshake for each. Present each item on a table or on a tray. Keep the rest in the kitchen and bring in when necessary.
 Eat a few popcorn or something while you wait, though.
 There is no point in getting all this ready if you are going to be uncomfortable!

, Perhaps your favourite soap to keep your minds occupied? Watching a soap will enable you to discuss what you think will happen next afterwards, too. Watching a film or another programme can be just as excited, too.
 If guests are staying the night, you could each take a bowl of marshmallows to bed to feast on during the night? It all depends on how you've planned the night - if you were going to stay up to very late hours, then you'll probably need more food and drink, more films, more music, and more things to keep you occupied. But if guests go home early, be sure to invite them back again another time! The fun never stops as long as you want it to stay!

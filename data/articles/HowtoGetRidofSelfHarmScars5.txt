 If you have scars on your arms or legs, wearing clothing to cover up the scars will prevent other people from seeing them.


This is not usually a good solution for summer weather.
 Tights can cover legs at almost any time of the year and can be paired with dresses, skirts or even shorts. Get lighter-weight tights for warmer times of the year and heavier-weight tights for cooler times of the year., If your scars are on your wrists, wear accessories that cover them up. Bracelets are useful, as are wristwatches. Sweatbands can be useful while you’re working out.
 If you want to go swimming, you don’t need to wear a swimsuit that bares a lot of skin. Choose a one-piece bathing suit, or wear swim shorts over your bathing suit. You can also wear a t-shirt or a surf shirt with swim shorts.

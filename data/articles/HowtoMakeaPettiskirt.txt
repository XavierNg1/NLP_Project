 This will save you hours in time spent ruffling the pettiskirt by hand.;
, The nylon chiffon fabric should be approximately 108 inches (2.7m) wide.
 You may choose a similar shade to the nylon chiffon, or a different color.
 This can take longer than cutting other fabrics because it can slip easily. You will need several different strip widths.


Cut 3 strips that are 6 inches (15.2cm) wide and 108 inches (2.7m) long.
Cut 6 strips that are 4 inches (10.2cm) wide and 108 inches (2.7m) long.
Cut 24 strips of 2-inch (5cm) wide fabric that are 108 inches (2.7m) long. Smaller lengths can be connected to make 108 inches (2.7m) long, if need be.
 It should be 7.5 inches (19cm) wide and 48 inches (1.2m) long to go around a girl's waist band. The elastic can later be cinched in to create a bigger or smaller waist.
 Your ribbon should be 1 inch (2.5cm) in width.
 Cut an elastic that is approximately that long, taking off extra for a tighter waist band, or adding extra for extra room.
 In order to connect the first strips, you will want it to be set to a 4:1 gathering ration.


This means that you are going to gather more on your 2-inch (5cm) strips than you will with your 4-inch (10.2cm) and 6 inch (15.2cm) strips. The many ruffles will create a pettiskirt full of body.
You will be making 3 layers of nylon chiffon ruffles to comprise the body of the skirt. Make each of the layers 1 at a time.
 Feed them into your ruffler foot. Feed them through your sewing machine until you have run the entire length of the 4-inch (10.2cm) strip.


You will need 4 times the amount of 2-inch (5cm) strips than 4-inch (10.2cm) strips to account for the ruffling ratio. You will need 4 2-inch (5cm) strips for each 4-inch (10.2cm) strip you gather. Either pin the new 2-inch (5cm) strip to the end of the last strip in advance, or simply feed in the next 2-inch (5cm) strip by hand when the last is finished.
 It should be a 2 to 1 ratio.
 You will need 2 of the ruffles you made to sew to the length of the 6-inch (15.2cm) strip.


You may want to pin the 2 4-inch (10.2cm) strips end to end on the 6-inch (15.2cm) strip before you start sewing.
 Set it aside.
,,, It should now be 7.5 inches (19cm) by 24 inches (70cm). Make sure the right sides face each other.
, Make sure to back stitch to secure it.
,,, Stitch an additional time 1 inch (2.5cm) below the seam. This is where your elastic will be inserted.
 Match the right side of the waist band to the right side of the top layer of chiffon.
 This is on the opposite side of where the elastic will go.
 Turn it inside out when you are finished.
, You can also attach a button on 1 end and a button loop at the other end of the elastic, if you prefer.
 Tie a bow and place it in front or back, depending on your child's preference.

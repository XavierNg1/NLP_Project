 Let's face it — sometimes, cheeks just refuse to be cooperative. If you can't get pinker cheeks with the tricks above, try using a little blush to give your cheeks a boost! Start light by adding just a little blush. Remember, you can easily add more, but it can be a pain to remove your blush and start over if you add too much.


There's no single "right" type of makeup to use — what looks good on one person may not look good on another. However, if you're a makeup beginner, it's generally a good idea to start with a mild pink blush, which can contain hints of gold or peach if you like. These shades are a good general choice because they complement nearly all skin tones.

, The more blush you add, the more noticeable your "rosy cheek" effect will be. If you'd like to bring out your cheeks a little more after applying your first light dusting,feel free to do so, but be wary of applying too much.


As a general rule, people with very light skin should be careful about the amount of blush they apply. Because a pale complexion makes makeup more noticeable, it can be easy to use too much blush (though there are plenty of exceptions to this rule.)

, Applying lots of blush will certainly give you rosy cheeks, but if you don't balance your blush with the rest of your makeup and your outfit, it can easily distract from your natural beauty. Overly-heavy applications of blush can give an artificial, doll-like appearance, especially to people with very light skin.

 If you are going to use a napkin, choose a large, dinner-sized one. A paper towel could also work., Flip the napkin over, and cover the back of each corner as well. This will make the corners nice and strong for the next step., Make sure that you are only punching through the taped area, otherwise the napkin will rip.








If you don't have a hole puncher, cut a small slit into each corner instead.
 Each piece needs to be the same length as your square. For example, if your square was 8 inches (20 centimeters) on each side, then your strings should be 8 inches (20 centimeters) long., Take your first string and poke the end up through a hole. Bring the end down, and tie it to the rest of the string. Do this for the other strings and corners.
 Find a button that has four holes in it. Feed the other end of each string through each hole. Tie the strings together into one big knot under the button.You can also tie the strings to a paperclip, a charm, or a small washer.
If you have a small toy, like a Lego or plastic soldier, tie two strings together on each side to make loops., Hold the parachute by the button, then toss it upwards. If you are allowed to, climb up onto a table or chair, and try again! This will give the parachute even more time to float down!

If you made loops for a small toy, slip the loops under the toy's arms first.

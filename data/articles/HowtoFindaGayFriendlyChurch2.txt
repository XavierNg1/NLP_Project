 Using the search engine of your choice, search for a church, using keywords like "gay church" and the name of your town or city. You also may choose to use the terms "affirming church" or "LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) church" in your search criteria.


Search for a specific denomination or type of religious organization by adding that to the search criteria. For example, if you are looking for a gay-friendly Presbyterian church in Seattle, use the search criteria "Presbyterian affirming church in Seattle."

, There are several websites that provide resources to the LGBT community, including church directories. Some church directories allow you to search by geographic area, while others are organized by Christian denomination.


Be aware that most churches and religious organizations provide their own information to the gay affirming church directories, and many directories cannot guarantee the accuracy of the site content.

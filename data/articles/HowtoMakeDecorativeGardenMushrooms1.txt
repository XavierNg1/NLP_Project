 The pot will make the stem and the drain plate will make the cap. The plate needs to be a 3 to 5 inches (7.62 to 12.7 centimeters) wider than the pot, so don't choose the matching size—go a few sizes larger., If you need to apply more coats, let each coat dry before applying the next. It will take about 15 to 20 minutes for the paint to dry enough for a second coat.You do not need to paint the bottom of the pot.
 Flip the plate over so that the back is facing you. Spray paint it a bright, contrasting color. Red is the most popular choice, but you can also do pink, purple, or even turquoise. Once again, if you need to do more than one coat, let the paint dry first.The top part of the plate won't be visible so you don't have to paint it.
 You can paint the spots on using a paintbrush or a round, foam pouncer. You may need 2 to 3 coats of paint for this. If this is the case, allow each coat to dry first., Just because the paint feel dry doesn't mean it is ready to be sealed; some types of paint require curing times as well. Check the label for more complete drying times as each brand is different. Once the paint is dry, give the pot and plate a few coats of a clear sealer.Choose a clear, outdoor sealer in either glossy or matte.
Allow the sealer to fully dry and cure.
 Turn the pot upside down so that the bottom is sticking up. Coat it with epoxy or waterproof outdoor glue. Place the plate, painted side up, down on top of it. Make sure that it is centered., This can take a few hours to several days. When moving you mushroom, hold it by the stem—do not grab it by the cap.

 Fold the fabric loop so that it is inside out. Pull it over the top of the pants until the edges of the fabric tube and the pants meet.
 The right, outside, sides should be touching.
 Use a narrow zig zag stitch. You may also choose to serge the final seam to prevent fraying.
 You can either wear them with the fabric tube extending up your belly or with it folded in half.

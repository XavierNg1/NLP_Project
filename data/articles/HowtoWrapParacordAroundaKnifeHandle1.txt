 Place the paracord along one side of the handle. Tape it to the handle at a point just beneath the blade of the knife.


There should be enough cord to extend down the length of the handle, plus a little extra. For most knives, the total length should be about 1 foot (30.5 cm). Allow this excess cord to hang off past the bottom of the handle.
Do not cut the paracord yet.
Wrap the tape around the handle two or three times. Make sure that it firmly holds the cord in place.;
, Wrap the paracord around the width of the handle in one full rotation.









Work with the cord still attached to the bundle. Do not wrap using the excess cord hanging down from the bottom of handle.
The cord should form a tight loop over the handle, fitting over the handle's width. This loop should end when it crosses over the taped starting point.
 Continue wrapping the paracord around the width of the handle until you reach the opposite end.









Each consecutive loop should be directly next to the loop before it on the handle. Keep the wrapping very tight as you go along.
Wrap the attached side of the paracord over the loose, cut end, covering that cut end and securing it to the handle.
 Slip both ends of the paracord through the lanyard hole at the bottom of the handle. Tie them into a firm knot to secure the wrapping.









If the hole is not large enough, you could wrap both ends of the paracord around the back notch of the knife. Tie the knot behind this notch.
The knot must be very tight so that the paracord wrapping cannot unravel.
 Cut the attached side of the paracord so that the tail is roughly the same length as the excess loose end still hanging off the bottom of the handle. Tie both of these ends together into a firm knot.









The resulting loop should serve as a wrist loop, so you'll need to make sure that you cut off enough to paracord to form a loop capable of fitting over your wrist.
The process is complete once you finish this step.

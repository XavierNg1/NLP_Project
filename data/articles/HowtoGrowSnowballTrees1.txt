 Snowball trees are generally hardy plants that can withstand most climates. However, if you live in a particularly hot climate, choose a spot in your garden where the plant is shaded for at least part of the day. Snowball trees grow best in well-drained, slightly acidic soil.Fully grown snowball trees can grow from 12-20 feet tall and wide. Plan your garden accordingly so that your tree doesn’t end up infringing on other plants!
Buy a snowball tree sapling at a local gardening store or at an online gardening retail site.;
, After you have decided on a spot to plant your tree, remove any weeds, rock or debris from the area. This gives the tree a more hospitable environment so that it can grow without interference. Removing weeds also eliminates the competition for nutrients and water in the soil., Dig a small hole about three times the diameter and just deep enough for the root ball. Use your hands or a small shovel to dig the hole. Discard any rocks or stones you may find while digging., Carefully take the snowball sapling out of its container. Use your fingers to gently loosen the visible roots of the bulb away from the sides so that they stick out from the bulb. Then lower the bulb into the hole.Make sure that the point of the sapling where the trunk meets the roots is 1 ½ to 2 inches above ground level.
 Take the soil that you discarded when you were digging and backfill the hole. Pat the soil around the bulb to eliminate any space between the bulb and the surrounding earth to ensure that the bulb is protected from the elements., Transplanting can be shocking to a sapling, and the tree will need extra nutrients to ensure it can flourish in its new location. Spread a 4-inch deep layer of mulch over the whole planting area. Mulch enriches the soil and also helps to retain moisture and discourage weed growth.

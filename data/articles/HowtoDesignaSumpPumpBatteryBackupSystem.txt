 The instructions listed below are for a ½ HP sump pump. Do not connect any sump pump larger than ½ HP to this battery backup system.;
, Connect the AC relay, DC to AC inverter, ½ HP sump pump, and marine battery together - according to the manufactures documentation or schematics. Note: For safety reasons, secure the relay and wire connections in a watertight plastic enclosure. Also, make sure all parts of this system are protected against any water splashing in the sump pump area., That’s where the 110VAC (electrical outlet) connects to the relay. You'll see later that this power cord will plug into your electrical wall outlet.

This step is extremely important. Triple check your connections before you apply any AC electrical power to your battery backup system.
 This is the normal operating mode when your house has electrical power., The relay should now flip into battery-backup mode., When the water level raises the sump pump float to its tripping point, the sump pump should turn on and pump the water out of the well.

Notice here, that the sump pump is now working off of the battery backup system and not relying on the electrical power grid in your house.


Now, when you lose power throughout your house, the battery backup system will kick in and keep your sump pump working.

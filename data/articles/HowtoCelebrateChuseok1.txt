 This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.;
, Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.

 For women’s styles, this casual cuff looks best on looser fitting jeans. A loose, straight-legged pair of jeans would work well, but this cuff would also work on jeans labeled as “slouchy” or “boyfriend” jeans.


For men’s styles, this cuff works on jeans that are looser, longer, and heavier in weight.
 Fold the bottom of both legs of your jeans upward. For women’s styles this fold is usually about 2 inches wide. For men’s styles, this fold is generally thicker, about 3-5 inches wide., For women’s styles, fold the 2-inch cuff again, to make a double cuff. For men’s styles, normally the one, large cuff is sufficient to create a wide cuff look.


The men’s style allows you to cuff you pants again, if desired. Just be aware that the look might not be what you are aiming for, as another large cuff will be fairly high up your calf.
For women’s styles, this cuff is best used for a casual look pair with sneakers.
For men’s styles, this cuff works well with heavier jeans and paired with boots.

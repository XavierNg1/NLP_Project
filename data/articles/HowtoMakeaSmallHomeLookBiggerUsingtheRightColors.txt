 The best color for opening up a room is bright white, so try painting this on all the walls. Neutral colors such as this give the impression that the walls are further away than they actually are.


If you want the room to be slightly warmer, try adding a few tints of your favorite color.
If so much white really isn't your thing, there are similar alternatives such as beige or light gray, which also work well. You could also try yellow, which is great for creating space due to its ability to reflect light, just like white paint.;
, Blues and gray-blues on the walls allow all the other colors in the room to stand out on the neutral backdrop, handily shifting the focus to the furnishings rather than the room itself. Always try to keep to one or two main colors that flow from room to room, and certainly don't use more than three.
 Pastels, and light natural tones are excellent for creating an airy feeling in small bedrooms, bathrooms, and hallways. You can bring the walls and woodwork together by painting both in colors from the same family, creating a light expanse. Use matte on the walls, and gloss or eggshell on the wood, so that it is not too flat.
 Stripes can completely change the shape of a room. Narrow vertical stripes in white or soft pastel will make a low ceiling seem much higher. You can of course simply paper the walls, or be more adventures and paint the stripes on.


To make the room look longer, simply turn the stripes horizontal, and only use 2 or 3. This works especially well with a light colored backing.
 It's not only the wall colors that affect the sense of space, but the floors too. It is best to use one carpet color throughout the house. Try painting the skirting board in a similar tone to break down the boundary where wall meets floor.


In a small bedroom, use a solid neutral carpet, or be a little more adventurous and use one with horizontal stripes to widen it.

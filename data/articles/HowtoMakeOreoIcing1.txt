 In a medium-sized bowl, cream the butter and powdered sugar using a hand or electric blender. Blend on high speed for about two minutes until the butter is light and fluffy.;
, Pour in the crushed Oreos into the creamed mixture. Blend on medium speed for about a minute until the Oreos combine in with the icing.
 Add the heavy cream into the icing to keep the icing creamy. Blend until well-combined and the icing is fluffy and smooth.
 Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place it in the fridge to chill for an hour so the icing can set. Once fully chilled, remove the icing from the fridge.
 You can use the icing to top off Oreo cupcakes, chocolate cakes, cookies, or an Oreo milkshake.

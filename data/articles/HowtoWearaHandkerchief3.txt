 Make sure the surface is clean before you lay the handkerchief down. Thereâ€™s no need to smooth the handkerchief out for this fold. It also does not matter how the corners are aligned.
 Using your thumb and index finger, pinch the center of the handkerchief and lift it up off of the table. The handkerchief will be hanging loose. The part you pinch will be the part that sticks out of your pocket., With the hand not already holding the handkerchief, form a circle around the cloth with thumb and index finger. Gently slide your circled fingers down the handkerchief, gathering it more tightly together.


Start at the top and stop once your hand is about halfway down the handkerchief.
 Let go of the pinched part and hold with your non-dominant hand. Then use your dominant hand to fold the corners up behind your other hand. When you place the handkerchief in your pocket, the corners will rest against your chest., As you fit the puff into your pocket, it may take a little more adjusting than other pocket square folds. Stuff it to the bottom of your pocket, then gently pull out a couple of inches. Adjust the shape to your taste.


The puff fold is not good for formal occasions. Use it to add a touch of classiness to a casual suit in non-formal settings.
Feel free to use a patterned handkerchief as this fold is casual anyway.

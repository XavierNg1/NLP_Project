 Place the saucepan on the stove and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Allow the squirrel meat to simmer until tender, about an hour and a half.


Be sure to simmer, not boil the meat; it should not be falling off the bone when you remove it from heat.
If you have an older squirrel, it may take longer for the meat to become tender.;
, Pat it dry with paper towels to remove extra moisture. Set the pieces on a plate.
, Heat the oil over medium high heat.


The oil should cover the bottom of the pan and come 1/4 way up the sides.
To deep fry the squirrel pieces, heat an inch of oil into a dutch oven or large saucepan.
To test whether the oil is hot enough to fry, dip the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil. When the oil bubbles rapidly around the spoon, it's ready to fry.
 Coat the pieces one at a time, and lay them in the frying pan. Repeat until all the squirrel pieces have been dredged and are cooking in the pan.
 Cook until the breading is golden brown.
 Serve with foods that usually accompany fried chicken: mashed potatoes, corn, or green beans. Eat carefully, since the squirrel pieces have tiny bones.

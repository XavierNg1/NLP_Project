 As aforementioned, most riders mount from the left side but either the left or the right side is appropriate for mounting. Turn to face the saddle.
 You should have a good grip of the reins at all time during the mounting process, so that the horse doesn’t walk off from under you. Shorten the inside rein so that should you add pressure to the bit, your horse would just circle in on you while you cue it to stop., Lift your forward foot (the one closest to the horse’s head) into the stirrup, so that your weight is resting on the ball of your foot. If the saddle is too high off the ground or if you don’t have enough stretch in your leg, lift your leg with your arm or have a friend do the same.


If you’re using a mounting ramp, step onto the ramp prior to putting your foot in the stirrup.
 If you’re riding in a western saddle, use your forward hand to grab the horn. In an english saddle use your forward hand to grab the pommel.
 Step into the stirrup as if you were walking upstairs while gently pulling yourself up with your hand on the front of the saddle. You may put your other hand on the cantle of the saddle to help keep balance.


If you have a friend with you, have them counter-balance your saddle to keep it from sliding off by pushing down into the opposite stirrup.
 When you have pulled yourself up so that your belly is level with the seat of the saddle, swing your back leg up and over the rear end of the horse. Be careful not to bump or kick them with your foot.
 Slowly lower yourself into the saddle, so that you don’t ‘plop’ down and cause pain or discomfort to the horse. This may be slow-going to start, but over time you’ll be able to do this quickly and gently.
 When you are stable on the back of the horse, make minor adjustments to your seat and posture. Put your other foot in the stirrup, and adjust the length if necessary.

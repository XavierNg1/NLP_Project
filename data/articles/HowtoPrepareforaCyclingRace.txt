 If you’ve been out of cycling practice for a while, don’t go on that 70 mile (110 km) tour.;
, A great cyclist is only as strong as their bike.


Having sturdy tires is the most important component of any race. Make sure your tires are fresh and properly inflated to prevent a wicked wipeout going downhill at 30 mph (48 km/h).
Check the condition of your cables. Often damp weather causes corrosion which can interfere with shifting and overall performance.
Check the wear on the drive chain. Poor lubrication and lack of cleaning may cause wear can also affect shifting.
Make sure your cleats and pedals are in good condition. Walking in cycling shoes wears down the cleats so they don’t bond to the pedals as well.
 This includes a strong helmet, high visibility jersey, water bottles, sunglasses, cell phone, and snacks like Powerbars are great to stick in your jersey pockets. And don’t forget the all important tire repair kit and micro pump; the question isn’t “if” you’ll get a flat, it’s “when”.
 Carbs stored as glycogen in your liver are crucial to your athletic performance. Not to mention you need the carbs throughout the race to maintain adequate blood glucose levels. Also make sure you are adequately hydrated before the race. With profuse sweating you’ll find yourself needing to drink a lot more water. And going into a race already dehydrated from training all week can be an extremely dangerous situation if your electrolytes become unbalanced.
 Conditions like heart abnormalities, diabetes, and epilepsy can be dangerous when cycling. Having well-informed teammates is extremely important if you become unconscious for any reason.
 Sleeping is crucial for your health because it’s when your body repairs itself. And if you’ve been training hard, your muscles definitely need some rest.

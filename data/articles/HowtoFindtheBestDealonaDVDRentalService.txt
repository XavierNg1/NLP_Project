 Walmart and Amazon have given up this business.;
, Netflix has plans starting at $4.99 per month but only allow you one DVD at a time and 2 total per month. Their more standard and popular plan is $16.99 which gives you 3 DVDs for as long as you want per month. Blockbuster has a plan that starts at $8.99 per month and that gives you 1 DVD at a time with unlimited rentals per month. For $11.99, you can add 2 free in-store rental coupons with your subscription per month. Their $16.99 plan comes with 2 DVD rentals per month + 3 free in-store rental coupons a month.
 If you can OWN a DVD for $5-8 (try eBay and Craigslist), this may be worth it if you're going to watch it over and over, share it with friends, or eventually donate it to church, charity or library. Remember, rented DVDs are used too.
 Most loyalty programs have deals with these DVD services and you can earn discounts, points, miles, cash back and more.

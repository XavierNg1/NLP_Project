 One common cause of dry skin is extraneous bathing. If you bathe your dog too often, you can cause his skin to dry out, even during warm weather. Unless under the advice of your vet, you only need to bathe your dog every three months. If your dog spends a lot of time outdoors, you may need to bathe him more often.


If this is the case, only bathe your dog when absolutely necessary. The extra baths will pull much needed moisture from your dog's skin., Another common cause of dry skin is harsh dog shampoo. Look for better quality shampoos with conditioners such as vitamin E, aloe vera, or tree tea oil. To avoid additional skin irritation, use warm, clean water to rinse off the suds.


No not use dishwashing detergent. These soaps have harsh ingredients that will remove protective oils from your dog's skin.Always follow label instructions on the shampoo you buy.
 In between baths, brushing your dog's hair can help keep his skin healthy. Make a routine to brush your dog every couple of days. Brushing the fur will help calm your dog and move around natural skin oils to prevent dryness.


You may need to brush him every day if his fur is long and thick., To prevent dryness in your dog's skin, you can expose his skin to more humidity. Dry air is common in certain situations where natural humidity is lacking, such as the northeast and southwest regions of the United States, during the winter months, and in houses that use central heating and air.Use a humidifier in your home, especially in the room where your dog spends most of his time. This will add moisture into the air.


Also make sure that your dog always has fresh water. His skin will also be helped through this hydration as well.

 A regular board, one foot (30 cm) long and six inches (15 cm) wide, should work well for your pistol. Wood in these dimensions can be purchased at most hardware stores or lumber yards., There are some tools you should have on had so that you can fashion the piece of would you found into a really cool rubber band pistol. To make your pistol, you'll need:

Pencil (or felt tipped marker)
Saw
Knife
Rubber bands
Nails (thin kind)
Hammer

, With a pencil or felt tipped marker, draw the desired outline of your pistol on your piece of wood. You may want to refer to an online picture of a pistol to serve as a model for your drawing., Using a normal saw, follow the pistol outline you drew on your board to guide your cutting. Once you cut your pistol free, take some sandpaper and smooth any jagged edges.
 A second nail can be added to improve the stability of your clothespin.
 Use a regular saw or knife to cut a V-shaped notch into the front end of the barrel of your pistol. The resulting notch you make should be deep and wide enough to serve as a catch for your rubber band.
 Do this by catching one end of your rubber in the notch you made at the front of the barrel and pulling it into the jaws of the clothespin. While the clothespin is closed, the pistol will be loaded with a rubber band. To fire, open the clothespin and shoot the rubber band.

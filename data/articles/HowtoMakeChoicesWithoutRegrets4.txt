 It doesn’t need to be a full-blown celebration, but give yourself a mental pat on the back when a choice you make turns out to be a good one. When you acknowledge your successful decisions, it eliminates your future self-doubt.


Say to yourself, “Good job! I made a great decision this time!”
Or you might think to yourself, “I did a good job thinking this decision through. I’m glad that I weighed my options and their consequences and didn’t rush myself!”

, Sometimes the choice you make doesn’t turn out to be the best decision. Even when you evaluate your options, you have to remember that things don’t always go as planned. When your decision ends up being a bad one, don’t fill yourself with regret and beat yourself up. Instead, try to learn something from the situation.Ask yourself how this experience can help you in the future. What did you learn about yourself, other people, or life in general?
Remind yourself that you can’t control everything and that sometimes what seems like a good decision may not actually be one.
For example, if you chose to take a shortcut and ended up taking an hour longer to get home, you might think, “I can’t control traffic, so I’m not going to beat myself up.”

, If you make a choice that ends up causing problems for someone else, the best thing to do is make amends. If you thought about the consequences for your options and didn’t think your choice would hurt anyone, then you don’t have to regret it. Instead, sincerely apologize and do what you can to make the situation better.


Remind yourself that you never intended to cause any harm. You might say to yourself, “I wasn’t trying to cause problems for anyone with my choice.”
Apologize to anyone that you have hurt or offended. Let them know that you are sorry that your choice caused problems for them.
For example, you might say, “I’m sorry this happened. I never thought my decision would result in something bad like this happening.”

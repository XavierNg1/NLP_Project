 Do they support you and get excited when you get rares or do they tend to play with other buddies more and get jealous of your rares? Do they laugh with you or at you? If you find yourself thinking they are a rude friend, proceed.
 Tell your friend kindly you don't like how they're treating you and to please stop. If they continue to bully or be rude, unbuddy them, block them and report them. If it gets bad enough, e-mail AJHQ, explaining some of the things they do to you and how they make you feel.

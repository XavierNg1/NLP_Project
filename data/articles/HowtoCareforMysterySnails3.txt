 After you've introduced your snails to the tank, wait around eight hours before feeding them. This allows them a chance to let them get used to their new environment., In order to feed your snails, prepare a mix of blanched vegetables. Blanching involves placing vegetables into boiling water and quickly removing it. Snails especially enjoy shelled peas, carrot, cucumber, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and iceberg lettuce. Allow vegetables to cool completely, then add them to your tank.Start by adding a small amount of blanched veggies each morning, and gauge how quickly your snails can finish them. Add a bit more or less until you can see that all food is being consumed within 12 hours.
Remove whatever isn't eaten from the tank within 12 hours.
 Mystery snails need some additional calcium added their water. Add rinsed sea shells, cuttlebone, and/or shell grit to your snails' tank in order to increase the calcium content.Try to add a calcium source one per week.

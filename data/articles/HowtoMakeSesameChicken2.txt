 Wash the chicken breasts, then cut into 1-inch chunks using a sharp knife. Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces and fry for about 6 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
 In a bowl, mix the honey, soy sauce, water, corn starch, ginger and red pepper flakes. Use a wire or electric whisk to ensure that there are no lumps of corn starch left in the sauce.
 Pour the sauce mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Stir to combine. Cook until the sauce begins to thicken, about 3-5 minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a little water. Stir in the toasted sesame seeds, then cover the pan and leave to simmer for about ten minutes.
 Once the chicken has soaked up enough sauce, serve the sesame chicken on a bed of white rice.

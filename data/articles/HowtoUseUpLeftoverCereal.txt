 Make the cereal either as your main ingredient or as a topping. Any cereal nicely accommodates yogurt in a bowl and a sweet breakfast treat as well. If you're planning on using it as the main ingredient, try putting it in layers with yogurt to get equal amounts in each bite.;
, Try to match sweet desserts with the cereal flavors, for example, chocolate cereal on a chocolate cake.


Rice Krispies is a main ingredient for Rice Krispies marshmallow treats.
Granola can be "recycled" and turned into cereal bars.
Use them as doughnut toppings.
 Any "ringed" cereal, such as Fruit Loops or Cheerios, would make an outstanding necklace or bracelet. You may not want to keep it for a prolonged time, so share it with the birds as well.
 Cornflakes or bran cereals are great examples. Place the cereal into a small snack or sandwich sized plastic zipped bag. Use a rolling pin to crush it into crumbs; you can also have a kid mash the contents as well. After dipping the food into the egg wash, dip it into the cereal before baking/cooking. These "cereal breadcrumbs" can be used as a covering for just about anything, including crab cakes, chicken, or a casserole topping.
 If you use raisins or pecans in muffins, roll them around the cereal sugar in a small bowl. This helps out in the recipe because the ingredients won't sink to the bottom of the dessert while baking.
 Share the love goodness in multiple boxes and add everything to a large container. Your kids may or may not mind by the multiple flavors in their bowl, but that can be solved by adding fresh chopped fruit in there as well.

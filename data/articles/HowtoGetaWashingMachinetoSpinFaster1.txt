 Most modern, front-loading washing machines have intelligent load sensing systems. If your machine detects an uneven load, it may bypass your selected spin speed for a slower one to avoid damage due to vibration. A good portion of machines can attempt to rebalance an uneven load, but will still drop to a slower speed, if these attempts fail. This is the most common cause of slow spinning.


These features include motor torque, RPM detection, and drum weight detection.;
, Listen to the washing machine during the slow "shuffle" before it begins spinning:


If the motor noise varies instead of staying at a constant tone, the load is probably unbalanced. Continue to the next step.
If it sounds jittery or "jumpy" you may have a mechanical failure, described in the section below. These are rarely the cause of slow spinning, so you may want to try balancing the load first anyway.
 Pause the machine and wait for it to stop spinning.
 It is not always possible to get a perfectly balanced load, but you can usually balance it enough to increase speed significantly. Here are some tips for how to arrange the laundry:


Light, polyester clothing should be in the middle of the load.
Towels and other large items should wrap all the way around the clump of clothing, rather than bunch up in one large ball.

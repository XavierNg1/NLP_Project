 This is an important step, since you can easily transfer bacteria to your ears with your fingers. Make sure they're clean every time you touch your ears.
 Use the salt-based cleanser provided by the technician who pierced your ear or another one meant specifically for treating piercings.


Don't use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or antibacterial ointment. These contain ingredients that inhibit your skin cells from regenerating and healing.
Use a sea salt solution as an alternative to a store-bought cleaning solution. Use 1/8 teaspoon of sea salt per 8 oz water. Do not use table salt, which contains iodine.
 Clean both the front and the back of the piercing, making sure the entire area gets covered with the cleaning solution.Make sure the solution goes inside the piercing.
 Gently rotate the earring two or three times to make sure the antiseptic gets inside the piercing. Also move the piercing back a forth.This also prevents the piercing from healing too tightly around the hole.
 Throw away the applicator you used to clean the first piercing, and use a new one for your other ear.
 Don't skip a cleaning, especially in the first few weeks after you get your ears pierced. It's important to disinfect your ears often, since dirt and debris from the air, in addition to the natural substances produced by your ear, can irritate the piercing and lead to an infection.


Clean your ears after taking a bath or shower, in case shampoo or conditioner got into the piercing.
Clean your ears after swimming or sweating during an outdoor activity.

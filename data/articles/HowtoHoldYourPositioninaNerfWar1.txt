 Look for anything that you can use for cover (something with a solid "wall" and no slits or holes large enough to allow a dart to pass): a bed, chair, box, bookshelf, pillow, etc.;
, Set them up so that the enemy will only be able to approach you one at a time, this way they won't be able to overwhelm you with their numbers.
 You can use surprise to your advantage when the time is right.
 Try, (supposing you have PLENTY of ammunition), shooting at them whenever they so much as peek at you, though be VERY careful not to be caught off-guard while you're reloading.
 Try making a trip line that releases something or shoots a dart at your opponents. Or you can put paintball traps in the area. Or anything else you can think of.

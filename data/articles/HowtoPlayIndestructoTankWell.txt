 You'll need to get used to bouncing off of helicopters (who could?). You have to bounce off of the helicopters onto the ground to receive points. The goal of these stages are to receive enough points to go to the next level before you lose all of your fuel. If you do, you get more. Eventually, you will receive enough points to win the first level smoothly.;
, Don't press that. You haven't used your points, yet. You can use your points here to increase enemies spawn frequency! (See Tips)

, Your problem will turn from not getting enough combos to getting too many combos! There could be so many enemies in the screen at once that you can't get down and receive points in time! You must land on the ground (usually you bounce) to receive the points. The longer, higher, and crazier you are in the air, the more points you will rack up!

, At this point, we can only give you some advice. Please read the tips below.

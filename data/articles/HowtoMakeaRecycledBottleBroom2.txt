 Use the Exacto knife to complete this task.
 Use the scissors to cut strips that are approximately 1/2 inch/1cm long. The thinner the strips, the better. Leave approximately 2 inches/5cm of bottle between the bottle neck and the strip top.
 Be sure you cut the bottle using the same measurements as you did the first bottle; the broom bottom must line up once it's assembled.
, Use the Exacto knife to remove the very top portion of the bottle.









Be careful not to cut too closely to the top strips, or else the bottle will fall apart.
 The first bottle neck should fit nicely through the cut hole you created in the second bottle.
 The top for your broom will be made from the third bottle.









Cut the bottle using the Exacto knife two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the bottle. Leave enough space to hold the other two bottles in place.

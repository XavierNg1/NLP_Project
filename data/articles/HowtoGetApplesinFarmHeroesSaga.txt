 Launch the game (on Facebook or the mobile app), and from the game map, tap or click the level you want to play. Almost all levels have apples in them, starting from Level 1.;
, Each level will require you to collect a certain number of cropsies or other elements. Not all levels will ask for apples, so don’t collect apples if they’re not needed. The goals are clearly displayed on the pre-game screen, right before you tap or click the “Play” button.
 Tap or click on the Play button on the pre-game screen. The game board for the selected level will load.
 Apples in the game are colored green. Spot them on the board. If you need to collect apples in the level, plan out how to get the required number in as few steps as possible., Swap cropsies in order to have at least three apples in a row or column. Once you have them, the apples are collected. Make a match of four or more apples to get more bonus points and multipliers.
 You can multiply the apples by making consecutive matches adjacent to them. The crop bonuses or multipliers appear right on the cropsies. Be sure to collect the apples with high multipliers before moving to a match elsewhere so that you don’t lose them.
 Work on the completing the other cropsies required for the level too. Don’t focus solely on apples, unless that’s the only crop required.
 If you complete the goals early, with some moves remaining, you will enter the Hero Mode. In this mode, your remaining moves will be used to fill the Growth Bar and to earn more Magic Beans. These will translate to a higher score and possibly get you more stars on the leaderboard. Continue matching matching and collecting apples, as well as other goal cropsies, here to increase your apple count and scores.

 This recipe makes 8 tortillas. Here are the ingredients you'll need to make tasty flour tortillas:


4 cups of flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
1 cup of water (many substitute warm milk for a fluffier texture)
1/2 cup vegetable shortening or lard;
, Make sure your bowl is big enough to accommodate all your ingredients.
 Use a pastry cutter or fork; don't work the dough too much.
,, The dough should be slightly sticky but not hard. You can add slightly more water or flour if needed.
 This will let the baking powder work the dough into a fluffier tortilla mix.
, Flour your work surface before you roll the tortillas.
 You can apply a little bit of oil, grease, or lard, or you can go without.
 If it starts to bubble up, that's long enough.
 20-30 seconds should be enough.

 It is helpful to trim in multiple different directions to make sure you've gotten all of those stray hairs. Even if you want your beard to be very long, it's still a good idea to trim it every few months and get rid of split ends. , Completely unshaven, untrimmed, and unwashed is one look. Being nicely shaved, trimmed, and washed is another completely different look. If you fall somewhere in between, you might end up looking a little sloppy, so try to decide on a style. Shave the places you don't want hair to grow accordingly. For example, some people don't like growing a bear that reaches to their neck.


Make sure you comb your beard down so that the hairline you shave is consistent no matter which way the wind may blow.
 Washing your beard is critical. Wash your face thoroughly with regular face wash and water every morning and night. You don't need anything too strong, but just something to cut through the oils that have built up. Make sure you also dry your face thoroughly. Have a clean towel and get as much of the water rung out of that mane as possible.
 Just like the hair on top of your head, beards need to be maintained and kept healthy. You can use the same shampoo that you use for your hair. If your beard is pretty short, you probably can just stick to washing your face with soap and water. If your beard is a few inches long you should shampoo it, but only use conditioner if it's very long.

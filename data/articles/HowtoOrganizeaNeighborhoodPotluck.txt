 Make a list of ideas. Ask these questions:

Do these themes fit the age group of what you predict the guests will be? (Ex: A One Direction theme probably isn't the best choice for Mom's garden club.)
Are you celebrating anything in particular? Can that tie it into the theme?
Is there a guest of honor? Can that tie into the theme?;
, This can be hard, but don't be afraid to skip over certain people. Before you scribble down a name out of instinct, here are a few things to consider:

Do you trust this person?
Does this person live close to the general area your potluck will be?
Is there any tension between this person and another desired guest?
Does this person have good table manners? (For a potluck especially)
Has this person caused trouble at parties or potlucks before? (If you're unsure, question their friends.)

, For the place, make a list of ideas. Look at a map of your town. Get recommendations from former potluck hosts. Make sure there's enough room for everyone there. Most people throw potlucks at their home, parks, community centers, schools, and churches, but there are far more options than those few. For date and time, write an informal email to guests to get idea for when they're free. Think about yourself, too. When are you free?, That means:

Decoration. Think about the theme. Choose pictures and colors by the theme or the season. Also think about the location. Does the person who owns it allow décor?
Tables and chairs. map out a plan for it. Leave space for dancing and chatting if applicable.
Music. Again consider the theme. Consider using something like Pandora and Rhapsody. Make a playlist ahead of time or plan for someone to perform at the party.
 Here's a good format:

What: Potluck
Who: Hostess, Guest of Honor
Why: What you're celebrating
When: Day and Time
Where: Location
Other

 Using makeup is an easy way to create cleavage on a smaller bust.


By applying darker shades to your bust where shadows should fall and lighter shades to areas that should be highlighted, you can create the illusion of ample cleavage.
 Evenly apply the foundation to your neck and cleavage area.


This will help create an even tone on your skin, giving you a clean canvas on which to apply your makeup.
Look for a shade a little lighter than your skin tone in order to highlight your cleavage., Trace the lines a little higher than where your breasts are fullest, then blend the shade into your skin.


Use a darker shade of eye pencil to draw on your chest.
Blend the shade in using a makeup brush., Using a brush, blend the contour between your breasts in a “V” shape.


Look for a contour shade with a bit of a grey/ashy tone. This will create the illusion of shadows while still looking natural.
 Apply the highlighter to the tops of the breasts as well.


A light highlighting shade accentuates the roundness of the breast, giving it a fuller appearance.

 When you first get into a skid, take your foot off of both of your vehicle's pedals.Your first instinct may be to hit the brakes, but this may not always help you recover from a skid.


Slamming on the breaks could make your skid even worse.
 Once you've taken your foot off both pedals, determine whether the back wheels have lost traction. If you are fishtailing, or the back of your car is sliding uncontrollably, this is called a loss of rear wheel traction. Gently accelerate to regain control of your car.The goal is to regain traction on your rear wheels before you can start to decelerate.


This is also commonly referred to as oversteering., If you are veering off into a direction and can't stop, it's most likely because you've lost front wheel traction on the road.In this case, you should pump your brakes to regain control of your car, after you take your foot off of the gas pedal.


If you have anti-lock brakes, then you should apply steady pressure instead of tapping the brake. Check your owners manual for information on your car or truck., Turn the wheel into the direction of the skid if you lose rear wheel traction. If it's skidding left, then turn your wheel left. If your rear wheels are skidding to the right, then turn right.Aim to stay on the road, but don't try to force the wheel or overcompensate.
 Once you've regained control of your car after a skid, reduce your speed. The reason you went into a skid is either because your wheels have been worn down and no longer have traction on the road, or you were going too fast. To avoid an accident, and potentially hurting someone, slow down and stay alert.

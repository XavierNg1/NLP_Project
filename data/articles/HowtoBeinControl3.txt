 What is making you feel helpless or out of control? Is it money problems, addiction issues, family relationships, or problems at work? Make a list of everything that is draining your energy or making you feel uneasy.


If you are having trouble, try freewriting. Set a timer and write quickly without stopping.
Pull things from your freewrite to make your list.
Be honest, and be specific. For instance, if you are writing about things that make you feel bad and you write about something in your relationship, even if you are generally happy with your relationship, put that thing on the list.
 Think of the things you would like to accomplish, things that would fix your problems or give you greater success. Think of how you can achieve each goal, and how much time each will take. Break the process of achieving your goals into steps, and set a schedule by which each will be achieved.


Go over the list of things that make you feel out of control. For everything that is truly bothering you, make a goal to fix it.
 To mentally contrast, foresee obstacles and plot ways around them. List what might go wrong, then take a few minutes to plan a possible response that will help you solve each problem., Advocate for your needs, and don't accept abuse from others. Respect the boundaries others set for you. Even mutually supportive relationships need good boundaries.
 Sleep around eight hours a night, eat at least three meals a day, and get some exercise every day. If you aren't taking care of your body, you can't be in control of your life.

 Leaving until later what could be done today is asking for trouble and crammed results. If a report is due by Monday and you've had three weeks to do it, don't wait until Sunday. Try to work on it daily for a while until you are finished with the report.
 If you do not understand, don't be afraid to ask the teacher. When you have something to share, raise your hand.
 If you want to take the lead in your class you need to work hard (sometimes, teachers don't want you to read ahead, so this is not always a good idea). Fill out the study guides if they are supplied, or make your own guides.
 Distractions during study time will make your studying less effective. This includes TV, people talking, the radio, and some music etc. - anything that is taking your mind off the task at hand.
 If you are thinking that you will totally fail the test, think again! When you learn something new, you will get smarter every day.

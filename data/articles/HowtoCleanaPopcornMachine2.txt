 Before cleaning your stovetop popcorn unit, allow it to cool completely. The unit should be cool to the touch before handling it.It is also advisable to remove all unused or unconsumed pieces of popcorn and kernels before beginning to clean the unit.
 Use a dry rag or a paper towel to wipe away any excess oil or butter on the interior of the popcorn maker. Do not use any cleaning agents, just use the towel to remove any excess fats.Some prefer to only wash their maker every four to five uses. Even if you decide to not fully wash your maker, oil and butter should be wiped away after every use.
 Hand wash your stovetop unit in warm water with either dish soap or a mild detergent. Since most stovetop popcorn makers donâ€™t have electrical components, they can be fully submerged.Be sure to rinse away any soap or detergent with clean, fresh water before allowing to dry.
 Allow the unit to air-dry on a dish rack or on a countertop before storing. Store the unit together in a dry place such as a kitchen cabinet in between uses.


Store the lid with the pot of the maker for easier use.

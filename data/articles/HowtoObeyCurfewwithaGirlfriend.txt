 Are you a young responsible adult, and confused by the definition of curfew? Webster's defines curfew as "a regulation requiring people to remain indoors between specified hours, typically at night." In short, it means being at home, at the designated time, with no member of the opposite sex present.
 The average young male requires at least 8 hours of sleep per night. Curfew will aid you in your quest to be healthy and achieve your goals., When that time rolls around, it can be hard to leave the person you love, not knowing whether or not you'll see them later. Some ways to say goodbye include:

Goodnight!
Sleep Well!
I have to go home, but I had a lot of fun!
Thanks for the swell time tonight, it sure was neat but I must leave!

, Give yourself a few minutes' leeway in case something holds you up at the last moment.

 If you don't like hibiscus, use 3 tablespoons of chamomile flowers instead. The mug needs to be big enough to hold 1¼ (300 milliliters) of water.
 This will allow the honey to melt easier.
 You can also use a small saucepan or a clean mug instead. Discard whatever is left in the strainer.
 How much honey you stir in depends on how sweet you'd like the popsicles. Keep in mind that the yogurt you will be using is plain and unflavored, so it might be a good idea to make it on the sweeter side., The texture should be consistent, with not streaks or swirls.
 Leave ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) so that the mixture can expand as it freezes.
 Some popsicle molds already have sticks attached. Some molds don't, and you need to insert the popsicle sticks yourself.
 Keep in mind that the popsicles may take a little bit more/less time depending on the size of the molds.
 De-mold the popsicles by holding the mold under running water for a few moments, then pulling them out. Store any leftover popsicles in a plastic container between sheets of parchment paper. You can also place them into separate freezer bags. They will last 1 week.

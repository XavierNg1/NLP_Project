 Try not to bring electronics or other items that aren't needed in school. It may only subtract a little weight, but it's a start.
 If you have homework in every subject, don't set each homework page in that subject's textbook. Instead, set all your homework in one folder. Only bring textbooks if you absolutely need to.
 Studying on the bus won't help at all, but maybe bringing textbooks to lunch and studying, or if your school offers study hall, then you will reduce weight.
 Instead of stuffing all books in your backpack, carry the heaviest book (It won't be too hard because textbooks weigh about 3-5 pounds.) This will help reduce weight, as well.
 If your bag is absolutely too heavy, get a ride from a parent, friend, or relative. Try to avoid bikes, because that won't help either.

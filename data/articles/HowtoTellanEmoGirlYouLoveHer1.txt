 Find some emo songs that you think she will like, and burn them onto a CD for her. Don't just throw the songs haphazardly on the CDâ€”spend time arranging them until you find the perfect order with the smoothest transition between songs (pay attention to genre, rhythm, lyrics, etc).


Consider putting a recording of you talking in between songs or at the end of the playlist. Tell her how you feel about her. If you want you can give a sentence or two explanation of why you chose one or two of your favorite songs on the list.
Include a note. If you don't want to record your voice, give her the CD with a piece of paper listing all the songs and the artists. On the back of the paper, write her a short note explaining that you love her.;
, Some emos are into poetry. Try writing her a poem that expresses your feelings about her. If you know her well, try to reflect that in the poem by telling her why you feel the way you do. Then, give it to her the next time you see her.


If you want, you can keep your identity a secret. Put the poem in her mailbox or school locker when she's not around, or put it in an envelope and give it to a friend to give her. However, if you do this, realize that you may never know if she loves you back.
Write multiple poems. If you want to wait a while and gauge her reactions, write her a series of poems. Use one or two of the same verses from the previous poem, so that she knows it's definitely the same guy. Then write a couple of different verses, too. With the last poem, write a couple of stanzas about who you are.
 If you're musically talented, write the emo girl a song telling her that you love her. Then, record yourself playing and singing it and email it to her or send it to her in a message. If you're feeling really daring, you can also find a way to perform it for her!

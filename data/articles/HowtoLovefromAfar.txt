 Communication is the first thing you want to have and have it often. Think of communication as the fuel for a fire, without it the fire dies or should I say the love dies. You want to have contact daily if possible. One way that is most used is the telephone. Call him/her as much as you possibly can and afford to do. If it is state to state check to see if your home and/or cell phone has statewide coverage. If he/she is in another country, there are some calling packages you may want to check on with your calling service or there is also calling cards which can be bought at stores. Check on the internet for international calling cards which many times are a lot cheaper than your home or cell services.;
, This is a cheaper way of contact and communication between the two of you. Choose a time to be online the same time and time to talk or chat. Daily would be the minimum if possible.
 Download the program for the webcam and when you talk to your love in let's say Skype, you can invite your love to see you on the cam as you chat. If it has a built-in mic, you can also talk to him/her and it will not cost you. Seeing your love and talking will keep your love burning and longing.
 How you have missed them, what you remember about them or of a time together. Keep them up to date on the events of the day, any plans you may have for the day, or week.
 Reassuring him/her of that love always, especially since the two of you are so far away.
, The video can have you saying something to him/her of your thoughts or feelings.
 Today letter writing is seldom done but sending a love letter or a poem through the regular mail is not only romantic, but it is also telling him/her how much you care and love them to take the time to write it and send it.
, Distance is hard enough for love so when you communicate make sure you follow through in all you say to him/her.

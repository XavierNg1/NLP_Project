 Plug your ears, and make up random things that people are saying around you. You can be silly and random or try to make up a TV-like drama about what's going on in their lives. Use their body language cues and expressions to inspire your store.
 Think of the room you are in right now and then pretend that you're a spy that's just been spotted. Hurry! Think of a dozen ways to escape the room and avoid the baddies following you!

, Think about what other people in the room are thinking. You can make it random or try to be realistic. If you want, you can even make it a story, like you're a psychic mutant and you have to find an evil spy.
 Decide what super powers everyone in the room would have. Try to be creative but keep the powers useful. Then, decide what their superhero names would be.
 Have an imaginary conversation with someone you love that has passed on. What would they say about where you are in life now? What would they say about what the afterlife is like?

, Imagine the world as it is now but with some vastly different change. For example, what would your life be like if you lived in a world where vampires ruled the different countries? What about if whales could talk?

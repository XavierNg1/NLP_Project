 It can be anything from newspaper to loose leaf. The only requirement is that it has to be an entire sheet of paper, or ripped/cut into long strips.;
, It is better when they are straight edged, so you could use a ruler and draw the lines or use a paper cutter. (If the page doesn't fit you can always fold it and cut)

, Be sure to hold the pen or pencil straight up and down while tracing or you might end up with a distorted version of your foot. You could also dip your foot in paint and have a footprint on a piece of paper, but that is much messier.
, (About a centimeter is a good distance)

, Take some strips of paper and clip them together with tape or binder clips. This will be side A. Take one strip and weave it through them perpendicularly, going over and under. Take another strip and weave the same way, but going under and over so the first strip is fixed in one place. Continue until the amount of strips on side B is the same as side A.
 Repeat, switching sides every turn. Continue until it is as long as your flip-flop shape.
 Put tape on the lines you drew and cut out.
 (It sounds like a lot but if you fold the newspaper and then cut, it goes a lot faster. They do not have to be perfect, as long as they are not drastically too big) OPTIONAL: Wet them and let them hang to air dry for more comfort.
 Measure the distance between where the strap would hit between your first two toes and where it would hit on the side of your foot. Add about 2 inches. Create a strap the width you would like using the same weaving technique as before. Do the same for the other side.

 An outdoor beach or garden wedding has a more relaxed atmosphere and thus clothing may be less formal. If you are at all unsure about the dress code, ask one of the guests or the hosts. The last thing you want is to show up in inappropriate attire.


A beach wedding is likely going to be windy and humid, so you will want your attire to endure those conditions. Consider avoiding a short dress that could become revealing in a strong wind, and wear a lightweight shirt under a suit jacket in order to reduce sweating. Pack deodorant in a bag, just to be safe.
 Outdoor weddings at prestigious wedding venues often require formal attire. Determine how upscale the venue is and how their clientele typically dresses.A wedding at a vineyard would require far dressier clothes than a backyard wedding. If you have any doubts, ask your hosts for their honest advice on appropriate apparel.
 Night weddings often call for more formal attire than day weddings. Determine your look by checking the time of the event. Also look for key words, such as "black tie," which indicates formal attire.A nighttime wedding might get chilly, so bring along a sweater or jacket for the cool evening air. A noon wedding on a day without overhead cloud cover may get uncomfortably warm, so consider that and bring sunblock.

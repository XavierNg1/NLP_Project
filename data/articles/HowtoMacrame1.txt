 This will most commonly be a ring or horizontal bar. Though macramé is designed to stay on its anchor permanently, it’s a good idea to practice with a pencil.









You could avoid an anchor entirely and tape your cord to a flat surface -- just make sure the tape keeps your cord anchored and parallel to your surface.
If you're making a necklace or bracelet, use a connector or charm as your anchor! If it can be threaded through, it'll work!;
, Place a loop of cord over your anchor and bend it over. This is a standard way to start any macramé project.









If you walk into any craft supply store, there will be a section dedicated to macramé cords. These are great materials, but the art of macramé lies in the knotting. You can use rope if you please.
 The reverse larkshead knot is simply pulled from the other side.
 That's the larkshead knot! That's the basic start of any project, with a few variations that are also standard:









Most projects use at least four cords. If this is the case, use either two larkshead knots next to each other or a larkshead knot inside another larkshead knot.

For two larkshead knots next to each other, the color pattern will be, for example, red-red-blue-blue. The center red-blue cords will be your anchor cords; red will be what you're working with on the left and blue will be what you're working with on the right. Therefore, with this method, the colors are different.
For the larkshead knot that inside the larger larkshead knot, the color pattern will be red-blue-blue-red. The blue cords will be your anchor cords; reds will be what you're working with on all knots. Therefore, with this method, the colors are the same.

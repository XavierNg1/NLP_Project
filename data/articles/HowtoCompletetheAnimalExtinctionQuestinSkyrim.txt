 This will involve becoming a werewolf and destroying the Silver Hand. You can start The Companions questline by speaking to Kodlak Whitemane at the Jorrvaskr in Whiterun.;
, You can find Aela at the Jorrvaskr, The Companions' headquarters in the Winds District of Whiterun. The Winds District is on the eastern side of the city.You may also come across Aela fighting a Giant at Pelagia Farms. You'll find her here if you haven't heard of The Companions yet, and she'll tell you to come to the Jorrvasker. You'll have to visit her there to get the quest.
 Once you find Aela in the Companions headquarters, speak with her about helping a citizen kill an intruding animal in their home or shop.
 Aela will give you a random location for you to find and wipe out the beast. There is a chance that it will be in a citizen's home or shop, or in an animal den. There are eight different possible beasts you may face: bears, trolls, wolves, frost trolls, frostbite spiders, hagravens, ice wraiths, or sabre cats.


If you have the Dragonborn add-on installed, there is a chance you will have to visit the island of Solstheim to kill the beast.
 There are two different variations of this quest that may be assigned to you. You'll have to either clear a random animal den, containing several regular beasts as well as a stronger beast, or you have to kill a beast in a random citizen’s home or shop in Skyrim.You only have to kill the boss beast to complete the quest.
The citizen’s home/shop will have only a single beast to kill.
 Once you have killed the beast, visit Aela again and let her know you have completed the quest. You will be rewarded 100-300 gold coins.


You can repeat this quest as many times as you would like.

 Dogs respond to their owners’ emotional cues, so before approaching the dog, chat with its owner for a few minutes. Keep your conversation upbeat and friendly so that the dog can observe the good rapport between you and its master. Be sure to ignore the dog during this conversation so it has time to get comfortable with your presence., Before approaching someone's new dog, get as much information as they can provide about it; if the owner adopted their new dog from a shelter or former owner, they were probably told about the dog’s history. Ask if the dog is friendly and likes to be pet, keeping in mind that the dog should have the ultimate say on this matter. Knowing more about the dog will allow you to accommodate its needs when you first meet it.For instance, a rescue dog might need extra space and time to warm up to you before being approached physically.
 Keeping a calm demeanor is important when meeting a new dog. Dogs reflect the behavior of humans around them, so your excitement could lead the dog to get overexcited or hyperactive; if an unknown person with very high energy approaches a dog, it could result in a fight-or-flight response that will cause the dog to act out. Stay relatively still and speak calmly to keep things comfortable.

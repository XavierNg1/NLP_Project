 Whether you are creating a graduated blue sky or a sunrise, create the background before adding in the clouds.;
, That is, don't add any water to the brush before you use it. Pour out white paint on your palette. Add a little bit of white to the brush.
 You can do a landscaped painting with clouds just at the top. Alternatively, you can have the clouds be the whole painting.
 In gentle curving motions, brush the white onto the canvas. Keep the pressure light.
 Push the edges of the cloud out with your brush. Try to create the edges when you're running out of paint. That technique will give the clouds softer, feathery edges.
 It will make it easier to add the shading underneath.
 Create a grey for the shading. You can create a dark purple to use for grey with a deep blue, a rosy color, and a brown-red color. You can also create your own grey combination.
 Add a tiny bit of the grey to the brush. Wipe off any excess. Gently brush the underside of the clouds to give them depth.
 Things off in the distance look smaller, so make your clouds smaller and fuzzier as you approach the horizon. To make them fuzzier, add even less paint to your brush when you create them.

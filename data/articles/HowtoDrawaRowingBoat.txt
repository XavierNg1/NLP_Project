 One of the lines is twice the length of the other (this will be called 'L'). The other line should be short (this will be called 'S'). The dot should be in line with the top of the short line (and this will be called 'D').;
,






The bottoms of S and L with an outwards curve.






The top of L and D with a slight inwards curve.






The bottom of L and D with an almost 90 degrees curve.
 If the line was drawn below the curve, then erase it.

 You can enter a phone number and Messenger will search for a profile that matches. This will only work if that person is using Messenger with that phone number.


The icon for the People tab looks like a list with three lines.
 This will open the phone number search.
 Type in the phone number for the person you want to search for.
 If the person can be found, you'll be able to add them to your contacts list.
 If the number doesn't return any results, you can send that person a Messenger invite. They'll receive the invite via SMS with a link to download the app and get started.

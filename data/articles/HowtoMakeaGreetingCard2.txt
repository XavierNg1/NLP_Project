 You can get double sided paper at any craft store. Don’t use regular paper, it won’t be strong enough to make this kind of greeting card.
 You can make an opening in your paper rectangle by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Now make another fold two inches from the top. Once you’ve done that, you need to draw a one-inch line from the corner of this fold at a 45 degree angle inward. Cut along that inch line.When you unfold the paper, you should be left with an ‘X’ cut in your original paper. The cut that you make will be going through multiple layers because of your folds to form this ‘X’.
 You should also erase the pencil mark at this time. You want to smooth the fold lines so that the card doesn’t look bunched up and unprofessional.
 Place the paper on its front side and take each triangle of the ‘X’ cut and fold it back toward you. There should be four triangle folds that leave you with a square window once you fold them back.Once you have folded the flaps back, glue them down.
 You can now design an image to put inside the window, put a stamp in there, or anything else. Draw patterns or other elements on the face of the card for added personality.
 If you want it to be a greeting card, you need to write something on the card that indicates what the event is. Make the theme of the card appropriate for this event. Birthdays, anniversaries, and marriages are all appropriate events for a greeting card.

 Don't get on facebook, but decorate pictures. Do something that you kept promising yourself or others that you would do. This can be a craft project, or reorganizing your kitchen. Make sure it's something that you look forward to and will enjoy because you'll be more likely to keep making time for it.Do one of your hobbies you have trouble finding time for. Draw, sew, knit, make jewelry, just do something that you like to do.
 Part of finding time for yourself is reminding yourself that your job is not everything. This does not necessarily mean you have to spend your time alone. In order to be a successful person you must prioritize your relationships with friends and family as well as your work. They can also help keep you accountable. When they seek to spend time with you, don't reject them because you are busy, but make time for it. You'll be better off.
 Take a long, hot bath or sit in a room and think. Sort things out. A time like this can really help you notice somethings and it's good for you to address your problems or go back to the good times.Turn off the TV and leave your smart phone in the other room and just be alone with your thoughts.


Cook or order one of your favorite meals. Eat what you like and be yourself. Sometimes during the rush of a work day we might find ourselves grabbing food on the go and eating it in a rush. Make time for yourself to cook something you enjoy and a slow sit-down mean to savor it.

 You should get into the habit of cleaning your cast aluminum furniture before you store it away as this will help to maintain the finish on the furniture. This will also prevent the build up of corrosive pollutants on the surface of the furniture during the winter months.You may also want to cover the furniture with covers made of breathable material to protect the furniture when it is not in use or stored away.
 To preserve the finish of your cast aluminum pan, you should try to wash it as soon as it has been used. Avoid letting the pan sit out with residue and dirt on it for a long period of time. If you do not have time to clean it right away, you can soak it in a natural solution of cream of tartar and water so it will be easy to remove any residue from the pan later., One possible issue with aluminum is that it can warp due to improper heating or cooling. This can lead to dents, warps, and deformities on the cast aluminum. However, it is possible to fix any warps with a hammer and a piece of wood.If your cast aluminum pot has a warped bottom, for example, you can place the pot upside down on a towel that is laid out on a flat, sturdy surface. Place a wood block or scrap piece of wood over the middle of the warp, such as a 2x4" or a 1x4" block. A soft wood like pine works best, as it will not further warp the aluminum.
Make small measured taps over the wood block with the hammer, working slowly and carefully to flatten out the warp. Avoid making any sharp, hard blows on the wood as this can lead to further warping of the aluminum.

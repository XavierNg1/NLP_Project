 With the top half, the apple shape means that you have a larger abdomen and chest area. The key is picking fabrics that skim your body and do not cling to it.


Choose flowing fabrics: Cottons, rayons, chiffons and silks. These fabrics look good and have a nice flow as well.
Avoid jersey knit, it will hug your abdomen.;
, For the upper body, stick with small patterns and dark colours.


Having details on the neckline or sleeves will bring the eye upwards.
V-necks also highlight a nice chest and allow you to add a necklace, which will further draw the attention upwards.
 Loose knits or boho tops can add style without being too clingy. A-Line tunics also will add appeal and room at the hips. A structured blazer will give you the "illusion" of curves.


Shop in the petite sections because the length of shoulder and sleeves for such clothing are made shorter than regular sizes.
 Layering is a good option. Wearing loose cardigans over tank tops can hide some the "muffin top" and again give you an illusion of shape.


A waterfall cardigan or blazer will elongate the torso and hide the tummy area.
 On the bottom half, lighter colours will make your legs appear bigger which will balance your upper half.
 Pants that are boot cut or slim straight will not draw too much attention and help to keep the lines simple.
 An A-line dress or skirt that flares out or have uneven hems will give your slim legs the attention they deserve. A knee-length pencil skirt will create a clean line.
 Wear colours that bring out your skin's glow. Many books are available on this subject.
 One fitted article of clothing is worth ten generic versions.

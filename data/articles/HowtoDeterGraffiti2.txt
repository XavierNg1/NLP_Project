 Properties that are not well kept tells others that you do not care about your property. Vandals are more likely to put graffiti on these properties because they think that they can get away with it. Broken fences, unkempt landscaping, and litter are all signs that you do not care.Keep the spaces around your property clean as well.
 Coat vulnerable surfaces with anti-graffiti coatings to prevent damage. While the coating will not stop someone from damaging the surface, it will be much easier to clean and will result in much less damage. Coatings are either “sacrificial” or “barrier.”Barrier coatings are the most prevalent and they are permanent.
Sacrificial coatings are not permanent and must be reapplied after the graffiti has been removed.
The type of coating you use will depend on the type of surface you are trying to protect. You can find these coatings at hardware and paint stores.These coatings can damage the surface. Speak with a professional at the hardware store or a professional painter or contractor to find the best option for your property.
 Graffiti artists like to work in the dark where other people can’t spot him. By increasing the lighting, you decrease the desirability of your space as a canvas. Motion-detecting lights are a good way to save on energy while still getting the much-needed lighting effect.Place the lights in hard to reach places. You do not want your lights to get vandalized as well.
 If you are a business, move your dumpsters away from the walls of the building. Cover your drainpipes to prevent people from scaling them. Also, check for movable objects such as benches. Graffitists are always looking for items that give them access to lights or signs where they can display their work.

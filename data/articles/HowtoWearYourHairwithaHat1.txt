 For men’s hairstyles, the easiest way to get away with hat hair whenever you want is to opt for a shorter buzz cut. This look works with basically any kind of hat, and you don’t have to worry about the embarrassing hat hair creases once you take the hat off.If you decide to sport this look, make sure you use conditioner or moisturizing shampoo that protects against dandruff. You don’t want to get flakey dandruff all inside your hat.;
, If you’ve got curly hair and you still want to wear a hat, have no fear! Curly hair looks cute peeking out from under a baseball cap or a fedora. Use a moisturizing agent (like a gel product) to avoid flyaways.Try not to let the curly hair stick out of the hole on the back of the baseball cap – especially if you’re wearing the ball cap backwards. This might look a little sloppy.
 Whether your hair is long or short, straight or curly, a slicked back look works well with most hat styles. Apply some hair gel to your hair right after washing it, and smooth it back across the top of your head and down in the back. Let your hair dry a bit and then add the hat.You can comb it back with a brush or comb for an extra sleek look.

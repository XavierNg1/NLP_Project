 A good method to minimize distractions is to schedule study time during the time of day when you are most focused. Are you a night owl? Early bird? Block off your most productive hours for studying.


If you have a class you don’t like to study for, you should prioritize working on this course during the time of day you are most concentrated., Multi-tasking has both a physical and mental toll. You’ll lose time while trying to multi-task and you’ll lose in-depth engagement in the subject as well., Do you have an awkward 20 minute gap between classes? Instead of pulling out your phone or taking a cat nap, grab your notes from the week before and review them., Avoid Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook. Getting onto these social media sites will distract you and prolong study time.


Instead, use these sites during scheduled downtime. Or, better yet, schedule to see some of these people you follow online in person!
If you can’t seem to keep yourself away from social media, alter your alert settings or have a friend change your password., Studying in a place where you will feel relaxed and sleepy, like your bed, is not the best idea. Instead, find a location that has a desk, good lighting, and minimal distractions.If you have a chatty roommate, head to a campus library or dorm study space.

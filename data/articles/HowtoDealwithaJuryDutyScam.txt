 Sometimes, phone scammers can utilize call spoofing technology to make you think that you're getting a call from your local police department or the local courthouse. And sometimes, scammers can dupe their victims into thinking the call is real by either already having your personal information or by using the name of real court/law enforcement officials to have their victims believing the call is real.
 Court officials and/or law enforcement officials will never contact you asking for confidential information or money. Furthermore, they'll never give a head’s-up phone call warning of an impending arrest, about missing jury duty or any other infraction., Authentic jury duty notifications, as well as “no show” summonses, are  always delivered by mail to your legal address. In rare instances, you may be telephoned by legitimate courthouse employees, but that's if the courthouse sent you a jury duty summons  but the Postal Service had it returned to sender because it couldn’t be delivered — and you won’t be asked for personal information such as your Social Security number, birth date or driver’s license number when they call you., Most of the time, scammers traditionally call when most businesses; such as courthouses are closed for the day because they know they have a better chance of reaching their intended victims., If you fail to show, the court will contact you via the Postal Service.
From there, if you still don't respond to the letters, an official from your local Sheriff's Office will show up at your door to remind you of your civic duty as a juror.
And finally, you can be held in Contempt of Court, which can result in a fine of several hundred dollars. Sometimes, the Judge can issue a "bench warrant," which means an officer can arrest you if you are pulled over for a traffic stop. But they'll never show up to get you arrested for missing jury duty and they'll never demand you pay a fine on the spot.

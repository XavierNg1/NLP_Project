 Each state has different qualifications for becoming a fishing guide. Contact your state's Division of Fish and Wildlife and/or Department of Law Enforcement to determine the proper requirements for your specific state. If you don’t live in the United States, check with your country’s guidelines.Some state requirements are rather rigorous, while others are more lax.
Many states require guides to have a coast guard license, CPR certification, and insurance.;
, A coast guard license (also called a Merchant Mariner Credential, or MCC) is required if you plan to take passengers on a motorized boat. This is a meticulous process with several steps.You will need to:

Submit an application at a Regional Exam Center or through the mail
Verify that you've spent 360 days (8 hours = 1 day) on a boat (90 within the last year)
Present 3 notarized letters of recommendation
Pass a background check (and provide finger prints)
Pass a written test (120 multiple choice questions)
Pay a fee (around $300)

, Many states require this for a fishing guide business. A guide must be able to demonstrate that they are able to handle at least general water and health emergencies. Take a course through your local Red Cross or community college.If you have been previously certified, make sure it is still valid.
 Many states will require you to carry a minimum of $1 million dollars in business insurance. Insurance is a safeguard against those unforeseen accidents or incidents that might occur on a boat or in the outdoors. Contact a local insurance company and inquire about business insurance.

 Add sugar and yeast and stir until dissolved. Set aside for 5-10 minutes or until it foams.
 In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, baking powder and poppy seeds. Pour in the yeast/milk mixture all at once and work it into the flour, using your hands. Continue mixing, adding flour or water as needed, until the mixture leaves the sides of the bowl.
 Place in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth and let stand in a warm place to rise for about 4 hours or until doubled in volume.
 Set a rack in the lower third of the oven. Place a large pizza pan or iron griddle on the rack and preheat. Also preheat the broiler (top-down grill).
 Divide into six pieces and shape them into balls. Place the balls on an oiled plate and cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap. Let the balls rest for 10 to 15 minutes.


Roll out and stretch each ball until it is about 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and 5 inches (12.7 cm) wide.
Remove the pizza pan from the oven, brush with oil and place one of pieces of bread on it.
 Bake until the bread is puffed and has brown spots. Transfer to a wire rack, returning the pizza pan to the oven to keep it hot. Place the bread under the broiler (top-down grill) until 'charcoal' dots appear on the surface. Wrap the finished bread in a towel while baking the remaining loaves.

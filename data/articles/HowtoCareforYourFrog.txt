 The type of aquarium you need depends on your breed of frog. When you purchase your frog, ask if it is completely aquatic or not.;
, Small frogs may need only a 1 gallon (3.8 L) tank while large frogs may need 10 gallons (37.9 L).
 Consult with the store you buy the frog from as to what types of plants your breed of frog will be most comfortable with. Avoid using gravel on the bottom of your tank, as some frogs will eat this and become sick.
 A screen cover works best.
, Make sure you find out what temperature your frog will be most comfortable in. This may range from room temperature to 80 degrees.
 Change water that is dirty, but try not to change relatively clean water too often as this may shock the frog. Changing a portion of the water every three or four days is sufficient.
 Large frogs may need baby mice. Most frogs like food that moves. Food can be supplemented with powdered vitamins. The frog should eat all it needs in about 15 minutes. Do not overfeed.
 Red leg disease is common. The frog's underside and legs turn red. Contact your vet at any signs of illness.
 Frogs also hibernate. The frog may appear to be very still and may attempt to conceal itself. Do not disturb your frog when it is hibernating. If it is breathing, it is okay.
 If your frog suddenly behaves differently, contact your vet.

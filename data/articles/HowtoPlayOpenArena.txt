 OpenArena's installer can be found at http://www.openarena.ws.



Linux users may be able to find OpenArena in their distribution's repositories.;
,,, Here you will find various settings you need to control your OpenArena experience. Under Setup, there is a list of four categories of settings:
Player (for controlling your handicap, changing your username, etc.)
Controls (for changing how you interact with the game)
System (to configure the game to work well with your system setup)
Game options (for changing certain colors, your view, and other preferences)
The last option, Defaults, is used if you want to reset the game to its default settings. Use this if you don't like any of your existing settings, keeping in mind that all settings you changed will be lost.
 This is where you can fight alone with bots. The game keeps track of your progress by putting you in a tier. The higher the tier, the harder the bots will be to fight and the more maps you will be able to fight on.
On this screen it will also show you awards and how many of each you have earned, for various in-game accomplishments. You can always fight at a lower tier, but you will not be able to fight at a higher tier than you have unlocked. Select a level to fight, then click "fight" in the bottom right-hand corner.
 Try to use a combination of weapons to kill an opponent, or slaughter them with only one the entire game. In any case, do your best to quickly aim and kill in order to earn awards and advance to the next tier.
 You will need to choose a server. You can use the filters at the top of the screen to show only servers that meet your desired criteria, such as map, ping, and number of players.
Of course, you can also specify a server IP address. If desired, you can host your own on your computer for a local network game. Enjoy fragging with OpenArena!

 Basically, any kind of screen protector is good, but most people prefer to use a tempered glass or plastic one over a conventional foil/film screen protector. Foil/film screen protectors are thinner, but tempered glass and hard plastic protectors last longer, provide better protection and are easier to apply.
 It is recommended to apply the screen protector in a low-dust environment, somewhere indoors. Also, make sure the surface you'll be working on is clean., Dry them with a clean towel. Or wipe them down with some rubbing alcohol., First remove any case you might have on the smartwatch. Add a little screen cleaning solution or rubbing alcohol to a soft, non-scratching cloth (such as a microfiber cloth), and rub your screen with it., Make sure you are holding its sides and you don't touch the back surface.
 Position it over the center of the screen to see how much margin to leave.
 Once the screen protector is aligned, carefully lay the protector down on the screen. If needed, give it a soft press in the center with your fingers and work your way outwards to make sure the protector grips to the screen properly.

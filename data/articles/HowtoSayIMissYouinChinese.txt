 First of all, you must know that there are 4 intonations in Mandarin Chinese. (There are actually 5, but the last one is not used that often).


The first one sounds flat like when you sing "la~".
The second one sounds like going up, like asking something. For example, "How are you?" "I'm fine, and you?" The second "you" sounds like the second intonation for Mandarin.
The third one goes down then up. For example, "He-eh?" The first syllable goes down, the second comes up.
The fourth one goes straight down. For example, "Hey!" "Stop!";
,,, But since the following word is also going to be in the third intonation, it is often spoken as the second one.

I love you 我爱你 wǒ ài nǐ
I like you 我喜欢你 wǒ xǐ huān nǐ
I miss you 我想你 wǒ xiǎng nǐ
I need you 我需要你 wǒ xū yào nǐ

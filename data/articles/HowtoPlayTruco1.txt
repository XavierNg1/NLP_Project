 The goal of the game is to be the first one to get to 30 points. These points are separated into the first 15 (the "good" points) and the remaining 15 (called the "bad" points).

On the image, the deck of cards used for truco. We do not use the 8's and 9's

, You have to win two rounds in order to win the hand.

Points are calculated based on players' ability to win each round, which is determined by players' strategy, the use of "Truco" and "Envido" plays, and the use of tricks.
 Teams can have up to 3 players each; in other words, a game of "Truco" can be one-on-one, two-on-two, or three-on-three.

If the game is two-on-two, each player should sit across from his teammate so that each player is seated always between two players from the opposing team.
If the game is three-on-three, players should sit so that two players from the same team are never seated next to each other. Players should always have an opposing player on either side.
 Literally meaning "Trick," it means that you can trick or lie to the opposing team by calling "Envido" or "Truco" plays, even if you don't have a valuable card.

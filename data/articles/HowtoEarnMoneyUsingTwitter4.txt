 Many companies are looking for popular Twitter accounts to occasionally post about their products. Contact the company, make a monetary agreement and begin your pay-per-tweet arrangement.


Make sure you have a written agreement with the company and proof of your tweets that you can submit to them. Also, make sure you choose an interval of sponsored tweeting that does not annoy your followers. If you lose followers, you lose potential sales and your sponsored ad contract may be canceled.
 These sites aggregate the companies that need to have sponsored ads and make them available to willing Twitter users. Sign up for an account, tweet an ad at the interval of your choice, and usually you will be paid by PayPal.

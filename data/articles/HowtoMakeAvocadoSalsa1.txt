 Wash 10 to 12 grape tomatoes and cut them into halves or quarters. You should get 2/3 cup (135 g) of chopped grape tomatoes. You'll also need to chop pineapple into small pieces in order to get 1/2 cup (115 g). Put the tomatoes and pineapple into your serving bowl.You can use fresh or canned pineapple. If you want to use canned pineapple, consider buying crushed pineapple, so you don't need to chop it.;
, Wash 2 medium avocados and slice them in half. Remove the pits and dice the avocados. Scoop the diced flesh into your serving bowl. You'll also need to peel 1 sweet onion (like a Vidalia) and cut it in half. Finely chop the onion half and put it in the serving bowl. Chop enough fresh cilantro to get 1/8 cup (5 g) and add it as well.Save the other half of the sweet onion to use in another recipe.
 Measure and add 1 tablespoon of lime juice, 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. Stir the chunky avocado salsa so the seasonings are incorporated. Taste the salsa and sprinkle in black pepper according to your taste.Consider serving this salsa with tortilla chips or even pita chips. Because this is a thick, chunky salsa, you should use sturdy chips for dipping. Avoid thin, restaurant-style tortilla chips.

 Many people think if you skip the meal before going to the all you can eat restaurant, you can eat more. This is not true. Have a light but complete meal in your regular time, otherwise your stomach will tighten and you will not enjoy the meal at all. Also, drink enough during the day, you will need a lot of water to digest all that food.;
, Can you eat unlimited for a fixed flat rate? Does this apply to everything, or only the buffet? Are drinks included? This can spare you some nasty surprises on the bill. Some restaurants have different rates for different days of the week and times of the day. If you are on a budget, find the best time.
 Slightly acidic fruit juices are the best. The gas in fizzy drinks escapes inside your stomach and you will feel full long before you have had a good meal. Sweet or alcoholic drinks also require more water to digest them so avoid them or drink more water to keep your balance. Refill as you go, never go thirsty! Iced water will facilitate the opening of the pylorus (the link between the stomach and the intestine) and thus help your digestion.
 Also, enjoy having a meal with friends, have a chat, don't focus fully on eating.
, Don't experiment too much with food you have never eaten before (such as exotic seafood or fruit), they might cause an uncomfortable feeling. Balance meat with garnishes such as rice, vegetables or potatoes. French fries are great but they are usually very salty so you will again have to drink a lot. If you feel full, stop eating, and rest and drink. You will probably be able to resume eating a bit later.
 If you have to break a conversation, excuse yourself politely. It is important to free yourself from excess weight.
 They will help balance your blood sugar level and overcome drowsiness. A light coffee can also be a good idea at this point.
 Grapes, strawberries or other small fruits will make it easy to select the exact amount

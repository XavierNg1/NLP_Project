 You can catch some thieves by checking people's trash. Of course, you can't go digging around in people's trash cans. That's much too obvious. However, you can go and chat with co-workers right after a lunch when food was stolen. Some people just throw the remains in their own trash, even if they took it.You may think that someone is too dumb to throw the trash away in their office. However, some people steal out of a sense of entitlement and have no problem throwing it away there, particularly if they're the boss.;
, No, you shouldn't contaminate the food with something that could cause sickness. Rather, when someone eats your food, send out an office email saying, "To whoever ate my food: I just found out the peanut butter in it has been recalled, and it can make you sick. You should seek medical attention." Once in a blue moon, the thief may confess just to find out what the "contamination" does.You can also leave a note instead.
 One way to catch a thief is to spice your food with something particularly hot, such as a ghost pepper. You should be able to tell who ate it, as that person will end up sweating and probably need lots of water. If you spike your food this way, make sure to keep an eye out around the office.Keep in mind, you could face some legal ramifications with this tactic, particularly if it harms the person in some way (such as they are allergic to peppers).
 One option is a nanny camera, as you can find those relatively cheap. Hide it in the kitchen, and leave it on video. The next time someone steals food, check the camera to see who did the stealing. Of course, you'll need to find a camera that can be plugged in, or you'll need to charge it.You'll need your boss's permission for this option. Keep in mind that it could be your boss who is stealing your food, so that could cause a problem.

 Scalding, or heating to a temperature just below boiling, changes the milk's behavior in bread recipes.Some people like to scald pasteurized milk as an extra precaution against microbes, but this is not necessary if it's been stored in a refrigerator.


If the milk is unpasteurized or if it's been stored at room temperature, boil it instead.
 A thick-bottomed pot will heat the milk more evenly, reducing the chance of burning.


Impurities can spoil the milk, so clean the pot thoroughly.
 Never heat over high heat, which is much more likely to burn the milk or cause overflow.
 Keep an eye on the milk, stirring every minute or so. A wide spatula works best, since you can scrape the base of the pot if the milk starts to stick., The milk is "scalded" once it has a tiny layer of foam at the top of the milk. Small bubbles will appear around the edge of the pot, and the surface will just barely steam.If you have an infrared thermometer, confirm that the milk has reached 82ºC (180ºF).
 Stir constantly to prevent overflow.
 If you have milk left over after drinking or cooking, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If this is not possible, store the container in a cool room. At warm temperatures, where bacteria thrive, milk will only stay good for four hours at most.

 Keep your legs moving (assuming you are running with the ball). If you stop moving, you become an easier target. You can do a quick juke or something, but don't let it slow you down.;
, If you know where the defenders are coming from, they'll be much easier to dodge. Always know where the defense is, and you have a better chance of keeping them off of you.
 Lower your shoulder into him, protect that ball, and let him know you are not going down without a fight. Keep your legs moving regardless, even after you hit him. Too many times running backs and receivers get clocked because they stop moving.
 Yeah, it might work when you play madden on your Xbox, but this is real life. Instead of trying the fancy spins and jukes, just make a quick stutter step or a small juke with your shoulders. The point is to make the defender hesitate. As soon as you see that split second of hesitation, You need to break for it. Remember, speed is always key though. Fancy jukes mean nothing if they're too slow.
 If you this is you, refer to step 3. Lower the shoulder, and tank through. Just make sure you stay on your feet.

 Pour baking soda over the old stain. Combine a tablespoon of clear dish washing liquid, a tablespoon of white vinegar and two cups of warm water. Dab the mixture onto a brush and scrub the spot for a few minutes. Let it sit for an hour, then blot the spot to remove the stain.Repeat the process if the stain remains after the spot has dried.
You can let the mixture sit on the stain overnight for older stains.
 If residue remains where your cat left a hairball, you can use a laundry stain remover product to get rid of it. Generously apply the stain remover product to the spot, scrub it with a clean towel, and dab it dry., Most hardware or grocery stores will rent out carpet shampooers. Buy a steaming soap that specializes in pet stains and follow the directions to the afflicted spot.


Choose the machine size based on the area you need to cover. If it is only a small stain, you can rent a small cleaning machine but may want more with a wider cleaning area if you anticipate doing your entire floor.

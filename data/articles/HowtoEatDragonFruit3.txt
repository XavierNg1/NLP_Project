 Dragon fruit pairs well with bananas, berries, and any other fruit you like to eat with smoothies.









Cut the dragon fruit in half. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon, then dice it.
Peel a banana. Slice it into pieces.
Wash a pint of blueberries.
 Dragon fruit has a creamy flesh that tastes delicious paired with a creamy base. Choose from the following:









Yogurt, or Greek yogurt, plain or your favorite flavor.
Milk - whole, partial fat, or skim, according to your preference.
Soy milk, plain or your favorite flavor.
Nut milk, such as almond or cashew milk.
 If you like your smoothies extra sweet and flavorful, choose from these additional ingredients:









Apple or grape juice.
A few spoonfuls of sugar, syrup or honey.
Peanut butter or almond butter.
 Throw in the dragon fruit, banana, and blueberries. Top with a cup of your chosen base and a few spoonfuls of any extra sweetener or nut butter you'd like.
 Use the "pulse" function on your blender to blend the ingredients until smooth.









If the smoothie seems too thick, add a little milk, juice, or water to thin it out.
If you want a thicker smoothie, add some instant oatmeal.
 Drink the smoothie with a straw, or if you made it extra thick, eat it with a spoon.

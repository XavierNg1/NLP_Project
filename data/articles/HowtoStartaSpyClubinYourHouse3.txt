 This is the most important step when spying. Breath through your nose, wear soft soled footwear, and know exactly wear the floor creaks.
 When tailing a suspect, it's best to stay a distance of at least 8 feet (2.4Â m) behind someone as to not be seen. If you make a mistake, you could risk falling and bumping into the person your spying on.
 Spy glasses or a camera are great to use but they can also be a bit of a hassle. If the person you are spying on turns around, you'll need something that you can hide easily. It may be a bit hard to take your glasses off and hide them behind your back or wait for your camera to turn off.
 Remember though, eavesdropping can be very rude if someone is having a personal or private conversation. Only eavesdrop if you know the person won't be upset if the find out. Record all of your evidence and enjoy being the spy of your house!

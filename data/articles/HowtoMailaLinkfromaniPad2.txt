 If you've installed another browser like Chrome or Firefox, you can launch that instead. Subsequent steps will remain the same with any major browser on an iOS mobile device.


Note that rather than using the Share button, this method relies on a basic "copy and paste" technique. This may be advantageous if you want to use an email account that hasn't been linked to your iOS client or if you'd like to add a URL to an already-existing email thread (e.g. to reply to someone else's message). This method would also be helpful if you wish to include more than one URL in the same email message.
 Simply click on the URL in the web address bar and make sure the entire link is selected (which will likely happen automatically). Then select the "Copy" button that appears after highlighting your desired text.
 This might include clients like Gmail, Microsoft Outlook or Yahoo Mail, and you'll find this located wherever you've stored it on your iPad Home Screen.
 You can either compose a new email or reply to a preexisting email thread. Determine your recipient(s) and make sure their email addresses are entered in the "To:" field. Remember that you can also email your own email address if you wish to access your link later. Finally, don't forget to enter your preferred text into the subject line.
 Tap and hold a preferred spot within the body of your email message. You'll see a "Paste" option appear. Select the "Paste" option, and your link will appear in your message. You may of course add additional text above or below that link.
 Once your message appears as you'd like, just tap the "Send" button as you normally would in order to send an email.

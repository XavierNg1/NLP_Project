 Sounds simple but many guests favour the "trust" factor. Hungry guests who have been tramping all over the ancient ruins or catching stinky public transport all day are not always into trust when their belly rumbles and may simply assume that unlabelled food is a free-for-all. It also helps you identify which of those cartons of milk is yours.;
, If there are specific rules about which cupboards and which fridge you can store food in, follow these rules. If you don't, you risk having your food removed and dumped.
 Most youth hostels are not that partial to the 'Trangia' being set up in your dorm. Not only is this a potential fire risk but it is also unfair on the other guests to be subjected to your cooking smells.
 Don't cook so much that you have leftovers to contend with unless you have freezer or fridge space and containers to store and you are staying more than one or two nights. If you cannot buy smaller amounts of food, see if other guests are willing to go halves with you in the purchasing costs.
 It is even more important to pay attention to food safety rules when using a communal kitchen. Never assume something has been washed before you use it; wash cutting boards in hot water and wash stirring utensils before using. When you cut raw meats, eggs and poultry, always do so on a washable surface away from others and clean up thoroughly after yourself. Cross-contamination can be very serious in a communal kitchen.
 This is a great way to get to know other guests. Offer them your culinary delights in exchange for some of theirs. Or offer to do mains whilst they do dessert. Be creative and friendly and you might just make friends for life or, at the very least, get a good yarn for the night.
 You're on vacation. Don't spend every night in the kitchen; get out and discover the local cuisine. Ask for cheap restaurant suggestions and deals at the hostel front desk and eat out with a group so that you can share the cost and the dishes.

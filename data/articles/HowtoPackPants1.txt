 Business pants and other pants made of fabrics that can be easily wrinkled should be folded instead of rolled, since folding cuts back on wrinkles. If you're traveling to a business meeting or another event that requires dress pants, you'll want to fold them to keep them from being completely lined with wrinkles when you reach your destination.


Suit pants should always be folded, never rolled, since rolling them can cause them to pick up unsightly wrinkles.
Pants made of 100 percent cotton wrinkle easily, and should also be folded.;
, If you pack wrinkly pants, they're just going to look worse after being packed in your luggage for several hours. If you iron your pants before packing them you're more likely to be able to wear them straight out of the suitcase when you arrive.
 Do it on the floor or another hard surface to make sure your fold is neat. Lay them out flat and smooth out any crease or folds so that you can easily fold them neatly.
 Bring one leg over the other to fold them in half. Make sure the fold is right down the middle over the seam at the crotch of the pants. Straighten the legs to remove any creases at this time.


If you're folding dress pants that have a crease or pleat down the middle, fold the pants in half along the crotch so that the crease is preserved.
 Bring the cuffs up to the waist. Again, straighten the pants so that no creases make it into the fold. Run your hands over the fabric to make sure the folds are nice and flat.
 Bring the edges of the pants, the waist and the cuffs, down to meet the bottom of the fold. Your pants are now ready to pack. When you fold pants in half this way, you will end up with a crease across the knees, and other across the thighs. Strategically placing a crease there is better than having lots of wrinkles, but looking perfectly neat is of utmost importance, you might have to iron them.

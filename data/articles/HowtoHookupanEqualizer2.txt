 The equalizer should always be between the receiver and the amplifier. Your amplifier will need integrated preamp-out and preamp-in connections to work with this method.
 To run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again, you'll need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).


The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer.
 Connect one pair of cables to the tape monitor output channels on the receiver and the other end of the cable to the left and right channel inputs on the equalizer.


You will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer.
 Connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the tape monitor input channels on the back of the receiver.


Right channel jacks will usually take the red colored RCA plug while left channel should take white or black RCA plugs.
 Turn on the receiver and switch the front panel output control to the “Tape Monitor” setting. This opens the tape monitor channels and means that the sound will travel through your equalizer before being sent to the amplifier. Adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences.


You should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music.
To switch on the “Tape Monitor” setting you should depress the button on the front panel of the equalizer.
If you have a tape deck connected to the tape monitor channels then you will have to remove this before connecting your equalizer.

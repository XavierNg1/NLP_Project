 There are tons of emulation options available for Windows computers, more than any other platform. The emulator(s) you choose will depend on what you plan to play.


You can emulate any retro system and most handheld systems.
There are no stable emulators for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Vita, or 3DS. Wii U has one emulator as of this writing (cemu), which is somewhat stable but still very early.;
, Once you know the system you want to emulate, you can decide on the emulator you want to use. Below are the most popular and stable options:


RetroArch - This program is a front-end for a variety of emulators. It is the best choice for all retro systems (including PlayStation 1, Nintendo 64, and PSP) and Nintendo handhelds (including all Game Boy systems and the Nintendo DS). It can also emulate DOS for old DOS games.

PCSX2 - This is the best emulator for PlayStation 2, but be aware that each game will require individual configuration.

Dolphin - This emulator can run Wii and GameCube games.
nullDC - This is one of the more stable Dreamcast emulators.
 This guide will focus on installing RetroArch, which will get you access to NES, SNES, Genesis, Saturn, Neo Geo, MAME, Game Boy family, Nintendo DS, PlayStation, Atari, PSP, Nintendo 64, and other emulators.

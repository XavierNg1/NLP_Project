 Many cruise ships today offer large exercise rooms with state-of-the-art treadmills, stationary bikes, weight lifts and other fitness equipment and often have a spectacular view of the ocean. Visit the room when it is least crowded (early in the morning, late in the evening, or at on-shore days).;
, They are usually less than a mile long and extend the length of the ship. Jogging here is a great way to start your morning, burn off some extra calories and enjoy a beautiful view from the deck! If possible, jog with a friend or family member (if traveling with others) and share the walk.
 If the ship has a court, play tennis or other racket sports. Most cruise ships also feature a basketball court, or even rock climbing walls and mini-golf. To have some fun with your fitness routine, organize a ball game with some friends or participate in a tournament (if offered).
 Try to do some laps every morning before the day starts.
 Use this as an opportunity to discover the entire ship. Pick different routes every day but make sure to have a map; it is possible to get lost on large cruise ships!

 Do this by double-clicking the Chrome icon (green, red, and yellow outer circle with a blue inner circle).
 Once the browser window is open, you can press the key combination CTRL + SHIFT + O to open the Bookmark Manager in a new tab.


For a longer route, you can click on the Options menu (three horizontal bars) in the upper-right corner of the window then click “Bookmarks”; you’ll see a compact list of the bookmarks you’ve made.
 In either the Bookmark list or the Bookmarks Manager, double-click a bookmark that you want to go to, and it will launch in a new tab.

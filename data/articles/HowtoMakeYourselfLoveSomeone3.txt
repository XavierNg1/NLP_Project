 Consider why you want to be in love with this person, and make sure that you want to do so for healthy reasons. Remember that you do not need to love someone just because he or she loves you. Do not try to force love for the sake of convenience, or social propriety,

, Love comes about through a series of variably conscious and subconscious choices. The intense feelings of attraction and attachment are the product of subtle hormones and pheromones â€“ chemicals that act behind the scenes and make us more or less likely to fall for someone.On some level, you may be able to set up the right conditions for love. On the other hand, the actual feelings may be beyond your control. Try to keep perspective.
Study love. Understand why people in love feel the way they do: how attraction and intimacy fire up the dopamine and serotonin receptors in our brains and make us emote so intensely. If you know the science of love, you might have a better idea of how it comes about.
 Perhaps you have fallen out of love with a long-term partner, and you want to rekindle the romance. Are you doing this because it is what you want, or are you doing it for the sake of stability: children, friends, or a mortgage? Perhaps you have been set up with an arranged marriage, or you have fallen into a serious relationship with someone that you aren't sure about. Social consequences aside, remember that you do not need to make yourself love anyone! Give yourself permission to honestly and organically discover the love that you deserve.

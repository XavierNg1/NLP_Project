 Sometimes, having an extra workload irritates employees, especially when the workload remains heavy over a long time. If the employees are expected to worker harder without any reward, they will become frustrated and their productivity will decrease.;
, Every employee wants to be treated equally and fairly. Unfortunately, supervisors sometimes show a preference towards a certain employee or group of employees (whether intentionally or not), and this can leave those on the outside feeling frustrated.
 Being dissatisfied with a low salary is yet another common reason behind employee frustration. This is why organizations must set salary according to an employee's current market value, otherwise their frustration may lead to them leaving the company.
 Lack of bonuses, rewards (both monetary and non-monetary) despite hard work and extraordinary performance can lead to employee frustration. This can lead to a high turnover of employees, which is not good for the company in the long run.
 One of the major reasons for employee frustration is a lack of communication. Sometimes, supervisors do not bother to explain work tasks to each employee. This lack of communication between employees and management causes frustration among employees as they do not really know what to do, when to do it, why they're doing it and how to do it.


Think about it from the employee's point of view - can he/she undertake the task assigned? Maybe the employee is new or has a history of being uncomfortable with the type of task you just assigned him her. Remember that employees are hesitant to discuss their shortcomings, so it is the job of the leader to address these issues.
Therefore, as a supervisor/manager; make sure your instructions are crystal clear. Leave no ambiguities. Insist on receiving feedback so that you know that your communications were clear.
Openness is a necessity rather than an option. Employees should know that your door is always open for them and that their queries will always be addressed.
 Fear of the unknown can get a lot of people very worried. So, as a manager, you should try to understand what it feels like to be doing a job at a company which has frequent layoffs, pay cuts, etc; an insecure company.


The worst feeling for any employee is job insecurity. The fear that you can be fired from your job at any time is so scary that it causes frustration among employees which affects their performance. These employees tend to have trust issues with the management, as they are scared that any mistake they make could result in them being laid off.
A manager should not only inspire trust and give hope to his employees but also educate them. They should know that they can confidently undertake a task without fear of failure. Mistakes will not be punished as long as the intentions are good.
 Another major reason behind employee frustration is the behavior of the supervisor, especially when the supervisor refuses to be understanding towards their employees. They should avoid pointing fingers and assigning blame when a mistake has been made, and accept the fact that n employee is perfect.


Try to separate the problem from the people. A manager should carefully analyze any issues in a calm and levelheaded problem and see what is actually causing the problem before blaming an employee. Often the problem lies in company policy and is not the employees fault.
Never direct/show your anger towards the employee. If something truly wrong has been done then there are policies and procedures in place to deal with that. A manager is to retain his/her composure at all times and maintain a peaceful and calm atmosphere.
 Sometimes, supervisors are so busy with other tasks that they completely forget to act in a timely fashion with regards to employee problems. This can really be frustrating for the employees, as they expect their supervisor to help them in case of any problem.


Swift action means tackling a problem as soon as it comes to your attention. Of course, this also entails having a mechanism which allows immediate identification and discovery of problems. Once an issue has been identified, e.g. via quarterly reviews, polls, surveys, etc then action should be taken.
Never wait for the problem to solve itself. Not only is this method futile but also dangerous. It can lead to further aggravation and result in even bigger problems. For example, if an employee keeps repeating the same mistake; do not expect him to learn from his mistakes. Figure out if there are other issues affecting his performance. A manager should be quick on his feet about such matters.
Your quick response shows employees that they have someone looking after them. They will therefore be less likely to stress out over issues leading to a reduction in overall frustration.
 Resolving issues is good. Overstepping policy or rules is not, so make sure you are operating within your powers.


Make a note every time you come across a frustrated employee. Take notes on what the problem was, how it was solved and so on. Once you have a list of 4-5 cases, use them to determine a common trend and send over a plan to your superiors to implement a policy to counter this trend altogether.
Never go out of the way to resolve an issue. You are a manager and have an equal duty towards every employee. Giving one of them favors can lead to disastrous trickle-down results with every other worker demanding favors too.
Use official channels of communication if you feel things may get out of hand. Everything should be on record. Resolving frustrations may involve a change of job descriptions and so on.
 The positive point of view will transfer to others as well- it is important to solve the "problems" with optimism. The change is guaranteed.

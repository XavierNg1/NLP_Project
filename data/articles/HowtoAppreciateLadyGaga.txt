 Most of them are untrue and ridiculous, and they will interfere with your personal opinion about Lady Gaga.;
, Lady Gaga is an accomplished songwriter and composer. Many pop artists do not write their own songs.
 At first, many of her songs seem nonsensical and silly, but some of them actually have deep meanings. For example, the song "Paparazzi" can serve as a love song but also as a story about a tragic death caused by the paparazzi. (Such as the death of Princess Diana) Her song "Speechless" is also a heartfelt ballad for her father. Her most shallow songs become popular, because thatâ€™s what the public wants apparently.
 She learned to play the piano by ear at age four, and wrote her very first song soon afterwards. She also wrote her first complete piano ballad at age thirteen, and started performing at fourteen.
 She attended a Roman Catholic school known as the Convent of the Sacred Heart. (She was originally set to attend the Julian School at Manhattan.) At age seventeen, she was one out of twenty in the world to gain early admission to the prestigious Tisch School of the Arts.
 Her outfits might seem crazy and awkward to look at, but to an artist, it is a work of art.

 Many of the standard treatment therapies arenâ€™t effective for immunocompromised patients because their immune systems are not able to respond normally to the treatments.Widespread facial molluscum have become a common marker for severe HIV infection because the low CD4 cell counts in these types of patients create the perfect host environment for the molluscum virus.
 There are many therapies used to restore immune system functionality in patients with compromised immune systems. Some of these treatments include stimulating cytokines (chemical messages that enable communication within the cells of the immune system), introducing Interleukin-2 to help increase CD4 cells, or antiretroviral therapy., This kind of therapy aims to eliminate the ability of the virus to reproduce itself within its host. In many cases, this helps eradicate the virus altogether.This type of treatment often has severe side effects including flu-like symptoms, tenderness around the site of the lesion, depression, and lethargy.

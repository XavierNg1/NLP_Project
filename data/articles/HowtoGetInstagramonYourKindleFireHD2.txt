Swipe down from the top of the screen.
Tap Settings.
Tap Security.
Tap the switch next to Apps from Unknown Sources to the on position.
Tap OK.
 Visit the the 1 Mobile Market download site, where the download should start automatically within three seconds. If it doesn't, tap the link by the download timer to manually download it.
 Either swipe to the left or tap the three small lines located on the very left side of the URL bar to bring a sidebar menu. Tap on the downloads menu and wait for the 1 Mobile Market application to finish downloading. Then, tap on it. You will be brought to an installation screen, asking if you would like to install the app and if you are okay with the permissions the app will have. Tap the Install button at the bottom of the screen and wait until it installs. Tap the Open button to open the app.
 In the search bar at the top of the screen, type in "Instagram" and press enter. Tap the Instagram icon in the search results (it should be the first result). Next to the Instagram icon and slightly below it will be a turquoise-green button labeled "Install". Tap on this and wait until the app downloads. A notification will then pop up, asking you to install the app. Tap on this.
Â You will be brought to an installation screen, asking if you would like to install the app and if you are okay with the permissions the app will have.

Instagram will be exactly like the official app from Google Play. You can access the app from your home screen by tapping the Instagram icon. It may be slightly blurred, but when you open the app the quality will be the exact same as the official.

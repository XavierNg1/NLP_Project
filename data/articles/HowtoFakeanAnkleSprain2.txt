 If you are trying to fake a sprain outside of a doctor’s office, it is best to appear as though you have seen a doctor. A doctor would typically wrap your ankle in a bandage to provide support and limit your motion. Start wrapping your ankle near the bridge of your foot. Continue to wrap the bandage around your foot and ankle until you reach the top of your ankle. Secure the bandage with the provided pin.You can find a stretch bandage at most general or drug stores.
 A doctor would typically advise that you avoid putting weight on your foot for two to six weeks after spraining your ankle. The best way to do this is by using crutches. You can find crutches at a medical supply store; however, keep in mind that your health insurance will not cover this cost without a doctor’s prescription., A more serious sprain might require a boot to help support the foot and more intensely limit your range of motion. You can also find a boot at a medical supply store.

 Bridges often fall out of place during tuning. To prevent this from happening, make sure you hold your bridge in place with one hand when tuning.
 On occasion, you will need to replace the strings of your violin as they break and wear down over time. In this case, make sure to replace strings individually. Removing more than one string at once can cause the bridge to fall out of place., Take your violin back to the shop where you bought it, or bring it to a music shop. If you don't feel confident placing a bridge on your own, ask your instructor to do so, or get a professional do so for you despite the cost. A professional will sand it, make sure it's the right size for your instrument and will adjust the sound post.

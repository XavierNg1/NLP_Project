, Understand that money spent on food is money subtracted from the rest of your budget. You should ideally choose the most cost effective menu, unless you have extra money to burn.
 How accessible is the food you are looking for? Is it served by a restaurant close to your venue of choice? If so, then this is a positive. It is even better if that restaurant caters. Make sure that the restaurant of your choice is open and prepared to take on your order well in advance so you don't have to scramble last minute. If your Sweet Sixteen's venue is serving the food, check with them what they can serve and can't.
 A party planner can be a very helpful way to develop your sweet sixteen's theme, decide on decorations and formulate a menu. Party planners will help you make important decisions, such as on the menu of your sweet sixteen.

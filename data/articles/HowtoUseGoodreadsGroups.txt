 Go to Goodreads website and log into your account. Find the little down arrow and click on it by the Community tab on the top notification bar. A drop-down menu should appear. Find "Groups" and click on it.;
, Goodreads Groups acts like a forum or bulletin board system that every member of Goodreads has access to. Here you can find Featured groups, Recently Active groups, and groups and discussions that you have started. You can find some groups on this page, but when looking for a specific group about a certain topic it is recommended to search for them.


Peruse the list or use the search box at the top of the Goodreads Groups page to search for a specific group name and topic.
 You should join the group with most members, because that usually indicates that the group has a large selection of people who communicate often and may get back to you in a timely manner.


Click the Group name from the Goodreads Group page, and click "Join Group" on the group's activity page. If the group is a public group, you should be able to use the group without clicking the Join Group button.
 Follow the directions on the page and make sure to choose or fill in information in the boxes marked with a red asterisk.
 Click the Topic header from the Discussion Board portion of the Group page (after you've been confirmed as a joined member in the Group), click the "new topic" near the top of the discussion portion and follow directions from there (as all fields are mandatory, and as this form is very short).
 Read through the current discussion until you find the box that is labeled "comment" and is located below all the other reply/discussions on the page. Type your reply into the comment box and click the "Post" button.

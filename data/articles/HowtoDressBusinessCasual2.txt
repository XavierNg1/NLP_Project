As with men, black and grey are more formal, making for a safer bet.
Avoid low-cut dresses or those with high slits.
Avoid dresses (especially) and skirts that are more skin-tight.
No sundresses.



No jeans, unless otherwise noted. If jeans are allowed by your employer, distressed jeans, jeans with holes, and "boyfriend" jeans are not desirable choices.
Neutral colors are best.
 Women have a few more options in this department than the men. Opt for conservative and not too revealing. Blouses, plain shirts, cotton shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, vests, and sleeveless shirts are all acceptable.


Tucked-in or untucked can both go, depending on the shirt.
Unusual patterns are acceptable, as long as they are not wild. The standard, however, is a monotone shirt.
Use a collar for a more formal look, and collarless shirts for a less formal look.
 Avoid flip flops, sandals and sneakers.


Heels are okay, so long as they aren't too conspicuous.
 Remember dress socks or pantyhose (with skirts or dresses) and tastefully accessorize with light jewelry and a simple purse.
 Ask yourself the following set of questions if you're still not sure whether your outfit is acceptable.Would I wear this clubbing? The answer should be 'no.'

Would I wear this to sleep? The answer should be 'no.'

Would I wear this to do yard work? The answer should be 'no.'

Would I wear this to a costume party? The answer should be 'no.'

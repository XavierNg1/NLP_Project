 The sale price is $15. What was the original price?" or "An investment grew by 22% and is now worth $1525. How much was invested originally?"


To solve these questions, you must understand that percentages are applied using multiplication. Whether it is an increase or decrease, it was applied using multiplication. Your job, therefore, is to undo that multiplication. You are not undoing the increase or decrease; you are undoing the application of the percentage. Therefore, three things will be true:

You will be dividing by the percent.
If you have an increase, you will still add the percentage to 100.
If you have a decrease, you will still subtract the percentage from 100.
 Sales tax, for example, is an increase; discounts are a decrease. An investment that grows in value is an increase; a population that declines in numbers is a decrease and so forth.


Let's imagine we have to work out the following problem: "A video is on sale at 75% off. The sale price is $15. What is the original price?"

Sale is another word for discount, so we're dealing with a decrease.
$15 is our "after amount," because it's the number we have after the sale has been applied.
 If it's a decrease, subtract the percentage from 100.


Because we're dealing with a decrease/discount, we'll subtract 100 - 75, giving us 25%.
 Do this by moving the decimal point two places to the left or dividing the number by 100.


25% becomes 0.25.
 This will help us reverse the multiplication that we talked about in Step 1.



Grab a calculator, punch in '15,' hit divide, enter in '0.25,' and hit equals.
 You've just calculated the original price.


15 divided by 0.25 = 60, which means the original price was $60.
If you want to double-check your answer to make sure it's correct, multiply the sale price (75%, or 0.75) with the original price ($60) and see if you get the sale price.
($15): 0.75 x 60 = $45 sale; $60 (original price) - $45 (sale amount) = $15 (sale price)



, To better understand this type of problem, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problem: "An investment grew by 22% and is now worth $1,525. How much was invested originally?"


This is an increase situation, so add 100 + 22.
Convert the answer to a decimal: 122% becomes 1.22
On a calculator, enter '1,525', hit divide, enter '1.22', hit equals.
Label the answer. For this problem, 1,525 divided by 1.22 = 1250, so the original investment was $1,250.

 Resistance training of any kind can improve health and build muscle. But to lower myostatin levels, you’ll need to engage in high-intensity resistance training (HIRT). This means doing resistance training that pushes you to your physical limits.HIRT requires doing full-body workouts. In other words, your resistance training regimen should work your arms, back, and legs.;
, Perform as many repetitions as possible without resting during the time limit you’ve set.For instance, do 10 pushups, 10 pullups, 10 leg extensions, then 10 biceps curls as quickly as possible over the course of about 10 minutes.
If you’ve gone through the 10 biceps curls before the 10 minute time limit has elapsed, start the cycle again by doing 10 pushups.
Rest one or two minutes between each super-set.
 HIRT can be physically taxing. Talk to your doctor before adopting a HIRT exercise regimen and don’t perform HIRT more than three or four times per week., When doing resistance training, you must choose the right weight for you. Start at the lowest weight for whatever machine or barbell you’re using. Perform 10-12 reps. If you find that it was very easy and you don’t feel taxed by the end of your 10-12 reps, add weight in small increments. You’ll know you’ve found the right weight for you when 10-12 reps is significantly taxing.

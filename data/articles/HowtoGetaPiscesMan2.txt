 Pisces men tend to be sensitive and questioning, lending them an unusually open mind. If you're obstinate, learn to tone down your stubbornness when you're around him. The inability to budge or compromise will be a downfall in your relationship if you let it.
 Pisces men are not secure in love. They would rather have you around more than their friends if they truly care for you. Plus, this will give them ample opportunities to be the romantic sign that they know they can be. Most people like being showered with affection.
 Loose lips sink - in this case, they sink Pisces. Gossip is superficial, and Pisces are, as a rule, opposed to the superficial. As much more deep thinkers, Pisces men tend to engage better in meaningful conversation. Skip the latest celebrity banter and move straight to a conversation about art for a satisfying response.


If you're not great at small talk, take it little by little. Find out what areas of conversation interest him and don't be afraid to bring it up. Asking questions is good. Once you get a Pisces talking about a subject he loves, you won't have to do much of the talking anyway. You'll probably have to pry him away from the conversation.
 A Pisces can tell right from the start when you begin acting strangely towards him. There's a good chance he'll intuit what's going on and bring it up with you after wrestling with it himself. That's not good for your relationship.
 Pisces like to be emotionally mothered, but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to see the passion you're capable of. When you kiss, put your all into it (kissing passionately is not the same thing as kissing violently). When you compete, put your heart into it. Whenever there's a chance to bare your soul, do so passionately. Passion is what will attract a Pisces man to you.
 You know why? The reason is he cares more about you than you care about him.

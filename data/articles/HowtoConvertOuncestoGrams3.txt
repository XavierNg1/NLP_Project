 This section uses fractions to show how the units in the problem relate to each other. Start by writing your number of ounces as the top part of a fraction (the numerator). Put "1" in the bottom part (the denominator) with no units.


Let's say that we're doing a chemistry experiment and that, at the end of our reaction, we get 1.23 ounces of product. To start converting this to grams, we would write it like this:



1.23 ounces/1




Don't forget to label the ounces in the numerator. It's important for this kind of conversion.
 This is the conversion ratio for grams and ounces. Basically, it's a fraction that shows how many ounces are in a gram. Ignore the units for now as you multiply. See our article on multiplying fractions if you need help.


In our example, we would multiply like this:



1.23 × 1 = 1.23
1 × 0.035 = 0.035




So our final fraction is 1.23/0.035


, Notice that "ounces" appears twice: once in the first fraction's numerator and again in the second fraction's denominator. If you're multiplying fractions and a unit appears once in both the top and bottom, you can remove it from the problem. The units you're left with (grams) are the units for your answer. Now just divide to solve.


In our example problem, we can cancel out the two "ounces" because they appear once on the top and once on bottom. This leaves us with grams. To get our answer, we just divide 1.23/0.035 = 35.14 grams.
 One of the nice things about using conversion ratios is that they make it easy to make lots of conversions in a row. All you need to do is use the same process as above, arranging multiple ratios so that all the units cancel except for the ones you want for your answer. See below:


Let's say that we forgot how to convert from ounces to grams, but we do know that there are 16 ounces in a pound, 2.2 pounds in a kilogram, and 1,000 grams in a kilogram. This is enough to get us our answer. We would arrange our ratios like this:



1.23 ounces/1 × 1 pound/16 ounces × 1 kilogram/2.2 pounds × 1,000 grams/1 kilogram




All the units cancel out except for grams, so these are the units for our answer. Now we just need to solve:



= (1.23 × 1,000)/(16 × 2.2 &times) = 1,230/35.2 = 34.94 grams (almost the same as our original answer)

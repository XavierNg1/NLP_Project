Always ask your doctor before taking any herbs, even if the packaging says they are safe. This is because many herbs have not been tested for safety during pregnancy. Bitter melon, also known as Momordica charantia, is often recommended for diabetes control, but has been associated with miscarriages and induced abortions in animals, so it should be avoided.Gurmar, also known as Gymnema sylvestre, and Prickly-pear cactus, also known as Opuntia spp, have not been tested in pregnancy, though Gymnema is safe when used for up to 20 months and Opuntia has been used for centuries as food.
Gymnema is generally taken in doses of 200 mg twice a day and Opuntia can be taken as a single dose, 400 mg once a day. If you use either Gymnema or Opuntia, talk to your healthcare professional first for recommendations.

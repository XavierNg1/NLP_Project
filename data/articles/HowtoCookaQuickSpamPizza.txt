 Prepare the bread slices, cheese, spam and olive oil so you won't have to search for them later.;
, Using a sharp knife slice the cheese into thin pieces. This will help the cheese to melt easier.
 Place the cubed spam onto the bread.
 This will prevent the pizza from sticking and burning. If you don't have olive oil on hand use coconut oil instead.
 If you feel like the pizza needs more time put it in for longer but not too long you don't want it to burn!

, Don't burn your tongue!, This is a great snack or lunch for school!

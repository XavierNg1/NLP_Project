 When you take your colored contacts out after wearing them all day, thoroughly wash them before storing them for the night. To wash the lenses, hold them under lightly running water and rub with your fingers.If sticky particles (for example, bits of make-up) are stuck to the lenses, squirt a little contact-lens solution on the lens and gently rub the spot.Never use your finger nails to clean the lens.
 This lens case should have been provided to you by your optometrist when you first purchased the colored contact lenses.The lens case is specifically designed to protect the lenses. Whenever you’re not wearing your colored contacts, keep them in the case.


Store the case in a safe location where it won’t get lost or damaged, such as your medicine cabinet.
If you lose or damage the protective case, a replacement can be bought at any pharmacy.
 The lenses should be completely covered in the contact solution (usually a type of saline solution) when stored overnight.This solution will cleanse the contact lenses, and also prevent them from drying out.
Never fill the lens case with water. Water will damage the lenses, and can be painful to your eyes when you insert the contacts.

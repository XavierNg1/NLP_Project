, Once you’ve installed the app, open it and then select your video file. The process is slightly different for each app, but you should be able to browse the videos that you have stored on your phone and select the one that you want to rotate.
 Once you’ve imported the file, you can start rotating it. Your options will depend on the app you are using, but almost all allow for basic 90° increments.
 Again, this will be different from app to app, but generally you can export the rotated file back to your phone so that you can view it at any time.

 Is there something you missed before? Is there anything that seems out of place? If so, take a closer look at it. Try pushing it around or hitting it with something.;
, Do you have all the items you think you need? Is there something that looks like you need to do something with it, but you don't have the item you need for it yet? If so, leave the room you're in and retrace your steps in others. Or, check to see if there are rooms you haven't been in yet that were further back on your quest.
  Is it one in the morning, or have you been playing for more than a few hours?  If so, put the controller down for a while, or go to sleep.  You may not want to, but you could be overlooking some key elements you wouldn't have missed if you were more awake.
 It may sound horrific to some people out there, but some games have levels or puzzles that don't really make sense to some people. So, if you've been stuck on some puzzle for a long time, and none of these other steps have worked, look up a walkthrough. You may be surprised at what the answer was, but don't beat yourself up because it was so "obvious", if you really didn't get it, then it probably wasn't "obvious" at all.
 You may get killed over and over, but if you quit now, then you could be missing a really crazy and epic ride up ahead.

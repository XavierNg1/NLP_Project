 You don’t want to be pulling down on the handle bars. If you do that, you’ll essentially be fighting against the bike. If the road is bumpy or has potholes then your handlebars are bound to jerk around a little bit. Allow for these small movements. , Since you won’t be gripping onto the handlebars with your arms really tightly, it’s important to anchor yourself by hugging the motorcycle with your knees. It doesn’t need to be a death grip, just enough to keep you sturdy. You can also hold down on the pegs with the heels of your boot.
 If you have to decelerate, downshift, or, worst of all, brake, in the turn then you have entered the turn too quickly. Brake before the turn, consider your entering strategy, and then enter it smoothly. You may want to enter the turn differently depending on the camber of the road and the type of turn, but generally use the delayed apex strategy. This means entering the turn on the outside and then scooting back to the inside as you clear the apex of the turn.

, Trim the root and leaf ends of 1-1/2 lbs. of parsnips. Scrub them with a vegetable brush as you rinse them under cool water. Peel the parsnips and julienne them, cutting them into long thin strips similar to the shape of long French fries.
,, The parsnips should be submerged in the water, which will cook them once it boils in the oven.
 Sprinkle the parsnips with 1/2 tsp. of dried oregano, 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp. of salt, and 1/8 tsp. of pepper.
 After 35 minutes or so, you can check to see how tender they are by poking them with a fork.
 Enjoy these parsnips while they are hot. You can enjoy them on their own or as a side to a meat or vegetable-based dish, such as chicken or eggplant.

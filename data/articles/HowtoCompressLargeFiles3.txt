 This is a free, open source video editor that allows you to easily compress and convert your video files. You can download it from fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.


Videos are large chunks of data that don't compress well when added to an archive using the method above. Instead, you'll want to re-encode it using Avidemux, which will lower the file size considerably at the cost of some quality.
Movie files that you've downloaded from online sources may already be compressed. Further compression can lead to a virtually unwatchable final product, or may not result in significant size changes.
It is not possible to uncompress a compressed video. You should always save the compressed version as a separate file so that you don't lose the original.
 You can click "File" â†’ "Open" to browse for the file on your computer. It may take a few moments for the video to load.
 This is the most compatible format for your converted video.
 This will compress the audio track of the video to keep the size down.
 This will ensure that the video plays on the most devices possible.
,, Enter in the target size for the converted video. Avidemux will adjust its settings to get as close to your target size as possible, but it may end up slightly over or slightly under the target size.


Note that setting the target size significantly smaller than the original size will result in a drastic decrease in quality.
 You will be prompted to enter a name for the video, and then the conversion and compression process will begin. Depending on the length of the video and the quality settings, this could take quite some time to complete.

 If you can catch wet nail polish before it dries on upholstery, you'll have a much easier time removing it. Use a paper towel or cloth to wipe off as much of the wet polish as you can.









Don't smear the polish so it covers, even more, surface area on the upholstery; rather, use the paper towel to wipe it off with short swipes that don't spread the polish around.
Use the most absorbent cloth or paper towels you can, so you're leaving as little polish as possible to soak into the upholstery.
 Use a cotton swap or another tool that allows the precise application to put a few drops of acetone on the stained area. Be sure to apply it only on the stained area.









You may want to do a test dab on a part of the upholstery that's usually hidden. Acetone reacts with some types of fabric, including those containing acetate or triacetate, and could make the stained area look worse if you aren't careful.
Do not pour the acetone onto the stained fabric since it's harder to control where it flows if you don't use an applicator like a cotton swab or the corner of a paper towel.
 Blot it over the stained area carefully, and then use a clean section of the towel to blot it again. Apply more acetone and continue blotting until the stain has been removed.
 Use a sponge to wash the area to remove traces of acetone or hydrogen peroxide. Let the upholstery dry completely before using.

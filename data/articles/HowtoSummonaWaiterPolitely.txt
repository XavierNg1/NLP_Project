 Most waiters are very busy but will get to you eventually. Be patient if the restaurant is packed. The waiter might have many tables to help besides yours.;
, Control your tone and attitude, a bossy or condescending way of speaking is not needed. Never yell or snap your fingers to get attention.
, If your waiter is ignoring you, be patient, he or she may be busy and stressed out with too much work.
,


Changing your mind over dishes after they have been ordered
Telling your waiter it is time to order than make them stand there for 10 minutes because you really have not decided what you want.
Drinking too much alcohol
Harassing other wait staff/customers
Asking them out on a date
Talking about your waiter even if he or she is standing right there.
Ask for separate checks after the waiter bring you the bill or order dessert after the waiter brings the bill
Asking the waiter to come back over and over again to take your order.
 Don't ever touch your waiter!

, Very rude.

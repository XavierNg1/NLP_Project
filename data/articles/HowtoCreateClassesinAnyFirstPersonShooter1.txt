 It can be any gun in the game no matter what people say.


People say that guns are noobish, because one, they don't like it or two, people get killed by them.;

Use an attachment that will help you use a certain gun. For example, if you don't like the iron sight on a M8A1, then use a Red Dot Sight.
Read the description about an attachment. This could be the most useful thing ever to read.
Again all attachments are not noobish, that's peoples opinion about the attachment. Use it if you want to,

If you try out all of the sights, this can be useful.
 Try each one and see if it's right for that gun.


(Optional) Some FPS games gives you an option to have a secondary weapon. This could be useful but like I said its up to you.

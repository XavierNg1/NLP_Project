 Buy a blue tank top (or a white one and dye it blue, it doesn't matter).


Sew or glue some thin (about .8 inch thick) white ribbon around the arm holes and hemline.
Cut an upside-down triangle shape in the neck line, like an arrow pointing to your bellybutton, and line it with the ribbon.
Also line the neckline with the same ribbon.;
, Any shade of medium to dark blue will work, but navy blue works best.


Buy sweatpants or leggings, in a size or two above your usual size. The upsizing is important to give realistically to the final product.
Take a white scarf (a thin one) and use it as a belt for the top.
 Tan colored UGG or UGG knockoff boots are good. Tuck the very edges of your pants into the boots, letting the rest bag out around the rim.
 Take a square of tan fabric (any fabric works, but velvet/faux velvet is nice) and taper the end ever so slightly. Line every side but the top with white stuffing.


Leave four or five inches at the top barren, so you can tuck it into your pants.
Tuck it in on the sides and back.
 Take some stretchy, light blue fabric and sew it in a cylinder shape that fits your upper arm. put a white rubber band that fits the size on each end. Paint white fabric paint on Korra's armband pattern.
 Take two thick straws and slit them lengthwise. Paint them blue and add white around the edges.
 Take the stretchy fabric for the armband, and make a two--three inch long cylinder. Paint around the edges with white fabric paint.
, Secure it with a brown or black hair elastic.

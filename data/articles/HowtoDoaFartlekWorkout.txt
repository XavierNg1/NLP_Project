 Identify parts of the route that you could use as indicators for when you can concentrate on speed bursts, such as a bend in the road, an area marked by trees or other objects. Note these areas mentally and get ready to start.;
, When you get near your identifying place, speed up as you head toward your landmark and maintain this speed for 200–400 meters (656.2–1,312.3 ft).,, Again, increase your speed over a short area and slow down again.
 Runner's World has a similar suggestion which involves using a local city block as your track. Begin slowly for the first five to 10 steps, gradually increase the pace for 20 to 50 steps and then run as if you are racing for a full block. Slow it down right to a walk in between the fast parts and the gradual build-up again.
 This is important to help you to cool down and relax back into finishing the workout.

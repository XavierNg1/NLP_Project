Citroens were the first mass-produced vehicle outside of the United States, and in 1944, their B-10 was Europe's first steel-bodied car.
Their company was the first to have mass-produced front-wheel drive, which was introduced in 1934, and in 1955 they had the first disc brakes.
One of their earlier models was the Traction Avant, and the 2CV and DS models were designed in secret while the Germans occupied France during World War II.

Try finding a Citroen at http://www.carandclassic.co.uk/list/15/. Use the search options of era, country and/or region.
 Use this pricing as a starting point for your negotiations for a Citroen, but keep in mind currency exchange rates so that you don't offend the seller when making an offer that is too low.
 Make sure that your starting offer is a fair price, but also don't get taken advantage of, particularly if you are dealing with someone not from your country who is more knowledgeable about exchange rates or international shipping than you.
 Will it be delivered by truck or by ship, or are you planning to make arrangements to go to the vehicle and drive and/or accompany it back to your home?

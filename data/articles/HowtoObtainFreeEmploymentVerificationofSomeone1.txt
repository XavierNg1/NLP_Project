 An employment verification letter is a letter from a past or current employer verifying the length of employment and the employeeâ€™s position. The letter can also include salary information.The letter should be official. That is, it should be written on company letterhead and include the phone number, email address, and mailing address of the company.
An official letter prevents the employee from faking the verification letter.;
, In your job advertisement you can state that you require an employment verification letter. Or, you may choose to request this letter during the interview process.


Request that letters be mailed in a sealed envelope directly to you.
You can always call the employer if you have questions.
 A character reference is like an employment verification but includes more information. Specifically, the person writing the character reference also gives his or her impressions of the applicant as a worker, evaluating abilities and skills.This letter should also include information about how long the employee has worked at the current job and therefore is a good substitute for an employment verification letter.

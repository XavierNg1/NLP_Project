 if you have or think you have a bacterial infection such as pneumonia, an upper respiratory infection (URI), cellulitis, strep throat, a urinary tract infection (UTI), or a Salmonella infection, you may need to take antibiotics.Keep in mind that antibiotics are useless for viral diseases like the common cold or the flu. Call your doctor to determine whether you have a viral or a bacterial infection.;
, Side effects of antibiotics include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes, and appetite loss. Antibiotic use may also result in liver damage, anemia, headaches, dizziness, and sensitivity to light.These side effects may be related to killing off normal gut, skin, and mouth bacteria.


One of the most dangerous side effects of many antibiotics is called pseudomembranous colitis, an inflammation and/or infections of the colon with Clostridium difficile (C diff) that results in dehydration, bloody and pus-filled diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This side effect may begin within a day or two of starting your antibiotic treatment or up to several weeks after you stop taking the antibiotics.
 If your doctor has prescribed antibiotics to combat a bacterial infection, then you should follow his or her instructions for taking the medication. Do not stop taking the medication without consulting your doctor first.Make sure that you take the full cycle of pills. Even if you being to feel better before you have finished taking the full cycle of medication, you should not stop taking the antibiotics until they are all gone. Not completing the cycle may cause the infection to come back or may make it harder to fight another infection in the future.

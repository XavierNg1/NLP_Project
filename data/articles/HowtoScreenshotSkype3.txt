 Click the Skype Window to take a screenshot accurately.


Once it’s done, you will hear a camera tone, which indicates that your snapshot has been saved to desktop in a PNG format.
 Skype has a built-in setting on the Options panel to take still screenshot for video calls. In order to navigate to that panel, hit “Tools” – “Options” on main interface, then check “Enable keyboard shortcuts” and “Take a snapshot during video calls” separately. You will soon get a pop-up window in which you can enter the key combination as shortcut. Now you can have video calls as usual and use the shortcut to make video snapshots conveniently. Images saved in this way would be placed in “Gallery” folder.

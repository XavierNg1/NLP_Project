 You will want to use lukewarm water, as warm or hot water may damage the leather soles of your Rainbow sandals. Add a drop or two of dish soap and stir to combine., Dip a corner of a clean rag into the soapy water, and squeeze it a bit to get rid of excess water. Gently dampen and wipe off dirty areas with small circular motions.If there are any particularly dirty areas that are too much for the wet cloth to handle, a soft bristled brush like an old toothbrush can come in handy.Take care only to rub hard enough to dislodge dirt, without damaging the leather.
 Using a clean paper towel, wipe off any dampness on your sandals. Make sure to do a thorough job, as soap residue can damage the leather.Itâ€™s a good idea to let them air dry in the sun before you wear them again, just to be sure they have totally dried off.

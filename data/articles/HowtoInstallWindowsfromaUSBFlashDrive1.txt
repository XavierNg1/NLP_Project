Reboot your computer and look for the BIOS or BOOT menu key when the manufacturer logo appears. Press this key to open the menu and change your boot order. The setup key is typically F2, F10, F11, or Del. Make sure that the USB drive is listed as the primary boot device.
If your computer boots directly into Windows 8 without showing the manufacturer logo, open the Charms bar (âŠž Win+C) and select "Settings". Click the "Change PC settings" option and then select "Update and recovery". Select the "Recovery" option and click "Restart now" under "Advanced Startup". In the boot menu, select "Troubleshoot" and then "Advanced options". Click the "UEFI Firmware Settings" to open your UEFI menu. You can then open the BOOT menu and change the order so that the USB drive is the primary drive., You'll see a message on your screen prompting you to press a key to boot from "CD or DVD".

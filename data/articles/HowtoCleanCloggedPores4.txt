 Blackheads form when clogged pores mix with dirt or dead skin cells and form hard, black knobs that become more visible over time. Making a habit of removing blackheads can cause skin irritation and even scarring, so be very careful with this method, and don't use it more than absolutely necessary.


Use a sterile wipe to sanitize the part of your face with the blackhead.
Use your fingers to pinch the area around the blackhead into a small mound.
Wrap a tissue around your other hand and use it to gently squeeze the blackhead until it leaves the skin. Wipe it away and wash the area.
Alternatively, use a blackhead removal tool (available at beauty stores) to remove the blackhead.
Always sanitize your face, hands and any tools you use so that you don't infect your face with bacteria, which could lead to acne or skin irritation.
 This treatment is offered at salons, and entails applying a chemical to the skin that removes the top layer to deeply exfoliate and get rid of substances deep in your pores. This treatment should be used sparingly, since it can damage your skin if it's done too often.

 Dialing voicemail requires cell signal like any other call. If reception is poor you may have trouble connecting to your mailbox.
 If you are having trouble connecting to your voicemail by pressing and holding “1”, you can also dial “123” or “1-805-637-7249”.


If these methods work, but holding “1” does not, then your voicemail feature may have been set up incorrectly by T-Mobile and you should contact them for support., If you find that unanswered calls aren’t being redirected to your voicemail, you can enter this button combo and press “Send” to reset forwarding.Your phone may need to be reset for the changes to take effect.
 If text messaging is functioning and your phone is up to date, you can try to delete all of your text messages, then reset your phone. Leave a test voicemail to check that notifications are now working.

 Surfing in Counter-Strike is accomplished by sliding down angled surfaces, using gravity to maintain your speed. You'll be required to jump from surface to surface to navigate the map. You'll be using the A and D buttons to stay on the angle, and the mouse to steer.
 Every time you're surfing an angle, you should be hold either A or D, whichever key is the opposite of the slope. For example, if you're on an angle where the upper edge is on your right, and the lower edge is on your left, press and hold D to push yourself towards the apex. This will keep you on the surface so that you don't fall off.This is the essential motion for surfing. You always want to be pushing the opposite direction of the angle you're on to counter gravity.
A basic way to remember this is to use this simple diagram: D/\A


, This will increase your speed, allowing gravity to work in your favor.
 After moving towards the bottom of the ramp, quickly aim towards the upper corner and climb back up before jumping to the next surface. You are essentially making a wave motion for each surface you hit (start high, move low, and then move back up high before jumping).
 When you reach the end of a surfing surface, press Space to jump and move to the next angled surface. Try to jump at the last possible second to maintain your speed.
 Hold the key that matches the direction you're going in mid-air

, While it might be tempting to press W to "move forward," this will actually slow you down. You'll get all the speed you need by moving along the angled ramps.If you need to stop mid-air, or slow down on a ramp for some reason, press S. Otherwise, avoid this key was well.
 This will give you the most space to surf downwards to the bottom corner of the far end of the ramp. Hitting the right entry spot for the ramp can be essential for maintaining a high speed.


Be careful when lining up your approach, as hitting the edge of the ramp will likely kill you from fall damage.

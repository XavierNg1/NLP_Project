 While you could craft caterpillar frosted cookies or cakes you can create creative designs using average grocery-made food.
 For after school or just “because” create snacks inspired by the book that not only tantalize the eyes but also the palate.


Create cheese and apple caterpillars. Slice green apples and create a wave design on a plate. Top with a sealed piece of red Baby Bell cheese and create feet and caterpillar antennas with fruit leather.
Design a fruit platter with pretend “bites” taken from the caterpillar. Puncture a piece of watermelon, strawberry and cheese with the end of a straw. Print a picture of the hungry caterpillar from the Internet and affix to the straw with clear tape.
Create healthy caterpillar sandwiches by using a round cookie cutter to create the “body.” Make sandwiches and then cut out the middle using a round cookie cutter. Line the sandwiches up in a rounded circle (like a caterpillar body) and top the head with either a tomato or an apple. Make the eyes and mouth with green fruit leather.
Make a caterpillar sushi roll for the adventuresome child (or adult). Line your rolls, wrapped in seaweed in a caterpillar line and top with a happy piece of tuna.
 Design your child’s birthday cake or snack in the “Hungry Caterpillar” theme.


Design green cake pops and affix them in Styrofoam covered in fake grass to resemble a caterpillar. Line the green cake pops in a wavy line and top them with a red cake pop with eyes and a nose.
Make green iced cupcakes and set them up on the cake board in a swirling fashion. Use small licorice rope to create the feet and add a red cake topper to be the caterpillar’s head.

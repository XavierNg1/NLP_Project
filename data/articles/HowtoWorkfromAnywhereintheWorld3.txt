Buy a smart phone in your home country. Make sure your carrier network is compatible with the countries you plan to visit. It should also be capable of making international calls.
Work with your cell phone company to ensure you get a good rate. Specify the countries you will need to work from and negotiate a flat rate if you can. This will save you money and keep you from having to switch to a new cell phone every time you go to a different country.



Use a laptop with a wireless Internet connection as well as Voice over IP (VOIP) capability. This will help you get online wherever you are, and provide you with the ability to Skype, or video chat when you want to.
Make sure you have all necessary chargers and adapters for both your laptop and your phone.
 Unless you plan on working from Internet cafes across the world, you will want to be able to get online no matter where you are.


Get a USB modem. These modems are cards or sticks that can be plugged into your laptop, bringing you Internet connectivity. You will need a data plan, which you can often add to your cell phone service.
 You can get online access by signing up with a global wireless provider such as Boingo, iPass and T-mobile.
 Anything can happen to your laptop or your phone while you travel, so make sure your data is saved in a Cloud, or another secure location.


Check out online data storage services such as Dropbox or Skydrive. You can also use programs like Google Docs and Microsoft Office Live.

 Smile and keep things cordial and kind with the person, even if they are not doing the same in return, and even if you are finding it difficult to do so. Changing your behavior and the way you interact with this person might cause them to change the way they interact with you, in return.You don’t have to go out of your way to be polite for this person. If they approach you and begin a conversation, just be polite in response. Condition yourself to keep your interactions with this irritating person as positive as you can, and you might start to feel less annoyed by these interactions as time goes on.
 Don’t speak to mutual friends, co-workers, or peers and express your negative feelings towards this person. Not only is it likely that your negative words will circle back around to that person, but you will also run the risk of that gossip reflecting negatively on you as a person.Even if someone truly irritates and frustrates you, don’t use that as an excuse to bad mouth them to anyone who will listen. That person’s irritating qualities might only be irritating to you, and not to everyone else. You might come off looking petty or foolish for shaming that person over those behaviors.
 If this irritating person says something to set you off, your instinct might be to lash out, or get angry at them. Just take a deep breath and stay calm. If this person is truly trying to annoy you, you will only disappoint them by not giving them the reaction they set out to receive.Even if the person has said something truly irritating or rude, laugh it off and move on with your day. Don’t stay in the situation or provoke further conversation. Stay calm and remove yourself politely from the situation. Say something like, “I’m sorry, I’ve got something really important I have to deal with, so I’ll catch up with you another time.”

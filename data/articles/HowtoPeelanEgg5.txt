 Cook and cool the eggs according to the steps outlined in the basic method above.
 Once the eggs have cooled, remove them from the water and pat dry with some paper towel. Take an egg and firmly tap each end on a hard surface, such as a counter top, to crack the shell.
 Peel away the circular area of broken shell at each end of the egg, using the side of your thumb.
 Grasp the egg firmly in one hand and blow forcefully into the hole in the shell, at the narrow end of the egg. With enough lung power, the boiled egg should slide right out of the shell. Make sure you have your other hand ready to catch it when it comes flying out!









This method can be very difficult to master and will definitely take some practice - but once you get the hang of it, you'll feel like an egg ninja!

 Assets do not live forever, and when an asset is sold or retired, you need to perform a series of accounting entries to make sure that both the asset, and its accumulated depreciation are completely purged from the balance sheet.If this did not happen, fixed assets would just build up over time, as would accumulated depreciation.
 This entry is fairly straightforward but will differ depending on the amount the asset sells for and when it is sold.


In the example above, imagine the asset is discarded after ten or more years. To record the journal entry, debit Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000 and credit Equipment for $10,000.
This reduces the equipment asset account by the value of the machine, and reduces the accumulated depreciation contra-asset account. The end result is that the asset is removed from the balance sheet.
 Imagine the asset is sold after ten or more years for $500. In this case, you would debit Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000 and Credit Equipment for $10,000 the same as you would for an asset with no value. You would also need to debit the Cash account for $500 and credit the Gain on Asset Disposal account for $500.


What if you sell the asset before it is fully depreciated? Imagine you sell the asset after six years for $4,000. To record the journal entry, you would debit Accumulated Depreciation for $6,000, debit Cash for $4,000, and credit Equipment for $10,000. In this example, the sales price is equal to the asset's book value. Thus, there is no gain or loss to record.
Finally, imagine you discard the asset before it is fully depreciated, say after seven years. To record the journal entry, debit Accumulated Depreciation for $7,000, debit Loss on Asset Disposal for $3,000, and credit Equipment for $10,000.

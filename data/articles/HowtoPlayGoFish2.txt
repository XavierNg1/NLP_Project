 In Go Fish, one person starts out as the dealer, the person who distributes the first hand of cards and gets the game started. The person who had the idea to play the game usually plays the role of the dealer. The other players arrange themselves in a circle extending from both sides of the dealer.


Some people like to follow certain rules to figure out who the dealer should be. For example, the dealer could be the youngest or oldest person present, or the person whose birthday is coming up the soonest.
If you end up playing more than one game of Go Fish, the dealer of the second game is usually the person who won the first game.
 Any time you're about to start a card game, shuffle the deck to redistribute the cards from the last game. This ensures the cards aren't organized in a predictable pattern and shows the other players that no cheating is involved.
 Start with the deck of cards face down, so they cannot be seen by any of the players. Give the topmost card to the first player on the left, the next card to the next player in the circle, and so on. Continue dealing cards one at a time around the table until everyone has five cards.


If you are playing with just two players, deal 7 cards to each player instead of 5.
 Place the remaining cards face down in the center of the circle or table so that they are within everyone's reach. They don't have to be orderly, but they should all be face down. This is the pool from which everyone "fishes."

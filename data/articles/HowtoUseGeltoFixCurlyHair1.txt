 If you have fairly dry, tight curls, choose a moisturizing gel â€” or at least a lightweight gel, which tends to be less drying. If you have looser curls, pick any clear gel. Dark brown gels may leave a visible residue, depending on your hair color.


Gels that contain high levels of alcohol can dry out and damage hair. That said, most gel should not cause problems as long as you wash it out thoroughly before going to bed.If you notice problems, switch to a different brand or reduce the frequency of use.;
, Gel applies best to damp hair, so wash your hair as usual before you use it. If you have extra-frizzy hair, you can help tame it with a cold-water rinse, or by weighing it down with leave-in conditioner.
 Make sure your hair is tangle-free before you apply the gel.
 This tends to create less frizz than a towel or blow-drying. Let your hair dry in the T-shirt until slightly damp.
 You only need a nickel-sized squirt of gel for one section of shoulder-length hair. Rub it between your hands to soften it.
 Hold one handful of hair near the base. Rub the gel onto it a short distance above the roots, then spread it evenly down the hair using your fingers or a comb. As you go, the gel should smooth down stray strands and weigh down your curls closer to your head.


You may not need to apply the gel all the way to the tips. Applying too much gel to the ends of your hair can weigh it down, reducing volume and bounce.
If you want to keep a curlier hairdo and just fight frizz, scrunch your hair with the gel instead.
 If you want to dry your hair more quickly, use a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment.

 On the FAFSA, you will be asked if you have a conviction for a drug-related offense while receiving student aid (Question 23).To help you answer the question properly, there is an additional form available from the Student Aid Office .


Just being convicted of a drug-related offense doesn’t mean you can’t get any money. Any drug-related conviction (felony or misdemeanor) that occurred while receiving financial aid will make you ineligible without further steps. If your conviction came when you were not receiving aid, you can still be eligible., If you were convicted for a drug-related offense while on federal aid, you will need to complete an acceptable rehabilitation program in order to regain your eligibility. Once one complete this program, you can contact the financial aid office at your school to get aid.An acceptable drug rehabilitation program must meet one of three requirements: include two unannounced drug tests, be qualified to receive funds from federal, state, or local government, or a state-licensed insurance company, or be administered by a federal, state, or local government agency, or a state-licensed health clinic, or medical doctor. Talk to your parole officer or health care provider to find a good program. Make sure you discuss with your school’s financial aid office what documentation you will need to prove that you completed the program., Once you have finished the program, you need to make sure you stay away from drugs. If you are convicted of possessing or selling drugs after you submit your FAFSA, you will need to notify your financial aid administrator immediately. At that point, you will no longer be eligible, and you must pay back all aid you received after your conviction.

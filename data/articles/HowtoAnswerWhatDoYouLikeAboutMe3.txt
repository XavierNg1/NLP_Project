 If your best friend was just broken up with, they are likely feeling sad and experiencing low self-esteem. Your significant other might be feeling insecure about your relationship. If you’ve recently had an argument with a friend, they may be worried that you are angry and truly don’t like them anymore. If you know why they are asking, give the person an encouraging answer that will lift them up. Say things like:"I've never felt this strongly about a boyfriend. You mean the world to me."
"No matter what happens, I will always be your friend."

, Their sudden question may some weird or silly to you, but they probably really want to know why you like them. Stop what you’re doing and focus on the person so that you can give them a good answer. Smile and look them in the eyes when you reply. Really think about your words instead of giving a half-hearted or brief answer.


If the person has asked you this question many times before and seems to have no real reason for doing it, it’s possible that they are just fishing for compliments. This is especially true if they are never satisfied with the answer you give them.In this case, you can say something like, "I have already answered this question several times. Is something else going on?"

, If the person feels comfortable enough to ask you what you like about them, chances are you already know them pretty well. Because of this, you don’t have to force a fake answer. You really do like the person. Tell them how you really feel.You can say to a friend, "Sarah, you've been my best friend since we were five years old. We've been through so much together. I can't imagine my life without you in it." You can then go on to list specifics.
It’s unlikely, but if you are asked this question by someone that you don’t like or don't know well, try to be nice to them about it. Answer as sincerely as you can. You could say, "I don't know you that well, but you seem like a really nice person."

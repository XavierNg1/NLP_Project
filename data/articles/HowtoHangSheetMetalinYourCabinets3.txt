 Apply contact adhesive to both surfaces to be joined.


If you made reference lines on the door, keep the adhesive within those lines.
Do not join the two pieces at this time.
Allow the adhesive to set for about 10 minutes or until your finger barely sticks to the coated surface.
 Your fingers will act as “spacers” as you line up the bottom and the right or left edge with the pencil reference lines.


Bond only a small portion of the two surfaces together to make sure the metal is lined up properly.
Your fingers will keep the rest of the metal from contacting the door at this time and will allow for readjustment.
Once you bond more than half the surface, it’s there for good.
 Once you feel the metal is properly lined up, slowly move your fingers up the length of the metal and bond the surfaces together.


Press the pieces together for a solid bond.
Allow them to set for a couple of hours before using.

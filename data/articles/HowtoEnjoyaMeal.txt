 Whatever you're eating, be it ramen, spaghetti, chicken Kiev or any other dish, take a slow and calm approach so as to fully enjoy it. Put down your fork, knife, chopstick or other utensil between bites and allow yourself time to chew and swallow correctly.;
, This step comes naturally. Take a moment to make a mental note of the flavor, the smell and the texture of what you're eating. That memory will stay with you and remind you of how good the meal was.
 Eating too much will give you that sick, bloated feeling you get when you are full. Keep this good meal, by eating just enough and no more.
 If something extra is on your dish, such as a condiment/side order that you don't normally eat, or a different dish altogether you haven't tried yet is available, go for it! Often a meal won't feel complete if you haven't tried a little of everything on your plate.
 From the very beginning, recipes were made to be altered and tampered with, to make new and exciting ones. Picture this––an ancient Chinese man eating some bland and dry chicken with rice adds a little sauce with some pineapple and tomato, and what does he get? Sweet and sour chicken: a delicious Chinese dish. Even now, that dish is still being modified. Try to alter your meal with some different sauces, and aim to get the ratio of flavor varieties right. Eventually you'll end up with your own personal meal that you fine-tuned to your own taste buds.

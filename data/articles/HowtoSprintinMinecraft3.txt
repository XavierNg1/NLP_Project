 Touch the forward button twice and hold it down to sprint. You will move at double speed, but will use up hunger much faster than walking.While sprinting, you can jump three blocks forward instead of two.
 To return to normal speed, just let go of the forward button, then walk forward again with a single tap. You will also stop sprinting if you collide with a block or fight a mob., Your Minecraft character needs energy for all that running. If your hunger drops below four food symbols, you cannot sprint.If your version of Minecraft does not have hunger, you are playing an old version that does not have sprinting.Connect your device to the internet and open Minecraft to download the latest update.

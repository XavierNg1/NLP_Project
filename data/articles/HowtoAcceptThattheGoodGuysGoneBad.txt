 There has to be a good reason why he went bad (we'll just assume the murderer's a boy, but generally the same rules apply to females.) Watch the reruns/read through the book and find key points which indicate their reasons for turning to 'the dark side of the force' (yes, Anakin Skywalker, we're talking about you). Try to see the whole thing from their perspective, not yours!;
, The more you see it, the easier it is to accept: they're the bad guy, and there's nothing you can do about it.
 This particular character has had his ups and downs in life. Observe times when he didn't realize that he was bad.
 This helps in any case. If they repent at the last moment, it makes everything a little better. NOTE: this step is optional.
 There's good and there's bad, this character just did what he believed was right. Everybody has their own personal beliefs. It's easiest just to accept it.
 Oh, the irony! It will be simply smashing to see how the other characters react to this sudden betrayal. Savour this part, trust me, this is always an exciting part of a story.
 The other characters, unless they are extremely emotional, will accept their betrayal and get on with their lives. After all, none of us can linger on the past. Follow their example. It may take a while to get it through your mind that he did wrong, but take your time and don't pressure yourself. After all, these characters aren't perfect.

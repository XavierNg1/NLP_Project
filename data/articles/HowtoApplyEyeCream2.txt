Before purchasing an eye cream, take a minute to think about your priorities.Eye creams do many things. For example, some eye creams are good for treating puffiness. If your eyes are a bit swollen, look for a product that mentions reducing redness and puffiness.

Any eye cream that you choose should be fragrance free. Fragrances can irritate your skin and should be avoided on all parts of your face.

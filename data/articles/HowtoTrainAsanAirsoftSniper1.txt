 The target should initially be at a medium range in the open, as you improve move the target further away, add obstructions and make the target smaller.;
, Mark down the number you hit versus the number you didn't. On consecutive runs do the same, hopefully your hit number should go up. See if there are any patterns to the hits. Are they all at the beginning? If so, then you are probably losing concentration near the end. If they are all at the end then you are rushing into it, so slow down.

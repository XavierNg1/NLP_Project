 Word of mouth can be an excellent way to grow your business, and you can increase word of mouth by seeking referrals from existing customers.


Offer a discount or a freebie to current customers who send you referrals. You could hand out specialized referral cards for them to give to new customers.
Be sure to advertise your referral program, so that existing customers know about the program and what they can gain from providing you with referrals.
 Team up with other businesses that offer complementary services and refer customers to one another. For instance, if you sell greenhouses, network with fertilizer suppliers and floral shops.Be sure to negotiate a deal that is beneficial to both organizations. This will increase buy-in for all involved, increasing success of the alliance.
You will need to formalize your partnerships and alliances with contractual agreements. Seek legal advice as necessary.
 Chambers of commerce, service organizations, and other groups are a great way to network with other business owners and potential customers.


It is important to be an active member of the organizations you join. Just being a member will not be as effective as being a participating member. Attend meetings and events of these organizations, and speak with as many people as possible.
Be sure to seek out mutually beneficial relationships. People are more likely to send customers your way, if you are returning the favor.
Make sure you are not blatantly advertising for your business. You should contribute value to these organizations while sharing information about your business and your expertise when appropriate.
 If you own a space that can accommodate several people at once, consider hosting an event to help familiarize people with your product. For instance, wine shops can host tastings and craft stores can host workshops on any number of crafting techniques.

 An alphabetical organization system makes it relatively easy to find books. You may alphabetize the books by the authorâ€™s last name.


If you prefer a less traditional system, you may alphabetize the books by title.;
, Depending on the size and scope of your collection, it may make sense to sort your collection into very specific categories. These may include fantasy, mystery, cookbooks, history, anthropology, art and art history, and or science.Alternatively, you could sort the books by reading level (children, young adult, adult)., If your top priority is to create an aesthetically pleasing display with your books, consider sorting them by color or height.


Group the books by black, white, reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, indigos, and violets. When you are ready to stage your shelves, you can color block your books.
Line your books up from tallest to shortest or group books of similar heights together., Use your books to create a timeline of literature and/or civilization. You may place the books in order of their publication date or you may organize the books by order of when the subjects lived, events occurred, or ideas originated., While you may choose to rely on only one method of organization, most collections are sorted by two or more methods. For example, you may choose to sort your books by genre and then place each genre in alphabetical order. Alternatively, you could sort your books by color and then place them on the shelf by order of height.

 Do you want to sort it by size (2x2 bricks, 2x4 bricks or 1x- bricks, 2x- bricks, etc.)? What about by set or theme (Creator, Western, Fire Truck, etc.)? Perhaps colour is your preferred route (blue, green, light grey, etc.)? Pick the one you like best.;
, If you have all of it in one place already, you can skip this step! Otherwise, decide on a main LEGO area (where your largest collection is). Grab a few plastic bags and raid your other smaller collections and return it all to the central pile. You may be surprised by how much LEGO you actually have!

, If you only have a small amount of one group, mix it in with another small group. (e.g. you could mix light grey bricks with dark grey bricks or 2x2 bricks with 2x3 bricks).
 Purchase as many as you need, according to how you sorted your collection in the previous step. Place all your LEGO in the boxes.
 Translucent boxes may be a good buy as it will be easier to tell which group of bricks is in the box, especially if they are sorted by colour.
 If you're really a stickler for organization, you can arrange them by size (smallest up, largest down) by colour (the colour spectrum), or by set/theme (alphabetical, set number, etc.)

Press the "Option" key and the number "8" at the same time to add a bullet in front of your text, if you are using Mac Operating Systems (OS).
Press the "Num Lock" key above your numbers pad on your keyboard if you are using Windows OS. Press the "ALT" key and keep it depressed. Then type these numbers in sequential order, as if you are dialing a phone number, "0149." Then release the ALT key. Note: This will not work with the number row across the top of your keyboard.
There is another option on Windows computers, go to the Start Menu, go to "Accessories," and click on "System Tools." You will see the function "Character Map." You can either click on it for 1-time use or you can right click and select "Pin to Start Menu" from the options in the pop-up window. Select the correct font for your document from the drop down box on the character map window. Select the bullet from the list. Double click to add it to the empty text bar. Press copy and paste it in your text box.
 You may have to create a tab or add spaces to format the list to your liking.

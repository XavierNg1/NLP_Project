 To make this apple and cinnamon pancake topping (which also functions as an apple pie filling or all-purpose dessert topping), you’ll need your apples, a sharp knife, and a large saucepan.
 After coring and peeling the apples, cut them into small cubes. Set them aside as you prepare the sauce.
 Add the water, lemon juice, spices, sugar, maple syrup,and cornstarch to the saucepan. Heat on medium heat, stirring frequently. Once the sauce starts to bubble and thicken, continue stirring for another two minutes., Turn the heat to low and stir to combine. Cover the saucepan and let the mixture cook on low for about 10 minutes, until the apples are soft.
 Once the apples are soft, remove the filling from the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes. It doesn’t have to be room temperature, but you don’t want to burn any mouths!

, Place one to two pancakes on a plate and cover each one with a few dollops of the apple cinnamon topping. Add a swirl of whipped cream for an extra special treat.


Once it’s cooled to room temperature, you can store the leftover apple topping in an air-tight container in the fridge.

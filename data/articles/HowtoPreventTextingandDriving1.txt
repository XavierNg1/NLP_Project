 A good way to prevent texting and driving is to turn your phone off. This helps you not hear any text or social media notifications, or see the screen light up when you get a text. If you don’t see any new messages, you won’t be tempted to look at them or respond.As soon as you stop, you can turn the phone back on. If you are on a long car ride, you can pull off the road every hour or so to check your messages if you need to check them.;
, If you don’t want to turn your phone off completely, turn it to silent. Even on silent you can see when you have a message. Just make sure you put the phone face down so you can’t see it light up with a new message and be tempted.If you want to leave your phone ringer on, you can silence your text message notifications.
 If you want to keep your phone on, you can try to place it in a spot where you cannot reach it while driving. This helps keep your phone unavailable so you cannot be tempted to sneak a peak. Try placing it in the trunk, glove box, behind your seat, or in your console.If you do this, make sure you will not want to reach to these inconvenient places while driving. Trying to grab something out of reach can cause an accident.
 To avoid a situation where you realize you need to send a very important text, take a moment before you start the car to send any texts you need to. If you will not be able to wait to read the reply, send the text after your trip.You should also plug your destination in your GPS and pull up any playlists you want to listen to before you start the car. This is also very distracting while you drive.
 If you are in the car with someone, ask them to read you any texts you receive. You can also ask them to respond to the texts. This allows you to respond while driving without texting yourself.You should only let the person on your phone if you trust them and don’t mind them reading your text conversation.

 One way to do this is to seal it inside of a plastic bag and be outside in the cold. Using the bag will also help redirect the condensation that will occur if your camera gets cold too fast.


Also, watch where you breathe. You can inadvertently cause condensation that way.;
, Cold causes the power to drain more quickly from your battery. You will need extras.
 If the conditions are extreme, any skin showing is prone to frostbite.
 Yes, it is difficult to photograph when gloved, but find some very thin gloves to wear under the warmer gloves. Then wear fingerless gloves over the thin gloves. Over them, wear the thick gloves that you would wear to protect your hands and remove them when you are photographing.
 That can end everything in a hurry. If your feet get damp with perspiration, change socks. Be sure to bring a few extra pairs of socks.
 With cold and ice, slipping is always a danger. You can hurt yourself and your cameras.

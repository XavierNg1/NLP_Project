 iBooks is a great feature to find previews of good books, to buy good books, and to even have access to tens of thousands of free titles.
 When iBooks opens, you should see a bookcase, or Library, and possibly a single book. The free book that comes with your download is Winnie the Pooh by A. A. Milne. This "bookcase" is where you will find all the books that you will later download.
 You can do this by going directly through the iBooks app.
 Then select your book from your Library. When you wish to turn to the next page, slide your finger across the page from left to right.

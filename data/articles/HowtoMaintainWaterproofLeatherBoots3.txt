 If your boots are made of Nubuck or other specialty leathers, look for a product specifically designed for that type of leather. If you have logging or industrial leather boots, mink oil may also work, but be wary about using it on standard hiking boots. Mink oil may over-soften the dry-tanned leather used for many hiking boots.
 The rag should be thoroughly moist, but not dripping wet.
 Make sure you rub the conditioner into the seams, and the surface.
, Do not allow the conditioner to sit on the boots for too long, since too much of it can cause the boots to become too soft.
 Buff the boots using long circular strokes.

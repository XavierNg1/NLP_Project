 After this, write the name of the person you are transferring the check to on the next line. This step transfers the rights to the check's funds from you to the person you have chosen.This step is like writing a brand new check to the person, but he or she will have to sign the check as well.
 You will need to sign your name underneath the printed name of the person to whom you are transferring the check. The person will then have to sign below your signature as well, so try to leave some room above the last grey line.
 Once you have signed your name, the person who you wish to transfer the funds to must also sign the check. He or she should sign the check right under your signature.


After signing the check, the person you have transferred the check to may deposit or cash the check.
 The authorized party should be able to deposit the check, but some cautious banks may require your presence. This may be the case for a large amount or if the person you are transferring the check to is from outside the country.You can try to let the person deposit the check alone first. If the person who you assign the check to can't cash or deposit the check, then you will have to go to the bank with him or her.

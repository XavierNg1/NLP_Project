 The chemicals in store-bought stain removal products can be very effective, but can also irritate the skin and some people might prefer a more natural alternative. Baking soda is one of the classics of stain removal. It is well-known as a something to grab if there is spill. Just make a quick paste with some water, gently apply to the stain and let it sink in.








You can also combine it with some distilled white wine vinegar., Lemon juice is known as a particularly effective way to tackle unpleasant sweat stains on your white shirts and tea-shirts, especially under the armpits. Mix up a solution that is equal parts water and lemon juice, and then rub it into the affected area of the garment.








Lemon juice and salt can work well to tackle mildew and rust stains on white clothes.Adding some lemon juice to a white wash can generally refresh the clothes.
 One of the worst things to spill all over your white clothes is red wine, but, perhaps surprisingly, a good remedy for this is to spill more wine on yourself. Take a little white wine this time, and carefully pour it onto the stain and it will work against the red wine.Dab at the edges of the stain gently with some kitchen towel to prevent it spreading.This won’t make the stain disappear, but can help it come out in a normal wash subsequently.
 Oily stains are particularly tricky to deal with as water can make the problem worse. One natural method for oily stains is to use white chalk. Rub some white chalk onto the fabric without being too rough. By doing this, it is the chalk which will be absorbing the oil rather than the clothes.








Dust off any excess chalk before putting the garment in the wash.
Only wash it in cold water, and don’t put it in the dryer as this can cause the oil to set.

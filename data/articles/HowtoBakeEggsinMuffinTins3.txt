 Make sure that your oven is warm enough to hard boil the eggs by preheating it. Set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Some recipes for hard boiling eggs in the oven call for heating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), so you may want to experiment with both temperatures and see which works best with your oven.
 When the oven is preheated, get the eggs ready for the oven. Set a single egg in each cup of a muffin tin. You can fill the entire tin or just hard boil a few eggs, depending on your needs., Place the muffin tin in the heated oven, taking care not to bang the eggs around too much. Allow them to bake for 30 minutes.It’s important not to bake the eggs too long, so you may want to set a timer to remind you to take them out.
 When the half hour is up, remove the muffin tin from the oven. Use a pair of tongs to take the eggs out of the tin, and carefully drop them in a large bowl filled with ice water. Allow the eggs to sit in the water for several minutes.To be safe, it’s a good idea to leave the eggs in the ice water for at least 10 minutes.
 Once the eggs have cooled sufficiently, remove them from the water and dry them off with a clean towel. Peel them as you normally would with hard boiled eggs, and enjoy.,

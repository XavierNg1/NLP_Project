 Make sure the container is at least 12 in (30.5 cm) with two or more drainage holes. Glazed ceramic or plastic pots prevent wilting and help the soil stay moist.The container should be sterilized. Soak it for 10 minutes in a solution of 1 part household bleach to 9 parts water. Afterwards, scrub it with dish detergent and water and let it fully dry before using it., Daisies should have sunlight or a grow light all day in the spring, summer and fall seasons. Indirect sunlight for at least 3-5 hours is sufficient for the wintertime.House plants need light from all sides. If your light source only hits one side of the plant, make sure to rotate the plant a quarter turn about every week., Check the top 1 in (2.54 cm) of soil – if it feels dry to the touch, water your daisies deeply. Allow the pot to drain completely. If the saucer or drip tray is still waterlogged, pour out the excess water so that the plant doesn’t sit in soggy soil.Daisies growing indoors prefer a temperature between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (4 and 21 degrees Celsius).Water plants from underneath and avoid getting the leaves wet.
 During the spring and summer, feed your daisies monthly with an all-purpose fertilizer. Don’t fertilize during the fall or winter.Mix water with a soluble fertilizer such as 15-5-15 once a month when they are actively growing in the spring and summer., Use sharp, clean shears and trim close to the stem. Whenever the blooms begins to wilt, snip off the flowerheads.When the leaves look wilted or damaged, prune them to improve the plant’s health.
 If the plant gets crowded in its container, move it to a larger pot.

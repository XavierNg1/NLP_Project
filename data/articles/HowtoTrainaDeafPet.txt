 Operant conditioning includes two types of reinforcement.

Positive reinforcement - Most trainers who use positive reinforcement also use "negative punishment", which means they take away something the dog wants to reduce behavior that the trainer doesn't want (for example turning away from a dog who is jumping up for attention).
Negative reinforcement - works by rewarding the dog by removing something aversive (like stopping shock, or loosening a tightened choke chain).

,, This is a hard one...think it over. Different animals need different types of reward/acknowledgment. Some ways that you can consider:


Hand signals
Small flashlight (not a laser light, this is potentially damaging to your animal's eyes).

For the purposes of this article, hand signals will be used, but whatever method you select can be used in its place.



Some dogs like food, others like a quick scratch or stroke off the head.
, Know, ahead of time, at least the first few things that you will be teaching your dog. 'Yes', 'Come', 'Stay', 'Sit', 'Leave it', are a few that you can start off with.
 This can be done by tapping the area near your eye or pointing at your eye so it catches his attention. Once the dog has made eye contact, signal 'yes' and reward.


You might need to 'grab' their attention by waving a treat in front of them and then bringing it to your face. Whatever you do...be consistent.
Another idea for grabbing your pet's attention is to thump your foot or hand so that they can feel the vibrations.
 For example, when your pet sits, give the 'yes' signal and reward. The signal and reward let your animal know that they did something good.

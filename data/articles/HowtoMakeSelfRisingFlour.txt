 Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl. If your recipe calls for more flour, simply increase the proportions.;
, Make sure that the baking powder is fresh. If the baking powder is not fresh, your self-rising flour will not work as well., These ingredients require a little extra raising power. The baking soda (in addition to the baking powder) will give them just that.If you are not baking with buttermilk, coca, or yogurt, you do not need to add the baking soda.

 You will need just a little less than 2 teaspoons.Again, make sure that you mix it in well.
 In a separate bowl, combine the baking powder and the salt. You will need about 6 ¾ teaspoons of baking powder and 1 1/8 teaspoon of salt. If you won't be using all of your gluten-free flour mix, use 1½ teaspoon of baking powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt for each cup of flour., Mix the two together using a whisk or fork until everything is evenly combined.
 Take note of the expiration date on your box of baking powder. This is when your self-rising flour will expire. You might want to copy this date down onto the container you will be keeping your flour in. When you are done, put the container in a cool, dark place.

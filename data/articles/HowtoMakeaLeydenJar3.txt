 By putting one hand on the outer electrode, you create a bridge to the negatively charged surface. Make sure that you are not touching the inner electrode, or any other charged surface. No spark or movement of charge will happen when you touch only the outer electrode., If you are doing this experiment as part of a group, everyone should join hands in a circle. The first person in the circle should be holding the Leyden jar and contacting only the outer electrode with one hand. They should hold the hand of the person beside of them with their other hand. The last person in the circle will only be holding one hand. Every other person will be holding the hand of the person to either side of them., Once everyone in the group is holding hands, with one person touching the outer electrode, the last person in the circle should touch their finger to the inner electrode. When they place their finger on the nail, a circuit will be created that allows electrons to move from the negatively charged outer electrode to the positively charged inner electrode. Everyone in the circle should feel a shock and you may see or hear a spark.If you are building your Leyden jar alone, touch one hand to the outer electrode and the other hand to the inner electrode to discharge the jar. You will likely see, hear, and feel a spark when you do this.

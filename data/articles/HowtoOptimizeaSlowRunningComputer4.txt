 This is the icon in the upper right-hand corner on your menu bar that resembles a magnifying glass. Wait for a window to appear.
 The Disk Utility window will appear where you can now select your hard drive. This will usually be titled "Macintosh HD."

, At the top of the screen, hit the "First Aid" button. A window will appear where you will be asked if you would like to run First Aid. Select "Run." First Aid will now go through your hard drive and isolate certain errors as well as repair them. This process may take a few minutes to complete but once it has, you may exit out Disk Utility.

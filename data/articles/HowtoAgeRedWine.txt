If you do not have a basement or cellar there are many specialized refrigeration units for wine on the market that will maintain your investment and do all the work for you.
Keeping the temperature at a constant is crucial to slowing down the aging process.
Extreme changes in the core temperatures will expand and contract the wine which will push or pull on the cork, resulting in oxygen entering, thus spoiling the wine.
Keep a digital air thermometer on hand to monitor the temperature.

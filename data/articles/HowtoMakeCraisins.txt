, Take out any berries that are soft or brown.
 Stir.
 It may take a bit longer; just stir every minute or two until all of the berries have split open. Turn off the heat, and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
 Don't worry if they stick together. Let them cool another 5 minutes.



Spread the cranberries on the parchment paper. Again, don't worry if they're stuck together because they will separate as they dry. If there are any that didn't pop, pop them now.
 Turn the heat down to 150ºF/ 65ºC. Bake for 6–8 hours in total.


After 2-4 hours, take the berries out. Replace the paper towels and parchment with fresh layers. This step is optional, but it really helps to speed things up.
The berries will be done in 6-8 hours total. The final time depends on your local levels of humidity, and on how dry you want the finished product.
 When the berries are done, store them in zipper bags. Homemade craisins can be frozen for up to 4 months.
 Craisins can be used in recipes calling for raisins or added in to dried fruit recipes. For starters, some ideas include:



Make pumpkin craisin bread.

Add to a fruit salad or add to a fresh salad.

Make pumpkin cranberry torte.

Flavor your oatmeal or improve your usual commercial cereal.

Make sunflower seed muesli bars.

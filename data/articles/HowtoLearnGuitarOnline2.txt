 Tabs are great if you just want to learn some great pop or rock songs that you can play to impress your friends. The internet is full of guitar tabs, though they sometimes take a bit of hunting.


To find popular tab sites, plug “Guitar Tabs” into your favorite search engine.
If you already have a tune in mind, you could also search, “Guitar Tab” on that same search engine. If the song is relatively well-known, dozens of options should come up. Try to choose one that is highly rated for accuracy (for instance, five stars or 100% ratings).;
, A tab is kind of like sheet music but primarily is only used for guitar and bass notation. It represents progressions as fret numbers instead of as notes. The main problem with tabs is that, unlike sheet music, there is no indication of rhythm, so it definitely helps to know the rhythm of the song before you start learning it.

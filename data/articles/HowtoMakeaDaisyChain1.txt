 Look for daisies with thick stems at least 4 inches (10 cm) long. Look for healthy, fully open flowers for a more beautiful chain.;
, Cut a small slit through the middle of the stem, without breaking it in half. You can cut this just below the flower, or halfway down the stem.


If your fingernails are too short, use a plastic knife.
 Push the base of the stem through, until the flower is snug against the slit.
 Make a slit in the next daisy and push the third stem through it. Repeat until you've made a bracelet, crown, or necklace. When you think your daisy chain is long enough, cut a second slit through the first stem. Push the last daisy through this slit to make a loop.
 To keep your daisy chain for a long time, hang it up to dry in a windy area. It might wither or change color, but it should stay together.

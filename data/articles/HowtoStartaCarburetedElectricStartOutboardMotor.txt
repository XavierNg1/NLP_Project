 Make sure there is fuel in the tank and the fuel tank vent is open and clear.;
,, On some controls, this is a lever beside the throttle/shift control that is lifted up far as it will go. On others, pushing a button located in the hub of the throttle lever allows you to advance the throttle without engaging forward gear.
 All outboards built before 1980 have choke plates; most of those built after 1982 have the enrichment system. The enricher opens a valve that drains fuel into the manifold to provide a rich mixture for cold starting; choke plates accomplish the same result by blocking the flow of air into the front of the carb venturi.


If you have choke plates: push the key in while turning it over to the start position. Release the key when the motor starts. You may have a separate "choke" button instead of a "push-to-choke" key switch.
If you have the enrichener: turn the key to the "run" position, push and hold it in for 5 or 8 seconds, then continue to hold it in while turning it to the "start" position. Release the key when the motor starts.
 If it starts to die out, punching the choke for just an instant will usually make it recover.

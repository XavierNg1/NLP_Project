 Rest is essential when you are sick and your sleep requirements can increase, as your body is working hard to fight off the infection or virus. You will likely need more than eight hours of sleep each night and may also need to take a nap during the day if you feel like you need one. If your mucus cough is making it hard for you to fall asleep and stay asleep, then you may want to consider taking some cough medicine before bed.Listen to your body â€” if you feel fatigued, you need to get more rest.
Applying a topical ointment that contains menthol and camphor may also help you to sleep at night. These expectorants can help to ease your coughing and thin out the mucus at the same time. Try rubbing some Vicks Vaporub or a similar ointment on your chest before you go to bed.
 Breathing in humid air as much as possible may also help to get rid of your mucus cough. You can use a vaporizer to keep the air in your home humid all day and night or take a few hot, steamy showers throughout the day.If you do not feel like taking a shower, then you can also just sit in the bathroom with the shower running and the door closed. You will still breathe in lots of steam by hanging out in the bathroom.
 These medications help thin or loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier for you to cough it up.The mucus becomes less sticky and your cough will become more productive.

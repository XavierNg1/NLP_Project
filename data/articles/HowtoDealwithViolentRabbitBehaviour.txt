 Rabbits are territorial animals. If you tend to keep your rabbit in its cage most of the time and you put your hands in it, your rabbit is likely to charge at you and protect it's territory. Let your rabbit out of its cage before you do any cleaning or anything else to it.;
, It's unfortunate, but after a few months of owning a rabbit, you may have lost interest in it. However, you have to spend at least an hour a day with your rabbit - without a strong bond, some rabbits can become violent due to neglect.
 Getting your rabbit "fixed" can help reduce aggression and bad behaviour.


Unspayed female rabbits have a 85% chance risk of getting reproductive cancer, especially if she is five years old or older.
Neutering a male rabbit will not only prolong his life, but also help eliminate hormone related fighting and aggression.
 There may be something causing your rabbit's violence:


Are there any other pets in the house? If you have rabbit predators, such as dogs or cats, your rabbit may feel uncomfortable. Keep an eye on your other pets to make sure your rabbit is safe from harm. If you have attempted bonding your rabbit with other pets and it didn't work, keep the animals well away from each other.

Loud noises. Chances are, if you live in busy environment with constant noise, your rabbit will become annoyed, as rabbits have sensitive hearing. Keep your rabbit in a peaceful environment so it can rest.
Getting picked up constantly. Rabbits generally prefer to be petted rather than picked up, and there are times when they want to be left alone. If your rabbit does not want to be picked up, it will struggle to try to break free. This can be harmful, as their powerful hind legs can result in back injury. Firmly hold your rabbit, support it's belly and hind legs, and then gently lower your rabbit to the ground.
Are you stressed? Rabbits can sense if something's wrong and will pick up on it. This will get it agitated. Reassure your rabbit by showing it affection.

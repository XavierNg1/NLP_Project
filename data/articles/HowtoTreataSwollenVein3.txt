You will probably also see visible swollen veins, particularly in your legs.
More severe symptoms include leg swelling, leg or calf pain after sitting or standing for long periods; color changes to the skin of the legs or ankles; dry, irritated, and scaly skin that cracks easily; skin sores that donâ€™t heal easily; and thickening and hardening of the skin in your legs and ankles.

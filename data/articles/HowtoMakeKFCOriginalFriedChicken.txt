 Beat the 2 or 3 eggs in a medium-large bowl—–you'll be dunking your chicken pieces in this. Add 2/3 cup (160 ml) milk, whisk to blend, and set aside;
, In a large bowl, mix the soup mix, Italian dressing, black pepper, and flour together.
 Take a piece of chicken and dip it into the batter. Then place it in the flour mixture and cover the chicken with it. Set the coated chicken aside.
 Continue coating each chicken piece until all portions are prepared.
 Heat the oil in a large skillet until it shimmers but doesn't smoke—about 350°F/175°C. Using tongs, carefully place the chicken pieces skin-side down into the skillet and fry them over medium heat. Leave the pieces in there for about 25 to 30 minutes, turning and flipping occasionally. Add chili peppers for a spicier flavor.


Don't add the chicken until the fat is hot, otherwise you'll end with greasy chicken.
 Remove the pieces from the skillet and drain the grease onto paper towels or a clean kitchen cloth (such as a tea towel).
 Serve with mashed potatoes, gravy, coleslaw, corn on the cob, homemade fries and a root beer for a real KFC-authentic meal.

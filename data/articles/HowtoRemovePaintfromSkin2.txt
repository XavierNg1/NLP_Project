 Create a thick lather on the skin, then rinse the lather away. This will remove some of the paint from your skin and make it easier for the oil to get in and lift the paint away.
 Simply coat the affected area in the oil and let it sit before scrubbing. You can use a variety of oils as they all have the same cleaning properties. More likely than not, you'll want to use what you have around the house, including:









Vegetable
Coconut
Olive
Essential oils, such as lavender or rosemary

, Use a washcloth or your hands to rub the skin with oil. Rinse the skin to see if all the paint is removed, then add more oil if the skin is still stained.
 Mix equal parts salt and oil, then scrub the mixture onto the paint to remove it. Any oil will do. However, it is best to use the biggest grain of salt you can get, usually "course" or kosher salt will do, since that provides a better scrub.
 If you still can't get the paint off, turpentine oil will do the trick. Pour it onto a cloth or cotton ball, not directly onto your skin, then use it to scrub away the paint. However, make sure you use it in a well-ventilated area, and use as little as necessary for the cleaning. While certainly not fatal, the fumes from turpentine oil aren't great to inhale.









Rinse off the area with soap and water immediately after finishing.
 After rinsing your skin with warm water, you may want to shower to remove any unpleasant stickiness remaining.

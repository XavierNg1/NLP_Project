 You can do this in a food processor or in a blender. Pur√©e the frozen fruit 15 to 25 seconds at a time, occasionally scrapping the mixture towards the bottom of the food processor/blender with a rubber spatula.


Slice and freeze the banana and peaches the night before. You can also use canned frozen peaches, but this may affect the flavor., Here is where you can get really creative. Honey and peaches go great together, but if you are vegan, you may prefer agave nectar or maple syrup. You can also use any type of milk or cream, including: almond milk, coconut milk, cow's milk, half-and-half, or heavy whipping cream.
 From time to time, pause the food processor/blender, and use a rubber spatula to push any lumps or clumps down towards the bottom.
 At this point, the ice cream is ready to serve. It will be very soft. If you'd like something firmer, transfer the ice cream into a freezer-safe container, and freeze it for 1 hour.

 Layering is a key tip in pulling off street-style. Carefully chosen basics are powerful fashion staples because you can combine them in many different ways. A nice t-shirt or tank top may not be much on its own, but throw on a nice blazer or cardigan and you'll be getting somewhere. Remember: casual chic is about being relaxed but still stylish, and layering allows you to feel comfortable but still mix and match unique styles.


1-2 nice, light jackets can allow you to wear your t-shirts out to many occasions and still look good.;
, Blacks, grays, whites, and tans are your friends here â€“ they can be easily mixed and matched with other colors and accessories. Casual chic isn't so much about making an eye-popping statement as it is about looking relaxed and comfortable with your style. Using muted or neutral colors as your base opens you up for bigger splashes of color down the road.
 While you don't want to wear your old lacrosse warm-up shirt, a few nice graphic tees are essential to casual chic. Make sure they don't have any stains, that they fit you well, and that they haven't become discolored with age. Tees can be easily mixed and matched with other pieces, and the logos or designs can be tailored to fit your interests.
 Not only does this allow you to look casual chic all year, it gives you the chance to personalize and "upgrade" your tees and tanks quickly and easily.


A sweater, usually bigger or baggier is better.
A denim shirt/jacket
A flannel shirt
A form-fitting blazer in white or gray.
2-3 cardigans in various colors.
 Button ups are great because they look dressed-up, but can still be worn completely casually. Try to find one that fits your well and open up the top 1-2 buttons. You can leave it untucked with a nice pair of jeans and touch it up with an accessory or two for effortless casual chic.

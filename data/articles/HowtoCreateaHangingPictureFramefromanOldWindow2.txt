Consider the overall theme with the project. Do you hope to display photos your child through the years or focus on a recent trip overseas? Know the photo theme and how it plays on the window style.
Take the room into consideration. You may not want to hang intimate family portraits in the living room so consider the location destination.
 You may not want just straight photos but instead something with more of an edge.


Try black and white photos for extra drama. Or you can add a splash of color on the black and white photos for a color pop.
Use a computer photo program to change or enhance the photos. Try creating a watercolor look or a pencil drawing from your photos for your project.
Alternate between color and black and white photos. Some photos in your window could be color whereas others could still be black and white-there are no hard and fast rules so tap into your creativity and have fun.

 Introduce your dog to some quiet, calm children. Only let your dog interact with one child at a time at first. Ask each child to sit quietly so your dog can approach them. Praise your dog when it approaches the child and reward it for any positive interactions.Don’t push your dog to interact with children at any stage during these introductions.
This is especially effective when dogs are young, so they get used to children.;
, Take walks near parks or schools where children are playing. Stay a safe distance away from areas with children at first. Gradually move closer to the areas with kids. If your dog doesn’t exhibit any signs of fear, try sitting on a bench or the ground near playgrounds and letting your dog absorb the sounds of children playing and smell them.Reward your dog when it is calm and relaxed in an area near children at play.
 If children will be around your dog, ask them not to pay attention to your dog. Also tell them to act quietly and calmly. Strongly discourage any screaming, yelling, running, or other loud noises., Encourage children who are helping socialize your dog to give it treats. Demonstrate giving treats with your hand down, palm up, fingers together. Tell children not to force any treats on the dog.

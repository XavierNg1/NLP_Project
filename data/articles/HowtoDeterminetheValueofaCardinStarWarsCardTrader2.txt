 Locate the app on your device. The app icon has the Star Wars logo on it with some cards in the background. Tap on it.
 Tap the exchanging cards icon on the middle part of the bottom toolbar. You will be brought to the screen with your trades. Tap on the title on the header toolbar to see a drop-down list of filters. Tap “Pending Trades” from here, and all your open and active trades will be displayed, with the most recent ones at the top. Swipe down to see more trades.
 Each trade can be studied and analyzed based from the data provided. You can see your trade partner’s username, the current status of the trade, the cards being traded, and some action buttons at the bottom.
 The cards you’re getting from the trade are located on the left box, and the cards you’re giving are on the right box. Tap on a card to open it. The card will be maximized on your screen so you can see it better. You are looking at the front side of the card.
 Tap on the card to flip it over so you can see the back side.
 A good gauge for your card’s value is the card count. This is the number of cards available for the exact same card. The lower the number, the fewer cards there are, the rarer it is. A card with a 1,000 count is rarer than a card with 5,000 count. Find this number on the lower left corner of the rear of the card.
 By looking at the card counts of all the cards being traded, you can assess if the trade makes sense for you. You will be able to tell if you are being fair, under-trading, or over-trading. Do this every time you receive a trade proposal.

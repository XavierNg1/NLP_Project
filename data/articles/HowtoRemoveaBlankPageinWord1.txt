 In many cases, blank pages in a Word document result from extra added paragraphs or page breaks. To find out if this is what’s causing you trouble, you should enable format markers in Word.;
, Now you will see paragraph markers (¶) at the beginning of each blank line, as well as at the end of existing paragraphs. You may also see lines that say “Page Break.”, If you see a ¶ or a line that says “Page Break” on the blank page, you’ll need to delete it.
 If you see both (or more than one of each), highlight it all at once.
 This should delete all the ¶ marks and page breaks. You may need to hit Delete a few more times to delete the entire page.


If there’s a paragraph mark that you cannot delete, it’s likely at the end of a table.See Removing a Blank Page at the End of a Table.
 Now you can make those markers invisible again. Click the ¶ icon or use one of these keyboard shortcuts:


Windows: Ctrl+⇧ Shift+8

Mac: ⌘ Cmd+8

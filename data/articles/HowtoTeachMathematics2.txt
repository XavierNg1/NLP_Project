 After introducing a concept to the class, you should allow some time for each student to practice. This practice may be done alone as individual work, or you might set up students in working pairs or groups. As students work in class, you can move among them to check their progress. Allow them the opportunity to struggle a bit. When you see that students are having real difficulty grasping a topic, then you can step in and redirect them., Students can learn new material during class time, but then you should assign homework problems to emphasize that learning. The homework should repeat the material learned in class and give students the chance to practice what they learned. You should give homework problems that are challenging enough to stretch all students but not so difficult that anyone will give up., Students need to be engaged in the homework they do. If they begin to believe that homework is not valuable, they will not learn as effectively from it.Using a few key problems to emphasize a point and understand students’ learning will be more effective than many repetitive exercises.

Individualize the homework. Gauge students’ level of understanding and assign homework for the students who most need the practice.
 Students should expect that their homework will “count.” They should also see that you value their results. An effective use of homework is to start each class period with a quick group review. You can ask students to provide their answers, either orally or on the chalkboard and then solicit feedback from other students. This provides you, as the teacher, with immediate feedback as to which students understand the concept and which are still having difficulty. At the same time, the students will see immediately that completing their homework assignments has an effect on their classwork.

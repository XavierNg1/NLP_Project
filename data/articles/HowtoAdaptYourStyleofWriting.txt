 Especially, for something different. If you normally write wikiHow computers 'live', then try breaking out the old pen and paper and doing it differently.;
, Why would they want to read your article versus the myriad of other sites and articles out there. Give them a reason.
 When writing for wikiHow, the desired format is a 'how to, step-by-step' process. Maybe if you want to switch over to blogging, you might want to make it more personal...from you to your readers.


If you have a basic format to follow, that is one less thought process you have to put into your writing. It's already taken care of.
 Really, regardless of what you are writing, that is a good idea. If you are 'all over the map', your readers will lose interest.
 You are not trying to get a good grade, but to get your message across.
 Always keep in mind which format or media you are using.
 After you have done writing and you think you are finished. Check it over. Your 'other' style of writing may have bled over.
 Sometimes, what we see, is not what it is.

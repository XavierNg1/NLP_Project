 After your surgery, you are at risk of postoperative delirium. Postoperative delirium is a sudden confusion and change in mental state. This may cause you to be agitated, sleepy, aggressive, or inactive.To help with this, you should ask a caregiver or trusted family member or friend to be by your bedside. Having a person there can help reduce the symptoms of delirium., Not getting enough sleep or quality sleep can also contribute to delirium. You should discuss with your doctor the best protocol for getting sleep after your operation. Sleeping without sleep aids like pills can help decrease your risk of delirium.You should also try to practice good sleep hygiene. For example, try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day. Sleep in a room with few distractions, like light and television. Try to sleep at least seven hours if possible.
 Stress can lead to delirium. You should be placed in a calm environment. Even if you are in the hospital, the area should be free from loud noises and too much activity. The amount of people coming in and out should be limited until you are not delirious.You should have limited devices restraining you. If possible, all cords and machines should be removed from you and your body.
You should be surrounded with familiar and comforting objects. This might include photographs, pillows, blankets, or knickknacks.
Calendars and clocks should be placed so you can find them and orient yourself. This helps keep you calm so you are reminded where you are and when it is.

 Just over 1/2 teaspoon of iodized table salt throughout the day will provide adults with 100% of the recommended daily amount of iodine.
 If you dislike adding salt to your food, a single sheet of seaweed (for sushi or soup) or 3 ounces of cod, fish sticks, tuna, or shrimp can provide between 10% and 66% of your daily necessary intake of iodine. In some cases, seaweed can even contain incredibly large doses of iodine (up to 2000% or your daily need).
 Many cereals, breads, and other grains are enriched with iodine. A cup of enriched pasta and 2 slices of bread can together provide up to 50% of your daily iodine needs.
 Milk, eggs, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt can all be significant sources for dietary iodine.

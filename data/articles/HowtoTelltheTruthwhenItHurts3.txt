 It’s important not to rush the initial conversation. You may need to make time for more than one talk. If you feel like the conversation has reached a standstill, call it quits for the day and give you and your partner a few days or a week to process before talking again.


Try saying something like, “I think we have talked enough for now. Let’s resume this conversation in a few days.”

, Once you’ve had a few talks, be sure that both people know what the conclusions and expectations are. Don’t leave things up in the air, otherwise somebody is bound to get upset all over again. Agree on a resolution and stick to it.Try saying something like, “So we are in agreement then? The next time ____ happens, we will both ____.”

, If you just can’t seem to come to a consensus on your own, try seeking out advice from a professional. Speaking with a counselor, attending a group therapy session, or even finding a trusted friend to mediate can shed new light on the issue at hand.Try saying something to your friend like, “I think we would benefit from meeting with an objective third party. Would you be willing to talk this over with me at a counselor’s office?”

 One of the most important way to change your attitude and become a better, more popular person is to have confidence in yourself.


Confidence is so important -- it allows you to get involved with things at school, make new friends and take more risks. It makes you feel good about yourself and reminds you that your opinion matters and your voice should be heard.
However, gaining confidence is not the easiest thing in the world if you're a naturally shy person -- so fake it til you make it! Push yourself to get out there more and soon the confidence will come.
Giving your appearance a makeover (like in the section above) will also help you to feel good about yourself and gain confidence.
 Being compassionate for others is another important attitude trait, especially in school where it can be easy to get carried away and unintentionally hurt another person's feelings.


Make an effort to think about what you're about to say before you open your mouth. Try to imagine being in the other person's place and how you would you feel if someone said something unkind or inconsiderate to you?
However, being compassionate extends beyond words -- you should also be compassionate in your actions. If someone's sitting alone at lunch, ask them to join your group. If someone drops their books in the hallway, help them to pick them up. Treat others as you would like to be treated.
 No one wants to be around a sad, lonely person, so brighten up a bit and you'll find it much easier to make new friends!


Try to smile more -- studies have shown that smiling makes you both more attractive and more approachable to other people -- so flash those pearly whites. The more you smile, the more you'll see people smiling back at you.
Try to get involved in things you enjoy and that will make you feel happier overall. Join a karate club, take an acting class or do some volunteer work -- whatever floats your boat. You'll feel much happier and fulfilled as a result, and other people will notice

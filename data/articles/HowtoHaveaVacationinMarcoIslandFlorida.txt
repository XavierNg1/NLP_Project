 Marco Island boasts a tropical climate that's generally ideal for vacations all year long, with hot, humid summers and dry, mild winters. The peak season is roughly May-October (when most hotels will be booked and tourists descend onto the island), and the off-season is roughly November-April (when less crowds are present and bargains abound).;
, While there are plenty of nice hotels to choose from, you can often get better deals renting a condo or even a fully-equipped vacation home with a private pool. If you don't or can't find somewhere to stay in Marco Island that meets your needs, consider looking slightly further up the coast for lodging in Naples.
 The white-sand beaches of Marco Island are gorgeous, and the sunset views are incredible. You can also:


Go swimming in the calm Gulf waters
Look for seashells (there are plenty)
Rent a charter boat and go fishing, ask your captain to filet your fish, and then take your catch to the Snook Inn and they will personally cook it to your liking
Explore the many smaller islands and sandbars
Go on a dolphin-spotting cruise

, While Marco Island isn't renown for its nightlife by any means (there is a noise ordinance in effect at night, and most venues close before midnight), you can go to one or more of the several bars. Some places worth checking out are La Casita with live entertainment on the weekends, and Vandys With An Edge that is a sports bar with TVs in every booth.
 If you like to walk in the morning, check out Tigertail Beach, which is the best spot to find shells and sand dollars. The front of the Marriott Hotel is a good place for tourists to visit; there is a walk-up bar, and at night there is sometimes entertainment nearby on the beach. South Beach is where all of the locals go. When you get tired of the beach, you can go to plentiful shops. Once you get on South Collier, go towards the Marriott and there are many shops, stores and places to eat. There is even a movie theater with the latest releases.

 While the adoption process is often one of triumph and success for parents—culminating in bringing home the adopted child—for the child itself, the process can be much more emotionally complex. Adoption tears children from the life they’ve known until that point, and a celebration of Gotcha Day may primarily remind children of being taken from their family and former life.If your child has primarily negative feelings associated with the adoptive process, consider forgoing a Gotcha Day celebration altogether.
 “Gotcha” implies that the adopted child was snatched from their original home, or taken in like a prize. It also focuses on the happiness of the parents and their successful obtaining of a child, and can even have the effect of making the child him or herself feel left out of the celebration.To remedy this, some families have changed the name to “Family Day,” “Adoption Day,” or “Family Anniversary Day.”

, Gotcha Day—and adoption celebrations in general—can have an unfortunate tendency to focus on the parents and can over-emphasize the sacrifices parents have made to bring adopted children home. To remedy this, rather than focusing on the parents, focus on the unified family and the special place held by the adopted child.If your child is old enough, ask them if they’re comfortable with celebrating Gotcha Day. It could be the case the celebration only reminds the child of being taken from their birth parents.
Make sure that your child feels comfortable with whatever level of celebration you choose to have, or forego a celebration altogether.

 Theses damping materials absorb sound waves, eliminate resonance, and diminish vibrations.


Damping mats: These are simple to install damping materials and are used to cover panels in your car to help with sound deadening. They are typically made of either stryene-butyadine rubber or asphaltic panes with adhesive backing and either lower the resonant frequency of the panel, or transform the sound vibrations into heat depending on the damping material used in your particular mats.
Sprays: These come in either professional cans requiring compressors and paint guns for application or easy to use aerosol cans. Sprays are used in situations where matting would be too bulky to fit or the weight of the matting would be too heavy such as door panels or kick panels.
Foams: Foams come in either sheet or spray form. The foam sheets are used just as the damping mats are by laying them over car panels to absorb vibration. Instead of converting the vibrations to heat, as the mats do, the foam sheets dispersing the energy throughout the sheet.
Insulation: This damping material is a thick pane of fibers that absorb sound and is laid underneath the carpet. The most typical type of insulation is jute or micro jute. Although insulation is less effective in regard to sound deadening, is does add thermal insulation to the interior of your car as well as creates a plusher carpet

, This will help with the panel's tendency to vibrate causing unwanted noise.
, The mats contain metal foil backing in order to increase the mat's heat resistance making them able to be near the heat of the engine. Apply them using a contact adhesion glue found at your local auto shop.

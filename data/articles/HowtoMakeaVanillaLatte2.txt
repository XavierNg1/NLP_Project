 If you don't like instant coffee or instant espresso, brew some espresso-blend coffee in your coffee maker instead. Use twice the amount of grinds you'd normally use., This will make 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of "espresso.", How much vanilla you use is up to you. Start with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) if this is your first time making a latte, then add more as needed., The jar needs to be large enough so that it's only halfway filled after you add the milk. You will need the extra space for the foam., You will see some foamy bubbles appear in the milk. Your foam is not quite ready to use yet, however; you still need to "stabilize" it.

You can also use a hand frother instead. Fill the frother with milk, and microwave it (lidless) for 30 seconds. Put the lid back on the frother, and pump it until the milk starts to foam. Scoop the foam onto the latte immediately., The heat will help solidify the foam.Do not microwave the jar with the lid on, or you may ruin your microwave., Hold the jar with an oven mitt or a potholder to protect your hand. Place a spoon inside the mouth of the jar, with the edge resting against the rim. Carefully pour the milk into the mug., Work quickly, as the foam will dissolve fast., Add a sprinkle of some cinnamon or cocoa powder on top of the foam. For something sweeter and fancier, add a drizzle of caramel or chocolate syrup instead.

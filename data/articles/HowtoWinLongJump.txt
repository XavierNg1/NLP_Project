, Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and fall forward. The leg which you catch yourself with is your take off leg. Repeat this 3 or more times to make sure it is correct.
 The board should have a normal white plank with a thinner strip of wooden material. Line the back of your foot up with the wooden strip so you are close but not touching it. This board should be just before the sand pit. Run back up the track and count either 13,15 or 17 strides. Run through and get someone else to put a mark down.
 Run through as if you were going to jump at the end, and get someone to see where your foot was on the plank. If it was on/touching the wooden part, then it would be a no jump. If this happens, then you will have to adjust the marker until you get on the board perfectly. Don't jump when you are running through.
 Run as fast as you can, exactly as you did before when you were running through the jump, because speed will carry you further. Don't look at the board or think about it. Look as far as you can into the distance, not downward. This will help you jump further, too.Fling your arms up as high as you can, and bring your legs forward, when you hit the board.Try to throw yourself into the jump so that you get enough momentum to jump without falling backwards or putting your hands behind you.
 Land with your legs bent and in front of you and reaching for your toes. The judges will measure to the furthest point in "back" of your landing, made in the sand; so, fall forward.
 Always remember to walk out the side or front of the long jump pit.

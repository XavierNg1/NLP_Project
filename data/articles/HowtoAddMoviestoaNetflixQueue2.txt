 If you have not already downloaded it on your device, then do so.
 If your Netflix account has multiple profiles, make sure to click your own when the "Who's watching?" screen comes up.
 If you have a specific title in mind, click on "search" in the upper right hand part of the screen and type in what you are looking for. If you don't have a specific title in mind, browse through all that Netflix has to offer using whichever means you wish. Once you have located which title you want to add to your queue, proceed to the next step.
 A small menu will open up showing information about the movie/TV show. On the right of the menu, there will be a box with the words "Add to My List."

, If the title has been successfully added to your queue, the "Add to My List" button will change to read "Remove From My List," and you will be able to locate it in your queue.

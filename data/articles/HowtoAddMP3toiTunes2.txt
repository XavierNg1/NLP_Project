 When you select "Add File," you can add one or multiple files from a single folder. If you select "Add Folder," you can select one or multiple folders from a single location.
 Use the file browser to navigate to the files or folders you want to add to your library. You can hold Ctrl and click multiple items to select them all, but your selection has to be from the same location.


When you add a folder, all of the music in any subfolders will be added as well.
 These items will be added to your iTunes music library.
 The button has a musical note on it. This will open the Music section of the iTunes program.
 This will display the music that is in your iTunes library, including the music that you just added.


You can also click the "Playlists" tab and select the "Recently added" playlist to view all of your new music.
 You can also add your music files to iTunes by dragging and dropping files and folders into the iTunes window:


Open the folder containing the files you want to add to i-tunes.
Open the "My Music" tab in iTunes.
Drag and drop the files you want to add into the iTunes window. This will immediately add them to your library.

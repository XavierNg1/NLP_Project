 This also applies to the posts and rails that will form part of the fence. It is much easier to paint etc. before you attach the palings.;
, You will need to space the palings or pickets as described below.
 This will form the line along which you will nail the palings to the fence rail.
 Use galvanized flathead nails, two nails per joint; if you need better grip, try angle nails.
 Use a block of wood to space palings or pickets to provide consistent spacing between each one.
 Be sure to keep it straight and consistent across all the palings. Cut the palings at this height, moving along the chalk line. Most pickets do not need to be cut as they already have their typical triangular shape in place (see image above).

 Start in a standing position, arms hanging at your sides, holding one dumbbell in each hand. Lift your arms straight out from your sides until they are parallel to the floor. Bend your elbow, slightly, and tilt your hands forward as if you are pouring a drink. Hold the dumbbells at arms' length for a moment. Then, slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.Exhale when your arms reach the apex of the lift. Then, inhale slowly as you bring your arms back down.
 Try 1-2 sets of 10-12 reps, or 4 sets of 6-10 reps, Give yourself 60-75 seconds to rest between each set. Make sure to lift at a steady pace: one second with your arms down, and two seconds with your arms up.You might want to try doing some article circles or shrugs in between each set.
 Keep your back steady and straight throughout each set. Bend your knees very slightly, and keep your weight centered through your spine. Make sure that your elbows are somewhat bent, but not so much that you remove the pressure from your shoulders.


Be careful. Keep your arms straight, and do not overdo the number of reps. It is easy to injure your shoulders with this workout.
The routine is best performed while standing, although you can also sit on a bench. Make sure that you can keep your back straight.

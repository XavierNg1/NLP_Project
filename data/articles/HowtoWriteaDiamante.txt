 Start off with either a noun or a pronoun, like "Home" and let the first word describe what you want to talk about for the next two or three lines.
 If your diamante started off with "Home," you might choose two adjectives like "safe" and "warm." These adjectives describe feelings associated with home.
 Participles are verbs that end in -ing, like "relaxing," "sleeping," and "playing."

, You can do the fourth line of a diamante in two different ways:


Four nouns: "security," "food," "comfort," and "repairs."
A phrase or two that's longer than the next biggest line: "There's no place like home."

, Choose whether you want your diamante to be a synonym or an antonym poem. A "synonym" means another word meaning the same thing. An "antonym" means another word meaning the opposite of the word.


Synonym participles: "living," "breathing," "being."
Antonym participles: "bustling," "grating," "tiring."

, Again, if your diamante is going to be an antonym poem, you want to choose adjectives that describe the opposite of the first word. Adjectives like "stressful" and "sleepless" might work.
 If you were writing an antonym diamante and started off with "home," your last word might be "city."

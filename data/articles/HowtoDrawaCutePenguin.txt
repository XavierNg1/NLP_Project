 For the head, draw a circle. For the body, draw a cylinder that meets with the circle.;
, Draw 2 triangles on the sides of the body for the penguin's wings. Add a little triangle on the face for the penguin's beak.
 Eyes always look cute when drawn large; use large ovals to make the eye, eyelid and pupil. Shade in the pupil shape. Add half circles that encompass the oval eyes; these give a definition and depth to the eyes, while adding cuteness to the penguin's face.
 Use little half circles that look like halved pebbles for the feet. Then draw the tail. For a final flourish, add a bow tie.
 See the image for details. Erase the draft lines.
 Black and white for the penguin, with a flourish of color for the bow tie, eyes and feet. Now you're finished––one cute penguin.

 Taking a refreshing bath at least once a day may be helpful for relieving skin itchiness and irritation. However, make sure the water you use is merely warm rather than hot, as hot water can dry your skin out further, thus causing more irritation and itchiness., Stick to soaps that are hypoallergenic, as these are especially designed for sensitive skin. Artificially fragrant soaps may cause your skin to become irritated.
 Fill your bath-tub with warm water. Instead of using soap, simply add one half to one full cup of baking soda and a half or full cup of cornstarch to your prepared bath. Baking soda and cornstarch baths decrease itching and will dry your skin less than soap will.


You can add bath salts (Epsom or sea salt) to enhance your bath experience.
Soak in the bath for at least 15 to 20 minutes, unless told otherwise by your doctor.
Between baths, use cold compresses to apply pressure to itchy sites.
 Dry your skin thoroughly and apply one of the lotions discussed in the previous step to help keep your skin itch-free in between baths.

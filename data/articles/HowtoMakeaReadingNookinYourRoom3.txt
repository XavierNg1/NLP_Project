 Install 1x4 pine wood as paneling ¾ of the way up the wall. On the right side of the closet, use two of those 1x4 wood pieces install them on the right side of the closet as two floating shelves. Attach the wood to the closet with power grab adhesive glue or finishing nails., Paint the remaining ¼ above the paneled section with the color of your choice. Stain the wood with wood stain to preserve it and give it more of a polished look. Paint the shelves, borders, and bench white., Place a cushion, a warm throw, and throw pillows on the bench for comfort inside your nook. Put some books up to line the shelves you’ve installed and some books in a couple of wicker baskets for decoration.For children’s nooks, consider using different toys to help you decorate the space. Include stuffed animals, toy cars, a flashlight, etc.Create themes centered around favorite novels to add to the reading theme.

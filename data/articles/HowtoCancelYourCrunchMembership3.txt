 In order to cancel your Crunch membership, you will need to state a reason for cancelling. If you cannot think of a reason immediately, such as moving to a new city, it may be worthwhile to briefly review your reasons for cancelling the membership. Think about how often you go, the gym itself, the people who go there, and the costs of membership., If you haven’t been to the gym in months, it may be time to cancel your membership. Holding onto the membership is not going to make you more fit. Perhaps you need to try a different form of exercise, such as running, hiking or walking., Consider whether the gym is kept clean, as well as whether it is crowded or relatively quiet. If your gym is too crowded, dirty, noisy or otherwise not right for you, you may want to cancel your membership., Consider whether you feel welcomed by staff members and personal trainers. You should also think about whether your people go there, such as friends, colleagues or just people you can relate to. If you feel put off by staff or personal trainers or just feel like you can’t relate to anybody at the gym, perhaps you should cancel your membership., If the classes at your local gym don’t fit your current family or social schedule anymore, the membership may not longer be worthwhile. You could look for a boutique or smaller gym that offers more classes., If the equipment at your gym is never fixed in a timely manner, you may want to find a new gym. Typically, gyms can order equipment online and get repair people in a fairly timely manner, so there is no excuse for gym equipment to go unfixed for more than a few days., If your gym feels too small or claustrophobic, you may want to find a new place to workout. A gym should have lots of room to move around, or pull and push weights without worrying about bumping into other people. If the machines are positioned too closely to one another or there is little floorspace, you may want to find another gym.

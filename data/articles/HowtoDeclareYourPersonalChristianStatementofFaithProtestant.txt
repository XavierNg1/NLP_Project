 Decide and state that the Holy Bible is the only accurate Bible and authoritative Word of God. It alone is the final authority in determining all doctrinal truths (for example: not traditions or other writings). In its original writing, it is inspired, infallible and inerrant (See: II Timothy 3:16; II Peter 1:20-21; Proverbs 30:5; Romans 16:25-26).;
, Outline that God is eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit. These three are coequal and co-eternal (See: I John 5:7; Genesis 1:26; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; Hebrews 3:7-11).
 Believe and present Jesus Christ as God the Son (the second person of the Trinity). On earth, Jesus was both 100% God and 100% man. Filled with The Holy Spirit beyond limit, He is the only man ever to have lived a sinless life. He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross for mankind and thus, took the punishment for our sins through the shedding of His blood. He rose from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures, ascended to the right hand of the Father, and will return again in power and glory. (See: John 1:1,14, 20:28; I Timothy 3:16; Isaiah 9:6; Philippians 2:5-6; I Timothy 2:5).
 Proclaim that Jesus Christ was conceived by God the Father, through the Holy Spirit (the third person of the Trinity) in the virgin Mary's womb; therefore, He is the Son of God (See: Matthew 1:18, 25; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 7:14; Luke 1:27-35).
 Realize that man was created good and upright, but by voluntary transgression he fell from grace (and each of us have sinned) so that: ones only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God (See: Genesis 1:26-31, 3:1-7; Romans 5:12-21).
 Knowing God by being regenerated by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential (See: John 6:44, 65; Matthew 19:28; Titus 3:5).
 Be saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ by His death, burial, and resurrection, as salvation is a gift from God, not a result of any of your good works or of any other human efforts, but so that you then "do work preordained that you should do" (Ephesians 2:8-10; Galatians 2:16, 3:8; Titus 3:5; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31; Hebrews 9:22).
 Make your own commitment to change your mind, being willing to turn around, in all areas of life, to follow Christ, which allows anyone, who will repent, to receive His redemption, and be regenerated by receiving His Holy Spirit. Thus, through true repentance we receive forgiveness of sin and appropriate salvation (See: Acts 2:21, 3:19; I John 1:9).
 Continue in the ongoing process of yielding to God’s Word and His Spirit in order to complete the development of Christ's character in you. It is through the present ministry of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God that the Christian is enabled to live a Godly life in Christ Jesus (See: I Thessalonians 4:3, 5:23; II Corinthians 3:18, 6:14-18, II Thessalonians 2:1-3, Romans 8:29, 12:1-2, Hebrews 2:11).
 Accept and know that the sinless blood that Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary was in payment, for redemption, for all time -- for all who receive Him -- able to end all use of blood sacrifice, as it is 100% sufficient to cleanse all mankind of all sin. Jesus allowed Himself to be punished for both your sinfulness and your sins, enabling all those who believe to be free from the penalty of unforgiven sin, which is death (See: I John 1:7; Revelation 1:5, 5:9; Colossians 1:20; Romans 3:10-12, 23, 5:9; John 1:29).
 Realize that Christians are people who have invited the Lord Jesus Christ to come and live inside them or 'dwell' within them by His Holy Spirit so that each believer will: relinquish the sovereign authority of ones life over to Him in truth thus making Jesus the Lord (King and Leader) of ones life as well as Savior. Each believer puts ones trust in what Jesus accomplished for each of them when He died, was buried, and rose again from the dead (See: John 1:12; John 14:17, 23; John 15:4; Romans 8:11; Revelation 3:20).
 Receive the promise of Pentecost; it is the promise of the Father, sent by Jesus after His Ascension, to abide with each and all believers, forever, to empower the Church to preach the Gospel throughout the whole earth (See: Joel 2:28-29; Matthew 3:11; Mark 16:17; Acts 1:5,2:1-4, 17, 38-39, 8:14-17, 10:38, 44-47, 11:15-17, 19:1-6).
 Desire The Holy Spirit being manifested in your daily life through a variety of spiritual gifts to build and to sanctify the church, to demonstrate the validity of the resurrection, to be able to conform to God's plan, and confirm the power of the Gospel of Christ Jesus. The Bible lists of these gifts are not necessarily exhaustive, and the gifts may occur in various combinations. All believers are commanded to earnestly desire the manifestation of the gifts in their lives. These gifts always operate in harmony with the Scriptures and should never be used in violation of Biblical parameters. (See: Hebrews 2:4; Romans 1:11, 12 :4-8; Ephesians 4:16; I Timothy 4:14; II Timothy 1:6-7; I Corinthians 12:1-31, 14:1-40; I Peter 4:10).
 Agree with believers that The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through His Spirit, with divine appointments for the fulfillment of Jesus' Great Commission. Every person who is born of the Spirit is an integral part of the church as a member of the body of believers. There is a spiritual unity of all believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. (See: Ephesians 1:22, 2:19-22; Hebrews 12:23; John 17:11, 20-23).



Follow Jesus in "Water Baptism": Profess faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, then the new convert is commanded by the Word of God to be baptized in water in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (See: Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; Mark 16:16; Acts 8:12, 36-38; 10:47-48).







Take "The Lord's Supper": Partake as a believer in a unique time of communion in the presence of God when the elements of bread and grape juice (the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ) are taken in remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross (See: Matthew 26:26-29; I Corinthians 10:16, 11:23-25).
 Being always in prayer--in everything: give thanks for His favor and the unlimited power of agreeing together upon God's promises.There is much to be achieved through the power of agreement and shared burden in your field of endeavor, especially as Jesus said, "If two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in Heaven." (See: Matthew 18:19) Pray for one another:


General prayer requests
Salvation for yourself
Salvation for a loved one
Finances/Work/School
Family/Friends/Enemies
Emotions/Concerns/Sexual problems/Disorders
Drugs/Alcohol/Habits/Addictions
Healing:

Pray for healing of the sick, thanking God that He has already provided it, giving Him the praise: expect to see examples of His healing power, as were illustrated in the life and ministry of Jesus, and included in the commission of Jesus to all His disciples, to as many as He shall call. This blessing of divine healing is given as a sign, which is to "follow believers". It is also a part of Jesus' completed work on the Cross and is one of the gifts of the Spirit. (See: Psalm 103:2-3; Isaiah 53:5; Matthew 8:16-17; Mark 16:17-18; Acts 8:6-7; James 5:14-16; I Corinthians 12:9, 28; Romans 11:29).
 Study and pro-actively seek the Father's will for believers to become whole, healthy and successful in all areas of life realizing that God will deny you no good thing! Love one another as Christ has loved the church, preferring one another, seeking not only your own, but serving in all things, as possible. But because of the fall, many may not receive the full benefits of God’s will while on Earth, as men may, if they wish, deny God and hinder you in some instances from some good already provided for you, if they can. That fact, though, should never prevent all believers from seeking the full benefits of Christ’s provision in order to better serve others, in many areas included in:


Spiritual (John 3:3-11; II Corinthians 5:17-21; Romans 10:9-10).
Mental and Emotional (II Timothy 1:7, 2:11; Philippians 4:7-8; Romans 12:2; Isaiah 26:3).
Physical (Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:17; I Peter 2:24).
Financial (Joshua 1:8; Malachi 3:10-11; Luke 6:38; II Corinthians 9:6-10; Deuteronomy 28:1-14; Psalm 34:10, 84:11; Philippians 4:19).
 Realize and receive Jesus Christ as physically resurrected from the dead in a glorified body three days after His death on the cross. In addition, both the saved and the lost will be resurrected; they that are saved to the resurrection of life, and they that are lost to the resurrection of eternal damnation (See: Luke 24:16, 36, 39; John 2:19-21, 20:26-28, 21:4; Acts 24:15; I Corinthians 15:42, 44; Philippians 1:21-23, 3:21).
 The eternal dwelling place for all believers after passing from death in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is called Heaven.(See: Matthew 5:3, 12, 20, 6:20, 19:21, 25:34; John 17:24; II Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 11:16; I Peter 1:4).
 Live your one life on earth for God in Christ, because the unbelievers will receive supreme justice, judged by the one merciful Judge, God, and sent to Hell, if they have not received and proclaimed His will on Earth, to then receive just punishment with the Devil and his Fallen Angels by eternal separation in darkness (See: Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:43-48; Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 14:9-11, 20:12-15, 21:8).
 Proclaim that Jesus Christ will physically and visibly return to earth for the second time to establish His Kingdom. This will occur at a date undisclosed by the Scriptures (See: Ephesians 2:10, Matthew 24:30, 26:63-64; Acts 1:9-11; I Thessalonians 4:15-17; II Thessalonians 1:7-8; Revelation 1:7).

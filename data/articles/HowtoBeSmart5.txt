 Apart from being a linguistic exercise, it may bring you into contact with new people and ideas. You may feel less of a stranger when you visit a place and you know some of the language. Also, at some point you will realize that there are some phrases or concepts in other languages that have no direct translation in English! This can be a challenging and fun exercise for the mind. (Note, try to be patient and positive when studying a language as it may take time to reach the level you desire.)

, Try to visit other countries too. Visiting cities in your country or in a different one gives you an open mind and teaches you about the universe. You will be able to understand other cultures (how people live in a different place, how they behave with each other). You will also be able to understand that there is so much to see and do anywhere. You will be fascinated on how there are so many different people and cultures in the world. That will make you smart and interesting.
 Just because you're great at one thing doesn't mean you have to stick to it! Find ways to step out of your comfort zone. This is where the learning happens.

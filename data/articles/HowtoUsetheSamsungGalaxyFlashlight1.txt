 While there are some minor interface changes between these two models, activating the Flashlight function is fundamentally the same. You can unlock your Galaxy S6/S7 by clicking the "Lock" button on the right side of your phone to wake up the phone's screen, then swiping your screen up or to the right.

You'll need to enter your passcode (if you have one) after tapping the Lock button. You can also use a fingerprint scan to unlock your phone.;
, This should open the "Shortcuts" bar, which contains several quick-access icons such as "WiFi" and "Location".You can also do this on the S7 Edge tablet.Swiping down with two fingers will show the entire "Shortcuts" menu, thereby eliminating the need to swipe., This should scroll through your Shortcut menu; the flashlight function is located here.

If you swiped down with two fingers, you should see the Flashlight option on your screen, near the middle of the menu.
 This will turn on your Samsung's flashlight! To disable the flashlight, tap this option again.

This may also be called "Torch" on your S7.
You can add the flashlight function to the first page of the Shortcuts bar by swiping down with two fingers, tapping the "Edit" button in the top right corner, and then tapping and dragging the "Flashlight" icon up to the main Shortcut bar.

For example, when you multiply 1/2 and 1/3, you will get 1/6 (1 times 1 over 2 times 3). It's not necessary to find a common denominator when multiplying. Reduce or convert the result if you can.



For example, if you want to divide 1/2 by 1/3, first rewrite the equation so the second fraction is 3/1. Multiply 1/2 by 3/1. The result will be 3/2. Reduce the fraction or convert it to a compound fraction if you can.

 Many IPAs are high in alcohol, which can be a problem if you plan on drinking your IPAs over the course of an evening and do not want to get too intoxicated. Some IPAs have 6%, 7%, or even 8% alcohol by volume!Check the label or ask about the ABV before you decide to buy or try an IPA. If it is higher than you want it to be, then try something else.


To check the alcohol content of the IPAs you are considering, look for the ABV on the label followed by a number and a percentage. A higher number means that it is a more alcoholic beer.
Try to find one that is at or below 5% if you want something you can drink over the course of an evening. These are called session IPAs., Some IPAs can be expensive, especially if they have a special ingredient or a high ABV. Consider how much you are willing to pay for a six pack of IPAs and check the price on the product you are considering.


Keep in mind that craft beers can be a little pricey. Expect to pay around $8 to $10 for a six pack of IPA.
 If you are into pairing your beer choices with food, then think about what meals you might want to have with your IPA. There are several different types of foods that pair well with IPAs including:Spicy foods, like curries, Thai food, or Mexican food.
Deep fried foods, like French fries, fried chicken, or chicken wings.
Grilled foods, like burgers, steaks, or grilled shrimp.
Oily fish, such as salmon or mackerel.
Mango and citrus flavored desserts, such as mango sorbet or key lime pie.

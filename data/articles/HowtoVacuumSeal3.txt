 Place the item you’re storing in a ziplock bag, then put a straw into the bag. Seal the bag, leaving only room for the straw to protrude from the opening, then suck the air out of the bag through the straw. When the plastic squeezes around the item you’re storing, quickly pull the straw out of the bag and seal it completely., Place the item you want to store in a ziplock bag, and seal the bag up to about an inch (two or three centimeters) from one edge. Submerge the bag in a large pot of water until only the unsealed corner sticks out of the water. Pinch the corner closed when the water forces most of the air from the ziplock bag.The pressure from the water will force air out of the plastic bag. It’s not as tight as a vacuum seal, but it’s an easy way to remove air before freezing food.
 Place the item you want to store in a ziplock bag, close the ziplock seal, but leave a corner of the bag unsealed. Place that bag into a larger ziplock bag. Insert a vacuum hose into the larger bag, then seal the larger bag around the vacuum hose.Turn the vacuum on to suck out air from the bags. When it seems like all the air’s been sucked out of the inner bag, finish closing the corner of its ziplock seal you left open. Turn the vacuum off, open the larger bag, and take out the inner bag, which should be effectively vacuum sealed.
You can set aside the outer bag for future use. You only needed it to lock around the vacuum hose and suck air out of the inner bag.

 Don't force anyone to do it if they don't want to. Remember, this is supposed to be fun!;
, Is this going to be a weekly paper, a monthly paper, or even a paper that comes out once a semester? Choose what's best for you and your group.
 Some ideas may include book/movie review, mini biographies of famous people in history, etc. Obviously there willÂ  be school news in it too! Make sure there is at least one topic for everyone in your group to write about.
 How many pages will it be? Will there be a section with fun stuff (jokes, facts, word searches, etc.)? Remember, don't go crazy with it! Make your newspaper a reasonable size.
 It should probably include your school's name, initials, our sports mascot. It should also include a name that could be used for newspaper (Sun, Scoop, Ledger, Times) Here are some examples:


The Hornet Times
The Academy Sun
The SHS Ledger

, Now it's time to set up a meeting with the principal to talk about your idea. Make sure everyone in the group is there. Show the principal your ideas, layout, and all your plans. Talk to them about having a teacher advisor and about permission to use your school's computer lab (if your school has one). Remember to be honest and try only to show the cons of your idea.


Try not to be too upset if you're told you can't start a newspaper. Maybe there's something else you could do like a newsletter!

, If you got a "yes", congratulations! Make sure you keep up with your promises and always have a plan for each paper. Don't forget to have weekly or monthly meetings with your staff and keep everyone on track to get the paper going.

 The right side visible from your back (ignoring the portion behind your back) should be 2/3rds of the total length and the left side should be the remaining 1/3rd.
, The belt should be sitting at your waist, right above the hip bones. Be sure to continue holding the shorter left end in place just below the navel.
 If the belt has moved to your belly button or above, adjust the placement of the belt below your navel again and tighten the belt so that it comfortably fits.
 The left side should now be under both the first loop and this current cross over.
 Draw the right side out and pull both ends to tighten the belt. Make sure that you are tightening it enough so that it stays on, but not so that you canâ€™t breathe comfortably. This is similar to the first tie before tying a bow in your shoe.
 Adjust if it is not.

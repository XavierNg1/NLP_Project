 The formula is (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}}. If the binomials show subtraction, the formula is (a−b)2=a2−2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}}, A perfect square is a number whose square root is a whole number.Since the first term in the perfect square formula is a2{\displaystyle a^{2}}, the first term in your trinomial must be a perfect square.Note that the square root of the first term is equal to a{\displaystyle a} in the squared binomial.

For example, in the trinomial 36x2−48x+16{\displaystyle 36x^{2}-48x+16}, the first term is 36x2{\displaystyle 36x^{2}}. The square root of 36x2{\displaystyle 36x^{2}} is 6x{\displaystyle 6x}. So, the first term of this trinomial is a perfect square. Also, in the squared binomial, a=6x{\displaystyle a=6x}.
 Since the last term in the perfect square formula is b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}, the last term in your trinomial must be a perfect square.Note that the square root of the last term is equal to b{\displaystyle b} in the squared binomial.

For example, in the trinomial 36x2−48x+16{\displaystyle 36x^{2}-48x+16}, the last term is 16{\displaystyle 16}. The square root of 16{\displaystyle 16} is 4{\displaystyle 4}. So, the last term of this trinomial is a perfect square. Also, in the squared binomial, b=4{\displaystyle b=4}


, That is, if you multiply the square roots of the first and last term of the trinomial, and then multiply that product by 2 or -2, the result will equal the middle term of the trinomial, if the trinomial is a perfect square.For example, if a=6x{\displaystyle a=6x} and b=4{\displaystyle b=4}, then the middle term of the trinomial should follow the formula (−2)(6x)(4){\displaystyle (-2)(6x)(4)}. Since (−2)(6x)(4)=−48x{\displaystyle (-2)(6x)(4)=-48x} the middle term of the trinomial does follow the perfect square formula. Since the first and last terms of the trinomial followed the formula as well, you know that your trinomial is a perfect square.

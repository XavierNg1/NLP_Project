 Start doing this passionately but realistically. Don't let little mistakes slide, and make sure your assignments are done to the best of your ability. Don't spend hours and hours being a perfectionist either; just put in a little more effort than you normally would.;
, The importance of this can't be stressed enough. Make sure everything on the rubric is fully and correctly applied in your project or report. If "Creativity" is out of five marks, strive to make sure the creativity in the project is to your full ability.
 Sometimes, when you complete a project, you look at a certain part and have a tiny fractional doubt that you may have done it incorrectly. For example, in a Lab Report, you may have filled out a section in a graph incorrectly - but you're pretty sure you are right, so you let it go, thinking: "I'll only lose a few marks anyway, right?" Instead, grab the doubt, and make sure you fix it. Ask a teacher for revision to make sure you did it right. Check it over with a friend. Those little marks add up in the end.
 You may find yourself losing marks as you're in a rush to hand everything in, and the time is so busy and stressful. However, those marks count. Plan your work out evenly to ensure you will have enough time to produce quality work. Exams are another biggie - study, study, study! They are worth so much. The work you do at the end of the semester is often the work that is worth the most marks, so you don't want to let it slide.

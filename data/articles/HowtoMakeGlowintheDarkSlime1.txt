 The water doesn’t need to be boiling hot, but it should be warm to the touch.;
, You can also use white glue, but the color of the slime won’t be as vivid.








Choose non-toxic glue, particularly if children will be handling the slime., You can find glow-in-the-dark paint in most craft stores or in the crafting section of major stores.









You can also use highlighter ink as an alternative to the paint. Just pry off the bottom of the highlighter and drop the ink filament into the bowl of hot water and borax. With a gloved hand, squeeze the filament to extract the ink.Note that if using highlighter ink, it may only glow under a blacklight.
 Stir to combine.









As an alternative to the borax and water, you can simply add 1/2 cup liquid starch, also available in the laundry aisle., Gradually add the borax solution into the paint solution, 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring continuously, until desired consistency is achieved.
 If you don’t store the slime properly, it will begin to dry out.









Leaving the slime in an open container just overnight, though, can help the consistency become more rubbery, if so desired., Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime!

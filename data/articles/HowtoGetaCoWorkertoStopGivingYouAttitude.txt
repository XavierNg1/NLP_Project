, While it is usually better to give your co-worker the chance to fix her attitude problem before sicking the boss or HR person on her, sometimes direct confrontation may be dangerous to your job or to your physical well-being. Remember key buzz words such as "I'm concerned that this person's attitude may be contributing to a hostile work environment."

, Sometimes aggressive co-workers will get the message if they notice you are avoiding them.

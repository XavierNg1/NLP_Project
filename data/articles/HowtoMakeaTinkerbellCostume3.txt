 Tinkerbell has two rounded wings and two pointy wings. Though, of course, you can bend them however you want -- whatever is easiest for you.


For the round wings, open up the hangers. Twist the two together and cut off the excess leaving about two inches (5 cm) of wire near the top bend. That part will be how they attach together, underneath the top set of wings.
For the pointy wings, just cut off the tops of the hangers and stretch the bottoms out. They'll look like diamonds.
 Cut off the thighs, basically using knee highs. Stretch it tight, with all the extra material bunched around the tips of the wires.


Cover the pokey edges with duct tape. Doesn't matter the color; this part will eventually not be seen.
Arrange your wings together. The four duct-taped points should be so you can hold all of them in your hand. The round wings should go below the pointy wings.
Tape the four points together. It's basically a handle at this juncture.
 Tinkerbell has blue wings, but you can use whatever color you like. Lay down newspaper and get into a well-ventilated area.


You may want to concentrate the paint on the tips and edges for a natural, fading look.
 You can either create designs or spread it around with a foam brush. Don't spread it evenly -- it will look better if it's concentrated on the edges and points. Use blue or silver for best results.


Hang it to dry -- after all, they're wet on both sides!

, Sew it together at the ends in a flat loop. This will be how the wings stay on the torso.


Hot glue the loop in the center of your wings on the side that will be facing the back.
Then wrap another piece of fabric (either sprayed nylon or dress fabric) around the center piece, hiding all of the duct tape. Hot glue it into place. You may want to add some glitter to this bit, too.

 We all know this one: Everyone is different and we all have our own work styles. Just because a team member approaches a task or challenge at a different angle than you would doesn’t mean it’s wrong. So if you don’t understand what a teammate is doing or saying, ask questions until you find a common ground. Clearing up the differences in your processes will help you work together more fluidly going forward, and who knows––you might even learn a thing or two!


In many cases, the outcome is what matters, such as making the deadline with quality work. If your team member approaches the work in a manner that perplexes you but still delivers, it's probably fine. However, in some cases, if methodology or accuracy require a specific way to achieve something, and your teammate is dodging this, it's time to have a pointed chat.
 Projects hardly ever go as planned, so there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself doing “surprise” work in order to move a project forward. It could be helping a teammate with some tasks, taking over part of a ballooning project, you name it. If you can roll with these change requests with a positive attitude and pitch in where needed, this will earn you those key points as “team player.”


If you’re a good problem solver and naturally willing to do whatever (within reason) the team needs of you, it could be that flexibility is one of your greatest strengths. Every team needs a flexible player, so play to it!

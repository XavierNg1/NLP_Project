 This plain peanut butter smoothie recipe can be easily modified. For example, you could easily add other fruits, like strawberry or concord grapes, which are often used in jellies.This could cause your smoothie to taste like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! For the basic recipe, you'll need:


Blender
Ice cubes (½ cup)
Milk (¼ cup)
Peanut butter (creamy recommended; 1 tblsp)
Yogurt (vanilla recommended; 6 oz (170 g));
, But before you do, make sure the blender is unplugged to prevent accidentally pressing a button before its lid is on and making a mess. Once the ingredients are inside your blender, seal the top firmly in place and plug it in.Especially when making a double batch, try not to pack ingredients too densely into your blender.
Over packing a blender can tax its motor and cause it to wear out more quickly, or could create more resistance than your blender can handle, in which case your blender may not start., Depending on your blender, there may be several settings to choose from. For making a smoothie, use the "Blend" button. Try to run your blender in short intervals, as this will help keep its motor from burning out.Blend until the mixture is a smooth consistency.


If your blender is too densely packed and the blades won't turn and blend, unplug it and use a spoon to remove some of the contents. Then reseal it, plug it in, and try again.
 Store your smoothie in an airtight container with as little air in the container as possible. The air remaining in your container will interact with the nutrients in the smoothie, causing it to break down faster.


Generally, you can expect most smoothies to stay good for 12 hours to a day after being prepared, so long as they are adequately sealed and stored in the refrigerator.

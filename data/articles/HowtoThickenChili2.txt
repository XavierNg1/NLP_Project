 An emulsifier, such as lecithin (commonly available in health food sections) will help disperse the fat throughout the chili, adding a slightly thicker, rich mouth feel to every bite without actually increasing viscosity much.
 This process makes the fat more appetizing, if you were going to keep it, but adds fat if you'd otherwise drain it off.

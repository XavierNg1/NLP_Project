 For this experiment you will need an eye dropper, a dry penny, water, a small bowl, dish soap, oil, and a towel. Most of these items can be found around the house or purchased at the grocery store. You don’t have to use dish soap and oil, but you will want different liquids to compare their surface tensions.


Make sure the penny is completely clean and dry before beginning the experiment. If there are other liquids on the penny, the experiment will not be accurate.
This experiment does not allow you to calculate surface tension, but just determine surface tensions of different liquids relative to each other.
 Place the penny on top of a towel or a surface that you don’t mind getting wet. Fill the eyedropper with the first liquid. Slowly, drip the liquid onto the penny, taking care to only drop one drop at a time. Count the number of drops it takes to fill the penny until the liquid runs over.


Write down how many drops it takes for the liquid to flow over the side of the penny.
 Clean and dry the penny in between each test of liquid. Dry the surface that you placed the penny on before repeating the experiment. Use multiple eyedroppers or clean it in between uses.


Try mixing a little bit of dish soap to the water and dropping again to see if the surface tension changes.
 Try repeating the experiment with the same liquid multiple times to see if you are getting an accurate count. Average the trials together by adding them together and dividing by the number of trials performed. Write down which substances required the most drops and which required the fewest to fill the penny.


Substances with a higher surface tension will have more drops on the penny than substances with a lower surface tension.
The dish soap lowers the surface tension of the water, using fewer drops to fill the penny.

 The stronger the magnet, the easier it will be to magnetize the screwdriver. Ideally, find a neodymium magnet or other rare-earth magnet with a pull force of at least Â¼ pound.These are available at hardware stores or online.


If you don't mind destroying an old hard drive, you can disassemble it to get two strong magnets.;
, Remove any grime from the screwdriver. If you need to use a damp cloth, dry the tool thoroughly afterward., Touch one end of the magnet to the metal surface of the screwdriver, next to the handle. Drag it down to the tip. This causes small magnetic regions (domains) in the steel to align in the direction of the magnet's field.On a large screwdriver, magnetize the half closest to the tip instead of the whole tool.
 Take the magnet off the screwdriver, then drag it from the handle to the tip again. Repeat this several times, using the same end of the magnet each time.


Do not drag the magnet back from the tip to the handle. This will undo your work.
 Rotate the screwdriver by a quarter turn. Drag the magnet from handle to tip again several times. Repeat with the third and fourth sides of the screwdriver.
 If the screwdriver can't pick up a screw magnetically, repeat the process. If it still doesn't work after ten passes on each side, try again with a stronger magnet.


A hard steel screwdriver can stay magnetized for months. If you'd like to demagnetize it, run the magnet back the other way (tip to handle), or whack the screwdriver against the wall a few times to scramble its magnetic domains again.

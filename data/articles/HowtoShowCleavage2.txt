 When showing cleavage, you want your breasts looking their best, and an ill-fitting bra won't be able to do that. Your breasts should fit perfectly inside the cups without any bulging at the top, bottom, or sides. Your bra should sit firmly and horizontally across your back without riding up as the day goes on. If your bra has an underwire, make sure it fits against your chest without gaps or pinching., Push-up bras are essential for creating the sexiest cleavage possible, especially for women who may be less well-endowed. These bras are specifically designed to increase the appearance of cleavage. Push-up bras work to push your breasts both upward and together, giving you a fuller, perkier look. If the pushup isn't enough for you, tie it in the back

, Also called "cutlets," inserts can both enhance cleavage and add volume to your breasts. Position an insert low on the exterior side of each breast. This will push your breasts inward, creating better cleavage.


When wearing inserts, you may need to wear a bra that's at least one cup size larger than what you'd wear with unenhanced breasts., If you want the focus to be on your breasts, make sure to take the time to make them look their best. Pat on some powder and bronzer before going out. Try to make the color of your cleavage match your face.


Don't go so far as to pile on foundation, however. If you want to hide blemishes, stick with a light concealer.

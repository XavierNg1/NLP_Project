 You may want to include information about alternative activities, in case a parent or guardian does not want their child to participate in the activity. For example, if the parent or guardian does not want their child to go on a trip, what will the child do instead? If there is an in-class activity that involves eating cake, what can a child do or eat if they are not permitted to have cake?

, If the activity requires the parent or guardian to give money, include both the cost as well as how the cost can be paid. For example, you can write, “Please send cash or check to school with your child. Checks can be made payable to (institution or teacher’s name).”Also, include the deadline that the cost needs to be paid by, if it is different than the date of the activity or field trip.
 At the bottom of the permission slip, you can write “Special Comments or Instructions: _________.” This gives the parent or guardian space to include anything that you may not have explicitly asked for.
 You can also write permission slips in a letter format. Start the slip with “Dear (parent or guardian)”. Use a friendly tone, include all relevant details in sentence format, and close the letter with a comment that invites further communication. For example, you can write, “If you have any questions or would like further information, don't hesitate to reach out.”

 The most obvious place is local photographers. Even if they don't volunteer, they might have some ideas. Heartfelt in Australia gives parents the opportunity of getting photographs of their deceased, or dying, children.;
, This can lead to more work in the future.
 Use all the care with them that you do with your human clients. You are improving their chances of getting adopted and you never know where people will hear your name from.
 Offer your services to them. Like Heartfelt (mentioned above), you are giving them memories that they will never have another chance of getting.
 If the military presence is strong in your area, you might want to change that to offering them a very good rate., If you know of an issue, (homelessness, domestic violence), and you have the opportunity (or make yourself the opportunity), go out there and take some shots. Put a face to the problem.
 Some ways are, as follows:


Taking photos for child identification
School events, such as sports, chess, anything
Just look around and see what you can do. Maybe there is an outstanding graffiti artist in your neighborhood. Share his art with others, using your photography.
 Maybe there is a nursing home in the area that you could offer your services to help create memories for them and their family.

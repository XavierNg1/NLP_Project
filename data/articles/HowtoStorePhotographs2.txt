Negatives should be handled very carefully. Avoid getting your fingerprints on them and follow the same storage rules as for photos—keep away from light, heat and humidity.
Consider photocopying your photos or scanning them into a computer, if you don’t have the negatives. Be aware that excessive photocopying or scanning can damage photos, as the process involves both light and heat.

 Each panel is made up of one square face of the box together with one flap.
Draw all the fold lines and cut lines onto the panels following the Modified Fun-Panel Plan.
Cut along the cut lines, then fold along the fold lines.
Glue aluminum foil onto the inner side of the two large rectangular cardboard panels. Use white glue mixed 50/50 with water. Wheat paste can also be used. For more information see Glue.;

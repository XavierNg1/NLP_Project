 They can vary by brand, but typically will be 1 size to a size and a half smaller than your shoe size, depending on the brand. Your toes should barely touch the toe cap.;
, This will also help you determine whether you need a standard width or wide skate. Standard width skates are usually denoted with a "D," and wide skates are marked as "EE." Some brands and models run wider and deeper than others.
 If you're trying out hockey for the first time, buy a pair of skates that are around $100. These won't last as long. But if you know you're going to be playing for a while you can pay between $200 and $800 for a pair of skates that will last you a good number of years. Look for brands like Reebok, Bauer, CCM, and Easton.


More expensive skates are lighter weight, have a more durable construction, and greater ankle support and padding.
Competitive players look for high-end hockey skates with thermo-formable foam padding that can be heated to create a customized fit.
Look at the construction of the plastic holder and metal runner (blade) on ice hockey skates. A 1-piece design is less expensive and suitable for a child or introductory player. A 2-piece design costs more but allows just the plastic holder to be replaced if it breaks, which can happen from impact by a high-velocity puck.
 The wheels may all be the same size or have slightly larger wheels in the back.
You'll want harder wheels (a higher durometer rating) if you are using the inline hockey skates outdoors. Outdoor wheels are more durable but have less grip. A durometer rating of 72A, 74A or 76A are for indoor use only. A durometer rating of 78A or 80A can be used indoors or outdoors. A durometer rating of 82A or 84A are for outdoor use.
Look at the bearing rating. A higher rating, such as ABEC 7, is more expensive but makes it easier to skate, because the wheels rotate with less effort.

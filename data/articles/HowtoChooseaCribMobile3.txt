 Look for bright, contrasting colors; in their first few months, babies only really distinguish bold, primary colors.Choose the type of design you want to complement your baby’s room, as well as the type of toys you want dangling from the mobile strings. Some mobiles will include removable toys that your child can play with during the day, flashing lights, a projection nightlight, or other fun options to keep your baby happy., Baby mobiles are generally either wind operated or battery operated. Wind operated models are losing favor as they require air movement within the baby’s room.Mechanically operated mobiles, which run on a small motor, are simple to use and can offer a wide range of movements (e.g. up and down, clockwise and counter-clockwise).Some electronic mobiles are also remote operable.
 Many mobiles feature a music box that plays to help your baby calm down or sleep. The duration of play length varies between models, as does the volume of the music; sound should be soft and not loud enough to risk damage to your baby’s hearing.There are two types of musical mobile options:


Wind up music mobiles, where you must manually turn a key or handle to play music for a short period of time.
Battery operated music mobiles, where music plays at the push of a button; there are often multiple melodies to choose from.

 This version of the exercise does involve an exercise ball, but it can also be done with your back against the floor.
 If you want this exercise to really work your shoulder muscles you should make sure to be pushing yourself as far off the ground as possible.
 Just like a regular bridge exercise, this will build up strength in your arm, leg, and back muscles as well as your shoulders.
 It might take awhile to master this movement, but so long as you have a good sense of balance it should come to you quickly enough.

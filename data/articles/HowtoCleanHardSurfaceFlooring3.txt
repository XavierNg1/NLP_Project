If you have one, follow this by using a microfiber dust mop to pick up finer dirt from the floor that is harder to see. Pick up with the broom and empty into the trash.
For an even cleaner surface, use a vacuum cleaner on the floor on the lowest carpet/surface setting (if available). Vinyl floors are relatively durable so you can use the vacuum cleaner with confidence.
 If you'd like to make your own, combine one part borax with two parts warm water in a bucket. You can also use vinegar and water at a dilution of 1 cup of vinegar per gallon of water. Pregnant women and children should not handle borax. , Although any mop will do the trick you may want to use a mop that has thick bristles to really remove any grime or grease.

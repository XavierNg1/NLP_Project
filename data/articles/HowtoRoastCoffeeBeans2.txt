 While your oven is preheating, ready your pan. For this method you will need a baking sheet that has many small holes or slots and a lip that will keep all of the beans in the pan. These pans can be found at any kitchen supply store.If you don’t want to buy a new pan but happen to have an old baking sheet with a lip lying around, you can actually make your own roasting sheet. Take your pan and use a ⅛ inch drill bit to carefully drill holes into the sheet. The holes should be ½ inch away from each other and small enough that none of the beans will fall through them.;
, Pour the beans onto the sheet so that they lie in one layer over the entire pan. The beans should be close together but should not be overlapping. Once the oven is preheated, place the baking sheet with the beans onto the middle rack of the oven.
 Listening for a cracking or popping noise. This is the water contained in the beans evaporating. The popping noise signifies that the beans are roasting and darkening. Stir them around every few minutes to help them develop an even roast., When they are roasted to your satisfaction, remove them immediately from the heat. To help them cool down, pour the beans into a metal colander and stir them around. This will help cool the beans as well as remove the chaff.

 Poke holes into the caps with a sharp object like a box cutter, a pair of scissors, or a knife. The caps will be your wheels.
 Cut the skewers so that they are slightly longer than the width of the milk carton. The skewers will act as the axles for the car. If you want the axles to run through the milk carton, take this time to puncture two parallel holes on each side of the carton.
 Make sure the top of the lid is facing towards the milk carton as this provides better stability. Use glue where the skewer and cap meet to make it sturdier. Be sure to let the glue dry before proceeding.
 Slide the free end of each skewer through a straw. Cut the straws down until they are slightly shorter than the skewer. Having the skewers inside of the straw will make your car move faster.
 If you punctured holes in the milk carton, run the free end of the skewer through the holes before adding the other wheel. This completes your axles.
 They should be parallel to the width of the carton.
 Use construction paper, paint, or markers to decorate the carton. You can also cut shapes into the milk carton to give it character.

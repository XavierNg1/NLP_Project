 Organic cotton does not contain any of those chemicals that help speed up growth and boost production. Regular cotton cloths are tainted with pesticides and dyes.;
, Comfortable clothes do not have to be expensive. You just have to ensure a good fit. Your baby won't be able to move well in baggy or tight-fitting clothes. Itchy neck labels and embroidered designs add discomfort as well. Look for seamless or flat seamed designs that are less bulky and are easier to move around in.
 As a general rule, baby clothes should fit close enough to the skin but not too tightly that it pinches the skin. There should be enough room to allow the baby to move. Avoid big clothes as the extra fabric rubs against the skin, causing further irritation and redness.
 Trade your regular soap and shampoo for organic ones. Organic soap and shampoo have no harsh ingredients that can strip off moisture and natural oils from your baby's skin. Wash his clothes with a mild detergent. If possible, avoid using too much product on your baby's skin and wash him only when necessary. Wetness aggravates baby eczema so make sure to dry him off completely after each wash.

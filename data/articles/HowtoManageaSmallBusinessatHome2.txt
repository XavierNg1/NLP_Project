 It takes time to become profitable, and you will need money to keep yourself afloat while you grow your business.
 When you live and work in the same space, it can be difficult to separate your personal and professional life.


Schedule office hours for yourself.
Stay focused on your work. Avoid the television, household chores and other distractions during your office hours.
Expect to work longer hours when you are just getting started or during particularly busy times. For example, if your small business involves preparing taxes, you know you will need longer office hours during tax time.
 Running a business from home means you can enlist your family members if you need their help. Ask your spouse to proofread emails, or have your kids stuff envelopes if you are preparing a mailing.

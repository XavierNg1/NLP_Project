 If you don't have administrator access on the Mac you want to crack, you will need to gain root access before you can start the password cracking process. Root access allows you to perform any function on the Mac.

Boot into Single User mode at startup by pressing and holding ⌘ Cmd+S during the startup sequence.






Type /sbin/mount -uw / and press ↵ Enter when you reach the Terminal.






Type launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist and press ↵ Enter.






Type passwd and press ↵ Enter. You will be prompted to enter a password twice. This will be your new root access password.






Restart the computer by typing restart or reboot and pressing ↵ Enter.
 When the computer reboots, select Other in the Login Window. Enter "root" as the username, and then type in the password you just created.
 This program will attempt to crack OS X passwords, and can be downloaded for free from a variety of locations online. Make sure that you are downloading from a trusted location or service.


DaveGrohl comes in ZIP format. Extract the ZIP and place the folder somewhere that is easily accessible.
 Open the Terminal (found in the Utilities folder) and navigate to the DaveGrohl folder. If you kept it in your Downloads folder, type cd Downloads/DaveGrohl. Make sure that you are logged in as root.


To start the cracking process, type sudo ./dave -u username. Replace username with the system name for the account you want to crack.
 DaveGrohl will begin trying to brute-force the password. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several days, depending on the strength of the password.Once a password is found, it will be displayed as Found password : 'password'.






You can leave DaveGrohl running in the background if the password is taking a while to crack.

 Year to date is a useful entry on your paycheck stub that can show you exactly how much you have earned, and how much has gone to taxes or withholdings, up to the current date of that pay stub.Use the year to date area of your paycheck stub to keep up-to-date and accurate financial records of your earnings.
 Each pay-stub will be unique. Beyond the more common items found on your pay-stub, there may appear additional items that you should look for.Insurance Deductions. Your company may take money directly from your earnings and place it into your insurance policy payment. If this is so, you can keep an accurate record of how much you have paid for insurance and when the payment was made.
Retirement Plan. If your employer offers retirement plans, they may take automatic deductions from your pay and apply them to your plan. This can be a great way to save money for retirement and if your paycheck stub has this item, you can easily keep track of your contributions. Your plan may be labeled by the type of plan you are using such as 401(k), 403(b), profit sharing, or IRA.
Time off. Some employers may enter the amount of time off you have used or have yet to use. This item, while not directly related to earnings, can still be useful in projecting how many hours of pay may be lost if taking time off.
Additional notices. Employers will sometimes put important information regarding changes to pay policies on the paycheck stub. These will help keep you informed about any upcoming modifications that may affect your net earnings.
 Often times, your employer, or the payroll company they have hired, will make use of abbreviations on your paycheck stub to save space. Understanding these abbreviations will help you make better sense of the information presented.YTD: Year-to-Date

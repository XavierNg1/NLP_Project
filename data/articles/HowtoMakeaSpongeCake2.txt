 Set the oven to 165°C, 325°F, or gas mark 3. Have a tube pan ready, but do not butter or grease it.
 Whisk together the flour, 3/4 cup of the sugar, the baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
 In a separate large bowl, whisk together the oil, egg yolks, and milk till combined. Gradually whisk the flour mixture into your wet mixture.
 In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a mixer set to high until the whites become frothy. Add the cream of tartar and vanilla, then beat until the whites hold soft peaks. Slowly beat in the rest of the sugar (3/4 cup) and keep beating until the whites hold stiff, shiny peaks. This should take around 5 minutes.
 Start by whisking in a third of the egg whites into your other batter. Then, take a spatula and gently fold the rest of the egg whites into the mixture. Stop folding just before all the flour is incorporated.


To fold in a mixture, simply use a spatula and a light hand to gently combine a lighter mixture into a heavier one. Avoid stirring, or you'll lose the volume of the lighter mixture. Instead, rotate your wrist when combining substances.
 Cook the cake until it springs back when you touch it, around 50 to 55 minutes. Remove it from the oven and let it cool upside down for an hour before you take it out of the pan.


To let the cake easily cool upside down, try setting the pan upside down over a bottle inserted in the center of the pan.
 Chiffon cakes can be sliced vertically, like an Angel Food cake, or cut horizontally and filled, like a Victoria Sponge.

 You can find peroxide in a lot of stores. It’s usually found in the first aid aisle and should be clear. Pour some into a small bowl so that the bottom of the bowl is just covered., Place your earrings in the peroxide and let them soak for fifteen to twenty minutes. If it’s been quite a while (over six months) since you last cleaned your earrings, you might want to leave them in longer.
 If you don’t have a jewelry brush, a clean toothbrush will work just as well. Gently brush your earrings, being sure to get into any cracks or crevices.
 You can rinse your earrings by holding them under warm running water, or by dipping them in a bowl of clear warm water.
 Lay your earrings out on a piece of paper towel and let them air dry. This will take up to an hour, depending on the size of the stud.

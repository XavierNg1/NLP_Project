 If you have limited space, you may want to consider a smaller drawing table over a standard drafting table. If the drafting table is for an office environment, where it may be used by more than one person or subjected to more wear, you may want to purchase a heavier, more durable table. If the drafting table is for individual use in a home environment, you may want to buy a lightweight table that can be easily moved.;
, The top surface of a drafting table can be inclined to various angles. The maximum tilt angle for most tables is either 35 or 45 degrees, but some drafting tables offer steeper tilt angles.
 Some drafting tables offer adjustable heights, allowing them to be used with any chair height. Fixed-height tables typically offer a 4-post design and are normally 30 to 37 inches (76.2 to 95 cm) from the floor.
 Some drafting tables offer lockable drawers to protect your tools and other valuables. Others features provide comfort, such as optional footrest crossbars and adjustable armrests. There are also built-in rulers, slide-up pencil ledges, and other convenience features such as split-level surfaces and various types of storage.
 To blend with your home dï¿½cor, you can choose either a traditional drafting table or one with a more modern flair. There is also a variety of materials from which to choose.

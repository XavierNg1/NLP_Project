 Find out if there are any specific reasons that they spend so much time on the computer. Sometimes, the computer can function as an escape from reality, especially if they are being bullied or having difficulties in school. If your child is facing problems that are causing a desire to escape, address those with them through discussions, providing advice, or getting them help when necessary..Listen to them without interrupting. There may be something that they’ve been wanting to share with you, so come to the conversation with a kind and concerned demeanor.
 After having a talk with your child and assessing what’s going on with them, lay down some basic ground rules for computer use. Let them know that there are limits, that they can only use the computer for two hours per day for non-homework related items, and that there will be consequences if they do not follow the rules.For instance, if they are caught using the computer for longer than allowed, take away the computer for one day. Let them rely on their textbooks when completing any homework.
 When they do break one of your computer rules, punish them immediately. Delaying punishment often results in bad behavior being repeated. If they overuse the computer or use it for anything other than school during homework time, take it away from them then and there. If they are caught doing this a second time, take the computer away for two days instead of one.If they feel that their bad behavior will not be punished it, then they will not care about the consequences and may lose respect for you.
 Don’t spend a lot of time using the computer around your child. This might make them feel a bit resentful of you if they see you doing the things that you have banned them from doing. Instead, be present when you are with them and work on spending more time together.

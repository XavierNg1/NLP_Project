 The idea is to give a nod to the grunge style of the early 1990s, which is where combat boots first had a chance to shine, without getting too carried away. While fitted shirts were not necessarily the "in" thing during the grunge era, black is timeless and had its fair share of the spotlight. A simple black, fitted t-shirt makes a nice neutral base for the rest of your outfit.
 Shapeless, button-down plaid was a definite part of the grunge look. To give your tribute to grunge an update, choose a shirt that nips in slightly at the natural waist and leave it partially or fully unbuttoned to reveal the black shirt underneath. You can stick to the classic red-and-black color scheme, or you can go for something a little more modern like teal-and-black or blue-and-black.
 Wearing cut-offs with frayed edges enhances the look, but if this is a little too bold or a little too early '90s for you, you can trade the cut-offs for distressed jeans with rips in the knee.
 The tights are only optional, but they do add a modern, stylish twist to otherwise outdated clothing. Go with black tights to make your look a little sleeker and to match the fitted black shirt serving as the base of your outfit. It is best to go with full-length tights to contrast the shortness of your cut-offs or to make sure that they can be seen through the rips in your jeans.
 You can pull off worn, rugged boots with this outfit to push it closer to '90s grunge, but if you want to keep your ensemble looking purposeful and stylish by today's standards, a pair of polished black combat boots will work better.
 Any cosmetics you wear should be used to even out your complexion, but do not go overboard with how girly or feminine you make your face look. One or two large, chunky accessories can be a chic touch, but anything too frilly, colorful, or dainty will look out of place. Consider a studded shoulder bag, black "hipster" glasses, or plaid-print button earrings.

 This should be a wooden bed frame with solid posts at both ends of the bed.;
, Buy four large 2x2 pieces of lumber. Screw them into the bed frame, or attach them. They should be standing upwards now, surrounding your bed.
 Attach curtain rods between the posts.
 This should ideally be a see-through, or translucent fabric. Ideally, the fabric must be cut so that it covers the whole top of the canopy made by the lumber, as well as the front and back. The sides should be saved for curtains. Measure the areas and cut the fabric accordingly.
 If you don't want to bother, cover both sides with the canopy just like you would for the front and back. In the sides, however, make a cut in the fabric to serve as curtains, and hem the sides. The edges should also be hemmed too.
 You can also sew the hem with lace, if you'd like.
 Enjoy your new bed!

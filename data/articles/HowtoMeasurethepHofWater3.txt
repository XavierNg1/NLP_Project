 Acidity and alkalinity (the term used to describe bases) are both defined by the hydrogen ions they lose or accept. An acid is a substance that loses (or, some say, donates) hydrogen ions. A base is a substance that accepts additional hydrogen ions.
 The pH number is used to rate the level of acidity or alkalinity of water soluble substances. Water normally contains an equal amount of hydroxide ions (OH-) and hydronium ions (H30+). When an acidic or alkaline substance is added to water, they change the proportion of hydroxide and hydronium ions.It is typically said to be on a scale of 0 to 14 (though substances can actually be fall beyond that range). Neutral substances rate close to 7, acidic ones below 7, and alkaline substances are above 7.
The pH scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that differences of a single integer actually represent a tenfold difference in acidity or alkalinity. For instance, a substance that has a pH of 2 is actually ten times more acidic than one with a pH of 3 and 100 times more acidic than a substance with a pH of 4. The scale functions similarly for alkaline substances, with one integer representing a tenfold difference in alkalinity.
 Pure water should have a pH of 7, though common tap water has a pH between 6 and 5.5. Highly acidic water (water with a low pH) is more likely to dissolve toxic chemicals. These can contaminate the water and make it unsafe for human consumption.It is often considered best to test pH on site. If you collect a water sample for study in a lab, carbon dioxide in the air can dissolve into the water. The dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the ions in the water to increase acidity in basic or neutral solutions. To prevent carbon dioxide contamination, you must test water within 2 hours of collection.

 There are a variety of apps that can block calls on your Android device. These can be useful if your device doesn't support blocking calls natively, or you want to block calls from unknown or blocked calls. Some of the more popular apps include:


Mr. Number
Call Blocker
Should I Answer?
Extreme Call Blocker

, The process for blocking numbers will vary depending on the app you are using, but generally they're all fairly similar.
 You can generally block unknown and blocked numbers through the settings section of the blocking app.
 You can typically find these options in the app's settings. This will block calls from numbers that appear "Private" or "Unknown" on your caller ID.
 You can use the app to add specific numbers or people from your contacts list. This will block these callers from being able to reach you.
 Many blocking apps allow you to set scheduling options for your blocking. You can do this to block all calls during specific hours.
 If the apps aren't working well enough for your needs, you can contact your carrier and inquire about their blocking options. You may be able to reject all unknown calls or add numbers to a block list.


Note that many prepaid plans do not offer the same blocking options that traditional plans do.

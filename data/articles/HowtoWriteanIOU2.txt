, IOUs are often difficult to enforce in court, being informal agreements usually agreed upon without the benefit of a witness. Whereas some IOUs only state an amount agreed upon, promissory notes state an agreed-upon amount in addition to the steps necessary to pay back the debt and the consequences if the borrower fails to do so.If you're lending a larger amount than you're comfortable with, take the time to make a promissory note. A promissory note will make it easier than an IOU to recoup any money you lent out in court.
In order to establish a promissory note, you should have it notarized. (Other than that, it takes basically the same form as an IOU.) Notarizing a document just means signing it in the presence of a state-sponsored witness and stamping it with a seal of approval.
 A lawyer will be able to explain all the small legal details associated with an IOU, and should be able to offer suggestions about possible legal recourse you can take if you become unable to recoup the principal.

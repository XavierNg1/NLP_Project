 You may want to convert an existing room into a nursery, or your church may choose to build a new addition to the church just for the nursery.


You will want the nursery located as close to the sanctuary as possible. This is convenient for parents who are bringing their children to the nursery. Be sure to check that the noise from the nursery will not hinder the church service.
It is a good idea to have an adjoining restroom to the nursery. This is for the caretakers to have access to a restroom without having to leave the babies. It is also good for children who are toilet training.
Access to a sink is also important for a nursery. The sink should be located in the same room.

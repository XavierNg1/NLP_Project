 Look for the Facebook app on your iPhone or iPad. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap on the More button at the bottom of the navigation for the iPhone and on the downward chevron icon at the upper-right corner for the iPad. Select “Settings” from the menu.


You will be brought to the Settings screen.
 From the Settings screen, scroll down until you see “Apps.” Tap on it. You will be brought to the Apps and Websites screen.
 From this screen, tap “Logged in with Facebook.” All the apps and websites integrated with your Facebook account will be listed. Scroll down the list and tap on “Candy Crush Saga.”


You will be brought to the app’s settings.
 The first option on the screen is for “Visibility of app.” This setting controls who can see your activities on this app. Tap the text beside it to open all possible options. Select “Only Me” by tapping on it.


Whenever Candy Crush posts to your wall, only you will be able to see it.

 To mix up your own gel liner in a hurry, find a loose eyeshadow pigment in the shade that you want to line your eyes with. Sprinkle a small amount into the lid of its container or on another flat surface that you can mix on.It’s best not to use eyeshadow pigment with glitter. The particles may fall in your eyes if you make a liner with the glitter.
If you don’t have a loose shadow pigment, you can scrape a pressed shadow with a nail file or butter knife to get some pigment to work with.;
, When you’ve got the eyeshadow pigment in ready, use a toothpick to place a small amount of petroleum jelly in the container with it. Stir the shadow and petroleum jelly together to form a colored gel.Start with an extremely small amount of petroleum jelly, and only add more if necessary. There should be more pigment than jelly.
Swipe a small bit of the gel liner onto your hand with the toothpick to test the color. If it’s not as dark or pigmented as you’d like, mix in more of the eyeshadow.
 Once you’re satisfied with the color of your gel liner, use an eyeliner brush to trace it along your lashline. Because the petroleum jelly is extremely emollient, it’s a good idea to set the gel liner with the powder eyeshadow in the same color.This gel liner isn’t particularly long-wearing and can smudge easily. It’s best used if you’re doing a grunge makeup look or a smoky eye where you won’t mind some smudging.

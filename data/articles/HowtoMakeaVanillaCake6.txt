 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius. Cover a cake pan that is eight-inches with melted butter or oil using a pastry brush. Dust with flour.
 In a mixing bowl, use a whisk or fork to mix the soy milk and vinegar together.
 Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda into a large mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to combine the dry ingredients together.
 Pour the almond extract, vanilla extract, lemon juice, water, and apple cider vinegar. Mix them together using a whisk or fork, until properly combined.
 Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to mix the cake batter. For a faster results, you can also use an electric or hand blender. Mix until cake is a light yellow in color and is glossy.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape up all the cake batter into the cake pan.
 Place the cake pan into the oven. Have it bake for about 35 minutes, which is when the cake springs back when you touch it, and a toothpick comes out dry when you poke the cake.
 Flip the cake pan upside down on a wire rack. To make the cake easier to flip, circle a knife around it. It should pop out. Have the cake cool for about five minutes.
 Using your favorite frosting and icing, frost your cake to your liking. You can also add toppings such as sliced fruit, sprinkles, nuts, chocolate chips, and coconut flakes.

 Older iPads don't support multitasking, but the following model numbers do:


iPad Pro: A1584, A1652, A1673, A1674, or A1675.
iPad Air 2: A1566 or A1567.
iPad Air: A1566 or A1567.
iPad Mini 4: A1538 or A1550.
iPad Mini 3: A1599 or A1600.
iPad Mini 2: A1489, A1490, or A1491.
Most newer iPads can use other multi-tasking functions like "slide over" and "picture in picture" functions, but "split-screen" is reserved for the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad Mini 4.;
, It's the grey app with gears that's most likely on the Home Screen.
 It's near the top of the "Settings" page.
 It's near the bottom of the "General" page.
 Its toggle switch will turn green, signifying that the multitasking features are enabled.


If the toggle switch shows green, multitasking is already enabled.
 To do so, tap one app, wait for it to open, tap the "Home" button, and then tap another app.
 This will activate the "slide-over" feature, pulling your next running app over the currently open app. Your right app will occupy about a third of the screen, so you can view your original app while using your right app.To change the app on the right, swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen and then select a different app.
"Slide-over" pauses the app on the "bottom" (the left side of the screen by default) in favor of the "top" app (the app you just opened on the right side).
This feature is useful for quickly researching a location while browsing a map, or checking social media while taking notes.
 The screen divider is between the left and right apps; dragging it left will activate the "split-screen" feature, in which both of your apps can run at the same time., This will minimize the video into a small window, activating the "picture in picture" feature. Your video will stay on top of any other apps you open, allowing you to use other apps in full-screen while watching your video.


The "picture in picture" feature can be used for FaceTime as well.

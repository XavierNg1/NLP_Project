 Avoid medicated shampoos or drying formulas.
 Heat may dry out your hair even faster, causing it to break and fall out faster.
 The experience may prove less traumatic than having your hair fall out in clumps, and it may provide you with more options in the way of wigs and head coverings.
 If you want the change to be less obvious, save a lock of your hair to match against wig colors. Alternatively, you can use this difficult time in your life to experiment with a different hair color by choosing a wig in a completely different shade.
 The most affordable wigs are machine-made, but hand-made wigs and custom-made wigs are also available and may look more natural. Modern day synthetic wigs tend to be of fairly high quality, however, so you can find a natural-looking hairpiece at an affordable price no matter which route you go.
 Wigs made of human hair are generally the most expensive, but they also look the most natural. Wash and care for these wigs as you would your own hair.
 Choose a 32 to 38 inch (81.3 to 96.5Â cm) square scarf or bandana. Look for colorful styles that complement your skin tone and fit your personality. Gravitate toward cotton scarves, which are cool and easy to keep in place, over silk scarves that tend to slip.
 Hats are a good option, whether your hair has fallen out completely or has only started to thin. Try on a range of styles, from bucket hats to berets, to determine which you prefer.

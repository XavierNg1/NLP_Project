 Some chemical products come with disposal instructions right on the label and following those instructions should be enough. Even for products without disposal instructions, you should still read the labels so you can be aware of the warnings and cautions concerning said products.Items such as batteries and light bulbs have to be recycled at special recycling centers.
Never mix cleaning products together. If you only have a small amount of cleaning product left in each bottle, it may be tempting to mix them into one bottle for disposal. Different chemicals can react with each other to form very hazardous fumes and noxious gases.;
, In addition to the product label, you want to read the MSDS for industrial chemicals. The MSDS gives you important information about the chemical: its toxicity, reactivity, and disposal considerations.Use the online MSDS database to look up the MSDS for the specific formulation of the chemical you wish to dispose., The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has many resources on determining if your waste is considered hazardous and what kind of special disposal is necessary. The EPA regulates hazardous waste using the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976.Determine if your waste is hazardous by referring to this EPA flow chart.
If your waste is classified as hazardous by the EPA, you will need to contact the EPA for proper disposal.
You can contact the EPA online or by looking up your local EPA office and contacting them directly by phone.

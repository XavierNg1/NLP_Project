 The freckles will be one of the last steps in your make-up routine, so its important to get the rest of your make-up just right before proceeding with the freckles.


If you normally wear foundation, powder, or concealer, apply those now as you normally would. If you wear blush, you can choose whether to apply it before or after the freckles depending on how prominent you'd like the freckles to appear. For more obvious freckles, apply blush now and then apply freckles on top of them. For less obvious, more natural looking freckles, wait to apply blush after you've applied the freckles, but be careful not to smear the freckles.;
, You'll need light brown cream eyeliner (a few shades darker than your natural skintone), a blush brush or beauty blender, and a cotton ball.


Do not use liquid eyeliner; it smudges easily and looks less natural.
 You can use the tip of the eyeliner itself as long as its a very fine point.









Make more dots for a more dramatic look, or less for a subtle look. You can place them on your shoulders, decollete, and neck as well if you want to.
 You do not want to rub or smear the freckles, but rather press on them gently, which will help them to look more natural.









Take your finger and press on them a bit, but not too much or else they will disappear. Remember that natural freckles vary in size, shape, and shade, so press on some a bit more firmly than others in order to vary their appearance. But do it randomly or it will look unnatural.
 You can even wear these to school. They look very realistic!


Remove using make-up remover or oil. To take off, put 1 or 2 drops of water on your cotton ball and wipe away to have a clear face again! If you are wearing waterproof eyeliner as freckles, you may need to use an oil-based make up remover (or coconut oil) to remove the freckles.

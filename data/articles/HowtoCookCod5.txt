 Arrange the cod fillets in a single layer in a microwave-safe 11- by 7-inch (28- by 18-cm) baking dish. Cover the dish with a lid, paper towel, or microwave-safe plastic wrap.


Keep the cod in a single layer in the baking dish. Do not stack the fillets since doing so will cause them to cook unevenly.
If this dish is too large for your microwave oven, you may need to cook the cod in batches in a smaller dish.



If your microwave does not have a rotating tray, pause the cooking process at the 3-minute mark and turn the dish 180 degrees before you continue cooking.
 Remove the baking dish from the microwave and uncover. Pour the broth and lemon juice into the dish and use a fork or spatula to flip the fillets over, coating both sides. Sprinkle the top of each fillet with the pepper and parsley.


If desired, you could use other seasonings, like 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder, along with the pepper and parsley.
 Cover the dish once more and cook the fish for another 4 to 5 minutes, until it becomes opaque and can be easily flaked with a fork.


If the microwave does not have a rotating tray, pause the cooking process halfway through and turn the dish 180 degrees before finishing the cooking process.
 Wait 5 minutes before transferring the cooked cod fillets onto individual serving platters.

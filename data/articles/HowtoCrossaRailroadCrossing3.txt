 It is illegal to cross railroad tracks at any other location besides a designated pedestrian crossing. If you are not at a pedestrian crossing, walk at a safe distance away from the tracks until you locate one. There should be a sign and/or a ramp for pedestrians to safely cross.Crossing at an illegal location risks your safety, as well as a ticket or fine that can range from $500 or $6000.
 Stop at the pedestrian crossing even if there are no signs of an approaching train. Look both ways down the track to look for a train. Signs of a train are flashing lights, a lowered crossing gate, and bells or whistles. Wait at the designated pedestrian crossing if a train is coming. If not, slowly cross with caution if you are sure it is safe.Not every pedestrian crossing will have lights or bells to warn you. If the crossing does not, look both ways down the tracks and listen for a train.
Stand at a safe distance away from the tracks. You should stand at least 10 feet away from the tracks.
 Wait for the train to completely pass. Do not cross until you are sure that another train is not following. If there is a pedestrian crossing gate, wait until it is lifted to cross. There should be no more lights flashing or bells sounding. Look both ways once more before you cross.Do not listen to music while at a railroad crossing. Music can inhibit your ability to hear bells and/or whistles.
Hundreds of people die every year on railway tracks. Do not play, sit, or walk directly on the tracks. A train takes at least a mile to stop, so it may not be able to stop in time if you are on the railway tracks.Do not try to hop aboard the passing train. You will risk serious injury or death.

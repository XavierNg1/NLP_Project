 This article relies on the previous accomplishment of the article preceding it, How to Create the One Sphere Pattern in Microsoft Excel. Please complete that first before attempting this one., Save the workbook into a logical file folder.;
, The first one creates the line the chart will follow.


Enter 63 to cell AD1 and Format Cell Number Number Custom "Degrees "0.00 and Insert Name Define name Degrees to cell $AD$1. 90 degrees is a problem, as is 0 and 180 and 360, but otherwise, it works well..
Enter Slope into cell AE1 and into cell AE2 Insert Name Define Name Slope to cell $AE$2 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=TAN(Degrees*PI()/180)"
Enter Factor_Up into cell AF1 and enter w/o spaces 2.102 594 6851 1947 into cell AF2 and enter =2.43189347013788*S_COUNT/24 into cell AF3.
Enter b_ into cell AG1 and enter w/o spaces -0.939 692 620 785 908 into cell AG2. Enter b_YN into cell AG3 and N into cell AG4 and Insert Name Define b_YM to cell $AG$4 and b_ to cell $AG$2. Enter 0 into cell AG2.
Enter New x  into cell AE6 and New y into cell AF6.
Enter 0 into cell AE7 and Format Fill yellow and do Font red bold and centered horizontal. Enter "=1+COS(Degrees*PI()/180)" into cell AE1447 and Format Fill yellow and do Font red bold and centered horizontal.Edit Go To cell range AE8:AE1446 and with AE8 active enter the formula w/o quotes "=($AE$1447-$AE$7)/1439+AE7" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range AF7:AF1447 and enter w/o quotes with AF7 active the formula "=Factor_Up*(Slope*AE7)+IF(b_YN="N",0,b_)". Factor_Up will stretch or shrink the line in theory for its y values. The b-intercept may be set to 0 in b_ or negated via N in b_YN while retaining a previous value in b_, or both.
Select AG1448 and enter Min, AG1449 and enter Max, AG1450 and enter Goal, AG1451 and enter Bu changing Factor_Up, and select AG1452 and enter Goal by changing b_.
Select AE1448 and enter "=MIN(AE7:AE1447)" and select AE1449 and enter "=MAX(AE7:AE1447)". Copy AE1448:AE1449 and Paste to AF1448. Select AF1450 and enter 6, then enter into cell AF1451 "=AF1450-AF1447" which is the set to zero cell, when we want to change AF7 (it has to be a value first) to equal 0 by changing Factor_Up.
Select cell AE1452 and enter "=1-AE7" which is what we want to equal zero when we want cell AE7 to equal 1 (therefore the line would start at {1,0} instead of at {0,0}) -- it's there for user discretion and is utilized by changing AE7 simply to 1 now -- it used to also depend on Factor_Up or b_. Select cell AF1452 and enter "=0-AF7" which is the Goal when we want to change AF7 to 0 by changing b_.
Select cell AD1454 and enter Chart has, then select cell AE1454 and input 1440, then select AF1454 and enter rows. Select AD1455 and enter Divided by, and select AE1455 and enter 24 and select AF1455 and enter Spheroids. Enter Equals into cell AD1456 and "=AE1454/AE1455" into cell AE1456, with the answer being 60.
Enter 3 in cell AE1457 and into cell AD1457 enter Number of Spheroids to Chart and Format Cells Font bold size 14 and alignment right. Aligned left, select cell AB1458 and enter the formula with quotes ="So if "&AE1457&" Spheroids are wanted, then adjust the series in the chart formula bar to the first "&AE1456*AE1457&" rows."
 and Format cells Font bold size 12. By calculation, the user may select which three spheroids to chart, adjusting for the fact that the series starts in row 7. So, if for example, the last 3 spheroids were wanted, the user would subtract 180 from 1447 and chart only that row (1267) up to row 1447. The user would then adjust the axes according to the demands of the rest of their graphic layout. Changing the number of spheroids in S_Count works, but only over a limited range of values -- this solution always works.
 In the time it'd take to find which articles it's in and hope the reader has done one, it can be done already.

Check the formula in I7 is =G7*GMLL*Sync1
Check the formula in J7 is =F7*GMSL*Sync2
Check the formula in K7 is =G7*GMSL*Sync2
The lookup tables have not changed, except for the following, perhaps:
Check the value in cell U4, ADJ_Y is 0.141592653589793
The value in FFF, cell AA7, should read 60.
NEW? Under Radius in column Z  are variable amounts. The formula in cell Z7 is =ROUND(((X7-V7)^2+(Y7-W7)^2)^0.5,4) and this is relatively the same in Z8 and Z1447.
Check for errors. If there are any, there are none in the example workbook. Please see the Warnings section below for help, if or as needed.



Edit Go To cell range F7:G1447 and, using either the Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter-Smoothed Line Scatter. A chart will appear atop the data unless using Chart Wizard, in which case a new Chart sheet will appear.
Assuming the former case, Copy or Cut the chart from atop the data and paste it to the Chart worksheet, then expand it by hovering over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and clicking to drag the Chart Area until about a 6" wide by 4" tall rectangle is formed.
Using Chart Layout, select the Horizontal Axis and set Minimum to -1.5  Maximum to 3.0, Major unit to 1.5. Minor unit to .3 and Vertical Axis crosses at 0.0, in Base 10, OK.
Using Chart Layout, select the Vertical Axis and set Minimum to -1, Maximum to 7, Major unit to 1.0. Minor unit to .3 and Vertical Axis crosses at 0.0, in Base 10, OK. It's done according to Min Max row formulas at the bottom of columns F and G or AE and AF kept there for just such an occasion.
The axes may now be safely eliminated as well as any grid lines and legend.
 Your chart should resemble the one above.

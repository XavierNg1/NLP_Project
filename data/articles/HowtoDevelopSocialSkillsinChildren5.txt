 It is important to target specific things in the classroom. Choose a skill and set a goal for the children to reach. The skill might be something like waiting until discussion is finished to sharpen a pencil. While this seems trivial, it teaches children to respect and listen to what someone else is saying.Be sure that you are choosing skills that are within the children’s ability to understand. Skills for kindergarteners will be different from sixth graders, for example.
 Children may not say that they like rules, but this is what they need to be successful. For the pencil sharpening example, the rule might be something like “You may only sharpen your pencils when everyone has finished speaking.” The children will understand the rule and begin to follow it, though they may need reminded from time to time.The “rule” takes the skill from being merely a suggestion of how to be courteous, to a clear message about what is expected.
 The first part of this is to role play. Pretend you are one of the children you teach and show them what you expect. The other part is to follow the rule yourself. If the children are not allowed to sharpen a pencil while you are talking to them, then you may not sharpen a pencil when they are talking to you., Have some “test runs” with your new rule. For example, you might give out a few unsharpened pencils and let the children try to sharpen them at appropriate times through the day. Do not punish them for mistakes, but coach them through what should have been done.It is important that the children are comfortable with the rule. If it appears that they do not understand after the first practice run, give it some time and do another one.
 Parents can do a lot to reinforce what is going on in the classroom. Most parents genuinely want to see their child do well. If you keep them informed about what is happening in the classroom and why, you’ll find that some of those behaviors will be modeled at home, too.

 Go to the next box on the “Sign-in & Security” page, which is titled, “Saved passwords”.
 This will bring up a prompt, asking you to re-enter your Google account password.


Each Website or app will have its password listed beside it.
In case you wish to see the password, click the “eye” icon.
In case you do not want Google to remember the password, simply click on the “X” sign.
Click “Undo” if you want to go back to how it originally was.

 A highly sensitive person is likely to notice their personality characteristics in social situations and interpersonal relationships. You might be an HSP if you experience the following:You are highly influenced by other’s moods
You are highly empathetic to people you know and those you don’t know
You are hyperaware of how your emotions, behaviors, and words affect others
You feel nervous when others are observing you complete a task or compete
You notice subtle differences in your surroundings that others tend not to notice
You feel over-stimulated in crowded social situations and feel the need to leave and spend time alone afterwards

, Persons who are highly sensitive are often more affected by their emotions than other people. Some emotional traits that characterize HSPs are:A tendency to retreat into inner thoughts
A deep connection to art or music
The tendency to frighten or startle easily
An inability to adapt to life changes
Becoming easily overwhelmed by tasks or deadlines

, Though many of the traits of an HSP are emotional or social, there are also some physical traits involved. These may be tied to the fact that people with HSP tend to have a more sensitive nervous system, which affects both their emotions and their bodies. You may experience the following physical symptoms as an HSP:Acute sensitivity to pain
Feeling overwhelmed by loud sounds, bright lights, or strong smells
Being greatly affected by medications, stimulants (coffee), or alcohol
Reacting strongly to hunger (reduced concentration or poor mood)

, Highly sensitive people have characteristics that should be embraced as valuable. If you are an HSP, you are able to pick up on things that other people miss. You are likely able to avoid or spot errors that others miss, concentrate for long periods of time, express yourself creatively, and execute fine motor movements very well. Additionally, many people who are HSP are skilled at self-reflection and self-awareness, instinctively understand the needs and emotions of others, and easily sense verbal and nonverbal social cues. These are important skills that can be marketable.

 Consider the amount of storage available. At the lower end of the market a 512mb to 1Gb player will generally hold up to 200 songs. If you have a large music collection then you should look for devices that offer at least 20 GB's of storage. In general every 10 GB's will hold around 2,900 MP3 files;
, If you have an active lifestyle then you will need a player that is small and compact. If you intend to use your player whilst jogging or whilst training in the gym, then a flash-based system will be a better choice as they contain no moving parts and therefore won't skip.
 Will it be easy to access and use on the move or will it require 100% of your attention to choose your songs? This is one area that is often overlooked and is often a source of dissatisfaction among users.
 Many MP3 players come with built in rechargeable batteries. These are very convenient and can last for a long time, but if you are not able to recharge them or don't have access to a computer with a USB port then you will need to wait Till the player gets all charged up again!!.
 Most MP3 players come with headphones but usually they are not very good quality. Investing in a new pair may improve sound quality. If you use your MP3 player in the car then consider an in car charger.

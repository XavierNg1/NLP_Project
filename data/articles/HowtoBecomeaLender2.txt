 For almost all individual would-be lenders, the best way to effective lending is through Internet micro lending services (also called peer to peer lending) that help small lenders find interested borrowers. Take a look at these sites and familiarize yourself with all of the rules and regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings later.Popular micro lending sites include Kiva, Prosper and Lending Club.
Some of the reasons people are looking to borrow through micro loans include:Pay off credit cards at a lower interest rate
Start a small business or expand an existing one
Finance a creative project such as a film, music or artwork
Finance a wedding, car repair or consolidate other loans



, In a similar method as the ones used by big lenders, micro-lending sites often "rate" borrowers according to answers they give on a questionnaire. This way lenders can match borrowers that meet their desired level of risk. Generally, you'll be picking a "basket" of loans and betting that the majority of them will not default, or in other words, be unable to repay.


Riskier borrowers will be charged a higher interest rate.
 When you have your desired loan recipients picked out, you should be able to seal the deal on micro lending sites using their proprietary tools and paperwork. When these are all finished, you will actually be a lender, able to collect income payments to boost your total investment portfolio.
 Rather than loaning money to a single borrower, in a lending club you invest in notes, or $25 portions. This way your investment is spread across hundreds of loans, while the borrowers' loans are funded by many different investors.

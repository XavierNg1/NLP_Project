 Chances are, you already have dishwashing detergent around your home. If not, buy any brand of dishwashing detergent from a supermarket. Look for a mild detergent. Mix one cup of detergent with two cups of water in a bucket, or double that amount if you will be cleaning many or large surfaces. A few brands that offer mild detergents are Ajax, Dawn, and Palmolive. A mild detergent will lather when mixed with water.This method works best on woodwork that has been painted, enameled, or varnished. Detergent may turn lacquer and shellac white as they absorb water., Use a rag or cloth and dip it into the bucket. Wring the rag out to remove excess water. Excess water soaks into the surface and causes damage. The rag should be moist when you have finished wringing it out.Make sure to test the detergent on a small, hidden part of the woodwork. If it mars the surface, try another method of cleaning.
 Rub the moist rag over the surface of the woodwork. You can rub in small, gentle circles, but avoid rough scrubbing. The detergent needs time to break down the grease and wax. Allow a few minutes for the cleaner to set on the woodwork. Re-wipe the surface once it has sat with the same cloth.Do not allow the detergent to sit for too long, or excess water will soak into the wood.
 Take a clean cloth that has not exposed to the cleaner and run some water over it. Wring it out until it is damp. Use the cloth to wipe the surface. This removes the detergent from the woodwork. Then, take a dry paper towel or cloth and wipe the damp surface until it is dry.You should completely dry the woodwork on your own rather than leaving it to dry.

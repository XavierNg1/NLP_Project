 The master part is the item that you will use to create the mold.


To prepare the master part, first wipe down or wash the item.
Once clean and dry, apply a release agent to the original item—this will ensure that the master part will pop free from the mold.
Coat the item with a layer of bubble buster—this product prevents the formation of air bubbles around the master part.
Place the master item into a heat safe container. The container must be slightly larger than the item.;
, Reusable molding material is easy to use and mistake proof; you can melt, mold, cast, and de-cast reusable molding material up to 35 times. Place the container of reusable molding material into a microwave. Follow the instructions on the product to properly melt the materials.


Heat the material for short intervals, roughly 15 to 20 seconds, until you understand how the microwave affects the materials.
If you do not have a microwave, you may use a double boiler., Carefully pour the melted molding material over the master part. Allow the product to cool and harden. Gently remove the mold from the heat safe container and the master part from the mold.

 On April 25th, you can join the movement and help to spread awareness by staying silent for a whole day. The goal is for each participant to raise $25 for the cause by the silence, but simply refraining from speaking is a start.
 If there is not, you can start your own group. All you need is:


Others who support the cause
A meeting place (school, library, coffee shop, house, park etc.) and a time.
 One great event is Gulu walk. It is held every year to raise money and awareness for the growing situation in Uganda.


You will have now learned about the situation in Uganda, spread awareness and assembled a core group of willing and dedicated members of your task force.

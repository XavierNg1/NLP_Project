 When you can press your fingernail into a squash without denting its surface, that means the squash are ripe. It's important to wait until the surface is tough - otherwise, the squash will go bad quickly.
 If you wait too long to harvest the squash, and they get exposed to a frost, they will rot more quickly than they would have if you harvested them before the temperature dropped. Plan to harvest them before the weather turns.
 Use a sharp knife to cut them from the vines, leaving a few inches of stem intact. Take them inside right away and rinse the dirt from their surfaces. There's no need to leave them outside to cure.
 Fully mature butternut squash will keep for months in storage. Store your squash in a cool, dry place and enjoy it all winter long. When you're ready to enjoy your squash, read the following articles to find out more:

 Launch the Google Maps app. Search for the address of the place you'd like to add.
 If this option is available in your region, you can access it in one of two ways:


Touch the menu icon, then select "Add a missing place."Tap directly on the address to bring up a description. If it doesn't have a name, touch "Add a missing place.", The place name, address, and category are all required fields. Phone number and website are optional, but useful if the location is a business. Once you submit this form, the map moderators will review it for accuracy and add it to the map. You should receive an email once this happens.

 To create a sturdy rope swing you’ll need a 36" 2x8 wooden board. Make sure the wood you use is strong like Oak or Walnut. You’ll also need two seat reinforcements that should be the same type of wood and 4” of 2x8. For a long lasting swing, pressure treat the wood before constructing.You’ll also need the following tools:


Saw
Drill
Nails
Hammer
Measuring tape
Pencil or marker
Lighter or matches
Two climbing carabiners;
, Measure 36 inches of 2x8 and mark it. Saw the main seat out of the 2x8 and then measure out two 4” blocks. Saw off your reinforcement blocks. You can also go to the hardware store with your measurements and they’ll cut the dimensions quickly., Align the 4” blocks at the two ends of the main seat so that the corners are smooth. Position the wood so the two reinforcements are underneath the seat. Use your hammer to apply two nails on each side.If you want to be more secure, you can add more nails to the reinforcements.
 Use a drill to create two ¾” holes on each side. Drill through both the seat and the reinforcements. The holes should be evenly spaced on each side. Use a marker and measuring tape to ensure you create even holes.

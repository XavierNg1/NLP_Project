 It’s important to have criteria that is written and defined. Don’t just pick people because they seem cool. Have a defined set of criteria like GPA, community service, and any other qualities you want in your members. You should never discriminate based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or anything else.
 Pledge processes often have a bad reputation for hazing. That’s not necessary. A good pledge process should be one that determines whether or not the prospective new members are a good fit for your Fraternity. Use this process to educate them about your group's values.


A good pledge process should allow the members of your fraternity to get to know your pledges and vice versa. This way both of you will be able to judge if the pairing is a good fit. You should hold a lot of events with pledges that fit the values of your fraternity so that the pledges can see what life would be like inside the fraternity. For example, if your fraternity is based on political activism, maybe you could ask your pledges to organize and execute a protest or event bringing awareness to a certain issue your fraternity finds important.
 Initiate those pledges with customized rituals that embody your Fraternity's values. Initiation rituals are great ways to build friendship and add legitimacy to your fraternity.
 If you are starting a new fraternity you will probably be struggling for money, especially since you will only have young alumni for a long period of time. Developing an annual alumni event is a great way to keep in touch with your alumni. Hopefully you can convince them to make some donations!Events like pig roasts or sports games are great examples of alumni events.

 When you are walking with your dog around bodies of water, keep them on a leash. This protects them from running off into potentially dangerous water, especially before you have a chance to make sure it is safe.A leash also protects them from other dangers, like predators and getting lost or separated from you.
 Taking your dog with you on my your boat, kayak, or canoe can be fun for you and your dog. However, your dog may be at risk if the kayak or canoe flips, or if your boat capsizes. To help protect your dog, even if they are a good swimmer, put a life jacket on your dog any time they are in a boat.You can find pet life jackets at pet stores.
 Before you let your dog free in the lake, river, or ocean, you should figure out if they can swim. If they cannot, then don’t force them into the water. You and your dog can have fun splashing around.If your dog is new to water and swimming, get them used to water slowly. You may consider swimming lessons from a professional dog trainer.
 If you have your dog in your boat, consider putting a pet ramp on the boat. This helps your dog be able to get in and out of the water easily so you can keep them safe while still letting them have fun swimming.Always help your dog in and out of the boat, even if you have a pet ramp. Always watch to make sure they’re safe.

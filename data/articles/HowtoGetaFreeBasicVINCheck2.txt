 This is the "free VIN Check service" provided by the National Insurance Crime Bureau, and issues free reports on cars that have current records of theft" or "have an outstanding title brand".


If you're looking for a mechanical history report, or trying to figure out how many past owners a used vehicle has had, this free service will not provide the information you're looking for. That information is only available for a fee.
The NICB no longer reports if the vehicle has a lien on it (as they did before), so be sure to verify with the DMV that the title belongs to the person selling the vehicle.
 If the vehicle in question was made after 1981 but has fewer or more than 17 numbers and letters in its VIN, it's generally a pretty good sign that the VIN has been faked. Stay away from purchasing this vehicle if possible.
 The verification code is a human detection service. After you've correctly entered the verification code, press "Search."


The verification code is case-sensitive, so be sure to use CAPS letters where needed.
 If the vehicle in question has an outstanding title brand or was recently reported stolen, read the short vehicle report based on that VIN.


If your car has never been reported stolen, or is relatively new, then the report will let you know that the vehicle has not been listed in the Theft Records (and/or) Total Loss Records database(s).
Remember, these records only show up if an accident or theft was "recorded" (and even then, it may take up to 6 months to show up in the database), so before you make the actual purchase, you will want to verify the information with the DMV.
You are restricted to 5 VIN Check searches from a single IP address per day.

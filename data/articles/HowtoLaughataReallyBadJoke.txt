 Who has told the bad joke? Is it a friend? Your crush? Your boss? You may need to laugh more/less depending on the person and their status. If the person always tells bad jokes, sometimes it's better to just nudge them and say something like "dude that joke was awful!" and then laugh. Be sure not to offend them though.;
, It's easier to laugh if you are smiling because you feel happier. Start laughing and show the other person that you liked their joke. You don't have to drag out the laugh, just chuckle for a few seconds depending on how funny the joke was supposed to be.
 If there is something or someone that always makes you smile, think of that. It's better to laugh at something completely different than come across as fake.
 This will let the person know that you still think the joke was funny.
 Saying something like "oh come on!" or "Really? That's not funny!" and then laughing after might actually be quite funny. Only do this if the person wasn't trying to impress you or was trying to tell a bad joke. Never do this if the person thought the joke was funny themselves, they may get offended.

 As soon as you bring your puppy home, you should begin training them. Establish a pattern from the beginning by bringing your outside to see if they need to go potty.Unless you are feeding, training, or playing with your Basset, use a baby gate to confine your puppy to a small section of the house, like the laundry room, for the first few days. This will enable you to supervise and monitor your puppy to see when your puppy needs to use the restroom.
Signs that a puppy needs to potty are sniffing the floor, circling while sniffing the floor, and/or whining.;
, Because puppies do not have full control of their bladders yet, taking your puppy outside frequently to use the restroom is very important. Taking them outside every half hour to go potty when they are 8 to 12 weeks old will begin to establish the boundaries for urinating and defecating. Once your puppy has gone potty outside, reward the correct behavior with praise and treats.Also, take your puppy outside after naps, meals, and after play time to use the restroom.
 Dogs are unlikely to soil the areas where they sleep, like their crates. A crate will teach your puppy to control their bladder and bowels. However, keeping your puppy in their crate for too long will increase the likelihood that they will have an accident in their crate. Therefore, only keep your puppy in their crate for short periods of time, for example, an hour at most.If your Basset has an accident while in their crate, take them outside immediately. This will encourage and further solidify the association between eliminating and outside. Make sure to clean the area with an odor neutralizer to prevent your puppy from eliminating in the same spot again.

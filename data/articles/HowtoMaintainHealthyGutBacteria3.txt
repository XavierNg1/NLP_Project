 You can get plenty of probiotics from the foods that you eat, as long as you make good food choices. If you are unable to eat certain foods or if you are concerned that you are not getting enough probiotics from food, then you may want to consider a probiotic supplement.


Make sure to discuss taking probiotics with your doctor if you are on any medications or if you are being treated for something.
 Make sure that you check the label for important information and also look for a “USP Verified” seal on the bottle. The USP seal indicates that a non-profit lab, the USP, has checked the product and found that the bacteria and other ingredients listed on the label is what is in the bottle. Some other things to look for include:company name and contact information
the recommended dose
strain, genus, and species of the probiotic
expiration date that also mentions how many organisms will be alive by that date

, Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the supplements that you are taking. You can also ask your physician for advice. Since it may take a while for your body to balance out the bacteria after you finish a round of antibiotics, it is a good idea to use probiotics for a month after you are finished taking the antibiotics.

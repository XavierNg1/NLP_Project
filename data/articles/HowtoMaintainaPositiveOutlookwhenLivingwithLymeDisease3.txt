 The more you know about your condition, the more confident you’ll feel when making decisions about your treatment. Search the internet for information about Lyme disease and educate yourself about the various treatment options available to you.Make sure that you are getting your information from reputable websites backed by research, such as the Center for Disease Control, LymeDisease.org, or the Mayo Clinic.
Never change your treatment based on information found online without first checking in with your doctor.
Blogs and chat rooms can help provide support, but if you find that they make you worried or upset about your symptoms, you may not want to read them.
 You can’t get rid of your disease, but you can empower yourself to manage it effectively. Regain a sense of control over your health by building habits that improve your well-being.For instance, instead of resenting the fact that you can’t eat sugary foods anymore, focus on how much better you feel when you make nutritious food choices.
 Mindfulness, or the practice of giving your full attention to the present moment, can help you cultivate a sense of peaceful acceptance in your life. To build the habit of mindfulness, try incorporating yoga, meditation, or journaling into your daily routine. You can also practice mindfulness by slowing down and immersing yourself in an activity like taking a walk or eating a meal.
Mindfulness may be difficult at first. Do not get discouraged. With practice, you will find it becoming easier over time. It can take a while to retrain your brain to operate differently.
 If you’re having trouble adjusting to life with a chronic condition, make an appointment with a mental health professional. Therapy can be a good way to process the changes and new emotions that go along with a diagnosis of Lyme disease.Look for a therapist who has experience working with people who have chronic conditions.
You may want to look for a therapist that emphasizes pain management.

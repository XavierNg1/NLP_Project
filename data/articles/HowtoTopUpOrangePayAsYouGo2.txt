 If you don’t have a credit or debit card linked to your Orange account, you can walk in and purchase a Top-Up voucher from any store such as Tesco.


There are many denominations to choose from: £5, £10, £15, £20, £30, £40, and £50.
The voucher will contain a 12-digit code.
 You will hear a voice recording on the other end requesting you to enter the 12-digit code on the voucher.
 When you’re done, press the pound (#) key to enter the code you typed in.


The value of the voucher you purchased should be credited into your account.

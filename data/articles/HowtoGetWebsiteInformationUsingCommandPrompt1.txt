 This is usually done by one of the following methods:


Going to Start >> All Programs >> Accessories >> Command Prompt on Windows Vista/7. According to your settings, in older systems (XP, 2000, etc), you might find "Accessories" directly on "Start"
Go to Start >> Run and then type cmd in the run dialog and press Enter.

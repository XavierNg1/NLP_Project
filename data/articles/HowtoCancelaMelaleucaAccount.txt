 To begin the cancellation process, you must call the customer service and enrollment department of Melaleuca at 1-800-262-0600. After providing the representative with your member identification number, explain to them that you wish to cancel your account. This is required so that Melaleuca has a record of your initial cancellation request. You should also keep a record of this call, or at least note down the name of the representative, time, and date in case you need to refer back to it later.;
, Click through until you get to the cancellation form. The form will contain the following:


Your complete name. If there are other names associated with your business/account, then you should include those as well.
The address to which your products are delivered.
Your contact number.
The business kit number.
A personal message. This message should detail your reasons for wanting to cancel your account. If your membership is less than 120 days old, you can also request a refund on your enrollment fee.
 Mail to: Melaleuca, 3910 S Yellowstone, Idaho Falls, Idaho, 83402. If you fail to fail to mail the letter in well before the 25th, you'll be held accountable for the next month's worth of purchases. Alternatively, fax it to 888-528-2090 so they will process it faster.
 After an appropriate waiting period, call 1-800-262-0600 to ensure that your cancellation has been processed. If your account has not been updated, ask that the issue be handled immediately. If Melaleuca has received your letter but it has not been processed, the representative who signed for the package is responsible. See if s/he can be tracked down. Do not hang up until your account has been canceled or an agreement is reached. If the latter, followup in a day or two to avoid continuing charges to your credit card. As always, keep a record of the call (at the very least, record the date and time and the person you're speaking to).

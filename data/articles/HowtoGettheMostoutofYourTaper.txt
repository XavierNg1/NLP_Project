 Most swimmers start tapering a week or two before Meet. Most coaches will know what's best for you.;
, After beginning your taper, you'll probably find yourself full of energy. Don't go out and run 10 miles (16Â km) just because you feel like you can or stay up all night. Go to bed at your normal time and try not to exert yourself.
 Don't eat too much because since your practices will be getting easier, you won't burn calories as quickly. Snack on fruits, vegetables, and anything high in protein and carbs. Cut down on sugar and sweets.
 The reasons should be obvious. NO SODAS!!!!!

, Keep going through your days as you would without being on taper. This means eating around the same time and going to bed at a reasonable hour. Try not to do anything drastically different from your normal daily life.
 Don't spend the whole day just lounging around and watching t.v. Get up and stretch a little and do a couple crunches.
 If you always go to pool on a Friday, go! Even if you have to race later that afternoon. Do a couple of long swims and get yourself stretched out. Stretch again right before the race.

 You will need a 12 cc syringe, a soft rubber feeding tube, and a 16-inch urethral catheter with a diameter of 5 French (for small dogs) and 8 French (for large dogs). These are the items you will use to create your feeding tube device. You will also need puppy milk replacer that contains goats milk, like ESBILAC®.


You can also buy an already assembled feeding tube from your local veterinary office or pet store.;
, You will need to determine the puppy’s weight so that you know how much milk replacer to give him. Place him on a scale to determine his weight. For every ounce of the puppy’s weight, give him 1 cc or ml of the milk replacer.
 Add one extra cc to be careful. You will want to heat the milk replacer up so that it is easier on the puppy’s stomach. Place the milk into the microwave for three to five seconds so that it reaches a lukewarm temperature.
 Draw the milk up until you have the measured amount of milk, plus one extra cc. The extra cc will be used to ensure that puppy doesn’t get any air bubbles, which could cause bloating or gas pain.


Once the syringe has drawn up all of the milk replacer, press down gently until a tiny drop comes out of the syringe. Doing this will ensure that the syringe is working properly.
 You will need to attach the end of the rubber feeding tube to the end of the syringe.
 To do this, place the tip of the rubber tube up against the side of the puppy’s bottom, or last, rib, and run the tube from there to the tip of the pup’s nose. Pinch the tube where it touches the puppy’s nose and make a mark there with a permanent marker.

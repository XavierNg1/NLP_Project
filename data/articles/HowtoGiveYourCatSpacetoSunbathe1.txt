 If your cat enjoys sunbathing, then it is important to make sure that there is a comfortable place for your cat to sit near a window. For example, you can situate your furniture, such as a chair or couch near the window. This will give your cat a spot to rest and access sunlight. Alternatively, you could situate cat furniture, such as a cat tree, or cat bed close to the window. Your cat will likely seek out these spots and you can make this easier by ensuring that comfortable furniture is positioned in well-lit places., Some cats like to stretch out in a ray of sunlight on the floor. You can help facilitate this by ensuring that there is empty floor space available near your cat's favourite window. Alternatively, you can place an area rug or cat bed on the floor where the light is present. This is a great spot for your cat to curl up and sunbathe.

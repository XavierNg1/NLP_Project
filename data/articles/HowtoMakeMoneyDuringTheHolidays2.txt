 Some people hate shopping for gifts and will be more than willing to provide you with a list and some money.


Be willing to do some grocery shopping too. People will be stocking their pantries for holiday celebrations and may need help or want to avoid trips to the grocery store.
 Make yourself available for gift wrapping.


Charge a premium for providing your own gift wrapping materials such as paper, gift bags, tissue paper, boxes, tape, bows and ribbons.
 Offer to drop off gifts, food and any other packages people and businesses might need to have transported across town.
 Keep your car clean and detailed and offer to drive people wherever they need to go.


Market your driving services to people who need a ride to and from holiday parties as well as anyone who need transportation to the airport.
 Try menu planning or Christmas card design. Think about what you do well and try to turn it into a money-making idea.


Create ingredient jars. Most people have given or received one of those jars filled with dry ingredients and a cookie recipe. Put together a few of these on your own and sell them to people as gifts.
Write letters to Santa. Get some pretty holiday paper from an office supply store and offer to write letters to children from Santa. Parents and adults can provide you with the child's name, age and a few things on his or her list.
Bake cookies. If you are an expert baker, consider making and selling holiday cookies. People can buy them from you by the dozen or by the tray for their festivities and parties.
 Use the Internet, word of mouth and flyers or postcards to promote what you do.

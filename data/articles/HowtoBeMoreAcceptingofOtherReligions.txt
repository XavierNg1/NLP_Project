 Your way may not be the only way - just like you can't expect your music tastes or favorite food to appeal to all, you cannot expect that everyone will be drawn to your religion, or any religion at all for that matter.;
, Every religion has questions that cannot be answered. This is why faith is necessary - to keep you from giving up when something doesn't make sense.
 This is extremely hypocritical. You are making someone feel bad about themselves because they don't agree with you. No one should have another's beliefs forced upon them.
 If you meet a person of another religion that is also kind, why try to change them? If you meet an Atheist that is honest, kind and pleasant and try to say he/she is a bad person because he/she does not believe in what you do, who is being irrational: you, or them?

, Study the books of major religions carefully, and you will be surprised by the number of views and fables that are similar to your own religion (with different characters, of course.)

, What does it represent? What is the symbolic meaning of all steps and objects involved?

Or you can have you hands like this:
Green = Use your Index Finger to reach over
Red = Index Finger
Yellow = Middle Finger
Blue = Ring Finger
Orange = Pinkie Finger. You Decide which position is best for you.
 Work on the song and you should be able to nail the intro and some of the verses and choruses. If you don't get the solo, then that's fine.
 Once you beat it, then you'll be fine.
 It will make you miss less notes.
 You should be able to do it, just make sure they're easy songs like "Slow Ride," "Rock and Roll all Night," and even "Bulls on Parade."

 To build a noose, the most effective material to use is wire.You can use anything as long as it's flexible and not too thin or brittle. It must quickly and easily tighten. There are a number of wire types you can choose from:


Craft wire
Headphone wire
Stripped wires from cars
An uncoiled spring;
, Make sure it's strong enough to hold a small (5-8 lbs; 2.5-3.5 kg) animal. If it snaps under your own strength, it probably won't work. The following items are suitable for a snare trap if you don't have or can't find wire near you.


Shoelaces
Dental floss
Fishing line

, That means stringy tree bark and plant fibers. It's going to be more work, but if primitive cultures did it, so can you.


Milkweed
Dogbane
Cattail, A snare can be used day or night, rain or shine, and in any climate. All you need to make sure of is that animals pass by more than once in a blue moon. Placing random snares with no eye for signs of small game is a waste of time.


Look for signs of game in droppings, shelters, tracks, scratches, and signs of feeding.
A significant source of water and food for the area is a safe bet as well.
 Now that you've found the general area you want to build your snare in, look above you. What sort of trees do you have to work with? The tree will be the beef of your machinery.


Find a sapling (a young tree) that is strong enough yet bendy. Keep in mind, it must be able to hold the game high in the air until you find it.
If no saplings are around, look for a large tree limb and decent-sized rock. This is an alternate method that uses the same idea but doesn't require a bendable, well-placed sapling.

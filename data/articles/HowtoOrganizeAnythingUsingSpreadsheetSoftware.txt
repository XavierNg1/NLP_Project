 It may seem silly, but start off by taking all the cases off the shelves (or wherever you store your collection). This will help to visualize how everything will look when it goes back on the shelves.;
, As you are taking items off the shelves, begin to think about how to organize the collection. Experiment with the piles to find a system that suits you best. In this case, the collection is being sorted into what system they can be played on (with a few DVDs thrown in for good measure).
 Choose where to place each category and place that category in neatly. If a section doesn’t fit, experiment! Once again, feel free to play around with your collection to find your favorite configuration.


If your shelf has some extra depth, use it to your advantage! Proudly display your favorite items up front, while pushing the not so desirable objects in the back. This has the bonus of letting you utilize all that space on the shelves.
 Aside from the name, feel free to add or remove headings, as you like it. Now, highlight that header and the row below it, and create a table.


In Excel 2010, on the home tab, click format as table, and select a style of table. Make sure to select the “My table has headers” Checkbox.
 If you are unsure about anything, Google is your best friend. If you’re using Excel, the table will expand automatically, if you add a new column or row. Take your time, and don’t rush.
 If you’re using Excel, you might have noticed that there are small arrows beside each header. If not, go to data, and click on filter to make them appear. If you click on those arrows, you can sort and filter through the entire table. Very useful If you’re looking for a specific game or movie!

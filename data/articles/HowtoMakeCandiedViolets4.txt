 Store in an airtight glass container. If you need to layer the flowers, place a layer of baking paper between each layer to prevent the candied violets from sticking together. Keep in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight.
 The candied violets are ready for serving any time wanted. They are great as a treat on their own or as a garnish next to a slice of cake and coulis.

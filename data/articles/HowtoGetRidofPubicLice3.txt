 You want to use hot water and dry the clothes for at least 20 minutes on high. Borax detergent has also been found to kill lice in bedding and towels., If you cannot wash something, like a stuffed animal or fragile clothing, seal it in an air-tight bag for at least 72 hours to suffocate the lice., If you share a bed with someone or have had a sexual partner in the last few weeks, have them apply lice treatment now to prevent an infection later.
 This may be difficult, but you need to let people know about your situation so they can treat themselves and prevent spreading the disease. Avoid future sexual contact until you have completely treated the problem.
 You do not need to throw out all of your furniture, burn your blankets, and buy a new wardrobe. Public lice will die without a human host after 48 hours, so if you contain the infected people, wash all the bedding, and follow treatment directions you can prevent an outbreak of public lice with ease.

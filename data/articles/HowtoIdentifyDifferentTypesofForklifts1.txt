 Although not always considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries.

Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised.;
, Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries.Â 

Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.
 Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are not usually considered a forklift. However, they still closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms/mini warehouses, small scale warehousing, etc.

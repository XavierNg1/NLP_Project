, If your friends think of a question you know the answer to, proceed to the next step, otherwise, just enter "Jud, please answer:" and fill in the question. Jud will answer with a general answer such as "I cannot establish a spiritual link". Not a problem, just try again and when you come up with a question to which you know the answer, just go to the next step.
 In the beginning of the petition box, type a period (full stop). This is where the magic will happen, instead of a period being inserted into the petition box, you will see a capital "J", as illustrated below.
 Notice how the petition continues to "fill itself out" as you type your answer.
 You are now out of the "answer mode", which means anything you type after the second period (full stop) will appear on the screen. Now, complete the missing portion of the standard petition.


Note: When you enter a colon ( ':' ), the cursor will automatically move to the "Question" box

, For this example, we will use the fictitious question "Who was this how-to made for?". Once you type the question mark ( '?' ), the answer box will appear, and your answer will be displayed.
 Undoubtedly, they will want to ask another question, in which case, simply click on the "New Question" link and repeat these steps again.

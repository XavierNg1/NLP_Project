 He was definitely the most handsome of the classic series Doctors, and dressed very well too. You can find his costume online, or if you want to put it together yourself, you'll need navy pants and a beige double breasted waistcoat, with a darker, long jacket. A fob watch would not go astray either.
 For the hair, you'll either need to grow really long, sexy hair and curl it, or get a rockstar style wig.
 If you want to dress like the Doctor from the Big Finish Audio series Dark Eyes, first off you need to listen to it. It's awesome, and secondly, you'll need a leather pea coat, with gold colored buttons.


Next in the Dark Eyes costume, you'll need a white crew neck t-shirt. Any white crew neck shirt will work as long as it has no graphics on it.
Get some well fitted black jeans.
Add a bag You'll need a brown messenger bag with a shoulder strap. Even an Indiana Jones bag could work easily.
If you have short hair, you're good.
 For the "Night of the Doctor" costume, you'll need to dress very similarly to the 1996 movie costume.


You'll need a green frock coat (preferably single-breasted but double-breasted works too)
For the belt, you'll need a regular old brown belt. You should cut it appropriately and add an S-link chain for the buckle.
You'll need beige colored pants (khakis work).
Brown boot spats/gaiters are also required, as this Doctor has a more steampunk look.
 You'll need a sonic screwdriver. Character Options has recently released a replica of the Eighth Doctor sonic for a fairly reasonable price. For the Dark Eyes sonic, you'll need to build your own as there are no replicas or models for sale - however, should you be desperate, you could simply use the Character Options replica.

 Cotton is king when it comes to comfortable underwear because it is breathable. That means moisture won’t be trapped in the fabric so your undies won’t get as sweaty and you won’t have to worry as much about bacterial and yeast infections.Because of the possibility of yeast infections, cotton underwear is a particularly good option for women.
Cotton underwear is also less likely to cause chafing or rashes.
 While cotton underwear’s breathability makes it more comfortable, it doesn’t always look smooth under clothing. For a slimmer, fit, opt for undies made from a stretchy, synthetic material, such nylon, Lycra, or spandex. Make sure that the crotch is lined with cotton, though, to ensure that you’re comfortable., Silk underwear definitely has a luxurious, sexy feel, but it doesn’t breathe as well as cotton. That means there’s a greater chance of moisture being trapped in your underwear, which can lead to infections. Only wear silk underwear on special occasions for the most comfortable feel.

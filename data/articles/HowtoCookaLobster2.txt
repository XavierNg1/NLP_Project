 Prepare to cook the lobster tails by heating your grill to medium high. Make sure the entire surface of the grill is evenly hot.


If you are broiling your lobster tails instead of grilling them, turn the broiler on to heat up your oven.
 Using a sharp pair of kitchen shears, cut lengthwise down the middle of the softer underside of the lobster shells. Insert metal skewers lengthwise through the meat of the lobster tails. Brush the tails with olive oil on both sides.
 Lay them across the grill cut side down and cook them for about five minutes, or until the shells turn bright red. Turn the tails over, cut side up. Sprinkle minced garlic, salt and pepper into the lobster meat, and top with a few spoonfuls of butter. Grill for an additional five minutes, or until the meat is no longer translucent.


If you are broiling your lobster tails instead of grilling them, complete this process in your oven. Broil them cut side down for five minutes, remove them from the oven and top with garlic, salt and pepper, and butter, and replace in the oven for five more minutes.
 Place each one on a plate and serve with melted butter and lemon wedges.

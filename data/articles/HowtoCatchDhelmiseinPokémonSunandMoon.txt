 Walk to the very end of the house, then go through the door to the outside.;
, The fisherman is not very important, but the fishing spot is, as it is the only place you can catch Dhelmise in the entire game! You will need the fishing rod from Lana in order to try and catch it.
 Dhelmise is a very rare find. There is only a 1% chance to catch it when the water is still, and a 10% chance when the spot is bubbling, so be patient!


A secret tip to maximize your chances of acquiring this elusive Pokémon is the door you went through. If you don't know, going through a door will reset the bubbling at the spot, so if you aren't lucky the first time you can keep going in and out of the house until you catch one.
 It has a low catch rate. You have a 3.3% chance to catch it with a normal Pokéball at full HP, and it has a catch rate of 25. For comparison, the catch rate for most Pokémon on the first route of the game is 255, meaning you'll need both luck and a lot of special Pokéballs!

, While it might be difficult, with enough patience and persistence you can have your very own Dhelmise to fight and train.

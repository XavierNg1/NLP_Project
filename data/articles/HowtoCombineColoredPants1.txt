 Black brings out the contrast in colored pants and goes with most colors. Avoid wearing black with brown, navy or beige pants.;
, A black, white or camel colored blazer looks good paired with cobalt, red, pink or other bright colors. It offsets the brightness of the pants with a professional work look.


Consider rolling up your blazer sleeves one or two inches to create a three-fourthâ€™s sleeve shirt.
Wear a white or matching neutral colored top beneath your blazer.
 Try the following combinations:


Wear pink, red, peach, plum and yellow with grey shirts or shoes.
Wear pumpkin orange, pastel pink, mint green, baby blue and olive green with brown shirts or shoes.
Wear red, lavender, turquoise and pale pink with beige and tan clothes and accessories.
Wear bright green, red, yellow and pink with navy tops and shoes.
 A neutral or patterned cardigan will be comfortable and professional. Try pairing a navy or black polka dot cardigan with bright red pants.
 The skirted top fans out over skinny or straight-legged pants, showing off curves. Choose a top in a neutral shade or a complimentary shade.
 A simply white button down shirt is a classic look with colored pants. For an extra preppy look, throw on a form fitting crew neck sweater in a coordinating color and let the tails and collar pop out.

 Backhand shots are when one swings the racket around their body with the back of the hand leading out in front. Your shot will have less power than a forehand shot, but backhands are still useful strokes.








Backhands are particularly useful when the ball is on the opposite side of your and your swinging hand.
Backhands are more difficult to master, especially for beginners and younger players with less hand and arm strength. Try practicing first with a two-handed backhand, detailed below, before attempting one-handed backhands.
 As you get read for your opponent to hit the ball to you, point your feet towards the net and keep you knees bent; hold the racket with both hands while facing the net.









Make a split step right before your opponent hits the ball by hopping about an inch off the court. Evenly divide your weight between both your legs.
After making the split step, pivot you left foot, take one step forward with your right foot, and turn your shoulders. All your weight should now be on your back foot, which will help generate power and speed when you make your shot.
 You can either use a one-handed or two-handed grip. The two-handed backhand uses a combination of two grips. 








For your dominant hand (right for right-handers) use a Continental grip. Point the grip to the right and hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket.
For your non-dominant hand use a Semi-Western grip. To achieve the Semi-Western grip, place the bottom knuckle of your non-dominant hand on the 8th bevel, pointing diagonally across your palm toward the heel of your hand and beneath your pinkie.
 Swing your arm and the racket to make contact with the tennis ball in front of your body.
 Extend the racket through the shot in the direction you are hitting the ball in one smooth motion, and then rotate your upper body through the shot and towards the net. When you finish, your racket should end up over your right shoulder.

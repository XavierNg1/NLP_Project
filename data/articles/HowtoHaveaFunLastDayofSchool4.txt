 It's important to maintain contact with those friends who you really like.


Throughout the school day, ask all of your friends for their numbers, and then write them in your yearbook or notebook.
Don't be embarrassed to ask your crush for his or her number. If they say no, don't worry about it; it's the last day of school. You won't have to see that person for another three months! If they say yes, then consider taking it a step further.
Ask your crush if they would want to go on a date, or maybe even try to sneak in a first kiss. Anything is possible, just don't do anything reckless.
 Sure, they gave you all that homework, all those boring lessons, and maybe a detention or two, but your teachers worked hard and surely taught you something valuable during the year. Show them your gratitude with a simple farewell. If you're at a loss for words, here are some examples of nice things to say to a few of your teachers:


"I appreciate all of your hard work this year. Thank you! Have a great summer."
"Sorry if I talked too much sometimes. I learned a lot from you. Goodbye!"
"Thanks so much, teacher!"

, Apologize to everyone--especially your enemies and teachers. You don't want to be guilty over a tiny squabble for the rest of your life do you? Plus it'll make people feel good. Be nice, you'll make other people happy. Don't complain, whine, be rude, or become upset. It might annoy other people.


Give your friends some big final hugs and tell them why they are special to you. Don't be surprised if a few tears are shed (bring some tissues if you are the crying type).
Keep your spirits up if you are feeling sad about leaving your school and your friends. Life goes on, and plus, you might see them sooner than you think.
 When the final bell rings, grab your bag, and make a mad dash out of the building! Enjoy your summer vacation and don't forget to read a few books.

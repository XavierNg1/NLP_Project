 Measure ½ cup (118mL) of water. Add three drops of detergent. As long as your tap water isn't contaminated, you can run the water from your sink.

, Place the measuring cup in the microwave. Set the timer for one minute. The cup will be hot when you remove it. Make sure you hold it by its handle to avoid getting burned., Place it in the water.

, Lay it on a clean paper towel. Try to balance it face up. If this isn't possible, hold it steady with your non-dominant hand./images/thumb/a/a9/Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-9.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-9.jpg

Keep the brush on the table with the bristles facing up. At the same time, keep the earbud mesh side down. This will allow the water and gunk to flow down and away from the earbuds., Hold a clean dry paper towel in your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand to dab the earbud on the towel. Continue to keep the bud mesh side down. The dabbing motion will force any excess water onto the paper towel.


When the first earbud is dry, repeat the cleaning and drying process on the other earbud.

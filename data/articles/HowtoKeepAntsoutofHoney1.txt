 When youâ€™re not using your honey or other sweeteners, make sure that any lids or seals are completely closed. This is the easiest way to prevent hordes of ants from going for a swim in your precious condiments., Honey is runny and notorious for leaving drips down the side of the jar or on counters. Any exposed honey will attract ants so clean up after you're done cooking or preparing food. Take a damp paper towel with a little dish soap and wipe down the honey jar and table and place any used utensils in the sink or dishwasher.
 Honey is best kept between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit and away from direct sunlight.A pantry or cupboard is usually the best place for honey as it won't be as affected by the elements. If your honey didn't come in an airtight container, relocate it to a repurposed glass jar or sealed plastic container.If you want to keep your honey on the counter, take note of where sunlight comes through your kitchen windows so you can avoid placing your honey in its path.
Honey does not react well to fluctuations in temperature so try and keep it away from drafty areas and vents in your house.
 You are able to store your honey in the fridge, but bear in mind that honey will crystallize if it drops below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. As long as you don't cause the honey's temperature to bounce around, a chillier environment is just fine.However, the honey will be a little slower to pour out when you want to use it.


Place the jar in a bowl or hot water to help break up and dissolve the crystals.
Honey can also be frozen.
Be cautious though, any moisture that gets in the honey can cause it to ferment whether in the fridge or pantry. This can produce mead but it does ruin the original honey.

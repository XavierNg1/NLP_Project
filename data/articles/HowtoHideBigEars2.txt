 If you have short hair, try applying mousse or other hairstyling products, and mussing your hair in a bedhead look to partially hide your ears or distract from them.


In the long run, you could try growing out the sides of your hair to medium length, to cover your ear tips. You can keep the rest of your hair short, although not buzz cut short.
All the remaining steps in this section are focused on medium to long hair styles.
 The more volume your hair has, the easier it will be to cover your ears. There are several ways you can accomplish this:



Apply dry shampoo.
Use mousse or other hair styling products.

Curl your hair, add a wave, or get a perm. The simplest method is to use hair curlers overnight, but there are more permanent options described in the linked articles, or available at hairdressers.
 If you have long hair, pull it back loosely, so the sides arc over your ears. Side ponytails or braids are another option.


Avoid tight or high pony tails, which pull your hair away from your ears.
You can even go for the princess Leah side buns look, if you want to completely hide your ears.
 Long, sideswept bangs can hide your ears completely. Even shorter bangs left in front, with the rest of your hair pulled back, will make your hairstyle softer and less star, so your ears are not as much of a focal point.

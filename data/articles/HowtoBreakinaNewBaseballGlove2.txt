 Coat or spray the entire surface of the glove. You may want to apply a little extra to the laces to make sure they are adequately protected. Let the glove sit for several minutes and soak up the conditioner. Then wipe the glove with a towel until dry.
 Be sure to keep your glove several inches above the water to avoid splashing. Place a curved lid or a large upside-down bowl over the glove to trap the steam. Let the glove sit in the steam for two-to-five minutes, depending on how soft you want the leather. You want the temperature of the glove to reach about 150Â° F.Many sporting-goods stores offer professional glove-steaming services. Some will even steam a new glove for free when you buy it from them.
 Turn the stove off and wait until the steam dissipates to retrieve your glove. Dry the glove with a towel. The glove should feel much more flexible now.
 Fold the glove in half so the thumb is on top and hit the heel close to the thumb side with a mallet to bend the material. Work your way toward the center of the glove.
 Depending on your preference, you might want a deep or shallow pocket.


Hit the glove near the webbing for a deeper pocket or more toward the palm of the glove for a shallow pocket.
 Your glove should be much easier to open and close now. Play some catch to help finish the process of breaking it in.

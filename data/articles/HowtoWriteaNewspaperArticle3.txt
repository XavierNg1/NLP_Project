 Objectivity has long been a fundamental requirement for newspaper journalism. While it's impossible to be completely objective - after all, everything about the story, from its topic to your vocabulary choices, is coming from you - you should try your best to present a complete picture so readers have the chance to form their own opinions.


Don't let your personal biases show in your story. If you're writing about two political candidates running against each other in an election, for example, present both candidates in an equal light, rather than making your preferences clear.
Don't use loaded words that may influence readers' opinions of your subject. Avoid stereotypes and politically incorrect terms.
Don't hyperbolize events, actions or other aspects of a story. Your job is to tell what actually happened, not an exaggerated version of reality.
 Write with a sentence structure and word choices that communicate information clearly, rather than causing confusion. The point of a news article is to quickly convey information, not to impress or entertain people (although you certainly don't want the article to be boring). Newspapers are read by people from all walks of life, so your writing has to appeal to a diverse readership.


Use active, rather than passive, language. It's easier to read, and it gets directly to the point. For example, write "Senator Thompson held a press conference Tuesday," not "A press conference will be held by Senator Thompson on Tuesday."
Identify your interviewees clearly. Is he or she a doctor who has done research on a scientific breakthrough? A government official? The mother of a man on trial for murder? The person's role should be clear to your readers.
Don't muddle your writing with unnecessary words. Using uncommon vocabulary serves only to distract and confuse your readers. Choose words that enhance your article's accuracy, rather than the biggest and most impressive words you can find.

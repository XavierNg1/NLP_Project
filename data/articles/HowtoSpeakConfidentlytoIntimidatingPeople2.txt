 In addition to working on how you present yourself, you should also work to make the person who intimidates you less scary. Before you go speak to them, imagine them in a funny costume or in some other funny situation. This will help you to feel more at ease with them and will also lighten your mood., Before approaching them, you should also practice deep breathing. Deep breaths will help to calm you down so that you appear more confident. Slowly take a deep breath in through the nose, and then out through the mouth. Repeat until you feel totally calm., Work to build your social skills and interact with other potentially intimidating people by chatting with folks you don’t know. Take a moment to ask how the grocery clerk’s day is or spend a few moments chatting to a stranger on the bus., You might find that you and this intimidating person have more in common than you realize. The more they are like you, the less about them you will have to fear. Take a second to think of all of the ways that you are alike and use those as conversation starters with them in the future.

For instance, perhaps you both like baseball, live in the same neighborhood, or like a certain television show.

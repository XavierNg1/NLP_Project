 “Show geo location information on newly uploaded photos and videos” is the first option; this determines if your location is listed along with your pictures and videos. You can select or deselect this option by clicking on the check box beside it.
 “Allow viewers to download my photos and videos” is the second privacy option available. This will determine if other users can take your pictures and videos from your profile and download them.


If you do not want them to do this, you can make sure the box next to it does not have a check by clicking on it until the box is empty.
 “Find my face in photos and videos and prompt people I know to tag me” is the third privacy option that you can change. You can turn this off if you do not want people to be able to tag you in their pictures of you they have.


This can also be done by clicking on the check box next to the option.
 “Upload my photos at full size” is the next option. This just determines if your pictures come in at full size or scale down when viewed from your profile. It is also a check box that can be manipulated by either checking or unchecking the box.


Below these settings is a bar that shows how much space you are currently using. This will give you a rough idea on how much space you have left for storage.
 The next video and photo option is also a check box; however, it is for your Google Drive. You can select this option by clicking and to check it or uncheck it.


If you check the box your Google Drive photos and videos will be displayed on your Google+

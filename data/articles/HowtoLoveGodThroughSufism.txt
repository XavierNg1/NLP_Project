 Sufism is based on strict monotheism. Remember you want to attain the love of God. As in one of the verse of the Bible, God say, ".... I am a jealous God", although it has been used figuratively. As one falls in love, his/her beloved doesn't tolerate that their lover even look at any other person.;
, Take out some time to remember God. Sufi's do this through chanting names of God loudly or silently. You can remember your beloved without any words. The key is to remember God as one thinks about beloved. Use Arabic names: Ya Allah (O' Allah) Ya Rahman (O' Merciful) etc or you may use words that are specifically for God.
 Different orders have different ways of meditation, but a very simple meditation is: to think about the blessings of God on you, think about how the nature works, how God dealt with people before or anything about God. Remember love's analogy; when you love someone you keep thinking about them e.g., how they speak, how they dress, how they talk to you etc. Sit in a quiet comfortable place for 5-10 minutes and relax, then leave every thing and begin to think about God's blessings. Initially focusing will be not be easy, but with time you would be able to concentrate instantly.
 Jalal-ud-din Rumi is 13th century Sufi saint and poet. His work is well known to western readers. Similarly, Razi, Hafiz, Ghazali are also worth reading.
 Listening to Sufi music and poetry. All of us must have seen whirling Dervishes of Turkey. They dance on the tunes of Sima or Sufi music. Remember, when one is in love they are more inclined to poetry and music, similarly, this practice brings you closer to God.
 As in love, you can't win the heart of your beloved instantly. Be persistent and patient, through consistent practice and devotion you may achieve that state when even God will begin to love you!

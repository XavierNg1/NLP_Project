 Sunfish can be found around the United States in most lakes, ponds, and rivers. One isnâ€™t necessarily better than the other for catching sunfish. Many people prefer to lake fish, but rivers can yield some great catches, too.Fish around different bodies of water in your area to figure out where you can find the most sunfish.
 Most sunfish are more active during the day than at night. They also feed by sight and get curious about things they see in the water, and they can see in the water more easily during the day. For the best chances at catching sunfish, fish while the sun is out.During the summer, morning and evening fishing is most effective. During the fall, fish in the middle of the day.
 Sunfish can be found just about anywhere, but they tend to really like shallow areas that have some kind of cover. Look for sunfish around brush, weeds, and rocks.For example, lake coves are a common place to find sunfish.
In the winter, you can also find sunfish in deeper waters.

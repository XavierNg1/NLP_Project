 Open iPhoto from your Finder and then select the photo you want to shrink. If the photos are not yet saved in iPhoto, go to "Import" under "File." From here you can select the file or folder that you wish to shrink. Once they have been successfully imported, they will display in the right-hand window of iPhoto.
 At the bottom of the window in iPhoto, there is a share icon that looks like a square and an arrow. Click on this icon. Select "Email" from the menu that appears., When you choose to email the photo, you will have the option of resizing the image. Select "Medium" under "Size." If you are really trying to save space, you may want to change the size to "Small," but this will greatly reduce the quality of the images so it is not recommended.
 You can now send the image to yourself via email and then download the resized image from your email account.

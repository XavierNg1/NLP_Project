 While you can't determine who exactly is looking at your profile on a regular basis, you can determine who you interact with the most and who Facebook thinks your closest friends are. If you find someone on the list that you don't interact with often, they may be expressing interest in your status updates (with likes, comments, or views).


You can quickly access your profile by opening Facebook and clicking on your name in the upper-left corner.;
, Click the Friends link on the left side of your profile to open a list of all your Facebook friends. The list may seem random at first, but evidence suggests that it is actually determined by Facebook algorithms to show you the people you are most connected to.


This list is determined by a variety of factors, including who comments on your posts, who shares items with you, and who views your profile the most.
 The friends at the top of your list are who Facebook has determined to be your closest connections. People in this list are most connected to you, either by your interest in their status updates or theirs in yours (likes, comments, etc.)

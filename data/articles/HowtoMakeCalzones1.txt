 Place the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl. Use a stand mixer or a hand mixer to mix the ingredients. Keep the mixer running while you add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil. The dough will be sticky at first, but should soon form into a ball.








If the dough seems too dry, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time to moisten it until it forms a ball.
If the dough seems too sticky, add 1 teaspoon of flour at a time until it holds its shape.;
, Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Use your hands to knead the dough until it comes together into a firm ball. The surface of the dough should begin to look smooth and a little shiny.
 Rub a large bowl with a few teaspoons of olive oil so the inside is thoroughly coated. Place the dough ball into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set the bowl in a warm part of the kitchen. Let it rise until it has doubled in size, which should take 1 - 2 hours.
 Remove the dough from the bowl and punch it down. Divide it into 8 parts, one part for each calzone you want to make. Set the dough pieces on a tray, cover it with plastic wrap, and let them rest for 10 minutes.









If you want to make larger calzones, divide the dough into fewer parts. For more calzones, divide the dough into smaller parts.
At this point you can place the dough in the refrigerator and use it at a later time, or go ahead and complete the calzone recipe.

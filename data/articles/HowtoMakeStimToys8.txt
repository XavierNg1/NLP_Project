 You will need a stuffed animal, small weighted materials (i.e pebbles, beads, buttons, dry beans, etc.), small zipped bags, a seam ripper, a sewing needle, and thread.


This may not be the best stim toy for you to make if you have poor fine motor control or can't sew, since it does require sewing.
 Pull out half of the cotton filling from the toy.
 Close the bags tightly.
 Put the bags inside of the stuffed animal. Place the cotton filling back as well.
, To stim, feel the stuffed animal by squishing and feeling the materials inside. You can also place the stuffed animal on you to feel the weighted effect from the amount of materials it has.

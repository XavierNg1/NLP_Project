 Run the hot water tap in your sink to let the water heat up. Alternatively, you can heat some water up in a kettle and pour it into a bowl. Make sure the water isn’t boiling hot! You should be able to touch the water safely. Otherwise, you may crack the glass of the jar.
 Hold the jar under the stream of hot water, focusing on the lid. If you’re using a bowl of hot water, set the jar upside-down in the bowl so that the lid is completely submerged. Allow the jar to heat up for a few moments. The heat from the water will expand the metal of the lid and help separate it from the jar.Rotate the jar while running it under hot water to help distribute the heat.
 Hold the jar steady with your non-dominant hand. If the lid is too hot to comfortably touch, cover it with a dish towel to protect your hand. Using your dominant hand, grasp the lid firmly and twist in a counter-clockwise direction.


If the lid is still stuck, cover it with a rubber glove or a dish towel before trying again. This will help pry the lid loose by adding friction.

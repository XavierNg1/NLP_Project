 Overly cold or overly hot water can discolor your leather, so room temperature water is best. How much you need will depend on how large the leather product you’re cleaning is, but you’ll need enough to cover the entire product., You should use a clean, soft sponge for this step. Dip into the bowl of room temperature water, and then ring it out to get it as dry as possible. The only way to remove water stains from leather is with more water, but you don’t want to use too much and damage the leather., Work from the center of the water stain out, wiping your damp sponge across the surface of the leather. Don’t scrub when you’re doing this, as this can cause water damage to the leather., You’ll want to wipe the entire surface of you leather with water as quickly as possible. If you allow one area to dry before the others, you might end up with a new water stain.

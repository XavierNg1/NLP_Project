Edit Go To cell range E7:E1447 and with E7 the active high-lighted cell enter the formula w/o quotes "=(AD7/IF(Divisor=0,S_COUNT^2,Divisor)+(IF(SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)<0,(ABS(SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor))^Power)*-1,SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)^Power)*IF(AAA=1,0,1))+IF(AAA=0,0,AH7*IF(MOLECULES="Y",Factor,1))^Power)" and Insert New Comment and edit in by copying the formula from the expanded formula bar "Original formula =(AD7/IF(Divisor=0,S_COUNT^2,Divisor)+(IF(SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)<0,(ABS(SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor))^Power)*-1,SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)^Power)*IF(AAA=1,0,1))+IF(AAA=0,0,AH7*IF(MOLECULES="Y",Factor,1))^Power)"
Edit Go To cell range F7:F1447 and with F7 the active high-lighted cell enter the formula w/o quotes "=IF(Flip_Pic=-1,-1,1)*((IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))*IF(Spirallic_YN="Y",SPIRALLIC*IF(A7=0,1/SPIRALLIC,1),1)))" and Edit Fill Down, then Do Insert New Comment and edit in" Original formula was =IF(Flip_Pic=-1,-1,1)*((IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))*IF(Spirallic_YN="Y",SPIRALLIC*IF(A7=0,1/SPIRALLIC,1),1))+(IF(N_CANDI="Y",0,0)+IF(D_CANDI="Y",0,0)) which includes extra parts of the worksheet concerning "writing" Candi's name in spheroids, which is an ongoing project."

, The Cos formula evaluates to -.0070 in AF1447 where I'm now storing it, fairly harmlessly. If you guys want the rest of the worksheet, ask, and there'll be made a Part II wikiHOW, about writing out Candi Woz in spheroids via formulas.,, You did it!! If you have errors, see the Warnings section below please. There is not a single error on the sheet that is germane to the Heart Chart or the others to show you. The chart is proof in and of itself.
 That one was pretty difficult, and there's a whole other third to it.,

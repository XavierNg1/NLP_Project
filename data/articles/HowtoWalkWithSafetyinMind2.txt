 If you're walking in the dim or dark, wear clothing with reflective tape on it. If you don't have any reflective clothing, you can purchase reflective tape to sew or glue onto the backs of your walking shoes, around the cuffs of your jacket and pants, or in stripes down your arms and legs.
 It won't help your workout anyway.
 Then stick with the plan.
 This makes you look like an easier target, and makes it hard to stay properly aware of your surroundings.


If you can't give up on listening to music as part of your workout, at least ditch the ear buds in isolated areas where you need to be the most aware of your surroundings and personal safety.

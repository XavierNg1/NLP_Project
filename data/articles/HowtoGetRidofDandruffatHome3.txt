 Psychological stress can actually have a big impact on your physical health. If your stress levels are high, your immune system will be weakened, and you will be more susceptible to developing dandruff. Find ways to relax and lessen the amount of anxiety in your life., Using products like mousse, gel, or hairspray increases the amount of oil on your scalp, leaving you at greater risk of fungal infection. Cut back on the amount of product you use, and you may see improvement in your scalp's health., Your immune system can't function at full capacity if you don't get enough sleep. Do your best to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night.
 Your skin, including your scalp, needs vitamins and nutrients to stay healthy. Make sure your diet provides your body with zinc and B vitamins.
 Don't go sunbathing, as intentionally exposing your skin to too much sun is one of the leading causes of skin cancer. Just spending a little time outdoors every day will give your scalp the sunlight it needs to be healthy.,

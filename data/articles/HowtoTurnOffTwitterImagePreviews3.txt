 Go to twitter.com and log in using your email address, or username, and password. Then click “Log in” to proceed.
 Click your profile picture on the top right corner of the header to bring down a menu. Click “Settings” from here. Your account Settings page will be opened.
 Scroll to the Content section of the Settings page and locate the “Tweet media” option. The checkbox for “Do not inform me before showing media that may be sensitive” should be empty. If not, click the checkbox to uncheck it. This will enable sensitive media filtering.
 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click “Save changes” and exit the menu. You will still see photos and videos with the tweets, but those marked as sensitive will be restricted. There’s no direct setting to control image previews online, but at least sensitive media can be filtered.

 The left needle should have the rest of the stitches. Unlike the English method, it does not matter what your first and second stitch will be. The working yarn automatically shifts itself into the correct position., If you are doing a knit stitch, the yarn will drape over the top of the needle, towards the back.If you are doing a purl stitch, the yarn will drape over the top of the needle, towards the front.
 Stick the right needle through next stitch on the left needle. Wrap working yarn under and over the tip of the right needle. Use the right needle to pull the yarn back through. Keep the working yarn on the right needle, then slip the stitch off the left needle.









Some patterns call for you to yarn over twice. Pick up the working yarn over your right needle again, then complete the next stitch.
 When you do the next row, you will eventually go over the extra stitch you got from the yarn over. This will create a lace-like hole in your project that also acts as an increase.

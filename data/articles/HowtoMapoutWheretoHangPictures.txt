 You will need to have every framed picture you plan to hang on the wall in front of you before you create your map.


Buy a long roll of parchment paper and painter’s tape. Although you can pick up both supplies at a local craft store, you could also find these items at a hardware or even a drugstore.
Locate a very sharp pair of scissors, a pencil and a measuring tape. You will be measuring the pictures and then transferring the measurements to the parchment paper, which will be cut out.;
, Be as precise as possible in order to get an accurate idea of how each picture will appear on the wall.


Write down each measurement and then re-measure on the parchment paper. Use the pencil to create the shape on the paper.
If you don’t want to write the measurements and then transfer them, consider running your measurement tape along the side of the picture, locking it in place and then tracing it while holding it down on the parchment paper.
 You may want to first get every shape cut out before hanging it on the wall to create your map.


Secure each end of the paper down on the wall using painter’s tape. That way, when you remove the tape it won’t remove any of the paint or drywall.
Pretend the parchment shapes are your actual pictures as you hang them on the wall. Use a level to ensure each shape is not crooked.
Consider either putting the picture name or printing out a picture on computer paper to place on each parchment shape. That way, you can get an even better idea of flow between photographs/artwork.
 Parchment paper clears away easily so even if you drill through it, you will still have no problem removing the paper.


Consider leaving the parchment paper in place if the shape is slightly smaller than the real thing. Not only will the parchment act as a map, it can also protect your walls from scratches generated by the picture frames. If the parchment is a little too large, simply trim the edges while it is still hanging.

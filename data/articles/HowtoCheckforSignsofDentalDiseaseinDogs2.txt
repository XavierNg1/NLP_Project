 If there is dental disease, the gum lines will change. The gum line should not be a straight line, but a wave-like edge where the gum meets the tooth. If the gum line is straight, there is some kind of dental disease present.Each tooth should have a bulge where the tooth and gums meet.
 Black spots along the gum line point to dental disease. These black spots allow exposed roots and tooth parts to be vulnerable to plaque and tartar, which can lead to tooth loss.Gum loss can cause exposed areas that can eventually lead to serious periodontal disease.
 Dental disease can be detected by looking at the state of the gums. Your dog’s gums should be pink and healthy looking. If they have gum disease, the gums may be red or swollen.


Red, swollen gums may mean that your dog has gingivitis.
If your dog’s gums start bleeding, they may have periodontal disease.

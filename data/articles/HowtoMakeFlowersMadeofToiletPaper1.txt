 This basic flower only requires a couple things. You’ll need toilet paper and a pipe cleaner. If you don’t have a pipe cleaner, you can use an elastic, a piece of tape, or a bobby pin.;
, Take your toilet paper, 2-6 pieces depending on the volume of the flower you wish to make, and pile them on top of one another. Line up your toilet paper squares and pinch them in the middle, creating a bow-like shape. Take your pipe cleaner and wrap it twice tightly around the middle of the toilet paper. This will replace your fingers in holding the bow shape., Hold onto the center of your flower (where the pipe cleaner is holding it together). Use your other hand to fan and fluff your flower petals. Pull the layers of toilet paper apart and rearrange them creatively to form your flower petals. You can gather, bunch, pull, or even cut these petals to give them the shape you want.While you want to see how far you can stretch your flower petals, be sure to do so carefully. Toilet paper is prone to rip if you pull it with force.
 Once you get the hang of creating the petals, you can make them in minutes. Repeat the flower-making process with different amounts of toilet paper and start cutting different sizes for different flowers. You can attach them to almost anything by wrapping the stem of your pipe cleaner around a frame. Try making a wreath or bouquet for an interest piece in a room.

 It is an Italian-designed metal vessel that disassembles into three parts, and uses steam pressure to brew coffee. Check Step 1 here for a good diagram and the following description of a moka pot:


They have three chambers, one for water, one for grounds and one for the finished product.
The bottom chamber is for the water. It usually has a pressure valve as well.
The middle chamber is for your finely ground coffee. Pack it in lightly.
The top chamber is the collection point for the brewed espresso / coffee.
 When the water boils, remove it from the heat source. This step is not required but is recommended to prevent the metal moka pot from overheating and imparting a metallic taste.
 There may be a guide line inside the chamber. Insert the filter basket.
 Make sure there are no loose coffee grounds on the top edge of the filter basket that might hinder the seal.









Use standard drip grind coffee -- roughly table salt consistency.
 Make sure they are securely sealed, but do not tighten so much that you wonâ€™t be able to get them back apart.









Be careful so as to not spill the ground coffee into the water or either into the top chamber. Keep each in its own place for now.
 When steam begins to form, the coffee will start to percolate up into the top chamber. You will hear a puffing sound as the steam emerges.









The coffee will emerge as a rich brown stream which will lighten over time. Wait for the stream to reach the color of yellow honey, then remove the pot from the heat.
Do not leave the pot on too long or you will scorch the coffee -- and that is not a taste most people enjoy.
 Again, this is not absolutely necessary, but is recommended to prevent the coffee from acquiring a metallic taste.
 If this semi-espresso is too strong for your liking, you can dilute it with water.

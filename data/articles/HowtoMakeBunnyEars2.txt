 Another way to make paper bunny ears which will be a bit sturdier than the version with a paper headband is just to use a normal headband or hairband that you wear. Find one you don’t mind using to make your bunny ears.
 Get two pieces of A4 paper, one for each ear, and fold the paper in half horizontally. Now, starting at the fold in the paper, draw a bunny ear shape. Repeat this on the other sheet of paper in the same way, ensuring that the fold in the paper is where the base of the ear is.


You can decorate or colour in your ears now.
If you use any glitter or glue make sure you leave it to dry before moving on to the next steps.
For bigger bunny ears use A3 paper.
 Now you can cut out the ears. Keeping the paper folded in half, carefully cut along the outside of the ears, making sure you don’t cut along the fold at the bottom of the paper. This is what keeps the front and back of your ears together.


When you have cut out both ears you should have two pieces of paper.
Each one will have a normal bunny ear shape and an upside ear shape, which join at where the paper was folded.
 Wrap each ear around the headband so that the base of the ear, where the paper was folded, goes underneath the headband. You should now see how the folded paper has become the front and back of the ears. Glue the two sides of the bunny ears together to fix them to your headband.You can also glue the base of the ears to the headband to make them more secure.

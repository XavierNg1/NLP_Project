Know that the flag is the most important aspect.
Know that traps stop everything except the piece with the number "3" on it.
Know that pieces with the number "2" can move any number of spaces in one direction.
Know that pieces with the number "3" and "3" only diffuse traps.;
, These pieces will be your scouts on the front line. Because they can move any number of spaces in one direction, they should get a position on the front lines. This also is a distraction to your opponent. Your opponent will think that one of the scouts is your flag, creating a red herring.
 It is recommended that you place your flag behind a natural boundary, so you will have to use less traps. Also, most people usually put their flag in the back, so doing this will throw your opponent off.
 Surround your flag with one layer of traps. Scatter the rest of the remaining traps.
 Your "1" piece could also be a letter, most commonly "S". It is recommended that you put the "1" and "10" piece next to each other in the second or third row.
 It is recommended that you place these pieces behind the "2" pieces. If you find a tram with the "2" pieces, you can disarm in with a "3" piece.
 These pieces can be placed anywhere you want.
 This is important! You can get "hints" from your opponent by doing this.
 This is where their flag will most likely be.
 If you hit a trap, their flag will most likely be in the vicinity.
 It will most likely be the "1" piece, the only piece that beats a "10".
 Although you may have been ignoring it, defense is one of the most important aspects of this game. Make sure you have a strong protective line with strong pieces and minimal gaps.
 If not, keep playing and practicing!

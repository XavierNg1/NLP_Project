 There are some region-specific augmentation systems that can make your GPS more accurate. For instance, Wide Area Augmented System or WAAS was designed for North America. It provides corrected GPS signal through its network of satellites and ground stations. You can find out available systems in your GPS Menu > Setup > System.


There is a European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service or EGNOS for Europe
Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) for Asia
GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation System or GAGAN for India
System for Differential Corrections and Monitoring SDCM is in development for Russia , You don't need any additional equipment. Just press Menu button (twice, if necessary), choose Setup > System and choose the augmentation system you want. You can use WAAS outside the US but the data will not be corrected thus it won't be as accurate., Since not all satellites are WAAS-enabled you may not always benefit from the system. Trees and other obstructions may also prevent you from getting a corrected signal, so be sure to stay in the open unobstructed areas away from trees, cliffs, and basins., GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigatsionnay Sputnikovaya Sistema) is a Russian Global Navigation Satellite System that can work alongside your GPS and provide more accurate data faster from its network of 24 additional satellites. Developed in the 70's for navigation and global positioning, GLONASS is now used in commercial GPS receivers (as WAAS system), smartphones and tablets. Just like WAAS you can turn it on in Menu > Setup > System.

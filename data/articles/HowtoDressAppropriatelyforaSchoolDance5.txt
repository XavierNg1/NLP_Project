 Choose clothes that are slightly dressier than your everyday attire for a casual dance. Choose an un-ripped pair of dark-wash jeans with a button-down or nice sweater, for example. Pay attention to your school dress code if they prohibit certain logos or content on t-shirts or hats.


It’s less common to coordinate colors with your date for a casual dance, but you still can if you like!

, Pick a nice loafer, boat shoe, or possibly a nicer clean sneaker in a neutral color or in a color that complements your outfit. Avoid wearing athletic shoes that you wear to play sports, especially if they’re dirty from outdoor use. Pay attention to the dress code to see if it prohibits sneakers.
 Keep jewelry simple, like a nice watch, ring, necklace, or bracelet. Choose a leather belt if you wear a button-down or other shirt that needs to be tucked in. Avoid casual caps or beanies unless the dance is very casual, and check the dress code to make sure hats are okay if you do want to wear one.

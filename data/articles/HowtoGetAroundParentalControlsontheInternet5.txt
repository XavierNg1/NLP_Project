 Go to your Start menu, click the "Power" button, then click the "Restart" option.
 As your computer restarts, hold down the F8 key; you'll need to do this before the Windows logo appears on screen. Hold down this key until the Advanced Boot Options screen emerges.
 Once the Advanced Boot Options screen appears, select the "safe mode" option with the ↓ key until you reach the "Safe Mode" option. Hit the ↵ Enter key to finalize.
 Upon boot-up, you should see two accounts: your default user, and an account labeled "Administrator". The Administrator account allows access to all system processes and is, by default, not password-protected.
 Navigate to the Control Panel program, open User Accounts from within the app, select "Parental Controls" from User Accounts, click on the default account, and switch the controls to "Parental control off"., Try to visit a previously-blocked site. Once the parental controls are disabled, you should be able to browse without limitations.

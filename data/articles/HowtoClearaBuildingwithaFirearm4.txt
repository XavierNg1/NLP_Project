 Self-closing doors include spring-loaded or hydraulic-closing doors. Common in most residential houses for the garage access door, this presents a set of problems when being approached from the non-hinge side. If the door opens toward you (you are on the hinge-side of the door), open the door and either use your shoulder or your foot to push it more open as you clear the room.
 Depending on the speed at which the door closes, you may have time to move to the opposite side of the doorway before you enter. This is probably your best option.


If you can, move to the opposite side before you enter. This gives you a brief moment to very quickly scan the room for any obvious potential targets.
If you are unable to step to the opposite side of the doorway, you must zig-zag into the room.
 Entering will take some quick thought and adaptation. You must be quick on your feet; the door may automatically close or close faster than you're prepared for.


You must quickly commit to entering; this is the only way to retain any element of surprise you may have. The fatal funnel becomes many times more deadly if you allow the door to close before you go through it; now an intruder on the other side of the door knows you must approach that door again to open it.
Use movement to your advantage. During high stress encounters, you and your adversary will likely have tunnel vision. Simply zig-zagging as you enter the room may cause you to completely "disappear" for a second or two.
 The door will cover the corner to your back temporarily. If you see this corner is clear before the door has almost finished closing, you may have time for a quick scan of the room, but your priority is the corner behind the door.
, Also be aware that many self-closing doors will slam loudly when they shut. Be patient and maybe spend a minute or more waiting in that room to see if someone comes looking for you.

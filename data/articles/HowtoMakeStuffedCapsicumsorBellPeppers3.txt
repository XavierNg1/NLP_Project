 A large capsicum or bell pepper will be able to hold about 1/2 to 1 cup of stuffing, so plan your recipes accordingly. The recipes below are meant for 4-5 bell peppers, so be prepared to make some adjustments.
 Just combine 1 cup of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of sour cream, 1 cup grated cheese, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, dried chili flakes, dried cumin seeds, and dried paprika to taste (about 1 tsp of each). Then add 1 tablespoon of sugar. This recipe is also highly recommended for sweet paprika peppers.


If you choose the cream cheese filler recipe, it is better to heat the oven to 200°C/400°F and roast them in a lightly oiled pan without water until the peppers flesh is tender - about 20 minutes. Then top with any surplus cheese filling to serve.
 Use a cup of pasta sauce and mix it in with one cup of water. Then, get 2 cups of dried pasta, which can be anything from penne to gnocchi, and combine it with 1/4 cup of grated cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste for this recipe.
 For this one, all you need is 1 cup of herb and pine nut pesto, 2 cups of ricotta cheese, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of grated cheese. Mix all the ingredients together and add salt and pepper to taste. Your peppers will be all ready to stuff.
 Take about 300 grams of any minced meat and gently brown it in a pan with 1/2 a cup of white onions. You can add this meat to any of the recipes to make them more meat-friendly.

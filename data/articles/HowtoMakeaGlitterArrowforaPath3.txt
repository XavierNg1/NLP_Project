 If the arrow is heavy enough, it won't need attaching or pinning to the ground.


For concrete/brick and other smooth surfaces: If the arrow might blow away, use poster tack or strong tape (such as duct tape) looped into sticky double-sided tabs to stick the arrow to the ground. If you're sticking it down, make sure the ground is clean first.
For rough, gravely surfaces: You won't be able to stick the arrow down. Either use the wooden arrow for weight or use small weights like pebbles to hold the arrow down at the edges. You could even carefully align an entire edging of small smooth river pebbles to keep the arrow weighted down.
For soil: Drive small pins or nails through the cardboard sign and into the soil to hold in place.

 If you itemize your deductions, your medical expenses must exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income. You may combine all expenses for yourself, your spouse and your dependents over the course of the year. This deduction is for your actual out-of-pocket costs. You may not deduct payments that are covered by insurance or that are reimbursed after payment.For example, if your adjusted gross income is $65,000, you must have medical and dental expenses that exceed $6,500 in order to take advantage of the deduction.
The threshold for medical and dental deductions increased from 7.5% to 10% in 2013. If you are still paying taxes for prior years, you will use the 7.5% threshold.
For tax years through 2016, individuals who are 65 years or older will continue to use the 7.5% threshold. Beginning as of January 1, 2017, everyone will use the 10% level.
 Because you must meet the threshold level before you can claim deductions for medical expenses, you should try to plan the timing of your medical payments. You may want either to prepay some expenses to include them in a prior year, or put off payment to a subsequent year, in order to group your expenses.For example, if your adjusted gross income is $65,000, you must have medical and dental expenses that exceed $6,500 in order to claim a deduction. If you know that you will have some major expenses next year, you may want to try to put off to that year whatever other expenses you can, in order to exceed the threshold.
 When you are preparing your tax return, you will need to report your medical and dental deductions on Schedule A. You can find this schedule by going to the official IRS website at www.irs.gov and then the “Forms & Pubs” tab.

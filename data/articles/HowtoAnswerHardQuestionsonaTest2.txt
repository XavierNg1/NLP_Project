 Be sure to pay attention when your teacher gives the last minute instructions, in case there is anything different about this test than others you have taken. Also make note of how much time you will have to take the test., As the exams are being handed out, quickly skim through the questions to be sure they all make sense to you. If there is anything that isn't clear, ask your professor to explain more fully what he or she is looking for on that question., If there are multiple essay questions on the exam, count them and divide this number into the total amount of minutes you are allowed to use for the test. This will give you an estimate of how much time you should be spending on each question., If you notice that you are stuck on one particular question, or spending too much time on a really detailed answer, go to the next question. Go back at the end of the test to fill in anything you missed., To come up with a thesis statement or central point for your answer, rephrase the question as a statement. This will give you a good starting point for your essay.Try to include key words from the question in your thesis statement.
 Outline the main points you want to cover, before you begin writing. Use scrap paper, or the back of the paper, if you need more space. Include the main terms, dates, names – anything that you can remember – when jotting down your notes. Then include only the most relevant data when writing your answer., Stay on point, and try to use clear language to express your ideas. Avoid lengthy introductory or summation passages.Include your most important points first – don't save them for the conclusion of your essay.
 Spend the most time covering the ideas you are most familiar with, and that you remember the most details about. Answer the question completely, but devote the bulk of your essay answer to the part of the question that you are most confident you understand.

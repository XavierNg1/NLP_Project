 Make sure your check is filled out clearly and legibly, and that you've endorsed it ahead of time. It's important that you select your own bank's ATM. While most cash machines and ATMs will dispense cash to anyone with a debit card who is willing to accept the fee, the other ATM deposit functions will only work for members of that bank specifically.


Credit union members who regularly do shared drafting at other locations will have to use an ATM from their particular credit union, not a shared draft union.
 If you don't have this information you'll need to go into the bank and speak with a teller.
 A list of your checking and savings accounts should show up next. Select the account into which you'd like the check deposited. Next, you'll have the choice between cash and check next. Select check.
 There should be an insert slot with directions about orienting the check (face up or face down, etc.) printed on the machine. Follow the directions and insert your checks. Next, the ATM will scan the checks and will ask you to confirm the information on the check as it has "read" it. Examine it carefully to ensure the ATM has the correct amount, account number, and other information.


Some Bank of America ATM kiosks allow you to insert up to ten checks at a time, but read the directions on the particular ATM carefully before you try to insert more than one.
 At this point, the ATM will provide your current balance and ask if you'd like another transaction. You can either withdraw cash, print a receipt, or deposit cash.

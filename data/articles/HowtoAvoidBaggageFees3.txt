 Depending upon your destination, train travel can be more affordable than air travel, especially when bags come into the picture. Many railroad companies allow up to two bags for free. Regional travel that would typically necessitate a commuter or express airline can often easily and affordably be replaced by train travel in many parts of the world., Ferries often allow up to two bags in a standard ticket, and are a great alternative for over-water crossings. Ferries are especially common in the Pacific Northwest, Europe, and between major cities globally. Most regional ferry trips take no more than a day, and allow you to not only bring your bags but experience a new method of travel as you go.Some high-speed ferries may not allow the storage of bags outside of cabins for safety reasons. Talk to your specific ferry line about their baggage policies before booking.
 If you must fly, take a look at the cost of shipping your bags to your destination. You may be able to get an affordable budget ticket for your flight that can help offset the cost of shipping, making that a more reasonable option than paying baggage fees.

 Find out what are the recommended upgrades for it. Then look into the upgrades you would like. Then find out what is compatible with your system, operating system, and the prices. If you are using a custom built computer, research the motherboard, and what works well with it. Contact tech support forums if necessary.
 You don't need to upgrade everything in your computer to be satisfied, but only what will suit your needs. Ask tech support forums what they would recommend for your needs. Remember that you don't always have to do what they say, though, the final decision is yours. Try to be sure that the upgrades will suit your needs, so if you multitask heavily, try upgrading the RAM, if you play games, graphics card, and (if it is a laptop) if you are constantly traveling, the battery, etc.
 You can buy hardware from many computer wholesale sites, the manufacturer of your computer, or at a local computer electronics store.
 Take the new hardware out of the box, read all of the instructions. Then disconnect everything from your computer, and open the case. Ground yourself by touching a large piece of metal such as the case itself, then find the hardware being upgraded. Read Build a Computer for specific instructions on how to insert hardware. Once you have finished inserting it, reboot the computer and install the drivers using the CD that came with it, or by following the link that came with the hardware to the drivers. Or, you can contact a professional to install the hardware for you.

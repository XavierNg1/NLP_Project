 For outdoors, use an outdoor broom. For indoors, a feather duster can be helpful for confetti on shelves and other higher places.
 Stop when you have accumulated a small pile and use a dustpan to collect. Toss away.


Constant collection is especially important when sweeping outdoors; the merest breeze can send collected confetti everywhere again.
 Check tree branches, window sills, banisters, drain covers, etc. as well as the ground. Knock confetti down with the broom handle or push it across difficult surfaces with the handle before sweeping.


For difficult pieces, use the wet cloth or tape method suggested below.

Run the rake over outdoor ground to finish up. A hosing down might also assist.
For lawned areas, a mow might be a good option, especially if the grass needs cutting anyway.

 Congratulations, you're pierced! Now you just need to take care of it properly. You should soak it in a solution of warm water and sea salt for the first couple weeks. When taking a shower, it is a good idea to use an anti-microbial soap just in case.
 Showers are fine, but try to avoid baths or swimming during the healing process since it is easier to get infections from sitting water.
 With genital piercings, you should not have sex for at least four weeks or so. You have an open wound on your penis, so keep that in mind. You are much more susceptible to STDs during the healing process, and having unprotected sex makes it much more likely to get an infection. So wear a condom every time for at least two months, whether you're in a committed relationship with other forms of birth control or not. This is for your safety. Also, remember you have metal down there, so it might not be a good idea to use "Shear" or "extra sensitive" condoms as they may break more easily.
 Enjoy your new piercing, and if you have any questions, ask your local piercer. They are more than happy to give you advice. They want everyone to be safe.

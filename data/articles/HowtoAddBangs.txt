 If you're not certain whether bangs are the right look for you, try wearing a wig with a hairstyle that features bangs. This allows you to see how you look without making a commitment. Clip-in hairpieces that attach directly to your natural hair and cover only your forehead are also available.;
, Natural or synthetic hair can be added to your existing hairstyle to give you bangs, usually using glue or sewing the new hair onto your own. Weaves (also called hair extensions) can last for several months.
 While you can try cutting your hair yourself, most people will find that they achieve better results by leaving the job to a trained barber or hairstylist.



Wet your hair so that it is thoroughly soaked, but not dripping.






Decide how thick you want your bangs to be. For thin bangs, comb your hair forward an inch or so back from your hairline. For thick bangs, part your hair further back from your hairline. For best results, don't go further back than the point at which your ears begin.






Hold the hair you intend to cut with your non-dominant hand. Pull it forward into 1 narrow spot in the middle of your forehead. It should fit in the spot between your eyebrows.






Use a very sharp pair of hair-cutting shears to cut the gathered hair straight across.






Push the newly cut bangs across your forehead so that they fall the way you intend to wear them. Make sure that the bangs are level; if not, cut more off the longer pieces of hair until the bangs are even.






Hold your hair-cutting shears at about a 45-degree angle from the ends. Carefully cut several small notches into your bangs. This will ensure that your bangs hang naturally, not as a solid block. The notches should be 1/4 to 3/8 inches (6 to 10 mm) long.






Let your bangs dry, then check to see whether they look the way you want them to. If not, use your hair-cutting shears to make small adjustments as needed.

 It’s important that you keep the waxed area clean, especially during the first few days following a wax. Sweat and dirt can get trapped on freshly waxed skin, contributing to the development of those pesky bumps. Try showering at least once a day and making sure you clean the waxed area thoroughly during your shower., Dead skin cells can build up after you get a wax, clogging the hair follicle and causing ingrown hairs. After you wax, make sure you exfoliate the area every day. Try swapping out your regular washcloth for an exfoliating cloth. Then gently rub the wet exfoliating cloth over the waxed area with your favorite soap or body wash.You can buy an exfoliating cloth at your local drug store or online.
You can also try a topical exfoliating product, like a post-wax cream that contains salicylic acid. Be sure to carefully follow the directions on the package.
 If you have post-wax bumps that are painful to the touch and/or feel pressurized under the skin’s surface, you might have infected ingrown hairs. If this is the case, take a warm compress and apply it to the affected area. Leave the compress on for 1-2 minutes, and then swipe the area with a cotton ball soaked in hydrogen peroxide., Calming inflammation after a wax can help eliminate post-wax bumps. Dab a small amount of one-percent hydrocortisone cream on the waxed area after your procedure. For example, a pea-sized amount works well after a brow wax. Use more for a larger area., If you frequently get bumps after waxing, you might want to make an appointment with your dermatologist. They can determine what is causing the bumps, and whether waxing is the best way to remove unwanted hair. For example, they may suggest a depilatory or laser treatments instead of waxing.

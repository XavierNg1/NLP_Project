 Toyota debuted Entune software in their cars with the 2012 prius. Any toyota built from that point forward might be Entune capable. If you are unsure if your vehicle has this software capability or not, contact your dealer or Toyota customer service.
 Unfortunately, your Toyota isn’t yet connected to wifi. You will need a way to transfer the update file from a computer to the car., It is ideal to name the file the same way that Toyota names it. “FAT32” is the name Toyota uses when they send out the Entune update files., Start your car, but keep it in park. Also, do this in a well ventilated area. It is dangerous to leave a car running in a closed space.
 If your car does not have a USB port, it is not likely Entune capable., When your system recognizes the Entune update file, it will ask you to confirm the update., Do not turn off the car or drive until the update is complete. Once it displays on the screen that the update is complete, you can remove the flashdrive and turn off or drive the car.

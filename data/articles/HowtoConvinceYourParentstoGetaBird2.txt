 The best way to show you’re parents that you’re capable of taking care of a bird is to fulfill your other responsibilities. Make getting good grades a priority by devoting time to reading, studying, doing homework, and organizing your workload. Participate actively in your classes, be punctual, and ask for help from your teachers, classmates, or a tutor if you feel like you are falling behind.
 Show that you can provide a good living environment for a bird by cleaning your room without being asked to. Ask your parents for boxes or storage bins to organize your things in, and clear out any garbage, recycling, or items (e.g. clothing, books) that you can donate to a local charity. Make your bed and make sure that all of your clean clothes are folded and put away neatly.


Show that you are committed to getting a bird by clearing out a space in your room large enough to fit the size of bird cage that you will need for the bird of your choice.
 Helping your parents with household chores will make you look responsible and help you gain points with them. Choose tasks around the house to do without prompting from your parents. Helpful chores might include:


Taking out the trash
Watering the plants
Cleaning the microwave
Dusting
Vacuuming
Doing the dishes
Sweeping the floor

 Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.


If desired, you could coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or grease it with a little oil instead of using foil.;
, Use the prongs of a fork to pierce each sweet potato about 6 to 10 times, spacing the piercings apart in a relatively even manner.


Piercing the sweet potato allows more heat to penetrate the inside of the vegetable while also preventing pressure from building up inside.
 Place the sweet potatoes on your prepared baking sheet and transfer the sheet to the oven. Bake for at least 45 minutes.


Sweet potatoes are pretty forgiving, so you can bake them for longer than 45 minutes if you want them to be a little more tender. For very tender sweet potatoes, 55 minutes should usually be long enough.
 Let the sweet potatoes cool slightly, just until you can touch them with your fingers without getting burnt. Slice each sweet potato down its lengthwise center, cutting into the sweet potato but not through it. Add butter and other seasonings, and enjoy.


For a simple side dish, stick with butter, salt, and pepper.
For a sweeter twist, season with cinnamon and brown sugar, or drizzle with maple syrup and a sprinkle of pecans.

 Before you use any soap on Merrell shoes, even mild soap, test the soap on a small, unnoticeable area of your shoes. Make sure it does not cause any damage, such as discoloration, before applying soap all over your shoes for cleaning.


If a soap does cause discoloration, try a different soap until you find one that does not damage the shoes.
 Moisture can make shoes more likely to become discolored, damaged, or dirty. Try to avoid using your shoes when it's raining or snowing. Keep them in an area of your home that is not prone to excess moisture., You can buy suede protector sprays online or at a local department store. Mist the shoes with a layer of the spray and let it sit on for as long as the label recommends. A protectant spray will make the shoes less prone to damage, dirt, and debris. This way, you will not have to clean the shoes as frequently.Different sprays have different specific directions. Make sure to read a bottle's instructions closely before using it on your shoes.

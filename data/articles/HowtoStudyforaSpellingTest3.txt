 This method of study will require you to select a word, say it out loud and then write it down. Say each letter out-loud as you write the word to help build familiarity with its spelling. Make sure the word is spelled correctly before moving on., Move down a few lines on your paper and write the word again. Make sure you say the entire word out-loud before writing it, speaking out each letter as well. However, you will not write the last letter of the word down for this step. Even though you are not writing the last letter down, you should still say it out loud., Keep moving down to the next line and writing one less letter every time you spell the word. You should still be saying the entire word and each letter aloud, even though you aren't spelling the entire thing. Continue removing letters until you only have the first letter of the word remaining., Fold your paper in half, hiding the original spelling of the word. Start rebuilding the word by saying the whole word and every letter aloud. Write only the first and last letters of the word. Move to a new section on the paper. Say the word and spell it out, adding in the two final letters of it. Continue in this way until you have completely spelled the word out again.For example, you would start by writing the word “tower” as 't___r”. You would then write “t__er”. Add another letter to get “t_wer”. Finish the word by writing “tower”.
Double check that you've spelled the word correctly.
Avoid looking at the original spelling of the word while you are rebuilding it.
You can also try removing syllables instead of letters.

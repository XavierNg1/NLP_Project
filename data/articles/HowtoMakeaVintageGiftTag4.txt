 Use distressing ink to create an antique look around the edges of the cardstock.


For an extra vintage look, use a distressing tool to mark the edges of the paper or use a nail file to sand the edges. The tool will give the appearance that this piece of paper has been around for a very long time, perhaps hundreds of years.
 While you may be trying to give off the appearance that this tag is old, you still need to add some sparkle and bling to make it look special. Create a design using the glue stick. Either freehand a design or use a stencil to make a border or design around the sides of the cardstock.


Sprinkle the glued area with glitter. Perform this task over a paper plate so the excess glitter is caught on the plate and can be returned to the glitter bottle.






Gently tap the tap against the paper plate to remove any excess glitter.

 The sled should be easy to use, easily steerable by your child and not liable to take off without control. Plastic sheets, sliding carpets and saucers are not good shapes or styles to choose because they are next-to-impossible to control. Prefer sleds with aerodynamic shapes, seating areas, places for legs, steerable ropes etc. Ask for advice when purchasing.;
, It is not safe to stand on a sled, nor is it safe to go head first, ever. Legs should face out front when seated.
 Wear a helmet that fits. Suitable helmets include ski, hockey, or bike helmets. Make sure that they are adjusted for comfort and fit over snow clothing. Helmets can and do prevent serious injuries if accidents happen.
 The slide should be:


Free of debris
Soft and snow-covered
Free of icy cover
Gentle in its slope
Free of vegetation, rocks, and other obstacles, including trees

, This allows for plenty of space to bring the sled to a halt before hitting the end.
, Always wait for a clearance in other sledders going down before taking your turn. Accidents from pile-ups are painful and potentially highly injurious.
 An adult should always be in attendance for all children 12 and under who are sledding.

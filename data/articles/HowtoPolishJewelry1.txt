 Quickly rinse the silver jewelry in warm, but not hot water. If you’re cleaning several pieces of jewelry, make sure to rinse each piece of jewelry individually. Inspect each piece of jewelry after rinsing to make sure nothing has fallen off or been damaged during the rinsing process., Once you have rinsed the jewelry, then rub a soft chamois jeweler's cloth over the surfaces to polish and shine. Rub the cloth in a gentle, circular motion over the jewelry. Make sure all of the moisture has been dried after you have finished drying and polishing., If rinsing and polishing hasn’t produced a satisfactory result, then use a silver-cleaning fluid. Apply the silver cleaner with a soft toothbrush and scrub gently. Finish polishing with a chamois cloth. A chamois cloth can be purchased at a jewelry store or online.You can also choose to use a silver-cleaning cloth rather than a fluid.
Goddard’s Silver Dip is an example of a silver-cleaning fluid, and it is available at drugstores and supermarkets.
 Make sure to remove silver jewelry before getting into in chlorinated swimming pools or hot tubs. Exposure to air and light tarnishes silver. Avoid wearing silver rings when you will be using your hands for projects, like gardening.

Put on your silver as a finishing touch to your outfit. Don’t use hairspray, cosmetics, or other hair products after putting jewelry on.

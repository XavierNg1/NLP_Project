 A girl can be sporty, girly, geeky, scholarly, artsy, or a mix of many things. If you aren't sure about her interests, make a list of how she spends her time. If she goes shopping once a week, she might be a fashionista. If she plays three different sports, that's probably her thing. Some list ideas for different interests are listed below:


Art: a poster of her favorite artist's work, an easel, high-quality paint brushes.
Eco-friendly: a plant, a tree planted in her name, a new bike.
Geek: a poster or action figure, a t-shirt, other fan memorabilia.
Girly: nice perfume, a cute dress, jewelry.
Smart/School: a book, a telescope, a high-quality monogrammed pen.
Sports: water bottle with her name on it, autographed ball, jersey.
 This will help you in two ways: one, you can eliminate what she already has and two, you might get some solid ideas of what she likes. If she has Dr. Who posters plastered all over her wall, there's a good chance she'll love the TARDIS plush you buy her.
 Ask her what stores she'd like to go to, then watch what she looks at and loves.


If there's a dress she loves but can't afford, get a couple things and ask her to run ahead to the food court to buy you some food. While she's out, you can buy the dress and hide it underneath the other stuff.
 If you are utterly stumped or too nervous, buy her a gift card to her favorite store (or one that works at multiple stores).

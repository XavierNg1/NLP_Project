 Don't loop it with another cord, just a loop unto itself. The lower end of the cord should be under the upper end, not over. The loop should be on the right-hand side.
 Then, take the end and put it under the lower part of the looped cord.
 Don't bring it around the loop, just over the top of the (un looped section of the) cord. Then, bring it under the top of the loop, over itself (what you did in step 2) and under the bottom of the loop.









You should see a wonky figure 8 forming -- like two Olympic rings gone bad.
 Make sure both sides are even! Gorgeous. To make it even more noticeable, do it with four cords. Just do a two-for-one, keeping the cords together. Repeat as desired.

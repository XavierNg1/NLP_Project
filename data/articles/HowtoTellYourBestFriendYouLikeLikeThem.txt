 If you are wanting to tell this person how you feel, it would be best to do so in private. This way, you both have the opportunity to hear each other out and say what you really feel without any interruptions or comments from others. Don't come off too strong, but also try not to hold any feelings you have back. If you only want them to know, and nobody else, it's best to find a way to get you alone instead of asking them to talk alone, for this can make it obvious. If for some reason you can't get them alone because of some friends or their busy or something, text or call them to try to meet up somewhere you can be alone and you both feel comfortable.;
, Doing something that you both enjoy together is a brilliant ice-breaker. For example, if you both like to draw, bring some paper to keep each other occupied. Or, if you both like jumping rope or browsing at the video game store, you can do that. Once you are both enjoying yourself, you can begin to hint that you like this friend.
 Start off casual, you don't want to leap straight into it and start off too strong. If your friend is not the 'open' type, try to slowly ease onto the topic. Keep it casual and calm.
 You don't want to become the 'other person' in the relationship. If your friend isn't single then it is best to just remain friends until (if)the relationship is over. Do not make your friend chose between you and their current spouse.
 If you followed the previous step, casual conversation should be established by now. Slowly but surely work the love topic into your conversation, you can do this as subtly or not, as you like.
 You can also try write a love poem if you can. If they are the romantic kind they will really appreciate this! Write them a cute, kind letter and they may just fall for you.
 If the suspense is killing you, just say it. This is risky, but is also by far the easiest!

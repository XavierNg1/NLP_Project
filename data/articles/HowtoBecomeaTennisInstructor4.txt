 Many high schools, middle schools and colleges in the U.S. have tennis courts and you can teach at these at certain times. Make sure to ask for permission if the courts do not seem to be open to the public. Be sure to know when it is convenient to use each location. In addition, be sure to check on such aspects as lighting and court conditions.


If you need to pay for courts, factor this into the cost of lessons and make the most of each paid slot by having as many students as possible for the time, without shortchanging anyone. This means having a very good system in place for making appointments, keeping time during the lesson and dealing with "no-shows" (who should still be charged so as to cover your costs).
 After you get comfortable being at the facilities, start talking to the people often. Let them know that you are a coach and that you would love the opportunity to help them with their game. Do not be too pushy but rather interested in their game and excited to be talking about the sport.


Compliments are always a good way to start a tennis conversation.

 This mixture is especially useful for soft-bodied insects, such as aphids, caterpillars and parsley worms. The soap is absorbed by the pest and then causes dehydration and death.


Mix 1 to 2 tbs. (15 to 30 ml) of plant-based soap with 1 qt. (0.95 l) of water in a spray bottle. Many people use Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castille Soap, a product made with olive oil. Shake the mixture up and spray it regularly at any sign of bugs.
 Insects and other pests are deterred by strong smelling plants, herbs and spices.


Find a mixture of plants like garlic, rhubarb, mint, onions, cayenne, ginger and horseradish. Cut them up into large pieces and place them in a pot or saucepan. Cover them with water and boil. Turn off the heat and allow the "tea" to sit overnight. Strain the liquid away and pour it into your natural insecticide bottle.
Create a caffeine mixture, if you are having a problem with aphids. Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of yarrow, lavender and/or catnip with 2 tbs. (10 g) of used coffee grounds and 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Allow the mixture to sit overnight. Strain the liquid and pour into a spray bottle.
 It will lose its potency after that, and you will need to mix up a fresh batch.

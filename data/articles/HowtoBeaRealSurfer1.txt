 Brown, blonde, black, or even red will do. It's more preferable not to have crazy hair colours such as purple, blue, green etc. However, if you do want blonde hair and are unable to dye it, your hair should get bleached from the sun!;
, This will make you look like a try-hard. If you go to the beach regularly or every weekend and swim & surf, The tan will come but just don't spend the whole day lying down on your towel trying to get a tan quick. Patience is better that getting skin cancer.
 While nearly all surfers have at least 2 items of those brands in their closet, You don't have to buy it just for the sake of it. Also if you don't really like it you don't have to buy. Just buy the clothes that you like whether they are a surf brand or not.
 Wear it on your wrist, ankle or neck. It's awesome!

 Your eyeglasses should work with your facial features, rather than against them. If you are proud of a certain facial feature, such as your blue eyes or your strong cheekbones, look for frames that show off this facial feature.For example, you may choose blue frames to match your blue eyes, or you may look for red frames to match your red eyebrow hair. Or, you can play with contrasting color. You could match purple frames with green eyes.
 Your skin tone should also complement your frames, as eyewear that works with your coloring will often look better on you. Your skin tone has been proven to be more of a deciding factor for eyeglass frames than your eye color or your hair color.If you have a cool skin tone, go for frames that are silver, black, pink, purple, blue, mauve, gray, and dark tortoise. These frames will not wash out your complexion.
If you have a warm skin tone, look for frames that are light tortoise, gold or honey, beige, olive green, and brown shades. Avoid pastels and white and black frames.
 Give your face more dimension by making sure your eyebrows fit with the look of your frames. If you have thick, bold frames in a bright color, you may want to keep your eyebrows simple and neutral so they do not compete with your glasses. You may do very light eyebrow maintenance, like plucking stray hairs, and brushing your eyebrows out to keep them simple and clean.If you have plain frames or rimless frames, you may want to play up your eyebrows and draw more attention to your eyes. Use an eyebrow pencil to lightly fill in your eyebrows, following the natural arch of your eyebrows.

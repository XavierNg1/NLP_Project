 To track Jupiter and its moons, you’ll need to observe at the same time (within a 30 minute window) every day for seven to nine days. Sticking to the same observation time will ensure the accuracy of your results. Make sure you have time to set aside to make your observations, and hopefully the weather will cooperate with your experiment.Unless you live in a dense urban environment, you will most likely be able to observe Jupiter without having to go to a dark, isolated location. Your backyard should work just fine!
While tracking the moons over the course of nine days is best, you can also make several observations over the course of six hours to track minor changes in their orbits and Jupiter’s shifting position in the night sky.
 Use your sky chart or mobile app to find out when Jupiter will be observable. While it’s visible to the naked eye, you’ll have to make sure it’s observable at your location.For example, if Jupiter appears near the western horizon in the evening, it’s too close to the setting sun to be observable.

, Once you’ve found Jupiter with your chart or app and have spotted it with your naked eye, you’ll need to point your telescope on it. Focus on the planet and center it in the eyepiece. You should be able to see from one to four moons, all of which should be in a straight line.Some of the moons may be behind Jupiter or so close to each other that they appear to be one object.

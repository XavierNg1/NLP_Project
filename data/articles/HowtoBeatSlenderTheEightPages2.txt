 After collecting all the pages from the first mode, you'll "wake up" in the daytime. It probably sounds easier, but it's not. You don't have to worry about your flashlight, but everything else is just as intense.


After "daytime mode," unlock "$20 mode." Again with version 0.9.4, if you beat daytime mode, you'll reemerge after the credits once again in the dark. Beating this mode is no different from the standard version except for the fact that you'll hear 20 Dollars by Ron Browz playing in the background.

The reference to this is that some believe that if you give Slender Man $20, he won't kill you. Cheap date, huh?
You can select these modes in the options screen and you can play both simultaneously, if you'd like.
 This will run like a video from Marble Hornets on YouTube, using the entry format. The music is slightly different, the static is more prominent, and it runs like a prerecorded video. Once you get past this, you can then move to daytime mode and $20 mode.
 It's only a slight name change (MH is one in the same, really). $20 mode was removed due to copyright infringement.You also have the options of using a crank lantern and a glow stick. What's more, you can pause the game as long as there isn't static on the screen. The more and more pages you collect, the less you can see. Fog will start rolling in, too.There are also more links in the menu, leading to forums and extra resources, etc.

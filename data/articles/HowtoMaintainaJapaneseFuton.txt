 Japanese futons usually come in sets that may include a foam pad (matto), a futon (shikibuton), sheets (shiitsu), blankets (mofu), a duvet (kakebuton) and a pillow (makura). The foam pad should be laid out first. Put the bottom sheet on the futon and lay this on the pad, followed by the sheet and any blankets you may want. If you use a duvet, use the cover that comes with it. One side will be made of mesh; this goes up.;
, Leaving your futon out during the day may allow mold or mites to grow underneath. The futon and pad should be folded in thirds (take care to make sure that only the underside of the futon touches the floor as you fold) and stacked neatly in a cupboard or the corner of the room. The blankets are folded in four and placed on top of the folded futon and pad, and then the pillow goes on top of everything.
 Hang it in the sunlight outdoors during a time of day when the air is relatively dry. This is said to kill anything that may be growing inside, such as fungus or mould, especially during humid times of the year. The fresh air also keeps it from smelling stale. Many people also use a beater (similar to what you would use on a carpet) to beat out dust and other material while airing.
 Futons are usually used on tatami flooring, which is slightly springy and quite a bit softer than hard floors. If possible, sleep in a room with tatami mat flooring or carpet. However, make sure not to walk in this room with your shoes on, and vacuum frequently. Clean tatami mats regularly.
 Though the practice is unusual, the futon itself can be washed if you have access to a double-size washing machine and dried in a very big drier if necessary (e.g. spills) or by hanging to dry. You can also bring it to a dry cleaners store (but call first to make sure they'll clean futons). Washing a futon in a washing machine can be an effective means of removing cat allergens.

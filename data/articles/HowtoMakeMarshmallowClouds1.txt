 Marshmallows are very sticky, so you need to start with a greased pan. Spray down a 9-by-13-inch pan (23 centimeters by 33 centimeters) with cooking spray. It can also help to spray down any utensils you're going to use. The mixture will stick to anything., Mix the packets of gelatin with about half a cup (125 milliliters) of water and the vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer. Just use a fork to mix them together. Let the mixture sit to the side for a few minutes so the gelatin can bloom (hydrate).Try to get all the lumps out with the fork.
You can also use extracts like raspberry, lemon, orange, almond, or banana, depending on what you want to do with the marshmallows.
 Add 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) of water to a small pan. Pour in the sugar or the sugar plus the corn syrup, whichever you're using. Bring it to a boil over medium to high heat, and let it boil until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius) or just under. Continually wipe down the insides of the pan with a pastry brush to keep sugar from crystallizing there.Alternatively, you can let the sugar and water come to a boil, and take it off the heat.Corn syrup helps keep the mixture from crystallizing, meaning your marshmallows will usually stay softer.
 You have two options here. If you raised the mixture to 250 degrees, simply pour it into the mixing bowl with the gelatin. Do it slowly, and have the mixer on low.Alternatively, if you just heated the mixture to boiling, add the gelatin to the pot. Heat it again until the mixture is boiling, stirring as it comes to a boil. Pour the mixture into the stand mixer, and let it cool down until it is just warm before going to the next step.If you prefer not to use gelatin, you can try agar in a one-to-one ratio with gelatin. Another option is Vegan Jel.

Sample Macro Using If...Then...Else Statement

Sub Using_IF()
Dimension the variable.
Dim x As Integer
' Place a value in x.
x = Int(Rnd * 2000)
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 10.
If x <= 10 Then
' Display a message box.
MsgBox "X is <=10"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 100 and greater than 10.
ElseIf x <= 100 And x > 10 Then
MsgBox "X is <=100 and > 10"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 1000 and greater than 100.
ElseIf x <= 1000 And x > 100 Then
MsgBox "X is <=1000 and > 100"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 2000 and greater than 1000.
ElseIf x <= 2000 And x > 1000 Then
MsgBox "X is <= 2000 and > 1000"
If none of the above tests returned true.
Else
MsgBox "X does not fall within the range"
End If
End Sub



Sample Macro Using Select Case Statement

Sub Using_Case()

MsgBox "X is <=1000 and > 100"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 2000 and greater than 1000.

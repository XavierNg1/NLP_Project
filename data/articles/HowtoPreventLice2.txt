 These sprays are not necessary to kill head lice and can do more harm than good if inhaled or ingested.
 This includes:


Washing children's sheets in hot water
Washing any clothes the child may have worn in the past 48 hours
Putting in the dryer for 20 minutes any plush toys your child may sleep with

, Hair care products such as brushes, combs, hair ties, headbands, barrettes, etc. should be soaked periodically to kill any lice. If an item is in question, it's better to be safe than sorry.
 Whether it's the smell of certain products or an adverse chemical reaction, lice tend to stay away from:


Tea tree oil. You can use a shampoo or conditioner with this ingredient to repel lice.
Coconut oil. Coconut oil is known to deter lice.
Menthol, eucalyptus oil, lavender oil, and rosemary oil. Most likely, lice dislike the smell of these strong oils.
Hair products designed to repel lice also exist. Make sure you don't use lice killing shampoo unless you actually have lice, or else it is bad for your hair.
 Once a month, do a deep vacuum and hit any carpeted areas or upholstery where lice might breed or wait for human contact.
 Don't live in fear trying to prevent something that might never happen to you. It's not worth being worried about lice until you appear to have a legitimate outbreak.

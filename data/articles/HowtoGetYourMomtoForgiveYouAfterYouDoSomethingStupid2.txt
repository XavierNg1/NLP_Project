 You don't want to make her madder by incurring another infraction on your record. So obey the house rules, and go above and beyond them .If you get the chance to be helpful, don't blow it away; be helpful.
 Ask her to help you come up with a plan for better behavior in the future.For example, maybe your issue is you're always late coming home. Ask her to help you come up with ways to fix the problem. Maybe you could set your phone with an alarm to 30 minutes before you're supposed to be home, and ask her to help you remember to set it when you're going out.
 Don't go and make big decisions like moving out or running away. You're probably mad that you're in trouble, and you may even feel like your mother doesn't care about you. However, her being angry shows that she cares enough to want what's best for you. She only wants you to do better. If you're feeling isolated, try talking to a friend, a different parent, or a sibling if you need to let off some steam.
 If you keep making the same mistake over and over again, your mother will start to doubt the sincerity of your apology.
 Take out the trash without being asked. Do some extra laundry. Offer to babysit or go grocery shopping. Cook dinner before your mom has a chance to do so. Your mom will notice that you are trying to make things right.
 Bring her breakfast in bed. Pick some flowers for her. Make her a card or a picture she can take to work. Let her know that you love her.
 Go to the park with her even if you don't feel like it, or ask her to go to the library with you.
 Being affectionate will show her you care and want to do better.

 When your dog starts biting, give him a chew toy instead. That teaches your dog that his teeth belong on the toy, not you.While you want to train your pup not to bite hard, you do eventually want to teach him not to bite at at all, which is where these steps can help.
 Most pet stores sell deterrents that your dog will not like the taste of, such as bitter apple. When you're playing, try putting the deterrent on your skin. Once the dog tastes it a few times, he'll likely want to stay away from human skin., Boxers are high-energy dogs that need a great deal of play. Try very active games such as fetch. These games will help your dog release energy, and at the same time, move him away from biting games., Boxers need to have lots of entertainment. Provide enough toys so that he doesn't get bored; when he's bored, he may lash out or bite. Try rotating them out so that when he gets bored with the first couple, you'll have more on hand to pique his interest.

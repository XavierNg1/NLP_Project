 Measure half a foot down on each of 4 pieces of 1-inch by 2-inch by 48-inch whitewood molding or other similar wood. Drill a 3/4 of an inch hole where you've marked on the wood. Insert the wooden dowel through all the holes.You should have two pieces of wood near each end of the dowel. On each end, spread the two pieces in opposite directions to create the "A" frame.
Sew elastic loops on the corners of a twin sheet. Throw the sheet over the frame, and loop the elastic over the end of each piece of wood to hold it in place.
 PVC pipe is lightweight and cheap. You just need to buy pipe and connectors to make a large cube (or an a-frame or house shape) in the size you want. Cut the pipe smaller if you need to. To finish, throw a sheet over the tent.To help the sheet stay in place, create sleeves for your sheet, and thread them through two of the bottom edges.
The best part of this type of tent is you can take it apart. It's lightweight and travels easily.
 Buy six dowel rods in your preferred height. Drill holes in them about half a foot from the top. Thread a string through all of them, then gather them together. Spread them out into a teepee shape, and wrap the rope around them to stabilize the shape at the top.To make the fabric, measure how far apart you've spread your teepee. Measure at the bottom of one of the triangles, then measure up each side to where you want the fabric to reach. Cut triangles in fabric that are the same size, with an extra inch on each side for hemming.
Make a triangle for each of the five sides. Sew the triangles together, and hem the bottom. Sew a tie across the top for tying it together in the front. It also helps to sew ties to the inside at the seams, which allows you to tie the fabric to the poles. Pull the fabric over the frame, and tie it in place.

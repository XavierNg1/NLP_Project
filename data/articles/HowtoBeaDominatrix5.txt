 This can be used in addition to or instead of gagging. Besides giving them permission to speak after they have had to be silent can be a way to evoke pleasure on both sides., When you tell them what to say, you can do it in character (if you're acting out a fantasy), or even use words you've previously discussed. Either way the control can be helpful in building intensity. For instance, you can say, "Tell me I'm your queen" or "Tell me exactly what you want.", This is often seen as traditional in a domme/sub relationship, but it can be definitely add to the power dynamic. Telling your partner to kiss you or touch you can create new understandings of both your sexualities. For instance, you can say, "Kiss me on the lips." Just make sure you're not asking them to do something you know they wouldn't be comfortable with. If they use the safe word, stop the action or relinquish your request. That doesn't mean all play has to stop, just that you need to change tactics. Try offering up an alternative to your partner instead. You can say, "If you don't want to kiss me on my lips, will you offer up a kiss on the cheek as an alternative?", Role play can be a creative and fun way to increase the tension of a scene. For instance you can play any role that has a power dynamic, such as queen and subject, boss and assistant, or anything else you can think of. Adding costumes can make the fantasy more real for you and your partner., Sometimes, dominatrix will institute punishments for infractions on the part of the sub. These should be discussed thoroughly before a session, especially if you're new to BDSM. Ideally the punishments should really be fun for the sub. For instance you could use any of the impact toys as a way to punish your sub, or you can implement silence or an apology. In any case, it should not go beyond the sub's comfort zone.

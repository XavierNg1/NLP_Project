 From your home screen, swipe to the left to bring up your app menu. Tap the letter “A” at the top. This should bring up a list of the entire alphabet; tap “S” to jump to that letter. You should see Settings with a little gear icon to the left of it. Tap to open.;
, You should now see a long list of different settings available to you. Scroll through this list and find “Touch.” Tap to open.
 Once you have the menu open, there should be three different options. The very top option should be “Touch sensitivity.” It should say either “high” or “normal” as its current setting. Tap the current setting to activate a drop-down menu. There will be two options. “Normal” and “High.” Tap one of the two options available in the list to continue.
 Tap the Windows home key in the bottom middle of your screen to return to your home screen. Once there, open an app or game that you play and try to use the screen as you normally would. If the adjustment isn’t to your liking, press and hold the back button in the lower left-hand side of your screen to show all open apps. Scroll through this list from left to right and find the Touch Settings menu you were just on. Tap to open, and try adjusting the settings again.

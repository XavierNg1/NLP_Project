 If you worry that your relationship doesn’t fit the mold, stop. Going in thinking it’s not going to work will put a damper on the relationship from the start. Stop worrying about what’s happening and just do what feels right.


You may need to tell your friends and family to butt out if they regularly make you question your relationship. You could politely say, “I understand you are looking out for me, but your constant criticisms about my relationship just aren’t working for me. I’d appreciate it if we didn’t talk about my love life.”, Part of the excitement of a relationship is doing things for each other simply out of love. You and your partner don’t need to miss out on this just because you’re in a long-distance relationship. You can give each other tokens of your affection, even if you don’t live near each other.


For example, you can send the other person flowers, have a bottle of wine sent to the table you know they’re eating at, and write a letter professing your feelings. Taking the time to focus on little things like this can have a positive effect on the relationship in a big way.Long distance relationships may bring challenges, but there are also rewards. You can build up a great set of relationship-building skills and mutual understanding through the relationship.
 Try not to use your distance as an excuse to not attend events that really matter to the other person. Being there when they need you, or surprising them by showing up, can really give the person an idea of just how committed you are and how much you mean to them.


Deaths in the family, birthdays, holidays, and promotions are all big life events. It would mean the world to your partner if you could find a way to make it to some of these events.

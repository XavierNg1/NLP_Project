 If linens, bedding, towels and the like remain, they should be washed or cleaned and then stored in boxes, preferably rodent-proof ones. Strip beds to allow the mattresses to air out. Open empty drawers and closets; use mothballs in the others.


Vacuum carpets and floors. This will ensure that no crumbs or other sources of food remain for vermin.
 Dispose of or move potentially flammable items such as oily rags and stacked papers, before you leave.

 This button is designated by a square with the 2 lines of the square that create the corners overlapping each other. This button will bring up "Fit," "Crop," and "Ken Burns" video editing effects onto the selected video clip within the editing viewer.
 This will bring up a green rectangle and a red rectangle.


Place the green rectangle over the image area you want the effect to zoom in on when the clip starts; place the red rectangle over the area you want the zoom effect to end on. For example, the green rectangle can be focused on a smaller area, which will create a zoomed in effect, and the red rectangle can be placed in a larger aspect of the clip to zoom out. You can move these rectangles around by clicking and dragging each around to the specific spot you need the zoom effect to take place.






Also, resize the rectangles accordingly by dragging the corners of each rectangle back and forth, resizing the image area.






Selecting the double arrow button at the bottom of the video editing screen will make the green and red rectangles swap positions.
 This button is designated by the play symbol (sideways triangle). Adjust the rectangles to get the effect exactly how you want.

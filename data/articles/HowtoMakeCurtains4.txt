 Gathered curtains are usually 1.5 to 2.0 times wider than a window. Most windows require two twin sheets. Twin sheets are 66" x 96". Full sheets are 66" x 102". Queen sheets are 90" x 102". King sheets are 108" x 102".
, Most hems are about 4 inches/8cm wide.
 Add width plus a 1/4 inch for movement within a rod pocket.
 Make a straight horizontal stitch above the hemline of the sheet, accommodating for the width of the curtain rod. The remaining fabric at the top of the sheet will become the ruffle.

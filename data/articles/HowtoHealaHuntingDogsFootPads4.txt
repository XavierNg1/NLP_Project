 Most bruises will heal on their own within five to seven days. You can help expedite this process by keeping your dog off its feet as much as possible during this time. Limit its time outside its crate and keep it on a leash if it needs to go outside.
 Apply ice to the affected area at least once a day. Doing this will help the broken blood vessels constrict, which can help to expedite the healing process.Wrap the icepack or bag of ice in a towel before holding it to your dog’s paw pad. An icepack or bag of ice on its own may be too cold for your dog to bear.
 Applying heat to the bruised area can help reduce the pain your dog feels from the injury. It won’t necessarily help the bruise heal faster, however. Do this once a day, or as needed, until the area appears to be back to normal and your dog seems to no longer be in pain.Test the hot wash cloth on your skin first. If it is too hot to hold against your own skin for a few minutes, let it cool down before holding it against your dog’s paw.

 Border your ceilings with pieces of bamboo, and lay a couple of bamboo throw rugs on the floor. Use bamboo to accent lights, wardrobes, and chairs for an added tropical effect., This will give the room a more tropical feel, as many tropical rooms and resorts use canopies both as mosquito netting and as protection from the hot sun. Canopies also allow for a romantic and playful atmosphere., In order to make a room seem more spacious, group mirrors together. Mirrors reflect light instead of absorbing it, so hanging them strategically, such as on their side, can trick the eye into making walls appear longer., Place seashells on dresser surfaces and on your bedside table. When you go to the beach, find shells that catch your eye and display them in your room to bring the seashore home. This way, people will instantly think of paradise upon seeing your space.
 Gather tropical plants, place them in flower pots, and scatter them throughout your room. Not only do plants provoke thoughts of paradise, but they will also help your health. Plants ease breathing and increase the humidity in the room, which can help fend off colds, sore throats, and dry skin.

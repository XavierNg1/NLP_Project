 If you are using a bar or a large piece of chocolate, chop it roughly into small pieces about one inch long. Breaking the chocolate into small pieces helps it to melt faster and more evenly., Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and cook on high in the microwave for 30 seconds. Since chocolate can scald easily, make sure not to put it in for more than 30 seconds. You can remove the chocolate after about 15seconds, stir it and place it back.This way you will get an idea as to how much longer it needs to be melted.If you don’t have a microwave, use a double boiler to melt the chocolate. Fill the bottom of the double boiler with water until it is about ½ inch from the top pan. Then put the chocolate in the top pan and place the double boiler on low heat. Stir continuously until the chocolate is melted., Take the chocolate out of the microwave and stir it using a spoon. Doing this ensures that the chocolate will cook evenly and won’t scald. You can also add just a spoon of milk to it., Repeat the process of microwaving the chocolate for 30 seconds, then stirring. Particularly stir the unmelted chunks of chocolate into the rest of the mixture. Keep doing this until the chocolate is smooth.Do not microwave the chocolate after it becomes smooth or else it will burn.

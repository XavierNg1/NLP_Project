 Get onto the furniture yourself, as this will make it more likely that your dog will want to join you.;
, Say the command you want (keep this command only for using when you want the dog to perform this motion). For example, pat the surface twice, then say the command "Up". Get a treat and show it to your dog. Then put the treat on the surface of your bed or couch.
 Once your dog has jumped up on the couch or bed, give it the treat. Do this at least three times in a row. Then try it without the treat. Repeat as often as needed until the dog gets the gist and performs it correctly., If your dog jumps on the couch or bed when you do not make the command, then push it off gently. It can also be useful to say something like "Down" so that the dog associates this command with getting off. Only let your dog on the couch or bed when you want it to be there. (See Warnings below.)

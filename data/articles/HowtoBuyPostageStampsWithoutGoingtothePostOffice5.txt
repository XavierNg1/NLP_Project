 This is the USPS number and you can call it any time, any day of the week.
 You'll need to state the type and number of stamps you want. It may be helpful to look at what stamps are available before you decide. Try looking online before calling the number.
 You'll have to use a credit card to place your order. Only do this if you're comfortable with giving this information over the phone. If not, you may want to buy stamps at a kiosk or online.


You will be charged a small fee for handling.

 If you repeatedly say the Vampire's name, there's a chance that they'll be annoyed and try to hunt you down. Instead, just state it once in capital letters and then again if someone asks.


If you think that there's a chance that they would target you because of your user, don't say what your username is.;
, Try to stay in a group. This works with being a Survivor, Detective - you'll be less likely to be targeted and will be able to quickly run or shoot the Vampire. It also works with being a Vampire; you'll have less presence (since you haven't talked much in the chat) so you can easily slip into a deserted space and devour your victim.
 This tells other players that you're probably not a Vampire since you want to keep some distance between you and potential Vampires.


Don't go ramming into other players. They could get scared and scatter around and you may end up getting shot or being falsely accused because you're behaving suspiciously.
 As mentioned in Step 2, it is a good idea to stay with a group. If you're a Vampire, then try to put some distance between you and your next victim before you dive in to kill or turn them to make sure you don't give your intentions away.



Survivors may try to trick you into thinking that someone is a vampire so that you'll die and drop your gun and they can snatch it.
 Look out for one of the three different 'scared' faces on a character that isn't bleeding - this usually means that they have been turned into a vampire, although it occasionally happens to people who have escaped.

 Unlike diarrhea, there are few home treatment options for constipation. If constipation is caused by a mild issue, like a dietary change, it may clear up on its own. Therefore, the best method for at-home treatment is to watch and wait. If the constipation does not clear up within a day or two, you should take your pet to the vet's for evaluation., If constipation lasts longer than a day or two, you may need to see a vet. Keep track of bowel movements over the next two days to see if symptoms clear up or improve.For cats, you can monitor bowel movements via the litter box. Make sure to change the litter each day and watch for fresh stools. Cats should have at least one bowel movement per day. Any less than that may indicate the constipation is serious.
You should also be careful of mistaking straining, which could be due to a urinary bladder blockage, with constipation. A urinary bladder blockage is life threatening for your cat. Make sure that there are still wet clumps from urine in your litter box. If your cat is straining and the litter box is dry, then you should contact your vet immediately to check your cat for this condition.
 If your pet is constipated, look out for other symptoms. Constipation is a symptom, and not a condition itself. Knowing the other symptoms will help you figure out the potential cause of your pet's constipation.A constipated animal may be lethargic, dehydrated, and reluctant to eat. A constipated animal may also vomit and not want to drink water. They are sometimes described as having a "hunched up" appearance.

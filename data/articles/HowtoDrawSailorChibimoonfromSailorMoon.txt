 These should be vertical for the mouth and nose and a horizontal for the eyes and ears.;
, Use a long, curved line to represent the body's movement, a vertical rectangle for the torso, and a horizontal rectangle for the lower body. Use straight lines for the hands and legs (with circles for joints). Sketch rectangles for hands and feet.
 Make sure to define the waist, but not so much the chest/waist (since Sailor Chibimoon is still a child).
 Draw very big eyes, a small nose, and a smiling mouth (following the guidelines). Make eyebrows above the eyes. Draw bangs on the forehead and two pointy hair buns on either side of the head (sort of like rabbit ears), with accessories in them and a V-shaped diadem on the forehead.


Don't forget to draw Sailor Chibimoon's right hand over her forehead in a sideways peace sign.
Carefully erase the guidelines.
 Draw a sailor costume with a short, ruffled skirt, big bows at the back and on the chest (with a round brooch at the center), long gloves on her hands and long boots on her legs with an inverse V-shape on each one. Make thick, shoulder length ponytails coming down from the hair buns.
 Sailor Chibimoon's usual outfit is red, white, and pink as shown here, but you can give her whatever color scheme you'd like.

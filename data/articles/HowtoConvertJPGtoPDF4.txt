, Click the "Choose File", "Upload", or "Select JPG File" button to browse your computer for files. On smallpdf, you can drag and drop your file into the browser window.


Some services have a file size limit. If you run into any limits, check the next method.
You may have to click a separate Upload button after selecting your files.
 Click the "Convert" button to start the conversion process. Some services will give you additional options such as margin size and page layout. The conversion process should only take a few moments.
 once the conversion is finished, you will be given a link to your completed file. You can download it just as you would any other file. It will most likely have the same name as the original images, and sometimes the conversion company's name will be added to the file name.

 On days where you want to look like you just rolled out of bed, try adding natural waves to your hair. You can do this by twisting big sections of your hair around a large curling iron.








Let the hair slide out of the curling iron almost immediately. This will add waves to your hair, instead of ringlets.
Spray some hairspray into your hair to keep your waves in place.
Straighten the ends of the waves to make the style a little more current looking.;
, If your side swept bangs need a trim, but you don’t have time to get to the salon, try braiding them across the crown of your head and securing the bang braid with a bobby pin.








Pin the braid just over your ear.
Leave the rest of your hair down, or put it up in a ponytail for when you work out.
 Blow your hair dry using a large barrel brush. Divide your hair into four sections, then curl each one, alternating between curling one section clockwise and curling the next section counter-clockwise.








Once each section is curled, pin it to keep it out of the way.
After all the hair is curled, remove the pins and lightly comb through the hair using your fingers.
Use the paddle brush to comb the hair on the crown of your head toward the left side of your face.
Don’t brush the waved portion of your hair. Brush this portion of hair towards the left side of your face using your fingers.
Spray your hair with hairspray and allow it to settle for an hour and a half before going out.

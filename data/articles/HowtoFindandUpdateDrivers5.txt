 When installing drivers manually, you'll be downloading the driver files directly from the manufacturer. You'll need to know the manufacturer and the model of the hardware you're trying to update.


If you have a laptop, you can usually find all of the drivers you need from your laptop manufacturer's page.
You can find the model information in the documentation that came with your hardware. You can also find the model information in Device Manager if Windows was able to recognize it.
 If the piece of hardware you're trying to update is listed as an Unknown device in Device Manager, you can try to look it up online:


Right-click on the unrecognized hardware and select Properties.
Click the Details tab and select Hardware Ids from the drop-down menu.
Right-click on the top-most entry in the list that appears and select Copy. Paste the copied text into your favorite search engine. The first few results will usually help you figure out what the hardware manufacturer and model is.If this doesn't help you determine the piece of hardware, you'll need to either refer to your computer's documentation or physically open the computer and visually identify the piece of hardware.
 Once you've determined what you want to update, you'll need to visit the manufacturer's support site. Below are some of the most common ones. If your manufacturer is not listed here, you can find it with a quick web search:

, The process for this will vary from site to site, but generally you can browse or search for a specific model. Find the support page for the specific piece of hardware you need to update.
 Many drivers come as installers (.exe files), or are packaged with software designed for the hardware. Older or less common devices may have drivers in .zip format. Sometimes the hardware's accompanying software will be listed separately from the drivers.If there isn't a driver available for your version of Windows, you can try one from an earlier version. For example, if you're looking for a Windows 10 driver but there isn't one available, try the Windows 8 driver. This isn't guaranteed to work, but may be your only option.
 If you downloaded an .exe file, you can run it and follow the installer's prompts to install the drivers. If you downloaded a .zip file, double-click it to open it, copy the files into an easy-to-access folder, and read on.


If you use an installer, you'll likely be prompted to reboot your computer after the installation is complete. You usually don't need to install any of the additional software unless you want it.
 If the drivers came in a .zip file, you'll need to install them manually. You can do this from the Device Manager.Open the Device Manager, right-click on the hardware, and select Update Driver Software.
Select Browse my computer for driver software.
Navigate to the location that you copied the driver files to and select any .inf file in the folder.

 Take a cucumber that’s been washed, and use a vegetable peeler to remove all of the skin. Next, cut the cucumber into ½-inch (1.3-cm) slices with a sharp knife.To wash the cucumber, rinse it under cool, running water. Dry it with a clean towel or piece of paper towel.
If you prefer, you can leave the skin on the cucumber.;
, Pour 6 cups (1.4 l) of water into the pitcher, and mix in the cucumber slices with a wooden spoon. Next, add enough ice to fill the pitcher and give the mixture another stir.For the best taste, use bottled or filtered water in your spa water.
 Once you have the water and cucumbers in the pitcher, allow the mixture to sit so the cucumber flavor has time to infuse the water. Leave it alone for at least one hour or up to four hours before pouring it into glasses and serving.Place the spa water in the refrigerator while you’re infusing the water to ensure that it’s chilled for serving.

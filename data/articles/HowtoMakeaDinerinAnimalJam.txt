 The best dens are the restaurant den or the mushroom hut. Make sure to choose somewhere practical that also looks good!;
, Make sure to get enough tables and chairs for your customers, and arrange them appropriately. If you don't think you'll have enough tables for your sure-to-be-popular diner, consider buying some from the dinner party or try adding a waiting room or a help desk.
 For example, if you choose an animal theme, decorate the diner with lots of animal posters and similar items. Customers are more likely to enjoy a restaurant if it's decorated attractively and has an interesting theme, so don't be afraid to spend some time on this.


Choose music that adds to your theme and attracts people to your restaurant.
 Go to Jamma Township and advertise that you have positions for waiters and waitresses open.
 If your restaurant is all-you-can-eat, get a food table and place it somewhere in the middle of the diner. Also consider getting a lot of lemonade stands. Since you can only get the lemonade stand once, you could trade. Make sure you have food and drinks for all your customers.

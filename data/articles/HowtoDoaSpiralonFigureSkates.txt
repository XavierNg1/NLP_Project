Now that you have identified what spiral you want to learn you will need to stretch out.
If you are doing any right leg spiral you will need to stretch out your left leg. Vice-versa for a left spiral
A good start is placing the leg that will be up against a wall and keep inching closer to the wall forcing your leg higher.
You can also hold onto the wall and lift your leg up. Practice your spiral position.
 Work out your core and lower back for both flexibility and strength.

If you rock suddenly forward it is okay to put your leg down and try again.
You should be looking ahead, not down.
Remember to keep your chest up, while pointing the toe of your free leg out to the side. Make sure that you balance in the middle of the blade, don't fall forward on you toepick.


Keep your shoulders down for proper form.
Really stretch those fingers to give a nice finished line to your arms.

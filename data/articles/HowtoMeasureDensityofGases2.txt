 You should know that the Ideal Gas Law is a theoretical tool that governs the behavior of gases under specific conditions. You can summarize it in the equation PV=nRT. This simply means that pressure (P) multiplied by volume (V) is equal to the number of moles (n) times the Ideal Gas Constant (R) times the temperature (T) for an ideal gas. , Standard temperature and pressure, or STP, is defined as 273 K (32 °F) ( 0 °C) and 1 standard atmosphere (1.0 bar). Assuming STP allows you to calculate the volume of one mole of any gas to be 22.414 liters. Knowing this volume will be imperative to finding the density of your gas., Since you are using STP and assuming one mole of gas, the finding the molar mass will be easy. Add the molar mass of all of the individual atoms that make up you gas to find the molar mass of the gas. The atomic masses can be found on the periodic table.For example, finding the molar mass of H2O gas would mean adding the masses of two hydrogens and one oxygen. The resulting molar mass would be 18 g/mol (1 g/mol + 1 g/mol + 16 g/mol).
 Though the volume and moles of gas are fixed in these calculations, the molar mass is different for every gas. That means that the density will be different for each gas as well. To find a given gas density, divide the molar mass of the gas by the molar volume (22.4 L / mol in this case).For example, if you were looking for the density of water vapor, you would divide 18 g/mol by 22.4 L/mol to yield 0.804 g/L. That is: 18 g/mol / 22.4 L/mol = 0.804 g/L.

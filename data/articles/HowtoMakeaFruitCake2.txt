 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.
 If you have a stand mixer, place them in the bowl with a beater attachment. If not, get a hand mixer out. Beat the ingredients until the mixture is smooth.


Make sure your butter is not completely cold and hard or this will make beating difficult.
 Add one of the eggs and beat the mixture until the egg is incorporated. Add the other egg and beat the mixture again.
 Add the flour to your mixture and carefully stir until the flour is completely mixed in.
 Dump in the can of pineapple with its juice. Stir till the liquid is combined.
 Stir these ingredients in until they're just combined. Avoid over-stirring the mixture, since this can make your cake tough.
 Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Take a knife and smooth over the top. Sprinkle the coarse white sugar evenly over the loaf.
 Place the loaf in the oven and bake for 1 hour.
 After an hour, take a sheet of foil and set it over the top of the fruitcake. Bake for another 15 minutes.


The foil will keep the fruitcake from burning while it finishes cooking.
 Stick a cake tester or toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, turn off the oven and remove your fruitcake from the oven.


If it's not done, return the fruitcake to the oven and check every 5 minutes till it's done.
 Once you've taken the fruitcake out of the oven, let it rest in the loaf pan for 20 minutes. Then, run a knife around the sides of the pan and flip the fruitcake onto a wire rack to finish cooling.


Letting it rest 20 minutes helps all the nuts, fruit, and cherries set up.
 Wait till the fruitcake is completely cool before slicing it. If you try to slice a warm fruitcake, the pieces will tear and fruit or nuts may come out in clumps.

 Pour the milk into a 2-quart (2-liter) saucepan. Whisk in the pumpkin puree and the sugar. Keep whisking until the pumpkin puree is completely mixed in.









Make sure that you are using plain pumpkin puree and not the pumpkin pie blend. The pumpkin pie blend contains additional ingredients that won't work in a latte.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat up to medium. Let the milk heat up until it starts to steam. Stir it constantly and don't let it come to a boil.
 The coffee must be strong, otherwise the latte will taste too milky. You can use freshly-brewed coffee from the coffee maker, or you can use instant coffee instead. For a more traditional latte, use 1 to 2 shots of espresso (about 30 to 60 milliliters) instead.
 If you want to, you can pulse the mixture with a handheld blender to make the milk more frothy.
 Top each one off with whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. You can also use cinnamon or nutmeg instead.

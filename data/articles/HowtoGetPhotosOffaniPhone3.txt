 To do so, plug your iPhone's charger cable into the phone, then plug the USB (larger) end into a USB port on your PC.

The USB port has a three-pronged symbol either beneath it or to the side of it.
If you're using a desktop computer, be sure to look for USB ports on the front and sides of the CPU box.
 This app, also known as "My Computer" on some operating systems, is the computer-shaped icon that should be on your desktop.

If This PC doesn't show up on your desktop, press the â‡± Home key and type "My Computer" into the search bar. It will pop up as a result.
 You'll see this option under the "Devices and Drives" heading at the bottom of the "My PC" menu.

Your iPhone should be named something like "(Your Name's) iPhone."
If you don't see your iPhone in the "Devices and Drives" section, plug your USB cable into a different port and try again.
 This folder should be near the top of the window., It's the only folder on this page., There will be several folders here, each named something like "100APPLE", "101APPLE", etc.

The higher the number in the folder's name, the more recent the photos in it are.
, To do this, hold down Ctrl and click each picture.

Your selection will only remain if you hold down Ctrl whenever you're clicking.
If you want to select all photos in a folder, hold Ctrl and press A.
 Any selected photos will come with the one you drag.

You may have to click the two overlapping squares icon in the top-right corner of the folder you're in to resize it so you can view the desktop.
 Your photos should now be on your computer's desktop.

You'll need to delete the pictures off of your iPhone if you want to keep them only on your computer.

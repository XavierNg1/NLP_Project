 To stay organized as best as possible, keep a record handy of all your travelling arrangements and appointments. Keep one easily acceptable document that lists all flight times, your hotel location, rental car company information, and scheduled business meetings.


Keep a printed copy on hand, and don’t just keep your itinerary on your phone or electronic device.The document should also list the contact information of people you are meeting on your business trip, just in case you need to report any delays or emergency situations.
 Obtain the proper currency, such as by using an exchange kiosk at your destination airport. Make sure your bank or credit card functions properly where you travel. Depending on the payment method your company wants you to use, you may need to verify branches of your bank exist at your destination, even if you’re traveling domestically.Call your bank or credit card company to let them know about your travel plans to avoid getting your card or account temporarily suspended.
Double check payment methods accepted by the hotel, airline or other locations.
Keep receipts and document your spending if you’re being reimbursed by your company.
 Some countries practice certain etiquette methods, which may be crucial to making the proper business impressions. Certain physical gestures and body movements are also interpreted differently and vary in each country. Your company or travel planner may be a good resource in learning how to communicate professionally with a different culture.Remember that you’ll be representing yourself, your company, and your country of origin. Learn about your destination’s culture and native language ahead of time by researching online, reading books, and checking out travel guides.
If your company offers any cross-cultural training classes or seminars, make sure to attend.

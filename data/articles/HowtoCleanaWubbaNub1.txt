 If you want to save time and wash your baby's bottles and other pacifiers at the same time, use a clean, plastic tub or sink instead.


You should wash the nipple part before giving the WubbaNub to your baby for the first time, even if you just took it out of the packaging.;
, You should use the same type of soap you use to clean your baby's bottles and pacifiers., Swirl it around. If the nipple part is very grimy, you may need to rub it between your fingers.
 This will help remove any surface dirt on the nipple.Keep rinsing the nipple until no soap residue remains.
 Fill a cup with boiled water. Place the nipple into the cup. Let it sit there for 2 to 4 minutes, then take the nipple out.You must do this before giving the WubbaNub to your baby for the first time.
Plan on sterilizing the nipple once a month.
 Position the WubbaNub so that the nipple is hanging upside down without touching anything. You could do this by setting it down in a dishrack or by hanging it from a clothesline. Make sure that no water can pool under the nipple, as this can lead to germ build up.

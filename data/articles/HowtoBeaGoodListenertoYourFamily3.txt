 Interrupting can put the breaks on effective conversation. Always allow a few seconds of silence after someone finishes talking before offering your response. This allows you to make sure the speaker is done talking.Do not talk over someone either. No matter how passionately you feel about a subject, do not start talking until the other person has finished.
 Unless you are explicitly asked, do not offer advice. Unsolicited advice can make it seem like you're not really listening. You're only hearing what you want, and offering advice in response. If someone just wants to talk, refrain from trying to tell them what to do., Never change the subject before the speaker has gotten their words out. Even if a subject makes you uncomfortable, it's important you let the speaker express themselves.If there's family drama, you may be tempted to hurry the speaker. For example, if they talk about how you talked to your father last week, you may start talking about something you saw on TV that night.
Avoid doing this. Part of communicating with your family is talking about difficult subjects at times. You need to allow conversations to flow where they will, even if a topic upsets you.
 Never rush the person talking. Do not interject with your interpretation before the speaker is finished just to hurry the speaker along. Never say things like, "Can you get to the point?" This will make it seem like you're not invested in the conversation., Even if you're frustrated or angry with someone, try to cultivate empathy when listening. Try to understand how the person feels and why. It's never a good idea to listen with judgment, as this will reduce your ability to fully communicate. Even if you disagree with someone's actions or opinions, avoid judgment.

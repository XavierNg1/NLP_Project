Some good free video capturing software that you might use includes:


Bandicam
Ezvid
Jing
Screenpresso;
, For this tutorial, we'll assume that you're working with Bandicam, which is free, easy to use, and allows you to record up to 10 minutes of gameplay in a single file.
 After you download and install Bandicam or a similar program, you'll have the option to play with the settings of the software in order to get the most out of the video you capture.


Here are the settings for Bandicam:

General: the General settings tab lets you control where you want your files to save to after they've been recorded.
Video: set your hotkeys for record, pause and stop; click the Settings tab here and navigate to Sound in order to turn on audio for your recordings; set your FPS here, as well, to a reasonable number (30 is plenty).
Image: lets you take screenshots with a hotkey.
 Start capturing video. Play your heart out. Experiment with the settings. The more video you record, the better you'll get at knowing what works and what doesn't.
 If your free video capturing software comes with editing capabilities, you may use that to cut, splice, transition, and tweak your capture. If your video capturing software doesn't come with editing software, you will need to download editing software and use that to edit your video to perfection.

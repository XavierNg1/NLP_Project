 Geeks hate management-speak and see it as superficial and dishonest. Managers shouldn’t learn to speak tech, but they should drop the biz-buzzwords. A manager can say “We need to proactively impact our time-to-market” or simply use plain English and stick to “We gotta be on time with this project”. The latter makes total sense to everyone involved.
 When managers don’t know much about a technical question, they should simply admit it. Geeks respect them for that, but not for pretending to know. And they will catch it––geeks are smart––that's why you employed them after all!


Even if you do know, don't lord this knowledge over everyone. Most geeks will be thinking the answer as quickly as you, there's no need to discuss the minutiae. The best thing you can do is to make it known that you are always available to answer questions or to clarify whatever you've just said. They'll take it from there and respect you all the more for it.

 WD-40 can remove dust and grime from stainless-steel appliances, including your refrigerator, stovetop, dishwasher, laundry machine, and clothes dryer.Spray the WD-40 onto dirty areas from about 2–3 inches away, and let sit for a couple of minutes before wiping down with a wet rag or a soapy sponge.


Although WD-40 can be used to remove splattered grease around kitchen in general, it’s less effective for this purpose than soap and water, or a general-purpose cleaner like Windex., The lubricating properties of WD-40 make it a useful for loosening dirt and grime in hard-to-reach places, including between kitchen or patio tiles. Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube about 1 inch away from the tiles or sections of grout that you wish to clean, and spray liberally. Let the fluid sit for a few minutes, and then clean up with soapy water.This method will clean a variety of substances off of tile, in addition to general dirt and grime, including: paint, scuff marks, makeup, and nail polish.
 Many porcelain surfaces in the bathroom are stained by mineral buildup from hard water. Other stains build up on these bathroom amenities as well, including some that may be left behind by other cleaning supplies. You can remove these by spraying WD-40 directly onto the stain, and then and then scrub vigorously with your toilet brush (or a sponge).You should not use WD-40 to replace regular toilet cleaner, as WD-40 cannot kill germs and bacteria. Rather, only use WD-40 to remove specific stains that general toilet cleaner can’t remove.
WD-40 can be used to remove stains from other surfaces made of porcelain (or a similar substance). For example, use it in your kitchen or dining room to remove stains made from tea or coffee cups.

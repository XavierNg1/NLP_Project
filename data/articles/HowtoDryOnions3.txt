 The onions should be peeled and sliced into rings that are 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) thick.


Cut off the root end of the onion and peel off the skins.
Use a mandoline to slice the onion if you have one, using the smallest or second smallest setting available. If you do not have a mandoline, using your sharpest kitchen knife to cut the onion as thin as possible.
 Arrange the onion slices onto your dehydrator trays in a single layer, positioning the trays so that they can receive plenty of air circulation.


The onions slices or rings should not overlap or touch. Keep them fairly spread apart to maximize air circulation.
The trays should also positioned far apart within the dehydrator. Keep at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of space in between trays to maximize circulation.
 If your dehydrator has a thermostat, run it at 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) until the rings dry.If you have an older or cheaper dehydrator that does not have a thermostat, you need to monitor the drying time more closely. The amount of time might need to be increased or decreased by an hour or so, and you can monitor the temperature with an oven-safe thermometer to gauge how big a time difference you need to account for.
 Keep the onions in a cool, dry location. Use them in your cooking or eat them plain.


If you vacuum seal the dried onions, they can last for up to 12 months. In slightly less airtight conditions, the onions can last 3 to 9 months.
Watch out for moisture. If you spot any moisture inside the container during the first few days of storage, take the onions out, dry them further, and dry the container before placing them back in. Moisture can cause the dried onions to spoil faster.
You could also crush the onions into flakes or powder for culinary purpose.

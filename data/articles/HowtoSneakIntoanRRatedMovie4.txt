, Have your person open the door from the inside and let you in. If there are people around before you go in, smoke or talk on the phone, acting like you had only left for a brief moment. It's good to carry an old ticket from a previous movie you saw so that if a bystander questions you, you can just flash them the ticket and say you just went out for a smoke/call.

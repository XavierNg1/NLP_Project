 Seasoned fantasy owners usually have a preferred method of ranking players. Some separate them into positions (catcher, first base, second base, shortstop, third base, outfield, pitcher) and rank them in order from best to worst. Others create a master list beginning with the most valuable fantasy players, while some separate the players by proficiency in a specific category (home runs, strikeouts, etc.). The choice of ranking is up to you, but be sure to have some sort of system in place so you’ll be more organized when the draft begins.
 If you’re drafting online, your league will likely feature its own live draft room that you can reach via a link on the main page. Live draft rooms are usually created roughly 30 minutes before the start of the draft, so be sure to jump in as soon as you have the chance. This ensures you do not arrive late and risk losing the opportunity to make your first pick. If you draft live, make sure you arrive a few minutes before the scheduled start time to set up and take care of any last-minute research.
 If you are fortunate enough to have the first overall pick, you should have a very good idea of who you want to select by the time the draft begins. If you’re selecting in any other slot, be sure to monitor all players who have been selected ahead of your pick so you don’t take anyone who has already been chosen.
 Baseball drafts often feature “position runs” in which fantasy owners opt to draft from the same position in the same round. This is especially common when selecting “closers,” a term referring to pitchers who come in to work the final inning of a game. It’s wise to ignore position runs—which often come about due to owner panic about position scarcity—and stick to your original plan. While closure come off the board, good players at other positions are available.

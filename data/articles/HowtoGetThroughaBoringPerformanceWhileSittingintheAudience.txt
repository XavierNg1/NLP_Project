 Remember why you have to be there and pay attention to it. If your friends or siblings are performing, you can just watch them and give them some feelings and advices afterward. They will be very happy!

If you're just too bored or can't get into it, follow the next step.

, Then you can take a short walk. However it is rude to walk out during a performance; you especially should not walk between the performance and the audience.
 Most phones have games, if not, explore its settings. You could even scroll through social media to see what people you know are doing e.g Facebook, Instagram. Keep the light down if it is dark in the audience. Keep the sound down or you will look like a jerk. It is better to refrain from looking at your phone for very long, though; try diverting your attention to the performance from time to time, especially if a friend/loved one is on stage.
 Look up at the ceiling and count the tiles or wooden planks. Do isometric exercises which are not obvious. You do not want to embarrass anyone., Look at the performance and analyze how the set was built, how the tech works, and how you would do it. You could also look at how the seats are set out., How would you escape (assuming you can run, jump and climb)? Imagine if a crazy gunman came in; how would you escape or defend yourself? How would you barricade and defend the room if you knew hordes of zombies were approaching?

, If you know you are going and you have a hoodie and an iPod, hide the iPod in your hoodie's pocket and run the cord through the inside of the hoodie, put the earphones on and jam. Some jackets have hoods with speakers in them, specifically made to play iPods. If anyone overhears this it will be very offensive.
 If you have a program, count the number of words in it, then read it backwards.
 This always works for me. Time will go by quickly. Just think about school, friends, what would happen if...., and such

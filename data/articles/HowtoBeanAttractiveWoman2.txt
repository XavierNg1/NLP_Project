 Whether it's talking, eating, gaming, dancing, or snorkeling, it's only polite to join in. Who knows, you might learn something, too. A person who just sits there watching might as well be wearing a flashing neon sign that says "I'm a boring person who doesn't like fun!"


This doesn't mean you should join in drinking or partying if you're not into those things. Participate only in what you have fun doing.
To get involved, walk kindly up to a person or group and ask, "Do you mind if I join you?" If they say yes, go ahead and have fun. If they say no, you probably wouldn't have had fun joining them anyway!

, You don't need to have something in common with a guy for conversation to blossom, but it helps. If a guy tries to talk to you and you just stand there, he's going to move on, so learn to be interested in lots of different topics and remember to ask questions.


A good conversation starter is to ask his opinion about something superficial, such as whether INXS picked the right guy or if he did anything fun recently. Avoid asking him for input about your looks, as it can seem like you're fishing for compliments.
Keep the conversation light. Above all, don't put yourself down, unless you do so in a humorous way.
Maintain eye contact. This will help establish a deeper connection. You're reminding him that you're paying attention, and that you expect him to do the same.

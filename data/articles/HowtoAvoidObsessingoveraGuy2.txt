 There may be something to the old saying “out of sight, out of mind.” Your ability to move on may be complicated because you are still entangled with this guy. Break off contact for a while and try to avoid seeing this person to stop obsessing.


Take a mini detox from social media so you don't stalk their page. Temporarily remove their number from your phone (be sure to write it down in an address book if this is someone you plan on talking to again) so you are not tempted to call or text them., If you’re still obsessing over a guy, chances are there are still some unresolved issues hanging around. You will need to find closure in order to fully move on and reclaim your life.


Get closure by performing a ritual. There are many approaches you can try. You can box up all the memories you have of this person and trash or donate the box. Or, you might write a letter to the person sharing your feelings. Then, burn it or tear it to pieces., Getting to know someone new can help you finally seal the deal of getting over an old flame. Plus, once you meet a better match, you might forget why your crush was so interesting anyway.Put out feelers to see if your social circle can hook you up with someone. Join a new club or take a class to meet new people. Or, create a profile and try online dating.

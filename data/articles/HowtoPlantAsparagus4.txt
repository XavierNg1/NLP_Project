 Asparagus plants will reach maturity after two full growing seasons. In the meantime, keep the soil moist at all times.
 Asparagus plants will die if they have to compete for nutrients with weeds, grasses, and any other plants. Take good care of the soil while the plants reach maturity. When they're older, their deep roots will naturally crowd out weeds.
 In spring, fertilize the asparagus plants with a liquid fertilizer meant to stimulate growth. During the winter, protect the plants from the cold by covering them with straw or another mulch.
 Asparagus plants are susceptible to asparagus beetles, which feed on the fern-like asparagus foliage during summer and spring. They lay eggs on the asparagus leaves. If you see the beetles or their eggs, pick them off.

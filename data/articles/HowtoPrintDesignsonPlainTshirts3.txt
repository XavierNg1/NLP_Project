 For this method you just need a t-shirt, a package of iron-on transfer paper, and a printer. Iron-on transfer paper is available at most craft stores.
 Use design software to create a graphic design to print on your t-shirt. You could choose a photo or picture you found online or create graphic art. The great thing about using an iron-on transfer is that there's no need to feel limited by the amount of colors you can use.
 Feed the paper into your printer so that the design will print onto the side of the paper that will transfer it to the t-shirt.
 Smooth it out to remove any wrinkles or folds. Place the iron-on transfer design-side down on the t-shirt. Place a thin cloth, such as a dishcloth, over the transfer.
 Place a hot iron over the cloth so that it heats the transfer underneath. Hold it there for the amount of time recommended on the iron-on transfer instructions.
 Remove the cloth and use your fingers to gently lift the paper transfer backing. It should easily fall away from the t-shirt, leaving the transferred image behind. If you have trouble lifting it, press it down and use the iron to heat it once more, then try again.

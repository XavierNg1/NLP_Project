 The formula is V = x height of the prism. You can use the first part of the formula to find the area of the pentagonal base face. You can think of this as finding the area of the five triangles that make up a regular polygon. The side is simply the width of one triangle, and the apothem is the height of one of the triangles. You'll be multiplying by 1/2 because that's part of finding the area of a triangle and then multiplying this by 5 because 5 triangles make up the pentagon.For more information on finding the apothem if one is not provided for you, look here., Let's say the length of a side is 6 cm and the length of the apothem is 7 cm. Just plug these numbers into the formula:


A = 1/2 x 5 x side x apothem
A = 1/2 x 5 x 6 cm x 7 cm = 105 cm2


, Let's say the height of the shape is 10 cm.
 Just multiply the area of the pentagonal base, 105 cm2, times the height, 10 cm, to find the volume of the regular pentagonal prism.


105 cm2 x 10 cm = 1050 cm3


, The final answer is 1050 cm3.

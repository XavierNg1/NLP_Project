 Before the chocolate expands and grows, take them out. They will stop expanding for a move if you break at least one square. If left unmonitored, the chocolate may end up eating your hard-earned target candies.
 Don’t just go for the basic three-candy match. Be creative and seek further combos. Make combinations using a four or more candies. These combos may just shake your board enough for candies to fall in your needed order.
 Look for ways to get the special candies next to each other. Combine these special candies to make great combos, which can also shake your board.


It will be good if you can combine a Wrapped Candy and a Striped Candy, or a Candy Bomb and a Striped Candy.
 This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move.

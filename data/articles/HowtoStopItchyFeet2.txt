 One of the most common causes of itchy feet, athlete’s foot usually causes a red, scaly rash on and in between your toes. Your feet may be itchiest right after removing your socks and shoes. You might get athlete’s foot on just one foot or on both.You might also get blisters on your feet, or ulcers – areas where your skin rubs off.
One type of athlete’s foot starts on the sole of your foot and causes dryness and scaling that travels over the side of your foot.
 Mild athlete’s foot can often be treated with OTC powders, sprays, or ointments that fight fungal infections. You can ask your doctor for recommendations, or speak with the pharmacist at your local drug store. Common brands are Tinactin, Micatin, Lamisil, and Lotrimin-AF.Rinse your feet and dry them really well, especially in between your toes. Then apply the medication to the tops, bottoms, and sides of both feet, and in between all your toes.
Use the medicine two times every day until the rash goes away. This may take several weeks (sometimes 4-6 weeks).
 If OTC medications don’t clear up your athlete’s foot in 4-6 weeks, you may need prescription-strength medication.Visit your doctor to discuss this option. Stronger medication may be available to put on your feet, or you might need to take an antifungal medicine as a pill.


Oral antifungal medications can affect your liver, so let your doctor know if you have or have ever had liver problems.
 Athlete’s foot, caused by a fungus, thrives in damp environments. Keep your feet dry, and change your socks and shoes as soon as possible if they get wet. Dry your feet thoroughly before putting your socks on.Athlete’s foot is also highly contagious, so if you share a swimming pool or locker room with others, protect yourself. Wear shower shoes in the locker room and shower, and don’t share towels or linens with someone who has an infection.
Clean your feet regularly, washing between your toes with soap.

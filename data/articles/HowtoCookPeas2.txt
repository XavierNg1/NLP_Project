 You can use any type of peas for this method, such as: frozen peas, fresh peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas. Start out by rinsing the peas, then prepare them as follows:


Fresh peas: snap the stems off, then pull them down to remove the string. Split the pea pods open, and run your thumb down the center to pop the peas out.
Frozen peas: open the bag and take the peas out. You do not have to do anything more.
Snow peas: snap or cut off both ends with your fingers of a knife. You don't have to remove the strings.
Sugar snap peas: pinch the stems off, then throw out any bruised or damaged peas.
 You will need about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water.
 Make sure that the bottom of the basket is not touching the surface of the water. If the basket is touching the water, pour some water out.
 The peas are done when they turn crisp and bright green.The cooking times for the various peas are as follows:


Fresh peas: 1 to 2 minutes
Frozen peas: 2 to 3 minutes
Snow peas: 2 to 3 minutes
Sugar snap peas: 2 to 3 minutes

, You can season them with some salt, pepper, and butter. You can also use them in your recipe (ie: casseroles, macaroni and cheese, pasta, etc).

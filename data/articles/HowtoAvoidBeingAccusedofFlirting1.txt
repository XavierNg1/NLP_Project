, You will find yourself facing a hundred new opportunities to flirt or act flirty if you are sitting right next to the boy. If you have assigned seats in class, there isn't anything you can do. Asking the teacher to move you if friends have already accused you of flirting is a bad idea. They will think you have way over-reacted, which shows you are too sensitive or really do like the boy, and it might offend him.
 If your girl friends and you have a 'girl's night out', or something similar when only one or two of you get together, do not insist that the boy comes along. Your friends may be offended that you don't want to spend time only with them, and instant accusations of, "ooh, you like him, don't you?!" will roll around. If it is obvious that the outing is only for a few select people, do not invite extras.
 Even if flirting is in your nature, suddenly paying attention to only one boy will invite comments from your other friends.
 A sudden change in behavior around him may arouse suspicions. Keep cool, act normal. Treat him like you would treat a friend.

 This method is similar to the stick method, but it’s more reliable because it uses a longer observation time. Locate flat ground and collect your tools:


A stick or pole that’s two to five feet long
One small sharp stick
Two small rocks
Something like a long string

, This must be done before noon. Wherever the shadow of the pole ends, place a rock.
 Tie the sharp stick to one end of the string, and the other end of the string to the pole, making sure it’s just long enough to reach the rock on the ground.
 With the rock as your starting point, use the sharp stick that's attached to the pole to draw the circle in the ground around the pole.
 When the shadow from the pole finally touches this circle again, mark the point where it connected with the other rock.
 The straight line that connects the first rock with the second rock is the east–west line, where the first rock represents west and the second rock represents east.To find north and south from this point, north will be clockwise from west, and south will be clockwise from east.

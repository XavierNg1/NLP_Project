 Try pressing all the keys your Android device has and see if there’s any response. A device that has been frozen or completely stuck will not work no matter what button you press.
 Press and hold your Android device’s Power button and the Volume Down key for at least 5 seconds or until the screen shuts down.


Release the buttons once you see the screen lighting up again. Instead of the usual welcome screen, a black screen will appear showing a list of text options. This is the Android console, or boot, screen.
 Using your Volume keys, move up or down the text options and highlight “Reboot System Now” from the Console screen.


Press the Power button to select this option and your Android device will restart.
 The device screen will shut off and then switch on again as it reboots. It should be able to start up, reach the usual welcome screen or logo, and after a few seconds, resume normal operation.

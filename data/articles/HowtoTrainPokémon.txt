 You might just want to get through to the next area of the game as fast as possible, and therefore try to ignore as many trainers as possible. This is counter-productive, as it would be wiser to train the skills now and go back to the Poke center than walk all the to the area just to get a few battles.;
, This lets you re-challenge enemies after walking a certain amount of steps. If you use this in tandem with normal training, you can maximize your efficiency, as defeating trainers almost always gives you more experience than fighting normal pokemon.
 For example, fighting audino gives you a thousand plus experience every time you fight it, so looking out for the shaking bushes in which it resides is always worth it.
 The method for getting these are different among games, but rather easy to acquire earlier in the game. This allows you to transfer some of the exp per battle to a Pokémon in your party, by having that Pokémon hold the exp share. Therefore, this allows you to train your lower leveled Pokémon without having to use them in battle

, Put the Pokémon you want to train as the first Pokémon in your party and get a wild encounter. On your first turn, switch out that Pokémon to your main pokemon, or another Pokémon you want to train with that is better suited. Finish of the pokemon, and both Pokémon used in battle should get the exp.
 Don't use them right away for the easy levels from 5-6 or similar levels. Wait for your Pokémon to be higher leveled, at least 70, where these candies will be most effective. If you use them early, the time saved now versus the potential time saved would be astronomically different.
 These won't actually raise levels, but they will raise the stats of the Pokémon you are trying to level up, meaning that you can kill enemies faster and therefore get more exp faster.

 You will have to delete all the data from the partition in order to unpartition your drive. Look at our article on how to back up your computer for a detailed guide on how to do this.
 This tool can be found by opening Finder and searching for "Disk Utility" in the search bar.
 From the list of disks on the left side of the window, locate the disk that houses your partitioned drive. If you have never added any additional storage space, you should only see one SSD. The different drives will be listed beneath each disk, so find the disk with the drive that you wish to remove.


Click on the name of the disk, rather than any drives beneath the disk, such as Main.
 You should see five tabs on the top of the main section of the window; click on the one that says Partition. It should be in between Erase and RAID.


After clicking, you should see a header titled "Partition Information" beneath the tabs.
 Beneath the "Partition Layout" title, you should see the different partitions on the disk as white boxes.


After clicking, be sure there is a blue border around the white box.
 When prompted from a drop-down dialog box, click "Remove."


Again, be sure you have backed up any data you want to preserve. This step will delete any data on the partition.
 There should now be empty gray space where the previous box (partition) used to be. Click on the three lines in the bottom right of the "Main" box and drag the box all the way down. While dragging, you should see the value in "Size" increase.
 Click on Partition on the drop-down dialog box when prompted.


This step may take a little while depending on how much data is on the main drive. The disk is being reformatted, so give it time.

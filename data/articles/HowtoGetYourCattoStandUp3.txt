 Cats do not respond well to punishment. When punished, most cats get aggravated and simply disengage. Punishing a cat during training will end up alienating your cat. If a cat is scolded consistently over time, this can cause stress which can lead to litter box issues, compulsive grooming, and health problems. If your cat is not behaving, simply do not offer a reward. Avoid yelling at your cat, placing him in a cage, or any other form of punishment.Never hit or physically harm a cat as punishment. This causes your cat a lot of stress and lead to a bad relationship between you and your cat.
 You want to make sure you end training sessions on a high note. If training becomes stressful, your cat may refuse to behave. Watch for body language that indicates stress, fear, or aggression. If your cat seems upset, cut the training session short and try again the next day.If a cat's ears are held back slightly, he may be feeling scared or aggressive. Watch his eyes as well. Slightly dilated pupils tend to indicate fear while fully dilated pupils can indicate aggression.
A cat's tail can also be an indicator of mood. If the fur on the tail is standing up, your cat is likely angry or frightened. If your cat holds his tail low or tucks it between his legs, he's likely scared. A tail that's thrashing back and forth indicates anger and potential aggression.
 If your cat has existing joint problems, or is very overweight, avoid teaching him to stand. Standing up can put stress on your cat's joints, which may aggravate existing medical conditions.

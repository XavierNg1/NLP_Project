 Like most animals, chinchillas are easiest to train when they are young and not yet set in their ways.You can adopt a chinchilla around nine months old, but if you have younger chinchillas from a litter you can begin the potty-training process around six months old.;
, Potty training can be a bit stressful for a chinchilla, so let her adapt to her new home before you try to begin the process.


While you wait, use the same bedding on the floor of her cage that you plan to use in the litter box.You cannot use cat litter for a chinchilla, but there are several options for bedding that are safe, including kiln-dried pine shavings, newspaper, or clean straw (oat, rice, or wheat)., A few weeks after bringing home your chinchilla, head to your local pet supply store.


You will need a litter pan, a litter scoop, and rodent litter. You can use a cat litter pan, but do not use cat litter, which rodents will ingest.

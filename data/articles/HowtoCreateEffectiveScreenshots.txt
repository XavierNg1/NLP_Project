 You will need something that will allow you to paste your screenshot that you make. Things that you would look for in a program are the ability to:



 



Resize an image.

Crop your image.

Annotate your image (this is what takes your screenshot from mediocre to effective).;
, Programs like Irfanview are great because they have a small 'footprint' and are easy to learn, but you can't annotate the photo very easily.
 You want it to:






Show just what you need it to. You may need the whole screen, but maybe you need only part of it. Think about it and just crop to what you need.
Resize it smaller if it needs it. Depending on your monitor resolution, your graphic could get pretty large.
 Especially when you have a software or browser that is slightly different from the norm. You want to be sure that people can still understand what they are seeing. The screenshot above has no annotations that help a user understand how to do what. Note the changes on this screenshot.
 Just calling it 'Image 001' helps no one, including you. You will find yourself regretting it when you go to upload it and have to figure out which one of 20 that it is.

 The easiest way to find your state's website is to use a site that provides a list of websites for the whole country, such as http://www.canivote.org.


Once on the website, you will choose the state that you want to search and you will be redirected to the selected state’s website. You can find your state's website by selecting it from a drop down list.You may be able to access your state's electoral roll in person or by phone, but it depends on your state. For instance, Oklahoma only has the records available on the internet.;
, Each state has its own requirements for what information you need to search for a registered voter. Generally, states may require the following information:


The person’s first and last name.
The person’s date of birth.
The county and/or the zip code where the person is registered to vote.The person’s voter id number.
The person’s driver’s license number., Once you have identified and gathered the required information, you can conduct your search of the voter registration lists. In order to be successful in your search, you must provide very specific information that may be difficult to obtain if you are searching for the registration status of someone other than yourself.


If you know the first and last name of the person you are searching for, you may be able to locate where they live through a simple internet search for their name. For some states, this is enough information to use in searching for a person’s voter registration status.
 While it depends on each state’s search requirements, it is unlikely that your search will provide you multiple people with the same name. It is much more likely that your search will not come up with any matches for the information that you provided.


If you did not find the person that you were looking for, review the information that you gathered and determine whether the person lives in a different location, double-check the spelling of the person’s name and other identifying information.

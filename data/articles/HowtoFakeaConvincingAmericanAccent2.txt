 Southern American English is distinct from Yooper dialect, which is spoken in the upper peninsula of Michigan. For you to pull off a convincing accent, you're going to have to choose one specific dialect and stick with it. Common dialects include:


General American (used in mainstream media, similar to many Midwestern dialects)African American Vernacular English (sometimes called "ebonics")
Eastern New England
Southern
New York
Northern
Western, Certain dialects have features that are absent in others. For example, the phrase "you all" is spoken as normal in General American, but contracts to "y'all" (one word) in Southern dialect. When your dialect is decided, find terms like these with a keyword search for "slang in ."


Learning slang terms in dialects of American English can also improve your listening skill. Many slang terms, like the "you all" variant of Pittsburghese ("yinz"), are difficult to follow without explanation.
 The more you hear the target dialect, the more natural it will become for you. Listen to music made by natives in the target dialect. If you live outside of America, try to make friends who use this dialect through cultural exchanges and meetups.Ask a friend, colleague, or acquaintance who speaks this dialect if you can record them. Make a recording on your phone, and listen carefully to the speaker's pronunciation.
 Play a recording of the dialect you're imitating. Try to mimic it exactly. Replay the recording after speaking to check your pronunciation. Have others listen to you and make suggestions.Practicing speaking in a new way can cause a kind of exhaustion, sometimes referred to as "language fatigue." Using facial muscles you're not used to can be tiring. Take plenty of breaks.

 If you find yourself falling asleep after eating sweets, try exercising. A gentle walk or a full-blown workout can help energize you. Try going for a short walk around your office building if your afternoon treat leaves you feeling lethargic., If you find yourself crashing, itâ€™s easy to reach for another cookie or energy drink for a quick boost. Avoid doing this, as you will only cause your blood sugar to peak and then crash again, possibly leaving you more tired., Another way to overcome the sleepiness brought about by consuming too much sugar is to step outside. Sunshine can warm and invigorate you. Spending time in the sun will give you an added boost of vitamin D, a nutrient that is essential to overall health and wellbeing.

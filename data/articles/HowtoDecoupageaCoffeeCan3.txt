 After painting the background, you can begin applying your cutouts. Images or shapes cut from magazine pages work well, as do cutouts from photographs or craft paper.
 The easiest way to apply the cutouts to the painted coffee can is by dabbing a bit of all-in-one decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge, to the back of the cutout. Then, carefully press the cutout onto the can to affix it.


If you do not have a decoupage glue, you can mix regular white all-purpose glue with water until it reaches the consistency of thin paint. This glue mixture can even be used as a final varnish, as it dries almost completely clear.
 After you have finished decorating the can, you can leave it as-is or you can seal it to give it a more inlaid, professional appearance.


If you are using Mod Podge or a similar decoupage glue, apply several thin coats of the glue over the entire surface of the coffee can. Check the product packaging for recommended wait times between coats.
You can also seal the coffee can using a thinned mixture of craft glue and water. If you are worried about a hazy, translucent finish using this method, test the glue mixture first on another surface.

 The “standard” beach ball size will likely work best for this project.
 Blow into the air spigot, making sure not to let any air escape, until the ball is about half to three-quarters of the way inflated. You can adjust this to how big you want your belly to be.


If you want a huge belly, then go ahead and inflate the ball all the way. It will look cartoonishly large for a pregnancy, but that might be what you’re going for with your costume.
 Again, you can use ace bandages, bandeaus, or tank tops to do this. Because a beach ball doesn’t have nearly as much weight as a helmet or two blankets, you won’t have to work so hard to keep it in place — a single tight bandeau or tank top should do the trick.


Make sure to point the air nozzle down toward the ground. If it points out or up, it will be noticeable through your shirt, and if it points back toward you, it will irritate your skin and start hurting after a little while.
 With this method, you might even be able to get away with a tighter shirt! Try out a few different shirts and see which one goes best with your fake belly.

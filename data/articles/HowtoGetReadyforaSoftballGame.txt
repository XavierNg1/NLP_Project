 You may want to consider taking it easy during the hours before the game. Lay down, take a shower, watch a movie. Do whatever it takes to calm you down and relax you.;
, Don't forget water!


Eat lots of carbohydrates the night before your game. Have the team over for a pasta party!
Avoid junk food. It won't help and will only hurt you.
 Maybe wear a tank top or a t-shirt.
 Compression shorts are tight shorts usually made out of Spandex. They keep everything in place while you are running and you wear them under your regular shorts. Sliding shorts are just like compression shorts, but they have padding on the outer thighs to protect your legs and thighs when you are sliding

, It is recommended that you wear the netted kind, but ask your coach about the best color. Sometimes coaches require certain colors to complete your uniform and to make everyone look the same.
 The shirt tends to look best when ironed.
 Make sure you have softball cleats, and tie them tightly. The umpire could call you on untied shoelaces, and it wastes precious game time and presents a general annoyance.
 If you have long hair, you must put it in a ponytail. If you have bangs, use a stretchy hair band, pre-wrap, or hair clips to keep everything in place. Keep it neutral with the hair accessories, and consider topping it off with hairspray to get rid of flyaways.
 And absolutely, no earrings. Remove rings and necklaces and anything else that might catch.
 At minimum, it should contain a glove, a water bottle, a helmet, and a bat. You could also have batting gloves, a batting donut, glove oil, extra hair bands/clips.
 If you're traveling, include plenty of things to do while traveling and clothing changes.

 Top stories are determined by a Facebook algorithm that takes into account the popularity of certain posts, the nature of the post's topic, and more. Recent news updates are sorted in the order in which they were posted by the friends and pages you follow.


Click on the "Sort" link located in the upper-right corner of the News Feed section. A drop-down menu will display that gives you the option to view your news feed by recent news updates, or top stories.
 This option is only available if you have your Facebook friends organized into different lists. For example, if you placed professional contacts into a list called "Co-workers," you can click on "Co-workers" to see all the recent news posted by your professional contacts.


Click on any friends list located within your left sidebar to view a news feed that will only display updates from those specific people.

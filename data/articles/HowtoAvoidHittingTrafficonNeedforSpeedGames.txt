 The rule of the road uses the right-hand side to get into a risk of collision. The left side is where most likely to hit you but then mostly, then suddenly, the cars go by you on the right-hand side, You can use this for shortcuts but then get back on the right-hand side.;
, If you are not paying attention, then you will most likely to hit or go near miss. Near miss are very good tricks that you nearly go into a collision. But be careful that when you hit into collision when you are near a car in 2nd place, the car will go by you really fast while the other cars can.
 If you're still playing it can reduce the speed of mph. If you did that, then suddenly, you will lose the race really fast.
 The shortcuts are very fast and there is no traffic on the but if you miss the shortcut. Try the Free Run mode, this will more likely to help you. It won't work on older Need for Speed games. It appears on Need for Speed: Underground and newer games.

 First and foremost, you need to know everything about your product. When someone asks a question, you need to be able to answer it without hesitation. If you can't, that person may walk away, and you miss a potential sale., People don't just want to connect with a product on a logical level. They want to connect on a emotional level, as well. You need to make a connection with each person by being able to tell what's special about your product and why they should use it.You need to have a spiel that you can give out to people, but you also need to be able to change it up a little so that it doesn't sound rehearsed.
For example, if you started the skincare line so your kid would have products to use, that's something you can tell a story about. You've created a line of all-natural skincare products so that everyone can have healthy skin, just like your kid.
 You're building a relationship with your customers, even if it's only a 5 minute conversation. That means you need to try to connect with them with what you're saying, so don't be afraid to just strike up a conversation.One way to connect is to ask questions about what your customer wants. Once you figure out what he or she wants, you can better address how your product is right for them.
 Don't just tell them how great your product is; let them know how it will help them in the long run. Show them the way that it can help create healthier skin, for instance, as that's a long term goal they can connect with.One way to help customers focus on how the product can help them is to provide samples. If they see how great your lotion feels on their hands, they'll be more inclined to buy it.

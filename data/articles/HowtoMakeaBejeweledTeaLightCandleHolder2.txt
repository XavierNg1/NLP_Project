 If you're drawing anything on the jar, do it before gluing on the jewels. It'll be harder to do this if anything is already glued onto the jar.


In the example for this article, draw two horizontal lines spaced apart evenly right the way around the middle of the jar. Leave enough room within the two lines for adding the gemstones. Then, draw evenly spaced vertical lines all the way around the middle, in between the two horizontal lines.
 Following your plan, glue each jewel in place and hold firmly in place for at least 10 seconds, or as long as instructed by the glue manufacturer.


For the example in this article, glue each jewel at even intervals around the band you've drawn on the glass jar, inside the horizontal lines.
 You don't have to add more than the bejeweled objects. However, there is no harm in adding more things if you'd like, such as glitter or sequins. Follow your plan.
 When it's dry, it's ready to use.

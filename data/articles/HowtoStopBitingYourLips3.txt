 In some cases, biting is triggered by the structure of your mouth. If your teeth are misaligned, your body might be unconsciously trying to realign them by placing your lips between them. If you have an overbite or another type of misalignment that you think might be causing your biting, see a dentist so you can discuss how to fix it.A dentist will be able to let you know whether misalignment is a factor in your biting. Treatments may include getting braces or a retainer to correct the issue. Once your teeth are aligned, you should stop biting.
 If you bite down on your lip or cheek by accident, you might create a lump. It can be difficult to avoid biting down on the protrusion as it heals. To help prevent repeated accidental bites, ice your bump on and off until the swelling subsides. Put a wedge of cloth in your mouth during sedentary activities to prevent mindless accidental biting.
 You might accidentally bite yourself if you eat quickly or have a misaligned jaw. Like another accidental biting, one bite can put you at risk for repeated and increasingly painful bites. If you bite your lip or cheek while chewing, give your mouth time to heal. Eat soft foods like yogurt, applesauce, and soup for a few days until the swelling goes down.

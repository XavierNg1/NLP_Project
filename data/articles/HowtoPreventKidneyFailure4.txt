 High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels leading into and out of your kidneys. This causes your kidneys to become unable to filter the waste that they receive, causing dangerous levels of fluid and waste to accumulate in the kidneys., If you have high blood pressure and are worried about your kidneys, talk to your doctor. Chances are, your doctor probably has already prescribed anti-hypertensive (anti-high blood pressure) medicine that you should take daily. Some of the most common medications for this condition include:


atenolol, amlodipine, ramipril and enalapril.
 Walking for 30 to 40 minutes each morning can help you to relax and keep you healthy. When you relax through exercise, you are actively keeping your blood pressure under control.


If you donâ€™t like walking alone, join a walking group or walk with a friend each morning.
 Stress plays a big part when it comes to your blood pressure. Exercising can be a great way to reduce stress, but you can also try other methods. Try meditating every day for 30 minutes or take yoga classes that will teach you how to relax by controlling your breath and focusing on the movement of your body.
 As mentioned in Method 2, eating too much salt can really elevate your blood pressure. Try to eat less salt each day; aim for about 6 gm of salt daily. Avoid high salt foods like:


Soups, gravies, and broths.
Soy sauce and salad dressings.
Salami, bacon, and cured meats.
Cheese.
Snack foods (like pretzels and chips).
Pickled foods.

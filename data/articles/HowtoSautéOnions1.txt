 You want the kind that are free of blemishes and that are heavy and firm. A little goes a long way, so don't get too many. One or two is usually enough for a family of 5, depending on the size of the onion.


1 large onion is about 1 cup (8 oz) of chopped onion. To gauge your recipe, go from there.;
, This part is a matter of personal preference or recipe -- chopped, sliced, diced; however you want 'em, it'll work.


Want to avoid crying while dealing with the onions? Chill them first -- cold onions will be nicer on your eyes. Then, chop them under water, next to a candle, or wear swimmer's goggles.
 Sautéing involves heating up a substance very quickly at a high temperature, so make sure your pan gets hot before you start.
 Once the pan is hot enough, pour in some oil. Don't overdo it initially; you can always add more. Put in enough to spread all over the bottom of the pan. You should end up using about 1 tablespoon (15 g) per onion.When it comes to oil, olive oil is a good choice. Butter is also a tasty fat for sauteed onions. If you're going super low fat, consider using vegetable or chicken broth., As they cook, have a spatula on hand to push them around the pan so they don't stick. If you're getting fancy, do that flipping move you see the pros do when they're sautéing. But be careful; splashing oil on yourself is not a pleasant experience.


Keep those suckers moving. You don't want half to be white and raw and the other half almost black. Onions cook very quickly, so stay by the pan's side, constantly moving 'em around to avoid crowding.
 When the onions are done (should take around 5-7 minutes) turn off the pan and spoon the onions into another bowl to cool off before you serve them. Or add them to another part of the meal, such as sauce, or just eat them then and there!

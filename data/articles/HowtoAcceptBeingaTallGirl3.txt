 Unfortunately, some people will always have mean things to say about your height. Know that the people who insult you are often just jealous. You can take some of the fun out of teasing you by laughing along and not taking stupid comments personally.If you don’t react to insults, people will probably get bored and stop trying to tease you.
If boys make fun of you, it might be because they feel intimidated around a girl who’s taller than them. Their insecurity is the problem, not your height.
If you’re being bullied in school, let your parents and your teachers know what’s going on. No one should have to put up with bullying, especially over something they can’t control like height.
 Remember that, as a tall girl, you need to weigh more than your shorter friends – it doesn’t mean you’re fat. Instead of comparing your weight to other people’s, use a BMI chart to find your healthy weight range.A good rule of thumb is to add five pounds of weight for every inch of height. For instance, if your 5’4” friend is 120 pounds and you are 6 inches taller, you might want to weigh about 150 pounds.
This guideline will vary based on your frame size and lifestyle. For instance, if you’re an athlete, you might weigh more due to muscle mass.
 Size doesn’t determine how compatible you are with another person. If you want to date someone shorter than you, that’s your business and no one else’s. Enjoy the relationship, and don’t let rude comments get to you.If someone teases you about dating a shorter person, stand up for yourself. Say “Why does it matter?” or “We really like each other, and I’d appreciate it if you stopped making jokes.”

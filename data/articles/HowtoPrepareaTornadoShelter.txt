 Determine what kind of tornadoes your area is most vulnerable to, which may be frequent weak ones associated with thunderstorms (such as in Florida), or occasional strong tornadoes accompanied by supercell storms, which are most common in much of the Midwest United States. Contact your local weather bureau if you aren't familiar with the local climate or want to be certain.;
, Designate an interior room as your shelter, without windows and with the most distance between you and the outside.
 Stock enough nonperishable food and bottled water to last for at least three days or longer. Store other food related items such as utensils and can openers as well.
 Collect plenty of spare clothing, weather gear, blankets, shoes, etc. to store in your shelter. Since tornadoes often strike at a moment's notice, you won't always be wearing the right clothing when you need to make use of the shelter.
 These are the last items you'll want to forget in the event of a tornado.
 The items and materials inside it can help you attend to minor injuries in the aftermath of a tornado.
 These will be helpful for seeing through damage in the dark, as well as keeping an ear on the current weather conditions.

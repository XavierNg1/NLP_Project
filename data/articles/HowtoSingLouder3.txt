 Singing directly into the center of the microphone will pick up the best range of sound in your voice. You should still project your voice to the back of the room, but don't be afraid to sing into the microphone.Practice using the microphone and ask a friend or vocal coach to tell you how loud you are. Try singing directly into the microphone and compare it to singing into the side of the microphone. Ask for feedback about your volume.
 You'll need to be very close to the microphone for it to pick up your voice. You lips should almost touch the microphone if you're singing softly and if you sing loudly, your lips should be a few centimeters from the mic.If you stand too far back from the microphone, the mic probably won't be able to pick up your voice.
 If you're singing close to the microphone, some words can make a loud popping noise. Move your mouth slightly to the side of the microphone when singing words that start with "P" or "B." After the word, direct your face back to the center of the microphone.You only need to move a little to the side of the microphone. Don't worry if you still get occasional pops while singing. This is to be expected with using a microphone.
 Plan on how you'll use your microphone for each song. Sing through the song, moving closer during slower or quieter parts and back away from the microphone during parts of the song that require you to speed up, sing louder, or sing at a higher pitch.Use the microphone to your advantage. It can easily amplify your voice during softer parts of a song and you can back away a few inches when you need your sound to really pop.

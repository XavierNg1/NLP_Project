 Motion sickness is most likely caused by the conflict of signals between your eyes and the balancing sensors in your inner ear.Watching the horizon in front of the boat gives you a steadier view. If that is not an option, close your eyes.


If the movement at the bow is too much for you, move back to the center of the boat.
 Stay above deck whenever possible, away from stuffy enclosed spaces and unpleasant smells. It's best to choose the lee of the boat (the side away from wind) in case you need to vomit.
 Start an activity before you start feeling sick, and continue it as long as you can. Help steer the boat if possible, as this helps you anticipate motion and requires you to focus on the horizon. If you are a passenger on a larger craft, distract yourself by counting birds and ships.Do not read or look at a screen. Focusing your eyes on a nearby point is terrible for seasickness.
Avoid others who are experiencing motion sickness, as the sight or smell of others being sick may bring on or worsen your own sea sickness., If nothing else works, lie down with your body parallel to the side of the boat, with your head pointed towards the bow. This reduces the sensation of motion and increases blood flow to the head, which can counteract the light-headed, dizzy feel some people experience.Keep your eyes closed unless there's a convenient view of the horizon.


A hammock helps reduce the sensation of side-to-side movement.
If you are in a bunk, wedge thick life jackets or other objects under the mattress to create a V-shape between the mattress and the wall. Lie in the narrow V so you are pinned against the wall, restricting your motion.

 The thicker the headband, the more ribbon you will be able to use, provided that you have wider and longer lengths of ribbon.;
, Any kind will do provided it is quality and comes in colors and patterns that are suitable for your needs. The thickness of the headband dictates how thick the ribbon can be. For example, you wouldn't want a huge ribbon attached to a tiny headband. Somewhere in the middle will do fine.
 This can be reinforced with glue, if needed. Use a clear-drying glue so that it doesn't show through it any leaks to the front.
, Continue doing this until you have covered the entire headband with ribbon. You're done!

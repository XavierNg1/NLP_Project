Divide the marketing costs by the number of customers you have each year to determine the cost of earning a new customer.;

Make a list of first purchase totals. Look through your records to gather data for this list.
Sum the figures on the first purchase list, and divide by the total number of purchases on the list.
 For example, a retail business that sells household necessities may wish to use the timeframe of 1 year. However, a business that has a more specialized market, such as appliance sales, may benefit by using a longer timeframe. The timeframe should represent a reasonable length of time that a typical customer could be expected to make more than 1 purchase.
 The average transaction amount puts your customer's buying potential into perspective.

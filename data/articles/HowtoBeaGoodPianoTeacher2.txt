 You do not need to be a virtuoso, but you cannot afford to cut corners either. Excellent sight-reading ability, knowledge of music theory, and good technique are all requirements for teaching piano., As a piano expert, you know how difficult it can be to learn an instrument. You will need large reserves of patience to draw on, especially for difficult or unmotivated students. Do not let frustrating moments trigger unnecessary negativity.
 Look for organizations on the local, state, or national level related to music teaching. Join these so you can share knowledge with your colleagues, and so you can pass on recital, audition, and competition opportunities to your students.
 If you already have teaching experience, you know that you need more than piano skills to be a good teacher. If you haven't already, consider earning a continuing education certificate or a similar qualification in music teaching.


Even if you are not able to enroll in a full course, spend time reviewing different lesson sets, reading books on pedagogy, and trading tips with other music teachers.

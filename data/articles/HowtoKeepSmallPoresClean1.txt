 You don’t want to transfer dirt or germs from your hands to your face, so be sure to wash your hands before you wash your face., Use your clean fingertips to gently lather up your face. Spend 30 seconds gently massaging the cleanser across your entire face with small, circular motions.Pick a cleanser that’s appropriate for your skin type, such as dry or oily, normal or sensitive. If most of your face is covered with small pores, it’s most likely that you should be using a cleanser designed for normal, dry, and/or sensitive skin. You shouldn’t be using products aimed at oily skin.
 Using hot water can dry out your small pores very quickly, so stick to luke warm water to keep your skin moist.For this reason, it’s often better to wash your face separately in the sink instead of doing so while you’re showering.
 Use a clean towel to gently pat away the moisture on your face. Avoid rubbing since that can actually clog pores by pushing soap film and dead skin into them.
 Washing too often or too vigorously can increase skin problems rather than prevent them. Stick to a gentle washing once or twice a day for the best results.Your skin naturally regulates its moisture. Cleansing your face more than once or twice a day can dry it out by stripping away its natural oils.
Scrubbing your face with a washcloth can irritate your pores by damaging their linings and/or pushing dead skin cells and other lingering debris into them.

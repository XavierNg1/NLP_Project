, Fold both of the sides into the middle crease from the first fold.
, At the same end, fold the corners into the middle line that is made by the two folds. This will be the collar. The exact angles are not critical.
 This fold can cross the circular pattern to form a "necklace"; see the front of the shirt in the next step. You can also adjust this fold to control the length of the finished shirt.
 You can get the best fit by tucking the end snugly under the collar and then sliding your finger to the bottom to form the crease.










Unfold both of the folds you just made. Then slightly unfold the two middle folds for the “sleeves.” Take one side at the bottom of the dollar where you just made the fold in step 5. Pinch out a corner shape (reverse the crease made in step 5 on the outer edge).
Fold the side back into place with the “sleeve” sticking out.
Make the other sleeve the same way.

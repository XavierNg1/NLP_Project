 Pour the water and oil into the saucepan. Whisk the gravy mix into the liquid until smooth.


If you have sausage, bacon, or beef drippings on hand, use those instead of vegetable oil.
A sausage-flavored country gravy mix or country gravy mix will lend the most traditional flavor, but you could also use a brown gravy mix or poultry gravy mix.
The amount of gravy mix called for in this recipe usually equals two packets.
 Bring the gravy mixture to a boil over medium heat.Stir or whisk the gravy frequently as it cooks.
 Reduce the heat to low as soon as the gravy begins to boil. Let it simmer for an additional minute, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning.


The gravy is ready once it thickens up. Adjust the cooking time as needed.
Note that the gravy will continue to thicken as it stands.
 Remove the gravy from the heat once thickened and ladle it generously over your shortcut biscuits.

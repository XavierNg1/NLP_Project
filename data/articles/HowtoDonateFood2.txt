 Many international organizations cannot take food for logistical or other reasons, so donating money, an old car, or other valuables is the easiest way to reach those farthest away from you., There are an overwhelming number of volunteer opportunities at the various institutions feeding the hungry. They can usually accommodate people of any age with any health concerns, and often the work is fun. Duties range from sorting fresh produce, to serving food at pantries, to answering phones, and many more., Since hunger is an issue that seems to persist relentlessly, there is always a need for more action.

Start a food drive of your own. This can be as easy as finding a recipient for your donations and getting the word out. Ask at your local donation center how you can make the biggest impact.Encourage your friends, family, and coworkers to join in when you are donating food, money, or time. Most institutions welcome groups of volunteers, and sometimes create healthy competition to make the work more fun and encourage repeat visits.

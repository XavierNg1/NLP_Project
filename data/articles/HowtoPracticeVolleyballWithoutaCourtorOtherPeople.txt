 Most of the exercises in the article involve a wall, so before you begin you should find a flat, high one.;
, Stand about ten feet from the wall. Toss the ball up with your left hand, then take a step with your left foot as you hit the ball with your right hand. Be sure to snap your wrist. Ideally, the ball will bounce right where the floor meets the wall. Then, catch the ball and repeat.
 Stand ten to fifteen feet from the wall. Toss the ball up so that it is higher than your head and just a little bit in front of you. Then set it to the wall. Your sets should be nice and high and they should go in a bit of an arc. You can either catch the ball and repeat, or you can just set the ball as it is bouncing back to you.
 This is very easy to do. You can do it while watching TV or just when you are feeling bored. All you need to do is lay down and set the ball straight up to yourself. Keep the sets going for as long as possible.
 All you have to do is get into passing position and pass the ball straight up to yourself. Try to keep the ball from dropping. You can even count the number of passes and try to beat your record.
 Measure 7'3" on the wall (higher or lower depending on what net height you usually play at) and mark the spot with a bit of masking tape. Stand 30 feet (9.1Â m) from the wall. Toss the ball up with your left hand and hit with your right hand as you are stepping with your left foot. You should be aiming to have the ball hit just above the tape. You can also practice your jump serving or underhand serving.

 Use a 5-gallon bucket to create your deep cleaning paste. Once the dry ingredients are in the bucket, mix the them together until they are well incorporated. , Slowly pour 30 oz. of distilled white vinegar into the bucket and combine it with the flour and salt. You can purchase distilled white vinegar from the grocery store.Vinegar is acidic and will work away any tarnish that's on your copper roof.
 Mix the solution together in the bucket with a paint mixing stick. The consistency of the paste should resemble toothpaste when it's ready. If the paste is too thick, add more vinegar to the bucket., Smear the paste onto your roof with a painter's brush. Make sure that you create even layers of the paste so that the roof cleans uniformly. Test a small portion of the roof with this method before you clean the entire roof to make sure that the paste doesn't have any adverse reaction to your roof., As the paste dries, the acid in the vinegar will pick up some of the copper's old patina and restore the roof to it's original shiny and pink color., Work in small sections to make the cleaning manageable. When cleaning, use large circular motions to remove the rest of the dried paste from the roof.
 Fill buckets up with distilled or boiled water that's been cooled. Pour the buckets over the loosened paste so that it drains off the side of the roof., Pick up all the remaining moisture from the roof with a clean cloth. Completely drying the roof will prevent water marks.

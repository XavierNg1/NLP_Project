Collect a snapdragon herb. Invest in clean snapdragon for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy snapdragons are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.






Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.






Collect 1 red spiders' egg. There's egg respawns located in the Chaos Tunnels, Varrock Sewers, and Edgeville Dungeon. If a player has a level of 10 summoning, they can get eggs using a spirit spider familiar.
 This will create a "Snapdragon Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose super restore potion.

 Once you have been seated by the host, the first and foremost thing you should do is pick up your napkin and without flicking it violently, unfold it and place it comfortably on your lap. This is its home until either you need to go to the restroom, or the meal has finished.;
, During the meal, it will be customary that you will need to wipe your mouth at certain promptings. To wipe your mouth, gently dab your mouth and allow the napkin to soak residue from the area. It is also vital that you use your napkin before sipping your wine or other beverage, so you donâ€™t leave any greasy mouth excess on the lip of the glass.
 At no stage during the meal should you use your napkin like a tissue as a means to blow your nose. Simply excuse yourself from the table if you need to, and visit the bathroom instead.
 If you do need to take a trip to the restroom during the meal, excuse yourself from the table and place your napkin neatly on the lap of your seat (not the arm or the top) until you return. Never place it back onto the table during the meal.

 The host should signal that you have reached the end of the meal by placing his or her napkin on the table beside the plate (never on it). It is fine for you to mimic this gesture and at the same time thank them for a wonderful meal if you can.

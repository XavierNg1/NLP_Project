 Texting during a show is fine, just don't make calls and make an issue for other people.
 Taking pictures with your cellphone is distracting; not to mention it blocks the view for the people behind you. Those who spend the entire show recording the gig on their cameras or phone are not living in the moment. Though you might want to capture an amazing shot, you'll most likely miss out on something better by being distracted with your camera or phone.

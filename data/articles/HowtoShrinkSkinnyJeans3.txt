 Lay your jeans out on a clean, flat surface, like a table. Make sure the area that you specifically want to shrink is facing upward.
 Combine together ¾ cup of warm or hot water with ¼ cup of fabric softener in a spray bottle.Close the top to the spray bottle, and shake the bottle to combine the mixture.
 Spray whatever area of your jeans you are specifically trying to shrink.For example, if the calf areas on your jeans are a little baggier than you want them to be, spray the calf areas with the spot-shrinking spray. If you want to shrink the thigh area of your jeans, spray down the thigh areas.


Be sure to spray both the front and back of the jeans if you want to shrink down an area that covers the span of your entire leg.
If you are trying to shrink the butt area for example, spray the back of the jeans, not the front.
 Change the dryer settings to have the heat setting the highest temperature it can go.Put your jeans in the drying machine and let them complete a full drying cycle. Remove the jeans from the dryer, and try them on.


If the jeans haven't shrunk down enough, repeat this process again.

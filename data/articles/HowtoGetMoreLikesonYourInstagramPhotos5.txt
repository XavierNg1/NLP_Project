 You can post the most fantastic photos in the world, but no one will like them in the middle of the night. Most activity with your photo will happen in the first few hours, so make those hours count. Here's when you should post your photos:


Post in the middle of the day, when people are likely to be bored at work and surfing the web. Don't post too early in the morning, or at five or six o'clock, because most people are too busy commuting to notice your photos.
Post your photos a little after dinner time. People browse the web when they're tired in the evening.
Post your photos during special occasions. Halloween, Christmas, and Valentine's Day are good times to post. Although some are too busy celebrating to notice your photos, they may actually be more likely to check them out.
 People may see them, but they may not want to admit that they have nothing better to do on a weekend than to look at instagram photos.
 Like a few photos to get your friends' attention.

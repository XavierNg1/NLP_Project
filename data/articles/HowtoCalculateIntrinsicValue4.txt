 Book value is defined as a company’s assets – liabilities. It can also be defined as a firm’s equity. If a company sold all of the assets and used the available cash to pay off all remaining liabilities, any cash left over would be considered equity (book value)., A company has book value as a starting point. The formula then adds new (expected) earnings that the company generates over and above a required rate of return.

 You’re adding “extra value” to the existing book value of the stock. 

 If the company can grow earnings at a faster rate than required, the firm will be more valuable.

 If the calculation’s intrinsic value is more than the current market value, the stock is undervalued.
 The formula for residual value has two components.  It is the current book value of the equity plus the present value of future residual income.For example, suppose a company will earn $1.00 per share forever, and the company also pays out all of this as dividends, $1.00 per share. The equity capital invested (book value) is $6.00 per share. Because the earnings and dividends will offset each other, the future book value of the stock will always stay at $6.00. The required rate of return on equity (or the percent cost of equity) is 10 percent.

 Calculate the annual residual income with the formula RIt=Et−rBt−1{\displaystyle RI_{t}=E_{t}-rB_{t-1}}, where RIt{\displaystyle RI_{t}} = residual income in future periods; r{\displaystyle r} =  required rate of return on equity, Et{\displaystyle E_{t}} = net income during period t{\displaystyle t}.

 If the net income is $1.00 per year, the book value is always $6.00 and the required return is 10 percent, the the annual residual income is $1.00−.10($6.00)=$1.00−$.60=$.40{\displaystyle \$1.00-.10(\$6.00)=\$1.00-\$.60=\$.40}

 The present value of future residual income is RIt/r=$.40/.10=$4.00{\displaystyle RI_{t}/r=\$.40/.10=\$4.00}

 The intrinsic value is the current book value plus the present value of future residual income.  The equation is $6.00+$4.00=$10.00{\displaystyle \$6.00+\$4.00=\$10.00}.

 The intrinsic value is $10.00

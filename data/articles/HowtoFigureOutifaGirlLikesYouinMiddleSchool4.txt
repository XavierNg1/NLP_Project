 If her friends do know about her crush on you when you walk by they may nudge her over to you or smile and nod their head toward you. They might stop talking to her if you come over near them or they might crowd round her, asking questions, after you have talked to her for a few minutes.
 You could also have a friend look at her to see how she acts when and if she stares. A sure sign that she likes you is if she twirls her hair or bites her lip.

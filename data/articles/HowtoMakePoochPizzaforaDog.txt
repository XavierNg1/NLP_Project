 Coat a deep dish pie/pizza pan with nonstick spray, such as Pam.;
, Using a whisk or electric beater, beat just until incorporated.
, Slowly pour in the wet ingredients. Stir until combined and ready to knead.
 Roll with a rolling pin or your hands until flat, smooth and round.
 Press down around the sides with your hands.
 Any of the the following will work well: Meats, cheeses (low fat), vegetables, pup treats, mashed sweet potato, gravy, beans, chili, or whatever else you think fits your pooch's "person(dog)ality".


Only use foods suitable for dogs to eat.
 Place the pizza in a preheated oven. Bake for thirty minutes or until the crust and/or cheese is browned.
 Cool completely before serving to pooch.
 Cut into slices and give to your dog. Time everything so that you end up having your own pizza with the dog having his pizza, and both of you will be happy.

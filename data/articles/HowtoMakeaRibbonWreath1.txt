 For a 12" wreath, you'll need about 60 yards (54.9Â m) of ribbon total. Basically, cut loads and loads of ribbon. Most ribbon fabrics will work, but the stiffer the better. At such a short length, most will stay erect and fluffy. As for widths, you'll find it's easiest to work with ribbons around 1" (2.5 cm) wide or less.









Experiment with a bunch of different colors. Think about using a zinger fabric -- a handful of more muted colors and one color that really pops.
Cut the ends at an angle. This is not only pretty, but keeps them from fraying as easily.;
, Take one color and tie a handful of pieces at different points around the wreath. After a dozen or so are tied, switch colors. This guarantees an even gradient to your wreath.









Tie 'em tight! You don't want them coming undone. And make sure you cover all parts of the frame -- there might be some small pieces that aren't in the main circle, but provide structure.
 Once you think you're getting done, scrunch the ribbons together. New spaces should form for you to tie in more. There should be some overlap -- this will make your wreath voluminous and full.
 Though your wreath is beautiful now (and ready to hang!) you may add a few touches if you'd like. Does it feel like it's missing anything?









A thin sheen of spray glitter can add a nice touch to ribbon that's otherwise solid-colored and uniform.
A giant bow on top may make your wreath seem more wreath-like and less like, well, a circle.

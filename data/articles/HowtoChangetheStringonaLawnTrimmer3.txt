 The length and width of line you need varies based on your trimmer.If you purchase the wrong width of line, the trimmer will not work correctly, so don’t waste your money by simply guessing at the hardware store. If you are not sure what size line your trimmer uses, check online—the manufacturer’s website often has instructions, and if not the customer service department should be able to help you.The length to which the lines should be cut also varies, from around 10’ to 25’.If you are not sure, err on the side of too long; you can always cut it shorter later. Both lines should be cut to the same length.
 If it has a gearbox, make sure it is cooled down. This will help prevent accidents.
 You should be able to see light through the head when you look through the eyelets., It should come through the eyelet on the other side of the trimmer head. Hold the ends together and pull to make both sides even. Twist the head clockwise until 5” or 6” of line are exposed.

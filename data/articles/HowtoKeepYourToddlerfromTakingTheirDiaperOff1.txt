 One easy way to keep a toddler from removing their diaper is to dress them in a way that makes the diaper harder to reach.


Overalls are great for this because they can have long pants or shorts which makes them usable any time during the year.
It is important to make sure that the straps over the shoulders are not so tight that they restrict movement, but are snug enough to make them difficult to get them off.;
, Another way to make the diaper inaccessible is to use a t-shirt or regular shirt that has a snap-crotch. For girls that are wearing a dress or skirt, tights can be worn over the diaper.
 If the diaper removal continues with any one of these types of clothing, they can be combined. For example, overalls and a snap-crotch shirt or tights with a snap-crotch shirt can be very confusing for a child to get past.

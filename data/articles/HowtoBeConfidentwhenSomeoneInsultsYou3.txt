 Most bullies are looking for attention. When they insult you and you get upset, you are doing exactly what they hope for. Strip your bully of their power and come of confident and secure by simply ignoring what the bully says.If a bully interrupts you to insult you while you are speaking, simply continue on without acknowledging what they said at all.
Be consistent. A bully may try to force a reaction out of you by speaking louder, repeating the insult, or being more verbally aggressive. Keep consistent and they may eventually leave the situation.
 Look at your bully whenever they insult you and simply walk away. Do this confidently, smiling and with your head held high, to show them that their insult has does not impact you in the slightest.


If they follow you, keep walking until they leave or you get where you need to go.
Do not go out of your way to avoid your bully. You are allowed to go where you need to for school, work, or your personal life. Walk past your bully confidently to let the know that they do not dominate your actions.
 If your bully moves from insults to threats of aggression or physical aggression, do not be afraid to let an authority figure know. Involve someone that can help you moderate, or else help protect you from those threats. Know that it is not a sign of weakness to seek help dealing with aggression.Consider talking to your teacher, your boss, or a counselor the moment a bully moves from insults to threats or physical aggression.
If a bully physically attacks you, report it to your office or campus security, or otherwise alert the police immediately. Call as soon as you are able and say, “I need immediate help. I am being physically attacked.”

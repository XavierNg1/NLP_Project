 You should stand approximately 8 inches (20 centimeters) away from your friend, just as you would stand if you were measuring your own PD in the mirror.Do not stand too close or too far away to ensure an accurate reading.
 Unlike measuring your own PD in the mirror (where you can't avoid looking at your own reflection), having a friend measure your PD requires you to look past that individual. Try having your friend crouch or sit in front of you while you stand so that she is outside your field of vision, and stare at something in the distance about 10 to 20 feet away., You'll need to keep your eyes perfectly still while your friend measures your PD. He should line the ruler up just as you would on yourself in the mirror. Your friend should align the zero millimeter mark with the center of one pupil and measure across where the center of your other pupil falls.

 Make sure the right sides are touching each other.;
, It doesn't need to be too perfect, and it looks cuter if it isn't. Just make sure it looks sort of like a person, at the very least, with arms and legs. The easiest shape is a rectangle with tiny stubby arms and legs.
, Leave a small opening somewhere, to turn it right side out. (1 inch/2.5 cm is good)

, With the back of a pencil or a similar object, push the stuffing in so that your ninja doesn't turn out floppy. Sew the opening closed using blind stitch.
 Skin tones (such as a light pink, white, yellowish, tan or brown shades) work best to make a more life-like ninja but you can use any colour for this.
 Use white thread so that the stitches will be less noticeable. You'll most likely want to match the face color of the ninja or use black thread.
 The possibilities are endless: use beads, buttons or embroider filled circles or even crosses if you'd rather have a knocked-out/fainted ninja. Use any colour you like or even different sized eyes for that home-made look.

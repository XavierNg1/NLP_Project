 Slide your dominant hand up to the "throat" of the head. When the ball sails into your pocket, pull your stick back a little bit so that it doesn't bounce out.
 Bring your stick back down to its 45-60 degree cradling angle, curl the stick, and cradle close to keep the ball in the pocket while you run down the field or look for a pass.


Practice catchingâ€”have someone throw the ball to you, or throw it to yourself against a pitch-back or brick wall.
 Slide your top hand down the shaft until it is directly above your bottom hand.
 Whip the stick forward in the direction that you want to throw the ball. Make sure to look in the direction that you plan to throw. Practice this motion while you are standing still, then while you are running. Keep working at it until you can fluidly transition from cradling the ball to passing or shooting.

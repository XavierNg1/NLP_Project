 Windows 7 Home Premium, Ultimate, and Enterprise come with DVD playback capability. You'll be able to play DVDs in Windows Media Player without issue. Home Basic and Starter do not come with DVD playback capability, and you will need to use a third-party player.


You can quickly see your version by pressing âŠž Win+Pause and checking the "Windows edition" section of the System window that appears.
 If you are using a version of Windows 7 that supports DVD playback, you should be able to load the DVD in Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center without issue.
 There are a few reasons a DVD may not be playing in Windows 7:If the DVD is from another region, there's a very good chance that it will not play. This is because regions are hard-coded into DVD drives to help fight piracy. To play DVDs from other regions, you'll need to flash your DVD player's firmware, which is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
If you have another DVD player program installed, it may be messing up Windows Media Player. Either use the other DVD player, or uninstall the program so that Windows Media Player works properly again.
Your drive may be physically failing. If this is the case, you'll need to install a replacement. See How to Install a DVD Drive for details.
 There's a good chance that using a program like VLC or MPC-HC will allow you to play DVDs when Windows Media Player isn't working. You can download VLC for free from videolan.org/vlc and MPC-HC for free from mpc-hc.org. Both are open-source and free of spyware.


Once you've installed the program, use it to load your DVD. These programs won't help if the DVD is from another region, but they should play most DVDs from your region without issue.

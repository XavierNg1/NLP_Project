 If you change your phone's calendar to a date previous to the end of your Spotify free trial, that time should be added onto your trial period.


For example, if you set the calendar back by a month, you should have 30 additional free days.
Setting back your phone's calendar may cause compatibility issues with your phone's operating system, app updates, and more.
 Since the Spotify app on your phone doesn't ask for number verification, you can feasibly add as many email accounts as you like to Spotify.


You can also do this on a computer if you wish.
 This is another way to provide alternative login information for Spotify. Since creating multiple Facebook accounts will quickly become cumbersome, consider using this method only for the desktop version of Spotify since it has a 30 day trial by default (rather than mobile's seven-day trial).

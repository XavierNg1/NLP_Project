 Before brushing long hair, you should check for major knots. If you use your brush through large knots, you can cause damage to the hair. Run your fingers downwards through your hair starting a few inches from the tips of the hair, and gradually work your way up the hair a few inches at a time. Work through the more manageable knots. If you encounter a knot you can’t run your fingers through, don’t force your fingers through the hair.;
, If you’ve encountered a large knot that you can’t get out using your fingers, use a product that will help ease out the knot. Apply the product to the knot according to the instructions on the label. For fine hair, use a spray.
For medium thickness hair, try a lotion.
For thick and coarse hair, or kinky hair, use a cream.
 After you have put the detangling product on the knot, use a wide toothed comb to comb at the knot. Be gentle, using small strokes to work at the knot. You should be able to get most of it out. If you don’t have a wide toothed comb, you can also use a paddle brush.
 By this time, most of the knot should be untangled. Run your fingers through the spot where the knot was to check if there is any more of it left. Your fingers are great tools because you can feel your hair in a way that you can’t when you are using a comb.

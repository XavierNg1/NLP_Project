 This will be enough to make about 10 popsicles. Keep in mind that the exact number depends on the size of your popsicle molds; each design will have a slightly different holding capacity.;
, Chamomile popsicles are great for teething children, but if you are making these for a child under 1 year of age, do not add the honey.
 You can also use ¼ cup and 1 tablespoon (6 grams) of fresh chamomile flowers instead., Leave about ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) of head space so that the tea can expand as it freezes.If you used loose chamomile flowers, pour the tea through a strainer into another saucepan first, and discard the flowers.
 Each popsicle mold will be a little different. Some of them come with a lid that already has sticks attach. Some come with a lid that has slots for popsicles sticks in it. If your mold has a slotted lid, pop the lid on first, then insert the popsicle sticks.
 Once again, the freezing time will vary, depending on the size of your popsicle molds.
 To de-mold the popsicles, hold the mold under running water for a few moments, then pull them out. You can store the popsicles in a plastic container between sheets of parchment paper. You can also place them into individual freezer bags. They will last 1 week.

 Wear bohemian style shirts or gothic t-shirts. Look for ruffled shirts or frock coats. Elegant waistcoats are very good for fancier occasions. Try to get ones with gothic buttons such as caskets or skulls.


If you cannot find clothes like this, you can get away with wearing certain T-shirts. Black or white band shirts with subtle logos are okay, as is anything with skulls or skeletons on it.
Romantic goth is very similar to ghost, so draw inspiration from romantic goth looks. Lace can be a wonderful addition to an outfit, as long as it's not too feminine.;
, Try to always wear dress pants, preferably black ones with pinstripes. If you can afford it, look for old Victorian dress pants.


If you want, you can also wear black jeans. Try to keep them relatively fitted without being skin tight. Try to avoid wearing sweats.
 You have some options with shoes, as long as you keep them black. Depending on the occasion, you can wear:


Dress shoes. These work best if they're vintage, or at least an older style.
Platform boots. If you're daring, add lots of chains to them.
Brothel creepers. These are not ideal, but they'll work if the rest of your look is very ghost.
 The best piercings are Monroe, nose studs, cheek piercings and eyebrow rings. If you don't like piercings that's okay.
 A very thin figure gives the illusion that you're barely there, which will enhance your ghost appearance.

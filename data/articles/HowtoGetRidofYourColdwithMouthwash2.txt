 Mix one cup of warm water with ½ to ¾ teaspoon of salt. Use warm water to better dissolve the salt and to soothe your throat.Test the water on the underside of your wrist to make sure it is not too hot to use for gargling.
 Gargle the solution in the back of your mouth, too. The saltwater helps to break up mucus in your throat and draws excess liquid from your throat tissue that may be causing inflammation., It’s okay if you accidentally swallow some of the saltwater, as it will give you no bad side effects.However, it’s better to spit it out, along with the mucus that it loosens, to rid your body of any of the bacteria or virus cells that it has accumulated.
 If you have a lot of mucus built up in your throat, gargle with the saltwater solution repeatedly until you’ve expelled as much of the mucus as possible.Otherwise, repeat at least 3 times a day until your cold symptoms subside.

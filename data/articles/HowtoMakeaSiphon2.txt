 To siphon your homebrewed beer, or other beverage, from one container to another you need: a rubber sink stopper anywhere from 1 and 1/8th inch to 1 and 1/4 inch in diameter, 2 feet (0.61Â m) of 1/4th inch tubing, three feet of 3/8th inch tubing, scissors, and a drill or a dremel.You need to have a drill bit that's smaller than 1/4th of an inch.
The rubber sink stopper needs to be the kind that's concave or hollow on the side that goes into the sink, not solid.
 Drill two holes in the sink stopper. The holes should be on either side of the small bump used to pull the sink stopper out of the sink. They should be as close to this bump and as vertically aligned with each other as possible.
 Stick the smaller tube through one of the holes. Place the sink stopper on the opening of the bottle you're siphoning into, and run the tube down to the bottom of the bottle.


If the tube doesn't fit in the hole, you can drill it a little bit bigger, but be careful. Don't make it any bigger than necessary. You want the tube to fit in very snugly, and airtight.
 Now you want to cut the tube you just placed in the bottle through the hole in the stopper. Cut it about two inches from where it comes out of the hole. Don't throw away the excess tubing.
 Run the left over tubing that you cut off into the other hole, about one inch in.
 Fit the larger tube over the smaller tube, the one that reaches the bottom of the bottle. Fit about 2 inches of the larger tube over the smaller one so it won't slip off.
 To siphon, place the sink stopper over the rim of the bottle with the brew in it. Place the other end of the long tube into the container you're siphoning into. Blow into the excess tube. This will start the siphoning.

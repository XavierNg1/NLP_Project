 Use a scissor to cut around the hem of the collar, creating a scooped boat neck.;
, Cut just inside the seams of each sleeve and save one of the sleeves to use later.
 Cut the back of the shirt so that it has a lower scoop than the front. Cut in two slightly curved lines that meet in the center to form an upside-down triangle.
, Make an additional cut in the hem so that you have one long strip of fabric rather than a ring.
 Laying the shirt face down, tie the back straps together with the piece of fabric you have cut. Do a double knot and then cut off the ends.
 Enjoy your new racerback.

 Roll the clay into a ball, and make sure it's moist.
 Punch your thumb into the middle of the clay ball, to about 1/4 inch (.6cm) from the bottom.
 With your thumb and forefinger, pinch the clay and press upwards. Work all around the inside, and with each pass, pinch from the bottom and move up, repeating until your vessel has the shape you want.
 Press from the inside, against the table you're working on, so that the bottom is smooth and flat.
 Decorate, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for curing and finishing your pot.

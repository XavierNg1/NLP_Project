 Button or very round white mushrooms are the best choice for this. The top mushroom needs to be the smallest (preferably a button mushroom), while the two descending mushrooms need to be larger than the head mushroom but either similar in size to each other, or one slightly larger than the other. All mushrooms should be rounded to help give the impression of a snowman. Large, flat mushrooms just won't work.;
, Remove any dirt or marks from the mushrooms, so that they can be eaten without concern. One washing method is to place in a colander and gently dip into a bowl of water, removing any dirt with your fingers.
 Remove the stems from the two larger mushrooms. The button mushroom that forms the head needs to keep his stem, as it forms a "hat" when arranged.
 On the small button mushroom, create the face as follows:


Turn the mushroom upside down. Select the "front" where the face will go. Choose an unblemished part with enough room to add all the facial features.
Poke two evenly spaced eye holes into the mushroom.
Stick two little raisins or similar food pieces inside each eye hole.
Carve a small hole in the middle of the face. Insert the tip of the carrot in for the nose.
Carve a small smile on the face (optional but cute).
 Arrange as follows:


Place the base mushroom onto the plate first, open part facing downward.
Balance the next slightly smaller or same-sized mushroom on top of the first mushroom, again open part facing downward.
Balance the head mushroom on top. Place the button mushroom on the middle mushroom, upside down with the stem sticking up to the ceiling.
 Make small holes in the sides of the middle mushroom where the arm sockets should be. Insert the skinny celery arms. Wiggle in a bit to ensure they stay in place.
 Place amid a plate of salad vegetables and give to the kids. Hopefully they'll be so impressed that the mushrooms all disappear without coaxing.

 Drag your cursor over the words you wish to comment on, or place your cursor at the end of a piece of text.
 Once you select the option for inserting comments for your version of Word, a balloon will appear in the right margin with identifying initials and a sequence number if you are in Print Layout or Web Layout view. If you are in normal or Outline view, a number will appear in the Reviewing pane.


In Word 2003, select Comment from the Insert menu.
In Word 2007 and 2010, select New Comment from the Comments group in the Review menu ribbon.
If your new comment falls between existing comments, the comments following it will be renumbered to reflect their new positions in the comment sequence.
 All text formatting features, such as bolding, italics, and underlining are available for comment text. You can also insert hyperlinks in comments.

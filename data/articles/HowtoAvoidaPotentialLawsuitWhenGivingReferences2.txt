 It’s quite possible that you have former employees whom you like personally, but who are nonetheless unemployable. While it might be tempting to omit problems that arose while they worked for you (especially if you think the problem is resolved), you shouldn’t.If an employee causes harm at another firm, and that firm finds you intentionally misrepresented that employee’s work history, they may take legal action against you.
Be especially leery of omitting details of an employee’s history of violence, theft, sexual harassment, or substance abuse. These behaviors can cause irreparable harm to the people in the new employer’s company. Indeed, the damage flowing from these behaviors would be the major reason that another firm would go through the expense of legal action.
 It might be tempting to try and give a good employee an extra advantage so they get the job they want and you believe they deserve, but you shouldn’t do it.Imagine that you receive a reference from a former employer claiming that a prospective hire is capable of handling a type of heavy machinery. In fact, your new employee has no experience with that particular piece of machinery. When the employee operates the machine, something goes wrong due to their inexperience. Another worker is seriously injured and your very expensive piece of machinery is ruined. Might you be inclined to take legal action against the party who assured you of that employee’s skills? Exactly.
 It all boils down to telling the truth.Truth is an absolute defense to defamation, and no employer can find that you made a misrepresentation if you stick to the truth. You have to remember that telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth is the most effective protection from liability.


Give possible employers objective facts, not subjective judgements. It is much more difficult to misrepresent an objective fact than a judgement.

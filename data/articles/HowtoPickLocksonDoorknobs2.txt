 A spring bolt lock is a spring loaded lock with an angled edge. It is one of the most common types of locks. The credit card method will not work with other types of locks. Spring bolt locks are usually found on doorknobs. If your door has a deadbolt, this method will not work., This method will almost surely bend your card and could risk breaking it. Rather than using your debit or ATM card, consider using an expired gift card, a rewards card from your grocery store, or a credit card you do not use often and that can be easily replaced., Slide the card in right where the latch for the lock is, next to the doorknob itself. The card will have to bend to make it in.
 You’re trying to get the card to catch the latch that is holding the door closed. This latch has a smooth side that is sloped at an angle. You’re goal is to slide the card up along that smooth side which will push the latch in., This puts pressure on the latch itself and forces it away from the doorway and back into the door.
 Start turning the knob to open the door as you push the card in. The door should open as the card slides past the latch, freeing the knob to turn.

 Many women report feeling higher levels of arousal after exercise that increases blood circulation in their pelvis and whole body. Try spinning, climbing, yoga, or acro-yoga. Go for a run, a bike ride, or a long hike together.This can be a great way to fire up the physical side of your relationship. When you exercise, you are engaging with your body in a conscious way – and when you exercise with your partner, you are engaging with her body as well. Compliment her on her physique, and impress her with your own athleticism.
 If she likes to read: take her on a date to an independent bookstore, or write her a romantic note, or spend an intimate day reading together. If she likes dessert: surprise her with chocolate, or set up a weekly Wednesday night dessert date. Show her that you are listening when she tells you what she likes.Pick something that you like to do, too! Find the intersections between your passions and hers.
 Your lady might not be into erotica – but even a steamy scene in a drama or rom-com can aid the process of getting her in the mood. A Northwestern University study suggests that women are often more aroused by erotica than men are., Wear a suit and tie; shave; and groom yourself well. Suggest that she wear your favorite tight shirt or dress. Then, take her out for a romantic evening together. Looking good can translate to feeling confident about yourself in bed.

 This way, you’ll pass the time doing something constructive and you don’t have to worry about the homework later.


Ask your teacher whether it is okay to do the homework in their class. This only works if you are bored in class because you are not challenged.
Sit in the middle or in the last row. Try to stay as far away from the front of the class as you can.
Keep the materials for your other class out of your teacher’s sight.;
, This will give you a sense of doing something important in an otherwise boring environment and will look as if you are taking notes.Vary your to-do lists. Write down what to search for online later, or birthday gift ideas,or your top ten favorite things of any category (i.e. Bands, video games, TV shows, etc). This can really pass the time, deciding which of your favorite things make the list and which are left out.

Write down the song lyrics to your top five songs, your favourite quotes from a Videogame, TV show, Book, etc. It'll get you thinking for a while and passes time.


Divide your list up into goals, projects and tasks- this will give you an overview of how to spend your time outside of class. Write an imaginary schedule: Stuff such as Monday: Mass destruction of school books, Tuesday: World domination. Wednesday: fitting of mute button on all siblings and parents. Thursday: World domination again. Friday: Sleeping.

Imagine how your teacher would react if they saw what you have written down.

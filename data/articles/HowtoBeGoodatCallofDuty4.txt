 When you first start and you only have default classes, make sure you use the MP5 rather than the others because for a first timer the M16 is hard to use, as it's burst fire (but when you get better it's a great gun). The M249 has high recoil and not enough power to make up for it.;
, When you do, make sure you use guns that you are comfortable and efficient with.


Pick good perks for you weapons. If you want to use a sniper, don't use C4s, Sleight of Hand, and Last Stand. Get a good combo.
 Get ready to shoot at the enemy that may be behind that corner.
 When you start to unlock weapon attachments, at first don't use the ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight) Scope or a silencer because red dot sights are easier and more precise and accurate. Later on, when you become more confident, you may try using them.
 They require innate amounts of skill and a quick trigger finger (you'll be pulling the trigger 20 times to empty a twenty shot clip, not once. Unless you cheat and have a mod).
 Up Close and Personal=Shotgun/Scorpion etc.; Medium Range and Mobility=Automatic Rifles; Long Range and Stability=Long Range Rifles

,, There are many different styles you can play and it helps to change it up so you don't get tired of one style.
 Don't just play Team Death match everyday. Play different games. You will get better if you play Headquarters, Search and Destroy, or sabotage.
 Prestige Mode is always an option for players who reach level 55. You can either stay at level 55 for the remainder of the time that you play and keep everything you have unlocked or you can go into this mode.


This mode does start you over at the beginning with everything at square one. But it gives you a new icon next to your tag and shows everyone the time you have put into the game.

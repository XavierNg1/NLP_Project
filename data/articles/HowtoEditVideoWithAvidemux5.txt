 In the top row of icons, click the Output button, which has an arrow pointing to the right edge of a screen. This will switch your display to the final version of your video, where you can review the filters and changes you have made.


Press the Play button in the bottom to watch the Output version of the video.
 You can select Save from the File menu or press the Save button in the top row of icons. Name the file and select where you want to save it to.
 Once you have clicked Save, the Avidemux will begin encoding the video according to the settings you defined earlier. Depending on how much encoding you are doing, this can take a significant amount of time. Once the encoding is finished, open the video in your preferred media player to test it out.

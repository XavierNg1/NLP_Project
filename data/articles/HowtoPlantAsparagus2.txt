 Early in the spring, sow single seeds in small pots meant for starting seedlings. Place the pots in full sunlight, moisten the soil daily, and keep them at a temperature of 77 °F (25 °C).
 Once they have sprouted, they do not need to be kept as warm. Lower the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C).
 When the seedlings are about a foot tall, and the weather outside has warmed to spring, it's time to plant them outside in a nursery bed. Dig a hole about 3 inches deep to allow them to continue growing.
 When the plants begin producing flowers, you'll be able to tell which are male and which are female. The male plants have large, long flowers, and the females have smaller flowers. Pull up the female plants and compost them.
 Let the male plants complete their growing cycle and overwinter in the nursery bed. The following spring, one year from germination, they have reached the same maturity as one-year crowns, and are ready to be transplanted to the permanent bed. Follow the steps below to continue growing the plants.


Be sure to dig the plants up while they are still dormant. Don't wait until they start their second growing season, or they will suffer from transplant shock.

 Interpreting a pulse, especially an apical pulse, is an art. However, there are many things that one can learn from an apical pulse. These are outlined in the following steps.
 If the pulse rate is very slow, it could be a normal adaptation for somebody who is in good shape. Some medicines also make the heart beat slower; this is especially true for elderly patients.One classic example of this is the class of drugs called beta-blockers (like metoprolol). These are commonly used to treat high blood pressure, and can slow down the heart rate.
 If the pulse rate is very fast, it could be normal for someone exercising. Children also have much higher pulse rates than adults do. It could also be a sign of:


High blood pressure, heart disease, or infection.
 The apical pulse may be displaced (meaning it is to the left or the right of where it should be). Obese individuals or pregnant women may have their apical pulse shifted to the left, as the heart gets displaced with extra contents in the abdomen.Heavy smokers with lung disease may have the apical pulse displaced to the right. This is because with lung disease, the diaphragm is pulled down to get as much air as possible to the lungs, and in this process the heart gets pulled down and to the right.
 The pulse may be irregular. This is commonly seen in older people. The heart sets in own rhythm, and over time the cells that control the rhythm may become tired or damaged. As a result, the pulse may become irregular.

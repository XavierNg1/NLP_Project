 Stroke is a very real risk with AF because your heart is more susceptible to sending clots to your brain. You and your family should recognize the warning signs of stroke. You may have some or all of the following signs when experiencing a stroke. Donâ€™t ignore these warning signs, even if they go away. Seek immediate medical care. Signs of stroke include:Numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
Trouble moving an arm or leg, especially on one side of the body
Slurred speech, confusion, or trouble understanding others
Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or coordination
Severe headache with no known cause

, Because AF can increase your chances of having a heart attack, it is also important to know what symptoms to look for. If you experience some or all of the following symptoms, go to the hospital immediately:Chest discomfort, often in the center of the chest, that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back and manifests as uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain
Discomfort or pain in other areas of the upper body, such as one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach
Excessive sweating
Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort
Cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness

, While AF can be managed, it is always important to be prepared for a worst case scenario. There are many things you can do that will prepare you for any life-threatening situation that calls for immediate medical attention. Ways that you can prepare in case your experience a medical emergency are:Keeping a list of emergency phone numbers with you at all times
Wearing a medical bracelet indicating pertinent conditions you may have, including any allergies and devices such as a pacemaker
Planning in advance the route to the nearest hospital and making sure your family knows the route
Asking family members to take a basic life support course

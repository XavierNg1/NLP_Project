 Watch carefully for the initial boot screen to display and tap the necessary key to over-ride the boot process. Depending on your computer model it will be either "Delete," or "F2." Press it a few times before your Operating System (Windows, etc.) starts up. If you see the operating system display, you've missed the opportunity. You will have to restart your computer again. If you do it right, the BIOS setup screen appears.;
,, Usually the first BIOS screen to appear is the primary, or basic screen.
 Press the "Enter" key to detect and configure the primary hard disk, making it the Master Drive.
 Your system will repeat the same process for the second drive, but making this one the Slave Drive.
 Exit the setup utility. The computer will restart. If not, manually restart it. Allow the computer to boot normally and you should see all your drives (C, D, E, Fâ€¦).

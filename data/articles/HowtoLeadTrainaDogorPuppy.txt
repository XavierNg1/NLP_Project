 If the dog sniffs it or shows any curiosity, provide a treat. You want the collar to be a positive thing. Do this about five times randomly throughout the day.;
, If s/he whines, cries or tries to bite the collar you've progressed too fast. Go back and reward any interest. Try keeping the collar on him/her for most of the day.
 Let the puppy or dog walk you, though, whether it be sniffing around or going in and out of trees. This teaches the dog that the collar and lead are not burdens, but times to explore. Do this every time you explore the garden

, Don't make them too big or they'll take too long to chew and after a few treats, your dog will become full and lose interest. Plus the smaller size encourages sniffing. Lead your dog along the path of treats. You should have control.
 If your dog doesn't pull or tug really hard, provide a reward. If your dog made a little pull (as in "Oh, smells like a squirrel was here.," that's just curiosity. Still, don't let it become too forceful or you'll have a pulling pup.
 Gradually move more steps until you don't use treats.
 Make sure your dog's ready because you don't want any incidents.

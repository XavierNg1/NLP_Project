 Adblock Plus is a browser add-on that once filtered Suggested Posts and commits to finding a way to do it again in the future. For now, you can use it to remove the ads that appear on the right side of the Facebook website.Using Adblock Plus with Facebook Ad Highlighter will make it easy to scroll past Suggested Posts without hassle.
The mobile Adblock Plus does not block Suggested Posts from Facebook.
 The Adblock site will automatically detect your web browser and display a green button that says “Install for .” Click this button to begin the installation.
 Depending on your browser, you’ll see a message asking you to click “Add,” Install,” or “Install Now.”

, Now that you’ve installed Adblock Plus, you’ll notice that the right side of the screen is far less cluttered with advertisements. While Suggested Posts remain visible, you can fade them (and mark them with the text “THIS IS AN AD”) with Facebook Ad Highlighter. You can also hide ads from particular pages that advertise in your feed.

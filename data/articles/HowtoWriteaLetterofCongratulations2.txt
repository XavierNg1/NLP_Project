 Although you will be keeping an otherwise formal tone throughout your letter, it is nice to address the person with their first name to open the letter casually.


Using a first name is also fine in a professional setting, and the recipient will regard it as more personal and friendly.
For example, start the letter with: "Dear <Recipient’s First Name>"

, You should immediately write the word congratulations to tell the receiver that you are congratulating them on their accomplishments.


Putting this particular word up front will make the person feel good and accept your wishes with their whole heart.
For example, you may write: "I am quite pleased to hear about your promotion. Many congratulations for being awarded the position of <position title>."
When you are speaking for more than one person and want to include them in the letter you can simply state, “my wife/ partner joins me in congratulating you on…”

, Since you have a solid reason to congratulate your business associate, it is necessary to mention that reason in your letter.


Not stating the reason will make the person wonder whether or not your congratulations is purely generic.
You should always state your reason for congratulations early on in your letter.
This will illustrate what actually motivated you to write the letter.
 When writing a letter of congratulations to someone, you should make sure to express your confidence in their abilities.


You should mention that you always notice the person's zeal and potential, or the efforts the person had been putting into work-related endeavors.
Referring to the person's good qualities in your letter will make the recipient feel great about their abilities and give them the confidence to pursue their future endeavors.
For example, you may write: "Your willingness to go the extra mile has always been quite well known" OR "This promotion definitely shows that your hard work, determination, and sheer dedication has been noticed and regarded in the best possible way."

, Make sure to end your congratulatory note very politely to leave a good impression.


Ending your note politely will leave a good taste in the recipient's mouth, and create lingering feelings of goodwill towards you.
The ending should contain a wish for many more achievements in their future.
You can also re-reference their current accomplishment and restate how the company is benefitting from their work.
For example, you may end with something like: "I wish you success in all your future endeavors. Best Regards, <Your name>"

, The last step, but one of the most important, is to proofread your letter.


Your letter should be free of all grammatical errors and typos.
The sentence structure should also flow smoothly.
Putting in the extra effort to proofread can take your letter of congratulations to the next level.

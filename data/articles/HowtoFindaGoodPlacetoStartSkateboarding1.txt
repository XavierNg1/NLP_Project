 These days, many larger cities are building free skate parks by repurposing industrial areas. For example, the city of Arlington, Texas is in the process of building fifteen skating spots around the city.These skate parks are approved spots for skaters to practice tricks and learn to skate. Talk to a local government representative or do an internet search to find a skate park.


If you skate in these spots, you don’t have to worry about approaching cars or getting in trouble for trespassing.
City-approved skate spots are great places to meet other skaters who can help you learn to skate.;
, Most high schools have parking lots, long handrails, ramps, stairs, and large concrete areas outside of the school building. These features are perfect for a budding skateboarder. If possible, ask for permission to skateboard in advance.


If a security guard asks you to leave, do so. If you get hurt on someone’s property they may be legally liable. Skate on Saturdays and Sundays to avoid crowds.
 These spots are great for beginners who just need a large flat place to practice. Make sure the parking lot has smooth asphalt and avoid large pebbles while you skate.


Always be careful when skating in parking lots, even empty ones. Keep an eye out for cars and pedestrians.
Bring a buddy when skateboarding in unfamiliar areas.
 Choose a park with large paved bike trails. Skaters usually have to follow the same rules as bikes. Stay to the right when skating, pass on the left only when there aren’t any oncoming bikers or pedestrians, and alert the person in front of you if you’re passing.


Double check with your local government to make sure you’re allowed to skate here. This information can be found online or by calling your local police department.

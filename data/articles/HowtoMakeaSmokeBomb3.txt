 Smoke bombs are composed of a simple concoction of potassium nitrate and sugar. By grinding these ingredients and mixing them together, you can create a smoke bomb just as good as store-bought products. Here's what you'll need:

Get potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter.






Buy some sugar.






Get some baking soda.






Obtain a cardboard tube. A tube the size of a toilet paper roll will work fine. Cut some discs out of cardboard. Tape one disc to one end of the tube. Save the second disc for after the tube is filled with the powder you will make.






Get a small length of fuse to insert in the smoke bomb.
 Wear gloves, goggles, and a filter mask to keep yourself safe as you conduct your experiment.
 Using a coffee grinder (that you will never again use for coffee) or a mortar and pestle, grind the ingredients separately. Grind the saltpeter until it is a very fine powder, then grind the sugar. Because these materials are flammable, you have to be very careful to avoid sparks while grinding.
 The ratio you need is three parts saltpeter and two parts sugar. Weigh them on a kitchen scale, then place them in a bowl and mix them together.
, To make it easier to pour, you can use a funnel, or place the powder in a small plastic bag and cut off one corner, then pour.
 Make sure it's securely in place.
 Cut a small hole in the lid of the tube, then push the fuse inside. The fuse should be long enough to give you time to leave the vicinity once you light it.
 Place it in an outdoor area clear of buildings, trees, people and pets. You should never light a smoke bomb indoors.
 Move away once the fuse is lit, and enjoy your smoke bomb.

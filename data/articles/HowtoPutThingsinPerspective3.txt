 Life is in constant motion, and, like the seasons, things change. Studies have shown that those who can adapt and accept changes in life, live a happier life (and sometimes longer) life.A great way to do this is to look at old pictures. You can see how you’ve changed physically to put things in perspective.
You can take pictures of yourself in the moment to create a baseline of what you want to change. This “before” picture can be a great motivator and really help to focus on the now.
 You are one of more than 7 billion people on this earth.This can be a comforting thought if you think you may be the only person who struggles with a specific problem.


You are one person in this universe. You will not be able to conquer all of the world’s problems on your own.
Another great way to gain perspective is to watch documentaries to learn about the world around you. Your local library may have some great ones to get you started. Learning about other cultures or history can definitely put your life in perspective.



One way to do this is tap into your own empathy. Think about how many children go without food or do not have families. Use this empathy for good and consider giving to therapy.
 As with the world’s population, it is sometimes comforting (although sometimes awing and scary) to think about what a vast universe we live in.


For example, the sun, which is so small in the sky, is 93 million miles away.When we consider this, it is easy to see how small we really are and how small our problems can be.
To do this, stargaze. The sky can look endless.

 On top of this sketch a wide cylinder and another, flatter oval. Sketch in guidelines. This will be the basis of Pooh's head.;
, Put curved lines high above them for the brows, ovals for the ears, an oval for his nose, and a happy smile.
 Add a long oval for each arm. Draw a circle for the hands, one on the end of each oval.
 Add a half-oval for each foot. Counterintuitive though it seems, Pooh's legs are shorter and chubbier than his arms, so make sure to take that detail into account.
 It should be riding up pretty high due to his large tummy, with loose sleeves and a collar.
 The only colors you have to use are yellow, red, and black. Erase any excess lines left on Pooh Bear and you are done!

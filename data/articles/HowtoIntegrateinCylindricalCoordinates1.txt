 Coordinate conversions exist from Cartesian to cylindrical and from spherical to cylindrical. Below is a list of conversions from Cartesian to cylindrical. Above is a diagram with point P{\displaystyle P} described in cylindrical coordinates.


x=rcos⁡θy=rsin⁡θz=zr2=x2+y2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=r\cos \theta \\y&=r\sin \theta \\z&=z\\r^{2}&=x^{2}+y^{2}\end{aligned}}}


, We are dealing with volume integrals in three dimensions, so we will use a volume differential dV{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }V} and integrate over a volume V.{\displaystyle V.}


∫VdV{\displaystyle \int _{V}{\mathrm {d} }V}

Most of the time, you will have an expression in the integrand. If so, make sure that it is in cylindrical coordinates.
 


dV=rdrdθdz{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }V=r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta {\mathrm {d} }z}

Those familiar with polar coordinates will understand that the area element dA=rdrdθ.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }A=r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta .} This extra r stems from the fact that the side of the differential polar rectangle facing the angle has a side length of rdθ{\displaystyle r{\mathrm {d} }\theta } to scale to units of distance.
 Choose a coordinate system that allows for the easiest integration. 

As with polar coordinates, the range of θ{\displaystyle \theta } is ,{\displaystyle ,} unless there are applications to integrating over more than the whole object. 


, Once everything is set up in cylindrical coordinates, simply integrate using any means possible and evaluate.

To save space in this article (and in your calculations) for the moment of inertia of a cone, it is useful to recognize the integral ∫02πsin2⁡θdθ=π.{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }\sin ^{2}\theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta =\pi .}

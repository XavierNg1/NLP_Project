 Place a cinnamon stick in a mug or teacup. Next, pour 1 cup (237 ml) of boiling water over the stick so that it’s fully submerged.Using filtered water usually results in better tasting tea.
 When the cinnamon stick and water are combined in the mug, cover it with a saucer. Allow the mixture to steep for 10 minutes so the cinnamon stick starts to release its flavor.If you don’t have a saucer to cover your mug, you can use a piece of foil.
 When the cinnamon stick has finished steeping in the water, add 1 bag of black tea. Allow the tea bag to steep in the mug with the cinnamon for another two to three minutes.You can use regular or decaffeinated black tea, depending on your preference.
If you aren’t a fan of black tea, you can substitute rooibos tea or honeybush tea.
 After the tea bag has steeped for a few minutes, remove it and the cinnamon stick from the mug. Add sugar, stevia, or the sweetener of your choice if desired, and drink immediately.If the tea has gotten cold while you waited for it to steep, reheat it in the microwave. Heat it on high in 10 second intervals until it reaches the desired temperature.

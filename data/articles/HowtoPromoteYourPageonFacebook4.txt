 Visit the Facebook website on a new web browser tab or window. Enter your email address and password at the top right corner of the page to log into your Facebook account. You will be directed to your personal account’s News Feed page.
 All the Pages you manage are listed on the left side of the home page. Take your mouse and click the Page name to go to its Timeline.
 On the top right of the Page is the “Settings” tab. Click on that tab to go to the settings menu of the Page.
 On settings page, click “Page info” tab on the left side. This will return a list describing your Page.
 Scroll the list of options, and click Facebook web address to go to the screen to customize your address/URL. The customization screen has two boxes. The first one contains the Page name and the second one has the address of the Page.
 Go to the second box that contains the Page address. Change the name to your preferred name. Make sure the name you type can be remembered easily by your followers. The address can be something like “Facebook.com/companyname.”


Make sure that it’s a name that you would like to use, as you can only change it once in the future.
When you’re done, click “Save” button on the box.
 You can do this by posting the change as a status. Just go to the status box at the top of the Page’s Timeline, and let your followers know that they can now easily find your page by entering the name you set.

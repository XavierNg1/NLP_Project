 Start with all of your hair combed back, without a part.
 Use a fine-toothed comb to separate a 3-inch section of hair from your forehead to the crown of your head, almost like a mohawk. Lift it above your head to keep it separated.
 One section should be in the front, one in the middle, and one at the crown of your head.
 Take each of the 3 sections individually and backcomb them by running a fine-toothed comb from the tips to the roots. Tease each section gently, then drop them down toward your face to hold them out of the way for the time being.
 Hold it as if you are making a ponytail, then twist it until you've reached 3







, Now it's starting to look like a French twist! Twist it against your head, then use pins to hold the twist in place.
 Make a little bun and pin it in place just below the first section of teased hair.
 Pull the front sections of hair that you teased back to the twist, and wrap the ends around the twist. Tuck them into the twist where it meets your head, and use pins to hold them in place.
 Your hair should now look like a classic French twist, with a slight lift on top where the hair is teased.
 Use a comb to lightly smooth the top and sides of your hair. Spray your hair with strong-hold hairspray to keep it in place.

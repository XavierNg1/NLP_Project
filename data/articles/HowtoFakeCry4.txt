 If you're extremely sensitive to peppers, a seedless jalapeno might be strong enough to cause your eyes to start watering. If you're a fire eater, you'll need a hot one.


Use gloves when you handle hot peppers. It's well known that touching a hot pepper and then touching your eye will cause irritation and tearing. This means you could skip the next step and simply touch the inside of a pepper and put your finger in your eye, but the pain probably isn't worth it.
If you don't have fresh peppers on hand, habanero or another hot sauce might do the trick.
Chopping a white onion is another good substitute for hot peppers. Just make sure it's white, since this type of onion emits the chemicals that cause people to cry.
 Remember that a little goes a long way, especially when it comes to habaneros. Eat just a little chunk of the pepper, letting it roll over your tongue and against the roof of your mouth before swallowing. If you don't feel your face turning hot, eat some more.


As always, furrow your brow and frown to make your fake crying act seem believable. In this case you should keep your mouth closed so the person for whom you're performing doesn't see the pepper chunks inside.
Try not to make your chewing motions obvious. If necessary, you may need to chew the pepper before you face the person watching you "cry."

, If your face stops producing sweat and tears before you're ready for the scene to end, find a way to eat another chunk of pepper. You might cover your mouth with a handkerchief while you bring the piece to your mouth, or excuse yourself to go to the bathroom and eat it there before returning with fresh tears.

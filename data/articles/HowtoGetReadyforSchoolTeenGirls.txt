, Getting up is always hard in the first place. People say you should get a decent beauty sleep, but obviously as you become a teenager there is always that show/book you want to watch/read. Set a good and upbeat alarm (if you use one) at a time you think suitable. Don't press snooze! You'll get into the habit and you waste time. You can also ask your mum or someone to wake you up at first if waking upÂ with an alarm is hard.
 Moisturize.
 Whether you have a shower or not, try not to fuss with different lotions and sprays. Just use a nice smelling body wash and (if you want) shampoo.
 Try customizing your uniform by adding a cool watch, or if you're allowed jewelry, some bangles or a necklace.
, Try something simple and cute, such as a high ponytail and cute clips. Or you can wrap a ribbon around a bun or pigtails.
 Discreet but good make-up is concealer and foundation (if needed) and possibly brown mascara.

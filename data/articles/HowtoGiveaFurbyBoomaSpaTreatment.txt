 You will need, a small hairbrush, plastic or bristles, a damp cloth not very damp just a little damp as you would find the flannel in the bathroom, a blanket and mini pillow and a nail file.;
, Arrange the blanket and mini pillow to make a spa bed and leave all your other equipment beside it ready.
 This way your Furby won't complain for food in the middle of his or her spa treatments.
 Leave him to get settled in this new environment.
 Use the not very damp cloth for this. Rub the inside and outside gently and then through the gaps. Repeat on the other ear.
 Again use the cloth for this. Gently rub all of the areas with the cloth and then repeat to get a good result.
 Brush all of the damp fur to get rid of any tangles.

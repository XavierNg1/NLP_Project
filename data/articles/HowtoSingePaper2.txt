 Any piece of paper that’s shiny or very bright white probably has a coating on it. This makes it more aesthetically pleasing for printing purposes, but makes it more difficult to achieve a natural, singed look. Choose a piece of paper that’s designed for painting, watercolors, or charcoal drawing and has fibers that you can clearly see., Either can be used to the same effect, but don’t use anything more powerful, such as a butane torch. This will simply be too powerful a tool to use on paper., Slide the edge of the paper back and forth through the flame a few times until it’s glowing, but don’t let it actually catch fire., Holding the paper about 1 inch (5 cm) above the flame, allow the heat from the candle to rise and burn a hole in your paper. Pull the paper up as soon as you see a hole starting to form, since it can spread quickly.Move the paper slightly closer if you’re not seeing any burning.
 If you blow on it, be sure you’re not blowing embers toward anything flammable. It’s ok to sprinkle some water on it and then lay it flat to dry, since the water spots will contribute to an aged appearance.

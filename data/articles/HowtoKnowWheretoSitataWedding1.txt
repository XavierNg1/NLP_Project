Seat the parents of the bride on the left side, in the front pew of the church, if the bride is given away, or at Catholic weddings. The groom's family will then sit on the right side, also near the aisle. This may be reversed for cases in which the couple enters the church down the aisle together (which is customary in many Protestant denominational churches). In this case, the bride will probably walk on the right side and the groom on the left.;
, This will include grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, and cousins.



Seating for friends is not designated, the only requirement being that they sit on the side of if they are friends of either the bride or groom. When they are friends of both the groom and bride they can sit on either side.

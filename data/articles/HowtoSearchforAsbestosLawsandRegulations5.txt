 In addition to statutes and regulations, the third source of law in the U.S. comes through written decisions by judges. The most familiar are opinions from the U.S. Supreme Court, although there are also federal Courts of Appeal (also called Circuit Courts), federal District Courts, and state courts. Judges make rulings based on the laws and regulations that are in place at the time, and their written decisions apply as “law” to all or a portion of the country. Decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court apply to the entire country. Decisions by the New Jersey Supreme Court, for example, only apply as law within the state of New Jersey. Therefore, it is important to understand which court has issued the decision you are reading.
 It can be difficult to establish a widely covering law from a court opinion in many of the asbestos cases, because they are limited to specific sets of facts. There has been a lot of asbestos related litigation going on recently, in the U.S. and in other countries. However, most of those cases are for personal injuries, which depend on the particular facts for the particular plaintiff. It is difficult to determine a widely held law based on one person’s case. If you find court rulings related to asbestos, try to rely on similarities between that case and yours, but expect an opponent to point out differences., Since decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court are considered the “law of the land” across the country, you will want to find any decisions there first. You can search for U.S. Supreme Court decisions at the Court’s official website at http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/opinions.aspx.
 You can search for decisions from other federal courts or state courts using Google Scholar. This search engine focuses your search on court documents, so you don’t have to weed through articles or advertisements about asbestos.

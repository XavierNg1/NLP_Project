 Ear mites trigger the production of a thick, brown-black type of ear wax. You might see inside your dog's ears a substance that looks like coffee grounds.Ear mite infections are commonly associated with an excessive amount of this brown-black wax produced by the ear canal.
Your dog may also have crusting on the neck, rump, and tail if the mites have spread to other parts of the body.
 The ear mites cause considerable irritation, so your dog may scratch at the ears with a paw. Because of this scratching, your dog's ears may be red, sensitive, or even have open sores.Your dog may also rub the ears, or scoot the ears along the ground.
Look for rashes or skin irritation around the skin of the ears, too.Your dog may also have sensitive or tender ears, which means she might whine as she scratches her ears or if you touch them.The scratching and rubbing can lead to inflammation and sore skin. The constant rubbing can introduce a secondary bacterial infection with a foul smell., Your dog may also repeatedly shake her head from side to side. She may also lean her head over to one side. Her ear may droop just a bit more than usual.She may act like she is trying to get something out of her ears.
 The ear may also smell unpleasant due to the secondary infections that commonly accompany ear mites. If your dog is favoring the ear, rubbing it, or scratching it, this can lead to a foul smell because of an infection.Lift your dog's ears and sniff. If it smells badly, there is something wrong and she should be taken to the vet immediately.

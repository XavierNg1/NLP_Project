 Instead of putting water to freeze, use washable tempura liquid paint to fill the ice cube tray holes. Squirt paints of different colors into the holes of an ice tray.;
, Freeze for about thirty minutes, just to begin to harden the cubes.
 Let the cubes freeze for three hours (or until solid) or overnight.
 Take them outside for your activity.


It should only take about ten minutes or less for the cubes to warm up. Warming too long can cause the cubes to melt.
 Spread a big piece of paper or a poster outside on the sidewalk. Use the ice cubes as paintbrushes, spreading and moving the cubes across the page. Children love to move the cold ice and see how the paint goes on the paper!

, When everyone is done ice painting, pick up the remaining ice cubes and place them in the bucket. The leftovers can be frozen again.
 You don't want to forget this fun activity! Place finished artwork in a picture frame, stick it on the fridge, or tape it on a wall.

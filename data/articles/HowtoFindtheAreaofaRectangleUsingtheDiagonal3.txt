 If the length of the diagonal is 7.2 units, then its slope depends upon a and b of a^2 + b^2 = (7.2)^2 = 51.84, making a and b about 5 and 5.18 if the rectangle is close to a square; therefore, slope m = (y2-y1) / (x2-x1) = (5.18-0)/(5-0) = 5.18/5 = 1.036; or just a shade greater than 1. If the rectangular form is given and it is not close to a square, proportion it with a ruler, and make adjustments accordingly.
Draw the surrounding rectangle with very straight lines;
Let 5^2 + 5.18^2 = 51.8324 whereas 7.2^2 = 51.84 -- you are probably close enough - check the problem requirements for tolerance/accuracy/exactitude required.
You're done! The area of the rectangle is 5 * 5.18 = 25.9

 For much of the film, Burton’s Alice wears a blue dress that falls close to ankle-length. In some scenes her blue dress is loosely draped and worn off the shoulder. However, in the court scene she wears a strapless red tea-length dress with white and black sheer overlay.


Adults may own a suitable red cocktail dress.
The loosely draped version of the blue dress would be difficult to buy or construct, but could be appropriate as an informal toga-style costume.
Vintage stores and thrift shops can be good places to find affordable longer dresses that can be modified to look like Alice's film costume.
 In the film, Alice does not wear the iconic white pinafore. However, the overlay on the red dress is something like an apron worn backwards; open at the front, covering the back.


You can make your own reverse pinafore by tying a length of black and white fabric across the back of a red dress, and draping part over one shoulder.
 In the film, Alice wears white-tinted stockings but they are sheer and not terribly distinctive. In warm weather, going without stockings would likely be as appropriate as wearing nylons.
 Burton’s Alice wears white lace-up boots with a kitten heel and a black toe. These might be quite difficult to find.


Black and white saddle shoes might provide a convincing alternative.
Some websites that feature vintage imitation clothing, such as Modcloth, stock high heels in black and white that look similar.
Purchasing a pair of white boots from a thrift store and painting them with black accents is an affordable alternative.
 Alice’s hair is blonde and parted down the center. It falls in loose waves around her shoulders without a headband or other styling.


If your hair is naturally straight, use a curling iron or hot rollers to achieve more body.
If your hair is naturally a color or texture that makes imitating the film look impossible, consider wearing a wig to achieve the full effect.

 Wrinkles can be caused simply by a lot of smiling/laughing because it stretches the face. Haven't you noticed that those calm, icy people have very few wrinkles;
, This will also help guard against freckles or spots.
 Instead of purchasing some "miracle cream" that claims to remove wrinkles in 24 hours, invest in a Vitamin E cream. Vitamin E is vital to the maintenance of healthy skin.
 Wrinkles are caused by the sagging of skin over time. Tightening up the skin will remove them, or make them less noticeable.
 These are very good for your skin.

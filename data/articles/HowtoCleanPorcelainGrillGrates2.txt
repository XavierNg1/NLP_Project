 If you do not have access to a grill brush, you can use household products like tin foil to clean the grates. Ball up aluminum foil, making a ball large enough to fit over your fingers. Then, run the aluminum foil over the grates to remove any debris and clean them.Clean the grates with tin foil when they are cool or not too hot to prevent burning your fingers. Make sure there is enough tin foil on your fingers to create a buffer between your fingers and the grates.
 If your porcelain grill grates are really dirty, you can try applying a baking soda solution to them. Make a paste by combining ½ cup baking soda in ¼ cup warm water. Apply the paste to the grill grates. Let it sit for 20 minutes and then clean it off with a soft bristle grill brush.Make sure you get all of the paste off before you cook anything on the grill.
 If the grime and grease on the grates do not come off with just a brush, you can try dipping the grill brush in water and using it to clean the grates. A wet grill brush can help to remove debris on the grates effectively.Let the grill grates heat up. Then, dip the grill brush in a bucket of water to get it wet. Run the wet grill brush over the grates in a diagonal motion, starting from the bottom of the grate and going upward.
Dip the grill brush back in the bucket of water to rinse it and continue to clean any other areas on the grates with the wet brush.

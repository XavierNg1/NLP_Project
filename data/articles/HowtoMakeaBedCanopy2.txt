 You'll need a hanging fruit basket. This should be the type that has only one basket, and four hanging chains that meet up at the center hook. It should also be made of sturdy metal, and not plastic or very thin metal. You'll also need mounting hardware for the basket, wire cutters, and four curtain panels.
 Using metal cutters, cut a 1/4"-1/2" gap at the center of the rim between each support chain.
 Slide the curtains on, one half of a panel onto one side of the cut gap, the other half on the other side.
 Following the manufacturer's instructions for the mounting hook you got, attach it to the ceiling above the bed. It should be mounted in a ceiling stud, which may require a stud finder to locate.
 Hang the basket to the hook you mounted.
 You can get LED icicle lights (preferably on a battery pack) and put them in the basket to create a chandelier effect. This is not required however. Just enjoy your new bed canopy.

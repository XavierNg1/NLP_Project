 Note that while this playdough is safe to eat, it probably would not be a good idea to gobble it up all at once. It is a great choice for young children who like to put things into their mouths, however.
 This is enough for one batch of edible playdough. If you'd like to make more colors, you will need to make another batch.


How much food coloring you add is up to you. The more you add, the darker your playdough will be.
 This will take about 30 seconds, but it may take less depending on the strength of your microwave., Keep stirring until the ingredients thicken and you can't stir anymore.If you need to, use a potholder to handle the bowl.
 If the dough is too dry, add a little bit more coconut oil. If the dough is too wet, add some more cornstarch.


Be careful; the ingredients may still be hot.
 You can even eat some of it too. Just don't eat too much, or you'll get a tummy ache! When you are done playing with it, store it in an airtight container. If it starts to smell funny, throw it out; it is expired and not safe to eat anymore.

 Aiming for one cheat meal per week can help you control your cravings and not feel like you are missing out on life’s pleasures. On a cheat day, make sure you eat healthy foods for the rest of your meals and snacks. For example, balance a cheat dinner with a healthy lunch and breakfast.You may be tempted to skip other meals in anticipation of eating more calories during your cheat meal, but it's important you stick to your regular, healthy eating habits. If you're having a cheat meal for dinner, don't skip breakfast or lunch. This can disrupt your metabolism and also cause you to overeat during the meal because you're starving.;
, It is important to have a clear plan about exactly when you will have a cheat meal. This helps you stay in control of your overall dieting strategy. You might, for example, decide to have a cheat meal on an upcoming social occasion. On the other hand, a weekend could be the best time for you to include a cheat meal., When you plan for a cheat meal, you should consider precisely what you will be eating. Think about satiating (in a moderate, controlled way) your craving for a specific food you've been missing. If you are avoiding carbohydrates in your diet, for example, digging into some bread and pasta might be a good choice. If you’re cutting back on sugar, having a slice of cake at a friend’s social gathering is a great way to cheat.
 Remember that a cheat meal is just that — a meal. You should avoid having an entire cheat day. Instead, focus on a single meal during which you will consume foods and/or drinks that you deny yourself while dieting. This will help you stay focused while at the same time satisfying some cravings.

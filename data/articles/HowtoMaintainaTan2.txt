 Your face is generally the first thing people notice. A fading facial tan will be immediately noticeable, so use self-tanner to fix up any fading. Purchase a self-tanner designed for your face and apply it regularly to keep your tan noticeable.Go for gradual tanners, as these tend to look more natural.
 A little bronzer on your face can also help your tan last longer. Apply the bronzer on areas where the sun naturally hits your face, such as the forehead, temples, nose, and cheekbones. This will highlight your natural tan, preventing the product from looking fake.Apply enough bronzer to give your skin a natural glow. Too much bronzer can be overwhelming and make your tan look fake. You want to recreate your natural tan rather than replace it altogether.
 Unless you have access to the sun all the time, your tan will eventually start to fade. As your tan fades, patch it up with spray-on tan. If your tan starts to lighten or darken, spray some fake tan on patchy areas to even things out., Over-the-counter pills that are designed to protect skin, such as Phytobronz Skin Protect, may help you maintain a tan. Such pills help replenish oils in your skin that are lost during the tanning process. If you're concerned about maintaining your tan, try taking some medication.However, some over-the-counter pills are not FDA regulated. Always check with your doctor before taking any new medications.

 There are CrossFit affiliates in 142 countries on seven continents. Depending on where you live, you should be able to find a CrossFit box that is relatively convenient for you.If you've never been to a CrossFit box before, try to find more than one so that you can visit several and compare. Different CrossFit coaches have different styles, and boxes vary in quality as well as general atmosphere. While you want to find a box that is convenient, you also want to make sure you feel comfortable there.
You can search for CrossFit boxes near you on the CrossFit website. If the box has its own website, explore that website as well to learn more about that particular location.
 Just as not every CrossFit box is alike, not every CrossFit coach is alike either. Not only do you want to work with a coach who motivates and inspires you, but you want that coach to have adequate training and experience to benefit you.Since the minimum qualifications to be a CrossFit coach are relatively low, interview the coaches who would be working with you at each box you visit to learn more about their background and experience.
Ask for references, and talk to other box members to get their opinions about the quality of the coaching there.
Find out if each coach has specific certifications or qualifications, and ask to see proof of those. You also should ask questions about the lifestyle and nutrition resources available at each box.
 CrossFit doesn't have a quality control system for affiliates – all they have to do is pay the affiliate fee each year. For this reason, quality varies.Visit several boxes in your area and compare them. Look at overall cleanliness, class size and structure, and friendliness. You will start to see ways in which some boxes are better than others.
Make sure that the owner and staff are trained in CPR and First Aid. CrossFit can get intense, so you need to confirm that there are employees who are capable of handling emergencies.
 Most CrossFit boxes will let you take a free introductory class so you can try out the experience and decide whether you want to commit to regular classes. It can be a good way to meet other people as well as get a feel for how a CrossFit class is run.Arrive at your intro class early so you have time to get acclimated before the class begins and don't have to rush. You should be ready to go when the class starts.
After the class, the coach may offer a question and answer session, particularly if the intro class consists entirely of prospective members. Stay for the whole session and pay attention – someone else might ask a question you hadn't thought of but that's important to you.
 If you're serious about training with CrossFit, even if you plan to do most of your training at home rather than joining a CrossFit box, the Level 1 Certificate Course will teach you the foundational movements.You typically can sign up to take this course separately, without having to commit to any additional sessions at a CrossFit box.
Once you've completed the Level 1 course, you can be confidant that you're doing the foundational movements with correct form. This enables you to safely start CrossFit at home.

 It is very important to use only new instruments. It can be three to four years old, but not older than that. Often, old instruments don't give accurate results, so it's better to buy a new one for yourself instead of using the one your mother or uncle used.
 If you only need a compass or a protractor, there's no need to buy a whole geometry box for that. Because individual instruments are also available in the market., This way you will be sure that you are using appropriate instruments.

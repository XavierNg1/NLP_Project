, Place the ground meat, wheat germ, and powdered milk in a bowl. Use a spoon to fully incorporate the ingredients until you have a firm meaty dough.


If the dough seems too loose, add 1/2 cup of flour and mix well.
If you know your dog likes certain flavors, consider mixing them in. Use chunks of vegetables your dog likes, or add bits of bacon for an extra punch.
 Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Use your fingers or the back of a spoon to press it flat, making a pancake shape. Flatten it until it's about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
 Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut biscuit shapes from the meat dough. Lay them on a greased baking sheet as you go. If you have scraps of meat dough left over, ball it up, press it flat, and cut out more biscuits.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the biscuits bake for 15 minutes, or until the edges have turned brown. Check the biscuits often to make sure they don't burn.
 Let them cool, then serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for later use.

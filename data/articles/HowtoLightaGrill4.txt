 The fitting for the hoses should be tight and you shouldn’t smell gas leaking out. Most propane tanks have a gauge that tells you when they need to be refilled. Refer to your grill’s user manual to make sure that your fuel tank is connected securely and has enough propane in it to cook with., Slowly turn the valve until it is fully open to release the gas. Leave it open for approximately one minute to allow the gas to travel through the fuel line., Using the knob on the front of the grill, turn the first burner to the “High/Start” setting. This will allow the propane to begin flowing through this burner., After allowing the propane to flow through the burner, press the igniter button on the front of your grill to ignite the gas from that burner.If the igniter button does not work, light the burner manually by holding a lit match against it with the gas on. Turn on the gas and hold a match near the ignition burner. Turn the knob to “High/Start.” The burner should ignite.
If the burner does not ignite with the button or a match within ten seconds, turn off the gas and wait a few minutes before trying again. Leaving the gas on can lead to propane accumulating dangerously in the air.
 Turn the knob for each burner to the “High/Start” position. It’s likely that the new burners will ignite on their own from the fire of the first burner. If not, press the igniter button again or light the burners with a long match., Allow the grill to heat up for at least five minutes before cooking anything.

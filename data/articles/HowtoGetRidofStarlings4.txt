You will need to either release them a significant distance from the trap site or euthanize them humanely. Consider hiring a professional pest control expert to help eliminate the trapped birds., There is a pesticide that targets starlings, but it can only be used by a licensed professional. Call a pest control company to inquire about pesticides.

 The breathing is the same as in the previous exercise, but here we will perform the movement in 2 breaths.


Stay in exactly the same position as in the cat stretch.
If your wrists are beginning to tire, relax for a few minutes and gently circle them round.
 As you exhale, lift the right hand and left knee off the floor, fully extending both out in opposite directions.
 Then exhale, and do the same on the other side.
 Repeat this six times in total - three times each side.
 Do not allow them to collapse taking the body out of line.

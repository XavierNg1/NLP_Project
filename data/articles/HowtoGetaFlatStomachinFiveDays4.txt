 If you’re not happy with your results after five days, there are still ways to achieve the look of a flatter stomach. First of all, gravitate to the most flattering fabrics. Don’t wear clothing made of Lycra or other clingy materials. Instead, choose lighter fabrics that skim your body.
 Choose a peplum top or dress to conceal a stomach that you wish were flatter. Or, try wearing a top with a v-neck or lower neckline to pull the focus away from your midsection.Adding a belt to emphasize your waist can also help improve the look of your figure.
 Darker colors like black, burgundy, navy, and emerald green will create a slimmer look. It’s also important to stick to one color top and bottom. You can layer a black shirt under a red blazer with red pants, and the color of the pants and blazer will help create a connected line between your top and bottom halves, helping you appear slimmer and taller., If you still aren’t happy with the way your stomach appears, consider purchasing shapewear to wear under your clothing. Shapewear is usually made of stretchy, soft material that will hold in your waistline, and smooth out your hips.Be sure to get shapewear that is sized appropriately – you want it to do its job, but you don’t want it to be so tight that you can’t breathe!

, Stand up straight. Your shoulders and hips should be in alignment. Hold your head up confidently and tuck your tummy in. Good posture will make you look much slimmer.

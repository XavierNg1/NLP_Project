 If accessing the command prompt is a bit intimidating, pulling up the remote access dialog box is an alternate option for remotely shutting down a network computer. In most versions of Windows, "Run" will be accessible directly from the Start menu. If you're having trouble finding it, try searching for "Run" or using the keyboard shortcut âŠž Win+R to open it up.
 This bit of code typed into "run" will bring up the remote access dialog.
 The dialog box will appear and you simply need to fill in the appropriate information.
 On many versions of Windows, the remote access dialog box requires you add a comment to display on the target computer's screen. The comment can be anything you like.

 Stress can have negative effects on your thyroid. Stress overworks the adrenal glands, which can accompany an underactive thyroid. Cortisol levels are also increased by stress, which affects insulin levels and hunger.Stress also causes people to overeat or turn to junk food, which can negatively affect the thyroid.
Learn stress-relieving techniques, such as deep breathing, yoga, or tai chi. Other approaches can include meditation, massage, and getting enough sleep.
Taking time off from your responsibilities can be very beneficial and restorative as well.
 Increasing your level of physical activity can also help boost your thyroid function. You should set a goal of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least five days a week.Try walking, swimming, rowing machines, ellipticals, stair steppers, or any form of cardio exercise that you enjoy. Talk to your physician to make sure there are no limitations.
Start slow and progress at your own pace. Set reasonable goals for yourself.
 Strength training can also help boost your thyroid function.You should add two to three days of strength training to your weekly exercise routine. Strength training also helps promote weight loss and reduce stress.

 Check with your local state law to see if Green frogs are legal to own.;
, You can either go to your local pond or go to the pet store or go online and see if you could find the frog.
 When you picking a frog, you want to make sure that it's healthy and without any abnormal features like skinny stomachs, weak legs, or cloudy eyes.
 A 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium is suitable for one or two frogs. If you have more, increase the tank size. A half land/half water set-up or a terrestrial set-up is good enough for the frog.


Make sure you have a top so that the frog can't get out.
If you use gravel, make sure it's large enough for the frog not to swallow. Water depth should be 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm).
Soil or sphagnum moss is suitable.
Make sure you have a water dish large enough for the frog to soak in. Tadpoles can handle an aquarium filled water.
Add hiding spaces like caves or plants for your frog/tadpole. #*You can use a fluorescent light for the frog to bask on and to get its nutrients.
 You can use Vitamin D3 to powder the frog's food. You can get it from your local pet store.
 When cleaning the frog's tank, you want to remove the frog into a little container while you clean. Use 1% of bleach solution to clean the tank. When pouring the dirty water out, use a tank vacuum cleaner or turkey baster. Wash the rocks and furniture with hot water to kill the germs.

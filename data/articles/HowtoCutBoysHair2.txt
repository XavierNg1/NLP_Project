 You should start with a small amount. You can always take off more if you still think it’s too long.


A good amount to start with, unless the boy has really long hair, is probably about an 1/8th of an inch. When using scissors you should go slowly and not cut off too much too fast.
Make sure that the hair is dry when you cut it. Cutting wet hair is more challenging, and cutting with dry hair will ensure that you know exactly what it will look like while you’re cutting it.
 This cut determines how long you want the rest of the hair to be. Comb the front most part of the boy’s hair back, about enough to hold between two fingers, with the comb and then transfer the hair to between the index and middle fingers of your nondominant hand.
 Try to make the cut even, but you can always go back later and trim unruly hairs. This should leave the front-most section of the boy’s hair a little bit shorter than the rest.
 Include a little bit of the guide cut to show you how much hair to cut. Continue this process, working back towards the back of the head. Always include a little bit of the cut you just did to guide you.You should be able to make your way all the way to the back of the head with this process.


If you are cutting with scissors on the sides, too, use this same method. Start from the front and move backwards, using your guide cut. However, if you would rather make your guide cut in the back, you can also start in the back and gradually move to the front.Always grab a little bit of the cut you just did in your new cut so that you know how much you should cut off.
 Fold the right ear down (or have him hold it down for you) as you cut around the ear, as if you were tracing it. Repeat on the left side. This is an alternative to using the clippers.

 Aim the nozzle of the hair dryer at the contaminated spot on your leather. Run the hot air in circular motions over the gum until the gum becomes soft., Once the gum has warmed up, you should be able to scrape most of it off with a plastic hard-edged scraper. You could also try using an old credit card, a butter knife, or a spatula.
 Once the gum is reheated, take a dry, clean cloth rag (one that you donâ€™t care about getting gum on) and rub the gum. Using a circular motion, you should be able to rub the gum so that it forms into little balls and wipes away easily.
 Using a leather cleaner will help to remove any greasy residue left by the gum. Once you have wiped down the leather with the cleaner, apply some leather conditioner to moisturize the area that you applied heat to.

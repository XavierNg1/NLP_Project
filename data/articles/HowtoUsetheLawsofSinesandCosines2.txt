 To use the law of sines to find a missing angle, you need to know at least two side lengths and one angle.For example, you might have a triangle that has one side that is 10 cm long. Another side is 8 cm long, and the angle opposite is 50 degrees. You need to find the angle opposite the side that is 10 cm long.
 The convention is that side lengths are labeled a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c}. The angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side’s variable. For example, the angle opposite side a{\displaystyle a} is A{\displaystyle A}, the angle opposite side b{\displaystyle b} is B{\displaystyle B}, and the angle opposite side c{\displaystyle c} is C{\displaystyle C}.For example, in your triangle:a=8cm{\displaystyle a=8cm}; A=50degrees{\displaystyle A=50\;{\text{degrees}}}b=10cm{\displaystyle b=10cm}; B=?{\displaystyle B=?}c=?{\displaystyle c=?}; C=?{\displaystyle C=?}

Since you want to find the angle opposite the 10 cm side, you are looking for angle B.
 The formula is asinA=bsinB=csinC{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{\sin {A}}}={\frac {b}{\sin {B}}}={\frac {c}{\sin {C}}}}. The formula shows that the ratio of one side of the triangle to the sine of the opposite angle is equal to the ratio of all other sides to their opposite angles., Take care to substitute the values correctly, so that the side lengths are in the numerators of the formula, and their opposite angles are in the corresponding denominators.

For example, 8sin50=10sinB=csinC{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{\sin {50}}}={\frac {10}{\sin {B}}}={\frac {c}{\sin {C}}}}.
 To do this, set the complete ratio equal to the ratio with the angle you are solving for. Take the reciprocal of each ratio, so that the side length is in the denominator, and the sine of the angle is in the numerator.For example, since you know side a{\displaystyle a} and angle A{\displaystyle A}, and are solving for angle B{\displaystyle B}, you would set up the ratio 8sin50=10sinB{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{\sin {50}}}={\frac {10}{\sin {B}}}}. Taking the reciprocals, you have sin508=sinB10{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin {50}}{8}}={\frac {\sin {B}}{10}}}.
 Use a calculator or trigonometry table to do this. Plug the decimal into the equation.

For example, sin50=0.766{\displaystyle \sin {50}=0.766}. So, the equation should now look like this: 0.7668=sinB10{\displaystyle {\frac {0.766}{8}}={\frac {\sin {B}}{10}}}


, To do this, multiply each side of the equation by the unknown angle’s denominator, then simplify the remaining ratio.

For example:sin508=sinB10{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin {50}}{8}}={\frac {\sin {B}}{10}}}(0.7668)(10)=(sinB10)(10){\displaystyle ({\frac {0.766}{8}})(10)=({\frac {\sin {B}}{10}})(10)}0.766×108=sinB{\displaystyle {\frac {0.766\times 10}{8}}=\sin {B}}7.668=sinB{\displaystyle {\frac {7.66}{8}}=\sin {B}}0.9575=sinB{\displaystyle 0.9575=\sin {B}}


, The inverse sine is shown by the SIN−1{\displaystyle SIN^{-1}} button on a calculator. The inverse sine will give you measurement of the missing angle.For example, the inverse sine of 0.9575 is 73.2358. So, angle B{\displaystyle B} is about 73.24 degrees.

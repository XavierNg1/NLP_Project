 This is the gateway to most scooter tricks. To do this, you need to pull up on the handlebars, and do the same with your feet. So in turn, your wheels will leave the ground.(Just jump with your scooter);
, This is an easy trick that just about anyone can do. To do it, you simply need to jump off of the deck, leaving your wheels on the ground. Variations: you can switch stances by turning, do an Airwalk, or even a Rodeo (one hand on the handlebars).
(Bar-to-bar)To do an X-Up, you need to bunny hop, then twist your handlebars 90 degrees in midair, then straighten them out before landing.
 (Wheelie) Once again, a simple trick. Just lean back and balance on your back wheel and ride around.
 Same as a Manual, but instead you lean forward, balancing on your front wheel.
 This can be difficult for beginners, but all you need to do is hold down your brakes, and hop on your back wheel.
 All you need to do is Ollie, then take both of your feet off of the deck. Similar to a Hippy Jump, you can do an Airwalk, Rodeo, etc.
 To do this, you Ollie, then kick out your deck to the side with both feet 45 degrees. Remember to straighten the deck out before landing.
 Very simple, but easy to screw up. All you do is Ollie and turn your deck 90 degrees and land on the rail. Grind for as long as you need, then Ollie off.
 Hard to learn but can lead to many other trick combos.

If your hair is clean, use a hairspray or a spritz of dry shampoo to give it some lift and texture. This will give the finished braid a messy chic vibe.
If you want a sleeker look, use a water-based gel or mousse instead of hairspray to prepare your hair.
Before you begin to braid, brush or comb your hair so that it is tangle-free and easy to work with.;
, To make your hair easier to braid yourself, offset the two sections to one side of your head so you can create your braid to the side.br>








, As you are braiding on section of your hair, use a large clip to hold the other section of hair out of your way. When you finish one braid, hold it in place with a clip while you braid the other side. br>









After you are finished braiding both sides of your hair, secure both braids together with one elastic band that is close to the natural color of your hair.
 Stick the bobby pins into your braid horizontally. You can use miniature bobby pins, as they are more easily concealed. Use bobby pins close to the shade of your hair.br>









Use as many bobby pins as you need to make your braid feel secure.
Slightly pull at your braids to help loosen them and conceal the spots where you inserted your bobby pins.
 This will tame any flyaways and keep your style in place all day. For a more natural look, pull a few strands of hair down around your face to soften it.









Pull at the sides of your braids to create the shape that you want, and adjust your braid as needed.

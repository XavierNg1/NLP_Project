 For a person with hazel eyes, this can mean different things. Some people tend to have more greenish-blue eyes, while others have more greenish-brown eyes. However, you should choose the tone in your eye color that seems to be most predominant, and then avoid that color.


For example, a bright blue sweater will downplay the blue in your eyes, if you tend more towards bluish-green.
 If you wear glasses, you can choose frames that will accentuate your eye color. To bring out the green in your eyes, try choosing frames that are in the purple family, or even dark green frames. To bring out the gold tones, try dark shades of purple or even plum., The darker the color the better. For example, an emerald green or royal purple will accentuate your eyes. Typically, it will be best if the article of clothing used to accentuate your eyes is your shirt (or a dress).
 There are a wide variety of accessories you can use to accentuate your eyes.


For example, try a scarf or hat in which is in the purple, green, or gold family. You can also try this with a hat. If you wear earrings, you can try the same with that, too.
Accessories that are worn closer to your face will play a bigger role than items that aren't. So if you're trying to emphasize your eyes, you should choose earrings, a scarf, or a hat instead of something like a bracelet or your shoes.

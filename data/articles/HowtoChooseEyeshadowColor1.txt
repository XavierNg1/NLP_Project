 Using darker shades will distract from your eyes rather than enhance them. Neutral tones like coral, champagne, or a gray-brown will work best. When applying eyeshadow try swiping a champagne hue over your lid and a complementary brown in your crease.


Finish with a black eyeliner to really make your light eyes stand out.;
, Gray eyes are similar to hazel, but rather than containing browns, golds, and greens, they reflect blues, grays, and greens.Using smoky shades like misty grays or silvery blues will help bring out the natural gray of the eye rather than change its color.


Try using a darker eyeliner like black or a deep brown to draw more focus to the gray, too.
 Green eyes generally stand out on their own, so muted colors really help draw attention to their natural sparkle. Colors like a dusty purple/plum or brown will make green eyes appear more vivid.


Try a pale pink on the lid and work upwards with a dusky purple on the crease. Blend the two into a gradient and finish with a plum eyeliner to help make the green pop.
 Similar to gray eyes, hazel eyes can change depending on what color eyeshadow you use. However, to keep the natural hazel color, shades of bronze, gold, or deeper pinks like a dusty rose work best.


Try out a neutral beige on the lids and a green metallic on the crease to enhance the mixed hues without changing them.
 Almost anything works with brown eyes, but colors that are opposite on the color wheel like purple or teal will really help deepen the brown of the eye. However, colors like salmon, a coppery gold, or a reddish brown work as well.


For light brown eyes, try sticking to more neutral tones like a light pink on your lid and a reddish brown in your crease.

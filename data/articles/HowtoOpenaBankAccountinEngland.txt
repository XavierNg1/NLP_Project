, If you have poor or no credit you will require a 'basic bank account' as these do not require a credit check to be carried out. These accounts are designed to be widely available but do not offer overdraft facilities. If your credit is good then you will have a wider range of account options to choose from.

Your bank or building society will be able to answer any queries you have regarding identification.

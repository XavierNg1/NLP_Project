 No matter how you travel, you will need some money to survive along they way. The more money you have, the easier things can be, especially when you don’t know your way around town. Do some research and find out how much it will cost you to afford the luxury of comfort, safety, and fun.Check prices for everything. Since you’ll be away from home, you want to get a sense of how much money you’ll need to pay for all your desires. Use travel websites like tripadvisor.com or lonelyplanet.com for prices and reviews.Look into the cost of first class flight tickets, nice hotels, good restaurants, travel insurance, leisure activities, and souvenirs.
 Traveler’s insurance is generally not needed if you have other forms of insurance like life-insurance or insurance on your high-valued possessions (like your laptop, jewelry, or a nice camera). If you are planning to travel with highly valuable goods or you are worried about getting sick, consider purchasing insurance.


Go directly to the insurance company. Avoid buying insurance from a travel booking agency. They sometimes work off commission and do not always have your best interest at heart. Instead, contact an insurance company through a website like, insuremytrip.com. Ask them to explain exactly what is covered, the dates of your coverage, and any exceptions to the policy rules., Make sure you pack the necessary travel documents like an ID or passport. Don’t stress about packing too much or too little. You will probably be able to purchase things like clothes, electronics, and toiletries when you arrive.
 Whether you travel by boat, bus, or plane, traveling first class provides extra comfort and accommodation. Sitting in a small space, particularly on a long trip, can cause unwanted physical and mental discomfort. Avoid stress by paying the extra money for a first class ticket. You will be much more comfortable if you have space to relax.


Consider flying business class. First class tickets can be quite expensive. On large airlines, business class is another option that provides comfort and high quality service.
 Luxury hotels are not only pleasant, they often have extra services that make being away from home less stressful. Services include spas, entertainment centers, and more.
 No matter the reason for your travel, make time to do something that is fun for you. Go out to nice dinner, see a show, or hit the beach. Take as much time as you can to do things that are relaxing.

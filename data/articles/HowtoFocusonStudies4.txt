 Your brain is like a sponge, if it gets to much information, it "leaks" out information. Take breaks to rest your mind.
 Sometimes we need an incentive to keep ourselves going. If good grades aren't enough of a reward, create something else to keep you concentrated on your studies. Maybe some sweet treats and some time in front of the TV? A shopping spree? A massage or a nap? What would make studying worth your while?

, Nutrition is key to keeping you awake and motivated to study. Have a snack nearby. Try to keep it to something simple, like a handful of nuts, blueberries, or dark chocolate. Keep water nearby, too; don't drink too much coffee, caffeinated teas, or any energy drinks (you'll be up all night long). Eventually, you’ll build a tolerance to them and they won’t help as much.


Eat super foods. Research shows that blueberries, spinach, squash, broccoli, dark chocolate, and fish boost brain activity. Avoid eating junk and sweets with little to no nutritional value. Your body will expend energy breaking them down, but won’t benefit for them. A healthy diet will keep you more energized and make it easier to put your mind to the test., Exercising does wonders to the body and the brain. Exercise helps with memory, mood, alertness and feeling. Do stretches that work out areas of your body that might have grown stiff during your study session. Touch your toes. Lift small weights. Go for a jog.
 Sleep allows your brain to store information that you study. Without proper sleep, all that studying is for nothing. Getting ample sleep helps to regulate your hormones, which will keep your temper in check.

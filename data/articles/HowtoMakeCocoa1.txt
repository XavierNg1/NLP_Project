 In a small saucepan, mix together 2 tablespoons (15 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 to 2 tablespoons (12 to 24 g) of sugar depending on how sweet you want your cocoa, and a pinch of salt. Heat the pan over medium low heat until the cocoa and sugar dissolve, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.You don’t have to use dairy milk in the cocoa. Feel free to substitute almond milk, soy milk, or rice milk if you prefer.
You can also substitute maple syrup, honey, or agave nectar for the sugar. However, you should start with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) and only add more if necessary after tasting.;
, After the cocoa and sugar have dissolved, whisk in the remaining milk. Raise the heat to medium, and heat the mixture until it is hot, which should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes.Make sure to whisk the mixture as it’s heating to ensure that it doesn’t scorch.
 When the cocoa is hot, mix in ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of vanilla extract and remove the pan from the burner. Pour the mixture into a mug, and top with whipped cream, marshmallows, or both.While this recipe makes just a single mug of hot cocoa, you can easily multiply to make as much as you want. The only alteration you’ll need to make is to use ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of salt if you multiply the recipe up to a quart (946 ml) of milk.

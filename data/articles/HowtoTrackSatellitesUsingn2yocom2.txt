 The site offers three different options, including a standard map, an actual satellite map, and a hybrid of the two. To access, click on one of the three buttons embedded in the top right corner of the map.


Additional options are also available directly below the map, they include:






The "Draw Orbits" option will show you the satellite's path as it orbits Earth.
The "Draw Footprint" option reveals the area on the planet visible to the satellite.
And the "Keep Selection Centered" option allows you to view the satellite's progress without intermittently adjusting the screen.

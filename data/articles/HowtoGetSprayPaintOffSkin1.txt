 Vegetable oiland cooking spraysmade of vegetable oil are often believed to work best, but you could also try other cooking oils, like olive oil or coconut oil, and non-cooking oils, like baby oil. Butter and margarine have even been known to work.


Oil is one of the most effective remedies for removing spray paint from skin. The vast majority of spray paints are oil-based. This means that water will not affect them at all—since oil and water do not mix or bond—but other oils and oil-based products can bond with the paint and lift it away.
If at all possible, you should avoid corrosive oils like turpentine. Such oils are harsh and can very easily irritate the skin, especially if used on sensitive areas. If you must use turpentine, only use it on areas of tougher skin like the feet or hands; never use harsh oils on the face or neck.;
, If you work with cooking spray, you can spray it directly on the paint-covered skin. For other oils, you can soak a cotton ball, cotton pad, or clean rag in a little oil and rub it onto the paint that way.









You could also put those other oils into a spray bottle and spray them onto the skin as you would do with cooking spray.
When applying the oil with a rag or cotton pad, rub the oil into the skin using the material. When applying it in spray form, spray your fingers with a little oil, as well, and scrub at the oil-soaked paint spot with your oil-covered fingers.
 To avoid making a mess or creating further stains in your sink or tub, it is recommended that you rinse the oil and paint off under rapidly running water while it is still wet. Use soap, if necessary, to help strip it away from your skin.








You may not be able to get rid of all the paint after your first attempt. If some still remains, repeat the process as often as necessary to lift it off.

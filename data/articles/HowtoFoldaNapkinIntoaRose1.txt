 Then, fold the top down about two inches (5 cm). Press the fold with your fingers. The folded portion at the top will be used to make the head of the flower.Using a table or flat surface to work will make this step easier.;
, Pinch the napkin between your index and middle finger tightly. You fingers should be pointed in the same direction as the fold.
 Start by going behind your fingers. Make sure the bottom wraps evenly with the top. Continue wrapping the napkin tightly around your fingers until there are about two inches (5cm) left, then stop.
 This will create a small triangle on top of the flap. The fold will help to shape the rose and create a little separation between the layers of petals.
 The napkin should now be cylindrical in shape. Make sure the top and bottom are about even in size.
 Keep your fingers in the head of the flower. Hold the coils around your fingers in place. Use your free hand to work on the stem.


Pinch the napkin just below the two inch fold and begin twisting with your free hand.
Once the base is secure, pull your fingers out gently.
Keep twisting until you get about halfway down the stem, then stop.
 This will create a leaf for the stem. Pinch the leaf between your fingers to keep it loose as you continue twisting the stem to the bottom.
 Making a paper rose out of a napkin is a great trick to know. If you're ever in need of a flower and don't have time or money to spend at a floral shop, this simple trick can save the day.

 Keep in mind that NYC is a big city, even if it doesn’t always feel like it. Make sure to plan your travels ahead if it is dark and take a cab if necessary. Be careful about who you trust and recognize that even new friends are still essentially strangers. When in doubt, rely on your common sense when making plans., If you get a feeling that something is wrong or off-kilter, there is a good chance that you are right. If this happens, get yourself to a safe place and reach out to people who can help you. Don’t be afraid to contact the authorities if you need assistance as well., Before you leave on your trip, get in touch with at least three friends or family members and let them know where you are headed. You can give them your accommodation and flight information as well. You might want to carry one of their numbers with you in your bags, just in case they need to be contacted in case of a medical emergency.Also, make sure that you carry all necessary medical ID cards with you. For example, if you require certain medications these can be used by first responders to help you.

 The amount of fabric you need depends on the length and width of the person’s back. Measure the width wrist to wrist of the person who will wear the wings. Measure their length from their neck to their waist. Also measure their arm circumference and add this measurement to the length of fabric you need., Using your measurements, get enough fabric that you’ll be able to cover the back and arms of the person who will wear the wings. A good fabric is black and stretchy, such as spandex. You can cut this material without leaving frayed ends.

For non-sewn bat wings, cut out the upper and lower sections of an umbrella, then clip off the metal pieces using wire cutters., From the right or left end, fold the fabric in half. Your fabric should be half the width of your original measurement. Now take the top end of the fabric and fold it downwards enough so that you can see the appropriate amount of fabric you need to create arm holes. Don’t cut this folded fabric, but mark the lower end of the arm holder before you unfold it., Where you marked the fabric, take scissors and trim the corner in a semicircle. The bottom of the circle will be towards the middle of your remaining fabric while the ends of the cut should be an even distance along the edges of the fabric., Fold the remaining top part of the fabric next to the cut you made. Bring it down enough so that it once again creates the arm sleeve., Opposite from where you cut the first semicircle, begin cutting. Start at the corner below where you cut the first semicircle. Leave this corner intact but cut up and down next to it to create another semicircle. Keep going along the bottom side of the fabric, cutting further in to give the wings a slope., Unfold the fabric. Take the top, uncut fabric and fold it over to create the sleeves. Sew the bottom parts of the sleeves onto the cape. Now the bat wings are ready to wear.

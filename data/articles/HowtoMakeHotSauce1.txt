 Pepper selection is important. This will determine how mild or hot your sauce will be. Here is a small list of peppers and how they taste:



Jalapeños: These peppers are ideal for making mild sauces. They have a strong flavor with less kick than other peppers. They are typically green and about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) with a curved shape. They look a little "stubby".
Serranos: These peppers look like jalapeños but are twice as hot. Use these peppers for a hotter sauce. They look similar to jalapeños but are not as wide. They're green when they're not ripe, but the color varies when they do ripen.
Pequin: These peppers look like small red berries. They have a unique flavor and are very hot. The difficulty encountered when using this pepper is obtaining a large enough quantity to make a good sauce.

Habanero: This pepper is one of the hottest of all peppers. Use this pepper if you want to burn your mouth with fire. It looks shriveled and is usually bright orange or red.
Bhut Jolokia: The "ghost chili" at over one million Scoville units. This rare chili comes from parts of India.;
, After selecting the pepper, you should further determine the heat your sauce by deciding on the appropriate quantity of peppers. Mild sauce will use half a pound (.23 kg) and hot will use 2 pounds (.9 kg).
,, Puree the mix until all thick chunks are gone.

 Fill a pot with water and place a large bowl on top. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water. Turn the stove on and wait until the water starts to simmer.
 Spread the chocolate evenly across the bottom of the bowl and stir it often with a spatula so that it doesn't scorch.
 You have to let the chocolate cool before you add it to you buttercream, or it will cause the butter to melt.
 You can use an electric mixer, a handheld beater, or even a food processor. It will take about two to three minutes for the butter to reach the right consistency.
 If you have been using a higher speed in your mixer, now is the time to change it to a low setting. Add the chocolate and mix it some more. You may have to use a spatula to get all of the chocolate out of the bowl.
 Do this until the buttercream has gets a smooth and even texture, and there are no streaks or clumps.


If you do not like vanilla, consider substituting it for espresso or strongly-brewed coffee instead.
 At this time, you can either decorate your cakes or cupcakes using the buttercream, or you can put the buttercream into an air-tight container an store it in the refrigerator for about two to three weeks.

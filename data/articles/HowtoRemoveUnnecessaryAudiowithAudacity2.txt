 Open the song you want to edit in Audacity.


Make sure you have a copy of the original file saved somewhere else, in case you accidentally over-edit.
 Find a section with several seconds of just the background noise that you're trying to get rid of.This can be audience chatter or it can be the standard ambient background noise that comes with a low-quality mic. Select this noise using the select tool, which should be activated by default.
 Open the "Effect" menu on the top bar and then select "Noise Removal". This will bring up a new menu. You want to click "Get Noise Profile" and then close the menu.
 Select, using the selection tool as before, the area where you want the noise removed from.
 Open the "Effect" menu on the top bar again. Now you will see a new option at the very top that says "Repeat Noise Removal". Click this.
 You should now have a noise-free file. Save the file as normal and enjoy!

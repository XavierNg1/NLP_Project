 You will need a broom or blower and a good concrete cleaner. For applying the sealer you will need a roller, a garden pump sprayer, or a pneumatic low pressure sprayer. You will likely want to have a good pair of rubber gloves and wear eye protection.;
, Use a good cleaner that will remove any oils, stains, or grease. Use a stiff bristled brush or broom to scrub the surface and rinse it off with a hose. For the best results, use a power washer. Before applying the sealer make sure the concrete is dry.
 Doing so after cleaning the surface makes for a smooth even substrate for the sealer to adhere to.
 Shaking the sealer may cause bubbles which can adversely affect the appearance of the sealed surface.
 This is especially important if you are using a sealer that will add color or sheen to the concrete. Make sure you complete the entire project at one time.
 This will vary according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.

 When purchasing quail from the store, choose birds that appear relatively plump since they'll have a better ratio of meat to bone. Make sure that the skin appears unblemished, too.Additionally, the quail skin should look creamy or yellow with a slight pink tint.
Do not purchase quail that looks dry or smells peculiar.
Note that quails can be purchased bone-in, semi-boneless, or fully boneless. Any of these options can be used.
 Store fresh quail in the refrigerator and use it within two or three days.


Cover a tray or baking sheet with greaseproof wax paper or parchment paper, then put the quail on top. Keep it on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator so that no juices can drip off and contaminate other foods.
 You don't need to marinate or brine the quail, but since the meat is lean and fairly dry, doing so can reduce the risk of drying the meat out during the cooking process.


For a simple marinade:Combine the olive oil, garlic, thyme, sage, and parsley in a large glass bowl.
Add the quail to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the quail for two hours.


For a simple brine:Combine the wine/water, salt, and bay leaves in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil on the stove over medium-high heat.
Allow the brine to cool.
Place the quail in a large bowl and cover with the brine. Cover with plastic wrap, then refrigerate for two hours.
 Remove the quail from the refrigerator roughly 30 minutes to one hour before you plan on cooking it. Keep it on the counter, away from cooked foods or foods that will be eaten raw.


Keep the quail on its tray or in its bowl as it drops to room temperature. Clean the counter both before and after setting the quail on top to minimize the risk of contamination.
During this time, you should also drain any brine or marinade, then pat the outside and inner cavity using clean, undecorated paper towels or parchment paper. The surface should appear moist but not soaking wet.

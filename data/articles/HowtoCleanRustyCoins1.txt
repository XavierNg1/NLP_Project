 Cleaning will decrease their value significantly. Avoid cleaning corrosion (such as rust), buildup (such as dirt), and other filth from old coins if you are hoping to sell them for prices anywhere near coin-collecting book values. If the coins you want to clean are part of a numismatic (serious study of coins) collection, do not clean them. Doing so can greatly diminish their coin-collecting values. Leave the cleaning of valuable coinage to experts, who are in the business of this work.;
, Any potentially valuable coins should not even be handled with your bare hands. Don gloves, and put the coins in plastic coin envelopes. Get your coins appraised by a professional before you proceed. The same goes for all antiques: don't clean, paint or polish anything that may have value before getting them appraised.
 Copper can discolor other coin surfaces when they are left to soak together in a cleaning solution. In terms of American currency: clean pennies separately from nickles, dimes, quarters, etc.


Do not leave copper pennies to soak with steel pennies. The copper could react with the cleaning chemicals and somewhat dissolve in the solution. The dissolved copper will bind to the steel pennies, ruining their finishes.

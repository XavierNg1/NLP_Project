 Try not to take negative reviews personally. Always respond to negative reviews professionally and politely. Don’t make excuses for the mistake. Make sure you resolve any issues that you can and highlight your strengths in the process.


For example, you might say: “we are very sorry that the shirt shipped to you was the incorrect size. We make and produce thousands of shirts and sometimes mistakes slip through the cracks. We will happily ship you a shirt in the correct size for no charge.”, If something negative about you or your company is going around online, you need to stay calm. Don’t try argue with or insult people who are talking about you. In order to quickly recover from negative press, either from social media or a journalistic publication, you need to publically apologize and stay calm. If the problem is something you can and should fix, then fix it. Do better in the future and people will forget about the negative press., If your account gets hacked and something that does not follow your beliefs or values is posted, you need to take action. First, you should delete the post, especially if it an obvious hack or it is graphic and inappropriate. Next, you should post a public apology for the offensive post.For example, “We are very sorry for the offensive post that was published on our account earlier today. Our account was hacked, but we are taking measures to improve security.”

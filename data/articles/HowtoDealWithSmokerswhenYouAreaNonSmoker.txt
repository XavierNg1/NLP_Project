 Believe it or not, your friends and acquaintances have no wish to make you miserable. Most people are very willing to leave the room or rub out their cigarette if it's really making you uncomfortable.;
, If you don't feel comfortable asking people not to smoke, at least ask them to keep the smoke from wafting your direction. Be polite or funny about this, especially if you don't know them that well.
 Promise you won't complain about the smoke at bars, just as long as no one smokes during mealtimes.
 Second hand smoke can lower your immune system. Vitamin C can help counteract its effects, and water can soothe your dry throat.
 The only thing worse than smoke is smoker's breath. Many smokers are very aware of this and are stocked up with eclipse mints, but not everyone is this self-aware. Buy the small, potent, sugar-free kind and pass those puppies around.
 If you desperately need a night off from the stench, buy a couple of these for your friends and guilt them into using them. They may even see this as a treat.
 If you're going to ask those around you to go out of their way for your comfort, be very clear about the reasons their smoking bugs you and don't do anything inconsistent with that logic. It'll just give them more excuses to smoke. (If this is the case for you, do not buy them cigarillos or any other tobacco product!)

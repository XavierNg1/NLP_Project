 Polaris, also called the North Star, can be used in the Northern Hemisphere to help you find north. This is one of the quickest ways to determine your directions at night if you don’t have a compass or GPS.


Polaris, or the North Star, is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Because it’s located in the sky around the North Pole, it doesn’t move around much, meaning it’s useful and accurate for navigating.
 Find the Big Dipper (also known as the Plough) and the Little Dipper (aka Ursa Minor). Think of the Big Dipper like a ladle (hence the name), where the handle holds a cup, and the outer edge of the cup (the farthest from the handle) points out into the sky and toward Polaris. For confirmation, Polaris is the last star that makes up the handle of the Little Dipper., This is approximately true north. When you face Polaris, you are facing due north; behind you is due south, and due west will be on your left, while due east will be on your right.

 You can choose a shirt with a logo or designs on the front, but the back should be free of design.
 Cut around the entire collar, instead of through the 2 layers, so that you can get closer to the collar seam.
 You should only cut through 1 layer of fabric at a time, to avoid uneven holes and seams.


At this point, try the t-shirt on, so that you can adjust the arm or neck holes to your liking. Cut wider or angled holes, if you prefer. Try on the t-shirt frequently as you work, so that you can see how it looks in a mirror.
 You can choose bows or braiding.


Cut 3 horizontal slits that are approximately 5 to 8 inches long in the back of you t-shirt. Make the first slit below your bra line, and measure the remaining slits so that they are equidistant from each other. Cut 4 2-inch wide bands of fabric from your leftover sleeves. Gather the center of each cut piece. Wrap the 2-inch strip around 3 times, knot it twice and tuck the sides of the knot into the center of the fabric. Repeat with each strip until you have knotted the last piece at the bottom into a bow.
Cut horizontal slits of the same width down the side or middle of your t-shirt in the back. The shorter the slit, the less skin you will show. Start a few inches before the collar line and continue as long as you would like the t-shirt braiding to go. Loop the slit that is second from the top under and through the first slit. Pull it down, then loop the slit below it through the slit you just pulled down. Work your way down looping through the last slit you pulled down until you reach the bottom. Stitch the bottom loop down with a needle and thread.

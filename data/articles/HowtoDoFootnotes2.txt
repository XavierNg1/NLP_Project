 Instead of including publishing information about the source in the footnote, often writers will footnote additional "asides" or tangentially related information in footnotes, often gleaned from other resources not directly cited. David Foster Wallace, in his long novel Infinite Jest made use of pages-long footnotes as a kind of in-joke. In academic writing, this should be used sparingly, but is common in memoir or other non-fiction styles of prose.


Science writing conventions will often footnote additional research studies that came to similar conclusions, but aren't being directly cited in the study at hand.
 If a paper quoted a source that talked about wikiHow articles and you wanted to clarify it, your footnote after the number might look like this: "WikiHow examples are used to clarify text in situations where it would be helpful to have a visual cue. Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115."

, Long explanatory footnotes are distracting to the reader. If you find yourself with lots of extra information you need to put into footnotes, consider finding a place for it in the text, or otherwise revising the article or essay to account for it.


Editors will often recommend that any information included in parentheses in a piece of academic writing be footnoted instead. Consider the progression of the prose, the "flow" of the writing, and see if asides might be better off at the bottom of the page.
 Before using footnotes to reference sources, check with your editor or instructor to make sure you should cite the sources using a footnote. Typically, MLA or APA guidelines prefer you use a parenthetical in-text citation of a source, rather than a footnote, and reserve footnotes for supplementary information or alternative references to the same information. Footnotes are to be used only when necessary.


In Chicago style, footnotes are used in place of parenthetical citations and are more common.

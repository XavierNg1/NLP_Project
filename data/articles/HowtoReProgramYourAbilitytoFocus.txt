 There are some places that make it nearly impossible for you to be able to think, let alone focus on anything important. Stay away from those areas. Find a place that is quiet, has good lighting, a comfortable temperature, proper ventilation, appropriate space, comfortable seating and allows you to concentrate. This may be an office at work, your workshop at home, the park, a local cafe of library. You know what works for you. Find a space where you can properly focus.;
, If the telephone is constantly ringing or your Facebook alerts continually pop up, turn them off. If the television is on and it's distracting, shut it off. Avoid distractions that divert your attention from the task at hand. The most important thing you can do is to take control of your environment.
 These may be mini-goals or long-term goals. Setting goals allows you to focus on something specific. Otherwise, it's easy to get distracted with details and items that are not significant to your task at hand. It's alright to make notes about things you need to do in the future, but don't let them distract you from your current goals.
 When you've successfully completed a task or met a goal, give yourself a treat. That could be a manicure, an ice-cream sandwich or a few minutes to sneak away to a movie.
 If your body is tired and your mind is fuzzy, it's not going to be possible to focus no matter how hard you try. Try to get between 8 and 10 hours of sleep per night to enhance your ability to focus.
 If your metabolism is out of balance, that can affect your neurosystem, which can affect the way you think and focus. Eat regularly, and include vegetables and protein in your diet.
 When your body is physically fit, your mind is more apt to be, too. Exercising regularly helps your body process toxins, be more alert and feel better overall. When this happens, your ability to focus is enhanced.Remember a fit mind can work wonders.

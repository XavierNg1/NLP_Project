 Look for a girl that is doing a simple side to side motion with her hips. Some girls do a figure 8 motion, but it is suggested to be tried side to side first.;
, If your request is accepted, gently place your hands at her hips and sway to the beat.
 She may lean forward, put her hands on her knees, and start to move her butt up and down against your pelvic area. Just stand there while she does it, you can either keep your hands on her hips or place them on her back. She may do some moves that are specific to the song like "pop, lock, and drop it". Don't try to follow her on these moves.
 If she smiles or leans back into you, or she's telling her friend what a great time she's having, you can take it a little further. Try moving your hand to her inner thigh and leaning your head into her neck, but don't go too fast. Some girls like to keep things slow.
 this is where you put your left leg (or right leg if your left footed) in between her legs. Sway your hips from side to side and start with your hands on her hips after a while you can try to lower your hands down onto her butt. Slowly get closer throughout the song.
 Put a hand on her shoulder and turn her around so shes facing you. Then move your hands to her back. Now go in for the kiss! If she smiles or comes back in for another this means she liked it and wants more. So begin to kiss her more and longer until you are making out.
 Squeeze in between them and grind normally with the one in front of you. The girl behind you will put her hands on your hips and grind with you from behind. This is called a sandwich.
 After a song ends grab her hand, walk to the refreshments area, and buy her a drink. This gives both of you a chance to cool down. Try to start a conversation and get her number. After a few minutes head back to the dance floor.

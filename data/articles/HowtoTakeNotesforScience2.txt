 When you back to examine your notes, you may want to enter in additional information. Leave yourself space to flesh out ideas.
 Don’t leave out steps to problems, particularly when math is involved, assuming you’ll understand how to get from one point to another just because it made sense during the lecture. Write down every little step — show your work.
 This is not the place for complete sentences! For one thing, you likely won’t have time to write all the extra words. For another, the extra text can be a distraction. If you are marking key points in a book, highlight important words and phrases. It doesn’t do you any good to color in an entire page with highlighter.
 Learn scientific units and use them. For example, write g instead of grams or K instead of Kelvin. Use shorthand notation for words you use a lot. These can be symbols you develop yourself or you can get them from a book. Examples of helpful notation include w/ for with and e.g. for examples

, Refer to relevant lab exercises. If you are taking lab notes, let yourself know where to locate the lecture notes. Your lab book will be separate from your lecture notes, so you won’t be able to keep all of the information in one place

, If you review notes soon after class, you’ll reinforce the material and learn to identify holes in your coverage. Write down any questions you need to ask in class. Right before class starts, review notes to make sure you’re up to speed and the concepts are fresh in your mind so that you are ready to move on to new material.

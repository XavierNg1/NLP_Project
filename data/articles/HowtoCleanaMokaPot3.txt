 Expect the metal to oxidize and create mineral deposits over time, especially if it didn’t dry thoroughly. Inspect the insides of the boiler and server for discoloration every now and then. Correct these by mixing one part white vinegar with eight parts water and using this to scrub out the inside, and/or let it sit overnight in the boiler.It’s also important to do this in order to keep the boiler’s overpressure valve clear of any deposits that may be blocking it., Dish soap dulls the pot’s shine, but it’s necessary to use occasionally in order to prevent coffee oils from growing rancid. If you miss that shine, don’t worry. Whether your pot is aluminum or stainless steel, polish the outside as needed to restore its luster., Expect rubber gaskets to deteriorate over time. This means that an old gasket will form a less secure seal for the filter at the bottom of the server, which in turn means coffee grounds may end up where they’re not supposed to be. Replace old gaskets as needed to ensure a clean cup of coffee.

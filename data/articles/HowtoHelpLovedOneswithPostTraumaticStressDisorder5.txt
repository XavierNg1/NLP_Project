 It can be difficult helping someone with PTSD. You may experience your loved one’s flashbacks or panic attacks if they are triggered. You may drain a lot of emotional energy being there and listening to them. To help with this, you should learn to relieve stress so that you aren’t getting too stressed out.

For example, you may want to try deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, exercise, or listening to soothing music.
Reducing your stress can help you stay calm around your loved one. They may feed off your stress, which can lead to negative reactions.
 You should ask other family members for help caring for your loved one. You are only one person, and you can’t do everything. You shouldn’t give up your life. Ask other friends or family members to help with any tasks or care that needs to be done for your loved one.You can say, “I am unable to be with them every day. I was wondering if you could go visit them once or twice a week. That would really help out.”
Look into home care or other medical care options in your area if your loved one can’t be alone.
 You need to have a support system to help you as you care for your loved one. This can be anyone you trust who can listen to you and offer support and understanding. Talking about what you are dealing with is very important when caring for someone with PTSD.You can end up with secondary trauma from listening to the trauma or being exposed to flashbacks. Having a support system to help you from getting too overwhelmed can help you avoid this.
You may rely on friends and family, a therapist, a support group, or a religious group.
 Though you want to take care of your loved one, you need to have your own life. This means keeping your job, seeing friends, engaging in activities, and pursuing hobbies. You should find ways to enjoy yourself and do things that are not connected to your loved one.Set boundaries for what you can give and when to back away. Make sure to give yourself space to do things for you.

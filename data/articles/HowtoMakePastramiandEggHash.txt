 Get the ketchup and cheese ready too.
 Add some salt (about half a teaspoon). Whip it with the fork.

If you like, add some black pepper to it.
 You'll need enough to fry the pastrami and to cook the egg., Then switch on the heat source to fry the pastrami.

If you want the pastrami crispy, leave it to fry until it turns dark in colour.
If you like it juicy, pour the egg as soon as it starts sizzling or if the pastrami gets a bit darker in colour.
 Leave the egg in the pan for about 45 seconds. Then scrape at the edges of the egg to make it easier to flip., When the edges are cooked, flip the egg and leave it on this side for the same amount of time. Meanwhile, keep the plate near you.,, Cut the bread in half and spread the cheese on one side. Cover the other side with ketchup. Put some of the egg inside the bread and squirt some ketchup inside. Enjoy!

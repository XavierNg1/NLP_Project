 Make sure you have enough room for the hotline shortcut(s) you wish to add. Remove icons or widgets by tapping and holding them, and then dragging them to the trash bin (delete) icon at the top of the home screen once they become movable.;
, Similar to adding an app icon, you can add a shortcut to the home screen by tapping and holding a blank area. When the customization window appears, tap on “Shortcuts” then choose “Direct Dial” from the list of apps that you can add shortcuts with.
 Scroll through the contacts list that appear shortly after tapping “Direct Dial.” Once you have the number you wish to assign the shortcut to dial, tap on it. You should be taken to the home screen, with the hotline shortcut added to the area you selected in Step 2.
 Now that the shortcut is added, relocate it to a more convenient spot if necessary. Do this by simply tapping and holding the shortcut, and then dragging it to the desired position.
 Time to test the hotline. Tap on the shortcut once, and the Dialer app should open and dial the contact directly.


Cancel the call by tapping the red phone icon.

 Aim for at least two daily walks with your puppy. They don't need to be long but they should reasonably tire out your pup. Just make sure the puppy is getting enough daily exercise based on its size and energy level.


Be kind to your puppy and be sure to give it exercise on a daily basis.;
, A bored dog will take out its energy in some other (undesirable) form, from whining, to crying, to destruction of property. Try to have two active play times each day, with you playing fetch, keep away, or tug of war, or any other active game your puppy loves to play.


In addition to getting necessary exercise, the puppy will love the attention it gets from you. The younger the dog is the shorter your play and exercise sessions have to be but remember to increase the frequency of play or walk time as the puppy gets older.
 You want your puppy to be able to amuse itself when it is alone in the yard. Supplying plenty of toys will hopefully distract your pup from the fact that it is alone.


Supply a variety of types of toys. Balls, squeaky toys, and treat-dispensing toys are all favorites for puppy playtime. These types of toys can help to distract a puppy from being sad it is alone while stimulating its natural inquisitiveness and desire to chew.

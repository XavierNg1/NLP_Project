 The app icon has an icon of a file or spreadsheet on it. If you don’t have Google Sheets, you can download it for free from your device’s respective app store. You can also access your spreadsheets from the Google Drive app.
 If this is the first time you’re using the app, you will need to link it with your Google account first in order for you to access your Google Sheets. Tap the “Get started” button and select your Google account to be used. You may need to enter your Gmail email address and password.
 Upon logging in, you will be brought to the main directory. If you already have existing spreadsheets, you can see and access them from here.
 Tap the large red circle with a plus sign on the lower right corner. You will need to name your new spreadsheet right away. A small window will appear where you can type it in. Do so, then tap the “Create” button. An empty spreadsheet screen will be displayed in full screen.
 You can work on Google Sheets much like how you would work on Microsoft Excel. There’s a toolbar on the header with functions very similar to those of Microsoft Excel.
 If you’re done with your current document, tap the checkmark on the top left corner of the header bar, then tap the left arrow. You will be brought back to the main directory. Your changes will be saved automatically.

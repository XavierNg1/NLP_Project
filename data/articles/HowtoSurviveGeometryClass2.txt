 Homework might seem boring or redundant, but it is important because it helps you practice applying the skills and concepts you learned during class.Plus, if you do the homework, you might realize that you do not understand a concept as well as you thought you did, and the next day you can ask your instructor for additional help.
 Usually your teacher will require this for full credit, but it also allows you to check your work. Additionally, if you show your work, it is easier to review with your parents, teacher, or tutor, because they can see what you did for the problems and identify any misconceptions you might have, or common errors you make., If your instructor did not mark which problems you got wrong, speak to him or her after class.

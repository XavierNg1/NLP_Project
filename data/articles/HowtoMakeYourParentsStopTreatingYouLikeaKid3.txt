 If you are old enough to move out on your own, then you may want to consider it as a way to improve your relationship with your parents. It may be difficult for your parents to see you as an adult until you have moved out of their house.


Before you do anything drastic, make sure that you are financially able to live on your own and that you are ready for the responsibility. Living on your own can be expensive and difficult.
If you are not quite ready to move out on your own, consider asking your parents if you can help out by paying for your own car insurance, paying one of the utility bills, or even paying them a set amount for rent. This will help to show them that you are mature and give you some good practice for living on your own., Whether you are still living at home or living on your own, it is important to maintain a healthy distance from your parents. Make sure that you keep an active social life with your friends, work hard in school and/or your job, and pursue hobbies and other interests that do not involve your parents., The less that you demonstrate your parents that you need their help, the more they will begin to see you as an adult. Try to avoid asking your parents for things if you can including advice, money, and stuff. If you have a problem, try your best to solve it on your own before going straight to your parents.Of course, sometimes it may be necessary to turn to your parents for help. If your parents do give you something or help you to solve a problem, be gracious and thank them for their help.
 Keep in mind that although you may behave like an adult and even be a legal adult, your parents may always view you as a kid because you are their child. Try your best to focus on yourself and not to be so concerned about what your parents think of you. Remember that your opinion of yourself is what matters the most.

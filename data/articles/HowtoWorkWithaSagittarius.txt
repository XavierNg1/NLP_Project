 Think about it, Sagittariuses are like, the symbol of freedom, if you give them strong demands, you're pretty much screwed. Because Sagittariuses LOVE freedom. It's one of their main traits. So tell them nicely.;
, Sagittariuses are full of fun and love adventure, they're very social and if you're iffy and uncomfortable around them, you could either send the wrong message and make them think negatively about you, or they may want to try to get to know you more, and show you that they can be your friend, when they may be your friend the whole time!

, We all understand it's work, hopefully the Sagittarius at your job does too. If you're boring, you'll bore them, Sagittariuses need to be occupied or they'll move on to the next one. They like to have fun and be free.
 Sagittariuses usually have a sense of humor, and if you can't make them laugh, they won't enjoy being around you. You need to be able to handle their humor and bluntness, they joke around a lot, you should be able to laugh with them.
 Sagittariuses aren't normally negative people, and if you're negative all day it'll drive them away from you. Which could make it difficult to work with them. Also, it's always nice to be positive.
 Sagittariuses enjoy being involved in team work, although sometimes they could be a know-it-all. They're great to work with, and they enjoy being able to work with people. Like I said, their social.

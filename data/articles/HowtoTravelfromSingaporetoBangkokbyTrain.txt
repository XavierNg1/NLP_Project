 The main Bangkok station that has trains going south is called Hualamphong station.;
, Once you cross into Malaysia you will exit the train and go through immigration and customs. Be sure to check "in transit" through Malaysia. The train from Bangkok leaves at 2:45pm and takes about 23 hours. It costs about 1,100 Baht for a second class sleeper. This is a wide seat facing another seat that later converts to an upper and lower berth.
 Tickets can be purchased the day of travel, but often only the upper berths are left. They are left because they are not comfortable usually.
 The ticket office in KL is easy to find since everything is in Malay and English. The KL station looks like a nice airport.
 An 8:30am train, 2:30pm, and 10:30pm. If the train is not late (which is unlikely), the 8:30 would be most timely. If you have a long layover, at least 4 hours, you can catch the Light Rail train from inside the KL Sentral station to KLCC station which is the Petronas towers. The tallest buildings in the world.
 The day trips are on regular trains with two seats. There will be a movie (an old TV and crappy VCR at both ends of the cars) and they will be in English. You will pass through customs around Johor Bahru.
 It will save large amounts of money due to the exchange rate of the RM to the Sing Dollar.
 They go all the way through. Use the trains because buses often break down and customs/immigration takes much longer. Plus, the buses claim to have bathrooms, which they do, but no one can use them. Once a passenger used the bathroom for "sitting" purposes and had to clean it out himself after the trip.

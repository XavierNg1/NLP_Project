 A fun game to play is getting all your dolls and some clothes and other things like fake food in a closet. Pretend you're on a train with your children (AG dolls) going to another country.
 For example, if you have Samantha Parkington, pretend you are from 1904. If you have Julie Albright, pretend you are from 1976. If you have Kit, pretend you're from 1934. If you have an American Girl of Today/My American Girl/Just Like You doll/Truly Me, pick a random time period and dress up your doll like they would back then.
 Make them the narrators, and post often.
 Make a story about anything you like. You and your doll could be the main characters. Either role play it or write it down as a short story. You could publish it on the blog if you like.
, Give her a microphone and have her sing her heart out. Build mini drums and guitars for the rest of the band. Drums can be made from bottle lids and guitars from cardboard and markers (or print out guitar shapes and glue them to cardboard).
 If you have some paints, have your doll do a sitting and paint her portrait. Hang it in your room––or in her room if you have made her one.

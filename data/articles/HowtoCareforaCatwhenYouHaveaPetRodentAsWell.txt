 These may include, mice, rats, hamsters, etc. Cats usually like to eat mice and rats. If you have one of these as a pet, your cat may want to catch it.;
,, Still, you should get a strong cage and medication.
 For hamsters, try not to get a cage that doesn't have strong wires or walls.
 If you do have bedding that does that, either find another bedding that doesn't or just make it not stick out by pushing it in so the cat can't reach. If the cat does reach it, it could get extremely sick if he/she chewed or ate a piece. Rodents do their business on it.
 This can get your cat sick. Make sure your cat doesn't have any diseases either, or it may get the rodent sick if they are very close to it.
 You may not have time to do it every single time, so tell someone else to do it, or move the cage where the cat cannot reach it completely.
 Make sure you tell them exactly what to do. Consider letting someone that is good at caring for cats and rodents or two pets at the same time to do it.
 Give your cat its favorite toy, or teach it its favorite tricks.


Do not distract the rodent, because the cat will get close to the rodent while it's playing, and the rodent can't do anything about it if it's in its cage. When the cat is distracted, the rodent won't have to do anything but mind its own business.
 Try feeding it something it usually likes to eat, like a small snack of meat. Don't feed too much, though.
 This is a method for dogs, but you never know. You can also give your cat a treat to distract it, but only at least 1 or 2 treats a day.

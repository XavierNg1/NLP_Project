 Use a tool, like a knife or awl, to poke a small hole in the ends of plastic eggs. Feed fishing line through the holes in these eggs to string the eggs up and create hanging tree ornaments. Tie the end of the fishing line to a branch to hang the ornament.Tie a simple knot at the bottom end of your hanging tree ornaments to prevent the eggs from falling off the line. Be sure the knot is thick enough to prevent eggs from falling.
Hang several of these ornaments from trees throughout your yard. Avoid areas thick with branches; when the wind blows, your ornaments might get tangled.
If you live in a windy area, you might want to keep your hanging tree ornaments roughly the length of your forearm. Otherwise, the wind might whip the ornaments around dangerously.;

You can often find baskets like these at dollar stores, general retailers, thrift stores, and craft stores.
The baskets donâ€™t have to be plastic, but they should be made of a weather resistant material.

Use markers or paint to color the top, leafy part of the carrot bright green. There should only be a small orange part of the carrot visible.Use a fastener, like tape or a tack, to attach your carrot to a wall on the outside of your home so that the carrot is close to the ground.

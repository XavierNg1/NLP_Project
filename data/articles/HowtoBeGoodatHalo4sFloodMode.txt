 You do not want to start with the Hardlight Shield. It is useless against Flood because it is very easy to sidestep.;
, Put a couple shots in the Flood to get a kill or an assist to get you more points.
 Here is a good list of camping spots for almost every map.


Abandon: Spawn spot by lift for LMS (Last Man Standing) or middle of map by lift for kills.
Adrift: By the pillars at the end of the hall.
Complex: On roof in the middle of map or in room below roof.
Solace: In bases by spawn spots.
 This step is tricky. The Flood has super high jumping and lunging, but also can use Thruster Pack or camo. Be sure to get your timings down!

, I know everyone says this, but the more you play, the better you'll get.
 Don't run in the middle of the map or take out your pistol in close range or you will die. Have self-control unless you are going for a Killian aire.
 If you are Last Man Standing, you get 15 points!

, Don't play Halo all day because you need to get a breath of fresh air. Good Luck

, Thruster pack is good for fast-paced players, vision lets you see where the humans are, and camo helps you sneak.
 When your reticle turns red, press shoot and you will lunge. If you happen to miss, sidestep their shot and try again. Also remember you can swing your sword while thrusting.
 Make them waste their ammo and then go in for the kill.
 Crouch pressing B, then you are invisible to the human radar. Camo is recommended if you use this tactic.
 Don't rage quit if you keep getting killed. Halo is supposed to be fun and not to be mastered right away.

 This is the only way to design a usable outfit. Remember, this template can also be used to make pants.


Do not change the template itself, unless it is the design of the clothing. The file will not be able to process into the outfit.
 This is where you start changing the design.


If there is an option to add layers, use that opportunity to create a colour guide. This will help you to put the right texture or design into the right box.
Later on you must remove that extra layer.
 Avoid colouring outside the lines - use a selection tool or bucket for that.


Remember, ROBLOX folds up the net of patterns so it is essential that you arrange the designs in the correct position.
Make your design unique.
You can copy, paste and resize images into the boxes. Be accurate and careful.
Do not spend little time on the design, as the result may either look ridiculous or not work.
Save your design before exiting!
Remember to remove that colour guide layer completely.

Click on "choose file". Select the template you have saved and edited.
Name your design. Avoid using misleading names as your design may be on the catalog.
Click upload. Enjoy your new design! You may choose to place it in the catalog, put up with a price.

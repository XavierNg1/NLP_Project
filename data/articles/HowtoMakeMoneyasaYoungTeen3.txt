 Selling sweets or chewing gum at school can make quite a bit of money. If you have a dollar or pound store in town, buy a few packs of gum (multipacks) and go to school and ask people if they would like to buy a stick or pack of gum and that could get you a tidy profit. Some schools frown upon selling on school grounds, so make sure you are up to date with school rules., Selling old clothes will make you money. Find some old things that you don't use anymore and post a picture and a price on social media or eBay. You can also ask your family to organize a yard sale so everyone in the family can make some money!

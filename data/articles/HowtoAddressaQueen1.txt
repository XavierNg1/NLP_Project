 According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like.Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms. Stay sincere, and do not use the formal terms below if they make you uncomfortable.;
, At the top of your letter, write "Madam," skip a line, and start writing your letter on the line below it. This is the formal and traditional term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.
 The traditional written conclusion is I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant, followed by your name.If you find this conclusion distasteful due to the declaration of servitude, or the insertion of the letter u in honour, consider one of the following respectful conclusions instead:


With greatest respect,
Yours faithfully,
Yours sincerely,

, On the envelope, write the following postal address, using the last line only if you are mailing the letter from outside the UK:


The Queen
Buckingham Palace
London SW1A 1AA
United Kingdom

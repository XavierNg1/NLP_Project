 Confidence is essential to good free throw shooting. Practicing the tips listed below can help improve confidence, and ultimately help you become the free throw shooter that you have wanted to be.;
, The keys to good form are flexing your legs, getting a good flick from your wrist to allow backspin (this gives you a higher chance of your shot to roll in if it hits the rim), to get your shoulders back, and to turn your feet toward your off hand, aligning your shooting hip, shoulder, and elbow to the basket.
 Most basketball gyms have a little black dot on the free throw line. Place your dominate foot on it and then put your other foot one or two inches back.
 The most common is three dribbles, but you should make one that fits your shot.
, Your feet should be on their tip toes or an inch or two in the air.
, If you don't, your shot could become inconsistent. Keep practicing.

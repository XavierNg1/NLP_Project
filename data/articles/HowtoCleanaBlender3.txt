 If your blender blades are still dirty after you blend dish soap and clean the carafe, then you may need to wash them separately. Remove the blender jug from the base, and then unscrew the blades from the bottom of the blender jug. Hand-wash them with dish soap and hot water. Scrub with a sponge or toothbrush to remove tough bits.
 Remove the blades from the blender jug. Then, submerge them in water with one of two polident tablets. The polident should clear up any tough stains.If you don't want to remove the blades, you can always just clean them in the carafe. Pour in enough hot water to cover the blades, and then drop in two tablets of polident. Let soak for at least half an hour.
Polident is a commercial tooth-whitening and antibacterial agent. You should be able to find the tablets in drugstores and grocery stores.
 When you're putting the blades back into the blender, take a moment to care for the gasket: the rubber piece that separates the jug from the base. Pour a tablespoon of olive oil or vegetable oil over the gasket to make sure that it remains flexible.

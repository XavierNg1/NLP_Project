 When you are using an app when a text message is received, your device will show you the text notification at the top of your screen with the sender’s name and the message content.
 A text field will appear where you can type in your response.
 Tap on the field and enter your reply. Tap the green arrow in the text field to send the reply when you’re done.


You can also send a quick voice message by tapping the “Record” option at the right.

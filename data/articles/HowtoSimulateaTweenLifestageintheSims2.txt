 It is recommended making a teenage sim by merging DNA though.;
, Look for something that looks natural and not flashy. The average pre-teen fixes their hair in a matter of minutes in the morning, so look for the simplest hair style possible.
 This is not necessary, but if you must, don't apply loads of mascara or lipstick/balm/gloss. This will give them a more natural look, like the affect created with a simple hair style. It is recommend to use blush. Make sure it's not too dark, it should look like the tween has rosy cheeks, not like an old lady going to church.
 Clothing can be hard to choose when you are creating a tween. It is recommended to choose something that doesn't accentuate their curves or upper body. Tween girls are still flat chested and straight. Look for something that's not too grown up, or too babyish.


Stay away from baby blues and baby pinks, lavenders, and dresses unless a formal outfit. Clothing is supposed to match your girl's personality, so choose accordingly.
 Remember, if your sim seems too teen-like or even too child-like, try to go back and see what else could work to make them seem the right age.

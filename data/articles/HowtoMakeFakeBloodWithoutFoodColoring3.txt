 You can also easily make homemade red dye from raspberries, which you can combine with thickeners to make fake blood. To begin, place 1 cup (236.59 ml) of fresh or frozen raspberries in a blender, then blend until liquefied.It should take around 15-20 seconds to blend the strawberries. Add a teaspoon (4.93 ml) or so of water if the mixture is too thick.
 After the raspberries have blended, strain them by placing a fine strainer over a bowl, then pouring the liquefied raspberries into the strainer.The strainer should catch the seeds and chunks of the raspberries and let the liquid pass through. You should be left with about ½ cup (118.3 ml) of raspberry juice.
Dispose of the raspberry pulp or use it in baking if you wish.
 In another medium-sized mixing bowl, combine 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of corn starch and 1/3 cup (78.8 ml) of warm water. Use a spoon to rapidly mix the ingredients to make a paste., Measure out 2/3 cup (157.7 ml) of corn syrup and pour it into the bowl with the cornstarch paste. Use a spoon to mix the corn syrup in with the paste., Add around 4 teaspoons (59.14 ml) of raspberry juice into the corn syrup mixture, mixing to integrate the color. Add more if the color isn’t opaque enough.You may need to add up to a few tablespoons of raspberry juice, depending how dark you want your blood.
 After you add in your raspberry juice, you should be left with a reddish pink liquid the consistency of blood. To give the blood a more realistic color, add around 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of powdered cocoa. This will darken the blood to a dark red and give it a more realistic hue.,

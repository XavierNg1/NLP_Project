 Pull all of your clothes from your wardrobe and lay them out on your bed. Organize the clothing by type and place them into piles. This will allow you to easily sort through your clothing while you decide what to keep and what to throw away.


Wash and dry any dirty clothing. If half of your wardrobe is dirty, you won’t be able to properly sort through your wardrobe.
 If a piece of clothing has large stains or irreparable tears, throw it away. Be realistic about what you can and can’t fix. Small tears in seams can be easily repaired, but larger holes are harder to mend. If the job is too advanced for your sewing skills, consider throwing the clothing away.


Don’t donate torn or stained clothing. The volunteers who receive the donation will have to trash them anyway.
If expensive clothing is damaged, see a tailor. However, less expensive damaged clothing may not be worth the cost of the repairs., Sort through your undamaged clothing to find items to donate. Be harsh with yourself and remember that you’re trying to reduce the amount of clothing that you wear. Place donated clothing in large clean plastic bags and take them to your local clothing donation center. While sorting, ask yourself:


”If I was shopping right now, would I buy this?””Have I worn this in the past two years?”
”Is this piece of clothing too small or two big?”
”Do I feel good when I wear this?”

, Any seasonal or sentimental items can be stored away until they’re needed. This will help clear up wardrobe space for other items or organizational tools. Bins of packed clothing can be stored under your bed, in a storage closet, or above your wardrobe.


Delicate items such as silk or cashmere should be wrapped in tissue paper and stored in canvas storage bags.
Regular clothing can be folded and stacked in large plastic bins.
Only store clean clothes.

 Older baseball caps are great collector’s items, but it’s sometimes hard to tell what they are made of or how to best care for them. Generally, you can wash older caps with a mixture of a little detergent and cool water. However, use a cloth to dab a bit of the mixture on the hat in an inconspicuous spot (like the inside of the band) before starting.








If the color of the hat comes off on the cloth or seems to run, don’t clean the cap yourself. Either take it to a professional cleaner or leave it as-is.
If the color seems to hold, you can clean the cap with water and detergent.
 Older caps tend to be more delicate, so you don’t want to dunk them into water. Instead, use a clean soft cloth or an old toothbrush dipped in a mixture of cool water and a small amount of detergent to gently spot clean any areas that are dirty. 








Once the grime has been lifted off, dip your cloth in clear, cool water and dab at the cap to remove the detergent.
 Lay the cap on top of a rounded object like a soccer ball or honeydew melon. Look for something that is approximately head sized. Leave the cap alone until it has thoroughly dried.

Price your item based on its condition and the current eBay market. List it in your eBay store or put it up for auction with a "Buy It Now" option only.
Alternatively, you can sell Christmas items at auction with a low starting bid and let them go to high bidder. You can also list a higher starting bid or choose a reserve price that is near or equal to an item's low-end market price.



Keep shipping time in mind. Shipping is slower as it gets closer to the holiday season and the volume of packages being moved increases.
Run seven-day auctions during November, to give your merchandise maximum exposure, and three- or five-day auctions in December to get the merchandise to customers faster.
 If you are not positive an item will sell, wait until it's purchased to package it. Because of the increased volume of packages, shipping damage increases around the holidays.
 When you are selling Christmas merchandise close to the holiday, customer satisfaction is largely dependent on how fast you can get items to your customers.

 Scoop the flesh of the avocado out of its peel with a spoon. In a mixing bowl, use a fork to mash the avocado into mush.


You can mash cubes or slices of avocado, as well, but using scooped avocado may make things a bit easier.






Use the back, flat sides of the tines or prongs when mashing an avocado with a fork.






Note that a potato masher can be used to mash avocado, as well.
 If you would prefer a smooth, puree spread, blend the avocado in a food processor on a low speed for 30 seconds or so.


Do not puree the avocado too long. If you do, you may end up with liquified avocado instead of mashed avocado.
 Avocado spread makes a healthy, tasty choice for whole-grain breads of all varieties.


In addition to using plain bread, you can also use avocado spread on toast, bagels, waffles, and English muffins.
 If the taste of avocado alone leaves you less than impressed, you can top the spread with a few complementary tastes. Examples include:


Cucumber slices
Kiwi slices
Tomato slices
Feta cheese
Poached egg
Red pepper flakes
Salsa

, If you want a healthier condiment, slather avocado spread onto any sandwich or burger you would usually use mayo on. Notably appetizing choices include:


Turkey sandwiches
Club sandwiches
Chicken breast sandwiches
Soy burgers

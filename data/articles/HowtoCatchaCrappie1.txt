 Crappie are freshwater fish that are abundant in the wild and stocked in many ponds and lakes in the United States and Canada. They're originally from North America, but they can be found in many countries across the world at this point. Black crappie and white crappie are virtually indistinguishable, and many anglers don't notice the difference.;
, Crappie like to spend time around cover, and brush piles and treetops, fallen logs, or other debris piles are a great place to look for them.


You can actually build a brush shelter for crappie as a way to attract them to a certain part of the lake. Carry large branches and sticks to an area of the lake with no other shelter nearby, then let it fall to the bottom. Take note of the spot; chances are, next time you visit, crappie will be hanging out nearby.
Sometimes crappie like to hang out in the water between branches and sticks, rather than next to them. Some of the largest fish may spend time in the crevices of a fallen tree branch. Skilled anglers can fish in these crevices.
 When there's no natural covering in the water, crappie will gather near these human-made structures. This is a good place to look for those who are fishing from the dock, rather than from a boat.
 Crappie spend time in deep water areas that have some kind of covering, like underwater brush or sunken wood. Finding a place where other fishermen rarely fish is key for finding large fish.

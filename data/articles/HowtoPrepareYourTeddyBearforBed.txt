 Teddy might like to have dinner before you or with you, depending on what works for you. Give the bear something healthy and nutritious.;
, This step is optional. You could make banana splits, ice cream sundaes and the like. And find some strawberries because all bears love strawberries (or other berries).
 Use a dry bath container and a dry face washer.
 It's easier if the bear has pyjamas. If not, don't worry -- you can get a clean, old sock and cut holes on the bottom to stick the bear's legs through.
, Some drinks include tea, hot cocoa, or any other beverage you and you teddy like. Consume with a plate of cookies, if that's okay (or apple slices). Wipe the foam from the bear's mouth when finished; because no one likes a sticky muzzle.


Take the bear to the bathroom after a drink.
 Get your bear a toothbrush or you could share one.
 You could read any book you like. If it is a long book, read one chapter every night.


Talk to the bear. Read or tell the bear a story, brush its fur. Just talk about the day.
 This could be its own bed or your bed. Make sure the bear is cozy in bed. Maybe it would like a mini teddy or a toy to sleep with. And keep the bear warm. Blankets are nice and warm.
 Say "Goodnight, I love you" like your parents do to you. Also comfort your bear. Say something like "see you in the morning gorgeous!" Let your bear know it's just bedtime and you'll be there in the morning.
 Make sure you're in a comfortable position too and that you have lots of blankets to stay warm. If you or the bear have a nightmare, just talk about what you want to do together the next day. Don't forget to cuddle!

 This is annoying to most and people will most certainly block you/lock you out of their dens. Begging for rares from a friend may make them want to delete you.

Try to buy Monday rares. They may seem to lack value at first, but don't worry! They will gain value with time.
Trading with other players. Trading is an awesome way to get anything! Be sure to know the item's rarity level if you'd like, and always use the trade system, in order to avoid being scammed no matter how interesting the offer seems, PRINCIPALLY if it means you're getting overtraded: "Send me your Rare Fox Hat and I will send you Non Rare Headdress!", for example. After all, unless such trade cannot be done through the trade system (which already sounds fishy on itself, doesn't it?), there's no reason why not to use it!
Participate on Adventures! Please note that not every adventure will lead you to a rare. There are no guarantees you'll get rares everytime, good or not, on an adventure. You can still get non store-bought items or betas, which is good, you just need to give your best - and a little luck helps too!
NEVER scam to get rares!;

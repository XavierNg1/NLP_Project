 Very lightly sprinkle salt, pepper and any herbs you might like over the inside of your squash. (Sage is particularly nice with winter squash.) Some also prefer to brush the surface with olive oil or butter before seasoning.
 This will keep the squash from drying out.
 Bake squash for 45 minutes to an hour, or until you can easily stick a fork through the flesh and skin.
 There are many possibilities for your squash; take a bite and see if it inspires you.









Eat your squash as is. Many people throw away the skins of winter squashes, but they are actually edible once softened; if you like the texture of your squash skin, garnish and serve the whole thing as a side dish.
Stuff the squash. This may require you to make additional space by scraping out some of the squash flesh; only do this enough to enlarge the cavity, then mix the scooped flesh in with the stuffing, then reinsert the stuffing mix into the squash.
Scrape the flesh from the skin with a spoon and place it into a bowl. Mash it with butter, salt, and pepper and serve it hot. For an additional flair, serve it inside its own skin.

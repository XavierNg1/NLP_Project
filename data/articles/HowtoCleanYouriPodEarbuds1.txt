 Liquids can damage your device. This is especially true if they get into the earbud jack or the charging port. Place your iPod in a safe place away from the cleaning area.;
, A regular-sized needle will do the trick. Soak the needle in a small bowl of rubbing alcohol for a few minutes. This will clean the needle, as well as kill any lingering germs on the surface.

, Move the pointed edge of the needle along the sides where the mesh meets the plastic. You'll see earwax and dirt begin to rise up. As it accumulates, either tap it onto a napkin or blow it into the garbage can. Keep doing this until all wax and dirt have been removed./images/thumb/d/dd/Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-3-Version-4.jpg

Apple earbuds made after September 2012 have smaller sound holes on the side of each earbud. Don't overlook them in the cleaning process.
 Glide the side of the needle across the surface. Don't apply too much pressure or poke the pointed edge into the mesh. You could damage your earbud or push gunk beneath the surface of the mesh./images/thumb/9/9b/Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-4-Version-4.jpg

, Dip the swab into the alcohol. Move it around the plastic portion that goes in your ear. Allow the buds to air dry. This should take no longer than a few minutes./images/thumb/5/5a/Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-5.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-Your-iPod-Earbuds-Step-5.jpg

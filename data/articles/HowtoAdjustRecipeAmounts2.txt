Reducing the amount produced by a recipe is handled in much the same way as increasing it, only you're working with lesser amounts of each ingredient. First read the recipe through and figure out by how much you need to reduce the recipe. If the recipe produces enough for 4 and you only want sufficient for 2, then you'd cut it in half, and so on.



If possible, make your recipe amount conversions in pencil beside the actual recipe. If a recipe calls for 1 cup (240 ml) of flour, then you should write in 1/2 cup (120 ml) flour. Continue this through the whole list of ingredients and amounts including spices. If the recipe calls for 1 egg and you're dividing your recipe in half, still use 1 egg. Lower the amount of other liquid in the recipe by 2 tbsp. (30 ml) for each half egg that you're rounding up.



Scaling a recipe down means that you will need fewer ingredients. This holds true for the main ingredients such as proteins, vegetables and starches. Make a list of the amounts of each ingredient you need after scaling the recipe.

Prepare the recipe. The directions will remain the same but cooking times may need to be adjusted to allow for a smaller batch. Anything prepared for the oven will take less time. If dividing your recipe in half, also cut the cooking time in half. Check frequently to ensure you're not overcooking the recipe.

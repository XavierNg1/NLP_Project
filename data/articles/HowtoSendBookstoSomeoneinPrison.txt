 See if there is any information online regarding restrictions, sending information, packaging information, or a mailing address for the prison. If you are in contact with the prisoner you would like to send books to, he or she may also have information for you.;
, The address label must list the name and ID number for the prisoner, the name of the prison, and the prison's mailing address, which is either the location of the prison or a PO Box.
 Many prisons have regulations limiting number of books that can be sent, restricting books with sex scenes, not allowing used books, or not allowing hardcover books. These restrictions vary from state to state and even prison to prison, so be sure to check first. If there are none present, look for a telephone number to call or email address to email the prison.
 Consider finding out the following:


Explain that you would like to send books to a prisoner
Explain who you are and your relationship with the prisoner
Explain what the books are
Ask if this is permitted and if so, what restrictions are in place, if any
Confirm a postal address and any packaging requirements

,, There are still several options to consider:


Write to an association that helps prisoners, such as the Prisoner's Literature Project, being sure to include the name, location, and ID number of the prisoner in your letter.
Contact any educational institution that is in contact with and aids prisoners
Ask the prisoner you are sending books to for more information on restrictions or which vendors they may know are authorized.

 Most shoes will stretch out on their own, especially if they are made out of leather. If the shoe is just a little too snug and not painful to wear, consider wearing it around the house a few times. It will eventually loosen up and become more comfortable.


Keep in mind that this will only loosen the shoe in the toe area. It won't work to make the shoe longer.
 Spray the inside of the shoes with rubbing alcohol until they are damp.Place them onto your feet and wear them until they dry. The wet material will stretch to the shape of your foot, and it will keep that shape once it dries.


This method is best for stretching shoes in the toe area. It is not good for lengthening shoes.This method works best on shoes made from canvas, leather, and microfiber.
If you have very sensitive skin, consider diluting the rubbing alcohol with some water first. You can also use just plain water.
Consider doing a spot test first. Some materials do not react well with rubbing alcohol., Dampen the entire shoe with water, then pack the inside firmly with newspaper. Leave the shoes stuffed like this for 24 hours. Dampen them every four to eight hours, as needed. Let the shoes dry fully before you take the newspaper out and try them on.


If you are worried about the ink staining your shoe, you can use a paper bag or butcher paper instead.
You can also use olive oil, Goo Gone, or even petroleum jelly (Vaseline), but keep in mind that these may stain your shoe. Use the oil only once during the 24 hour period.
 A professional will use his or her tools and experience to stretch your shoes until they fit. Usually, shoe stretching costs between $10 and $25, but this also depends on the shoe cobbler's experience. Keep in mind that shoes can only be stretched so muchâ€”about half a size.

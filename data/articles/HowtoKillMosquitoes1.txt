 You can purchase a high-volume fan which sucks air in rather than out when compared to traditional fans from a home improvement store or a department store. Choose one with a metal frame, since you'll be using magnets in this trap. With this and a few other supplies, you can create a trap that will reduce the number of mosquitoes around at least in the short term. Its effect on long-term populations is unknown, but following the advice in the breeding prevention section as well is recommended.If you are trapping mosquitoes in your yard, you may need a long extension cord as well, so you can plug the fan into an indoor outlet.;
, Cover the front of the fan completely with a length of fine, insect-proof, metal mesh. Use several strong zip ties








, Whenever an area is overrun with mosquitoes, turn on the fan and let it run for at least a few hours. There will usually be a noticeable reduction in the number of mosquitoes for a day or two, although whether this translates to a long-term reduction is unclear.
 Mix an equal amount of 70% isopropyl alcohol and water into a spray bottle. Spray the solution (alcohol and water) on the screen to kill them, avoiding the central fan motor.You can now leave the screen of dead mosquitoes outside to feed other animals, or shake them into an exterior trash can. The screen is reusable.










Consider picking moths or other non-mosquito insects off the screen before spraying.

 To feel secure, kids need quality time, attention, and love from their parents. Make it a priority to bond with your kids during the times your PTSD symptoms aren’t severe.A few simple ways to stay close to your kids include helping them with their homework, playing board games with them, and taking them to a movie or the park.
Don’t mistake practicality for being a good parent. For instance, cooking a healthy dinner every night can’t replace talking with your kids on a regular basis.
 Tell your kids they can come to you if they need anything or want to talk. Help them find other ways to cope with their feelings, too, such as journaling or drawing.Set a good example by talking about your own feelings. When parents with PTSD hide their emotions, their kids may feel like they have to do the same thing. It is important to be a good role model for your kids.
 Sometimes, parents with PTSD unintentionally pass on their symptoms to their kids. Educate yourself on how to recognize secondary PTSD, and be alert for any symptoms in your own children.Your child might pick up some PTSD symptoms from you if you over-share about your trauma or show your fear frequently. They might also start imitating your symptoms as a way of feeling closer to you.
Secondary PTSD can’t always be prevented, so don’t blame yourself if you think your child might have it.
If your child is showing signs of secondary PTSD, make them an appointment with a therapist.

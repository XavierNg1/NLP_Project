 Draw 2 irregular shapes overlapping each other (as shown). Think of the face as an irregular heart. Add vertical and horizontal lines on his face to serve as your guidelines for later.;
, Draw eyes, big eyebrows and a mane. To draw fur and the lion’s mane, draw zigzag lines over the outlines of the shapes from the previous step.
 Draw horns, ears and other details on his face. A good way to do this is to add more lines to emphasize his shagginess. Finish off by adding a ribbon to his mane.
 Begin with the tailcoat and then add his hands. Don't forget claws!

, Add a dress shirt and vest covered by an oversized handkerchief. Don’t forget to draw his brooch.
 Before you go into detail, draw his legs by drawing only the silhouette of his pants, tail and feet.
 Sketch lines to emphasize the folds on his pants and the fur on his legs and tail. Also add a trim on his pants and claws on his feet.
 Erase pencil lines to clean up your drawing.
 Remember that his eyes are blue and his fur a mix of yellow and brown.

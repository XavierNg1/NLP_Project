 One of the most common run-on sentences is a comma splice.A comma splice is two independent clauses that are only separated by a comma, such as in the following example:


“Ice cream is very tasty, I like it.”;
, You will also need to capitalize the letter following the added punctuation. End punctuation like periods or exclamation points work best if the ideas are separate. For example:


“Ice cream is very tasty. I like it.”

, Coordinating conjunctions are words meant specifically for connecting parts of a sentence. These words include: “and,” “but,” “for,” “yet,” “nor,” “so,” and “or.”They all work a little differently.


“And” shows that the two sentences are similar, meaning the second one is in addition to the first.
“But” shows the second sentence is contradictory.
“Yet” can also mean “in addition” or “even so.”
“Or” presents two possible choices.
“Nor” presents two impossible options. It also negates, like “but.”
“So” means “therefore,” while “for” is saying that a reason for the first part of the sentence will follow.
In our example, “and” makes the most sense to connect the sentences: “Ice cream is very tasty, and I like it.”

, Semi-colons work well if the ideas are closely related, and a conjunction doesn’t make as much sense. A semi-colon works fine in this situation, especially since conjunctions can change the meaning of the two sentences:


“Ice cream is very tasty; I like it.” Normally, you don’t use a capital letter after the semi-colon, but in this case, we of course have to capitalize the word ‘I’.
 For instance, you shouldn’t write: “I like pie, however, I like ice cream more.”


“However” is not sufficient to connect the sentences. Use one of the above methods to fix it: “I like pie. However, I like ice cream more.”'

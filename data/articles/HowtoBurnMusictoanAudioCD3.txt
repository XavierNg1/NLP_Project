 If you do not want to use iTunes or WMP, there is a plethora of third-party software out there. Perhaps you are dedicated to open-source software or just prefer the feature set of another media player, or maybe you don’t use your computer for music listening and have no need for a media player at all.


When downloading any software, it is always best to get it from the original developer website. This helps to ensure that the installer has not been tampered with or loaded with extra software or malware. If a developer does not host the file for download on their own site, there is usually a list of trusted mirrors to use instead.
 VLC Media Player and Foobar2000 are two free media players that are popular for their speed, customizability, and broad codec (filetype) support. Since these programs are still media players, the process of burning an Audio CD will be very similar to using WMP or iTunes.


Foobar2000 is for windows only.
 InfraRecorder and IMGBurn are two free, no-nonsense burning programs for those who do not need playback support. These programs boast a more comprehensive array of burning options, like mixed mode, which allows user to create hybrid audio/data CDs.


Because these programs support more complex burning features, this options is recommended for more advanced users or those who really don’t want the extra weight of a media player.
Both InfraRecorder and IMGBurn are Windows-only. “Burn” is a strong, simple option for Mac users.

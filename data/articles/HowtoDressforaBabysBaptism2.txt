 Pick out either a sport coat or suit that looks good while also being relatively comfortable. While some baptisms may be more casual than others, if you are unsure about how dressy the event is, go for a suit. If you want to skip the sport coat, you can also generally wear a nice dress shirt and tie paired with some killer slacks., Baptisms are a happy occasion and your tie should reflect that. This doesn’t mean you should break out that tie covered in cartoon characters for the occasion. However, ties in light colors and fun patterns are definitely acceptable. Make sure your tie matches with the rest of your outfit’s color scheme.
 Shoes are an important part of every outfit--particularly an outfit that involves a suit. Ditch the sneakers and wear some dress shoes. Before the big day, buff your shoes up to give them a bit of shine.
 If you’re going to a party or reception after the baptism and really can’t stand being in a suit for very long, you could bring a change of clothes that still look nice but are more comfortable than a suit. An appropriate change of clothes would consist of a nice polo and some ironed khakis.

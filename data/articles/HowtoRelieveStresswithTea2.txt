 You can also use some of your brewed chamomile tea in a facial mask. Place 1/2 cup of quick oats, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 tablespoon of honey in a mixing bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the tea and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes. Spread the chamomile mixture over your face and leave it on for 5 minutes before rinsing it off with cool water.Avoid storing the chamomile face mask. It should be used as soon as you mix it up since the oats will begin to soften immediately.
 Place 1/8 of a cup of green tea leaves, 1/4 of a cup of dried lemon balm, and 2 teaspoons of dried peppermint into a large basin. Carefully pour boiling water into the bowl and drape a towel behind your head. Bend over so that you're about 12 inches away from the water and the towel is draped over your head and the bowl. Close your eyes, relax and breathe in the vapors for 5 to 10 minutes.If the tea is no longer steaming, simply reheat it until it steams and continue to breathe in the vapors. You can do this repeatedly until the water evaporates.
 If you'd rather create a pleasing aroma to fill your space, use tea in an aromatherapy oil warmer. All you need to do is place dried tea or herbs (like peppermint, passion flowers, or lavender) in the top of the oil warmer. Light the candle underneath it so the heat releases the scent of the tea over time.You won't need to use oil or traditional essential oils in the warmer when you use dried tea.

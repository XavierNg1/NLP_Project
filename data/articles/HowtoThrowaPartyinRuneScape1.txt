 Some level 126 didn't throw a party in just 1 second and made everyone leave happy. Make sure that you have enough time to throw the party, and what the theme should be like (dance, armor, drop, etc).;
, OK members, this should be easy for you. If you have a POH (player owned house), you can throw it there. Members can stop reading here. But if you are a free player, keep reading. Good places to throw parties in RuneScape for free players are:


Falador Party Room
Blue Moon Inn
Blue Moon Inn Basement
HAM Headquarters
Up stairs of Varrock Palace

, What's a party without invitations? Also, for bigger success, tell them to also invite their friends! This should get you lots of people!

, You can't party if you don't start the party. About an hour before the party, make sure you have everything done (preparations, homework, dinner, etc).

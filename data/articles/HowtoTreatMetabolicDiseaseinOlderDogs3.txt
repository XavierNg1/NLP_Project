 When your older dog has a metabolic disease, it may have a harder time obtaining nutrients from its food. As you treat your dog for its metabolic disease, feed it a healthy diet. A healthy diet will provide your dog with the nutrients it needs in the right proportions.


Important nutrients in dog food are carbohydrates, fat, high-quality proteins, and vitamins and minerals.
Nutritional needs vary with the different metabolic diseases.
As you choose between diets, look for the ones that have an Association of American Feed Control Officials label. This label ensures the diet is nutritionally complete and balanced.Work with your vet to determine how much food your dog needs each day. Do not give your dog more and more food simply because it begs for it!

, Daily exercise is important for any dog. If your dog has a metabolic disease, exercise can help it stay as healthy as possible. The exercise does not have to be strenuous, though. A few leisurely walks each day would be adequate, especially if your dog’s metabolic disease makes it feel tired or weak.


Addison’s disease causes low levels of cortisol, which means a dog cannot handle stress very well.Intense exercise can be stressful, so engage in low-intensity exercises if your dog has Addison’s disease.
Exercise can also help with weight control, which is important for older, overweight dogs with diabetes or hypothyroidism.
 Stress is a big problem for dogs with Addison’s disease because their cortisol levels are so low. Along with giving medication to increase your dog’s cortisol levels, you will need to keep its stress at a minimum.Identify stressful situations for your dog and try to keep your dog out of those situations:Changes in daily routine: keep your dog’s routine predictable from day to day
House guests: put your dog in a quiet, calm area away from house guests
Boarding: consider having a pet sitter come to the house, rather than boarding your dog

 Stitch them, using a 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) seam allowance. Unlike the usual sewing project, the wrong sides are together so that the seams will be visible on top of the squares.









You are welcome to use a smaller seam, but that will result in less of a fraying effect.
 Continue until you have reached the width that you want for your quilt. Remember to keep it wrong side up!









Machine sewing is usually the fastest and best way to quickly and simply quilt these blocks.
Using a walking foot will help the fabric be more stable so tucks and puckers don't occur.
 Do this until you have used all the squares, which should be enough for the length you want for your quilt.









Always sew with the raw seam towards the top of the quilt. It is a good idea to sew the seams open as this will reduce the bulk of sewing over seams that are turned to one side.
 Again, keep the wrong sides of the fabric together. Sometimes it's a hard habit to break!









After you have sewn all your strips together, sew an inch inside the outer border all around the quilt.
 You can also speed up the process by pulling cross threads out of the squares.









Take scissors to the edges of your fraying seams to give it a uniform, ruffled edge.
Pop it in the dryer! This will help the seams become soft and fluffy.

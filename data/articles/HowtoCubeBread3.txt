 Tear your bread into small pieces, trying to keep them as close to one-inch squares as possible. Although the edges will be somewhat jagged and uneven, you still want the cubes to be the same basic size.
 When you tear, tear all of the crust first before moving onto the inside of the bread. This will help keep the bread pieces the same basic size, and will give you a better idea if you are getting off track.
 One easy way to keep your bread cubes the same size is to use the pad of your thumb as a measuring tool. Press your thumb against the bread and tear around the width of your thumb.
 To give yourself a better chance of uniformity, aim for 16-18 cubes per piece of bread. Like knife cubing, you can do multiple pieces of bread at once to save time.

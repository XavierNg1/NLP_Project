 Start the search by using a local phone book to look up a name and address. Many people and businesses can be found listed with their phone number and address. You can also use the phone number to contact the person to verify their address.


If you know the name of the place where the person works, you can look up the address or phone number of their place of employment. You might be able to contact the person at work to ask them for their home address.
 Contact your high school and/or university to find an address, or purchase your copy of a directory.


Many schools also have online databases, message boards, social media groups, and e-mail mailing lists. You might be able to reach out to people through these means to find information about the person.
Most alumni associations have presidents or representatives that can be contacted for information. They might be able to point you in the right direction. If you were part of organizations with the person, you can try contacting those organizations to see if they have directories or mailing lists.
 One of the easiest ways to find out where someone lives is to ask mutual friends or family. Talk to people who might still live in their hometown or be in touch with them on a regular basis. They might have a forwarding address for the person or a phone number where he or she can be located.

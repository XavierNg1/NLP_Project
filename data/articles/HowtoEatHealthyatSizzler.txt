 There are a lot of healthy options in the huge variety that they offer, if you choose wisely.


Salads: Go for the spinach leaves, cabbage, or romaine lettuce. Pile on the raw vegetables, such as mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Choose a light dressing, such as Italian. Note that the Blue Cheese and Ranch has the most calories and fat. If you want more toppings, go towards the sliced hard boiled eggs instead of the shredded cheese.
Fruit bar: Fresh fruit, such as watermelon, melons, pineapple, and kiwi are available in slices, while you might find whole fruit, such as apples and bananas.
Stay away from the salad bar entrees. The chicken, spaghetti, and taco bar might look appealing, but also very much loaded with unnecessary fat and calories.
Have some potato or macaroni salad as a side dish, along with the soft serve ice cream available. Always double check with the server if the dessert(s) are low-fat.;
, It might be a "your eyes are bigger than your stomach" issue when it comes to the sizes of the steaks on the menu. Petite 6 oz steaks are available on the lunch and dinner menu.
 Ask your server if you can do a substitution and get a baked potato or broccoli instead. Avoid any extra baked potato additions that your server might ask you on.
 Sizzler has great combination dishes, such as steak & lobster and steak & grilled shrimp. Just remember that if a person has the salad bar as their meal or even as an additional dish to their "main course" meal, then nothing can be shared amongst others.

 Many retirement plans take time to mature and early investments will yield more benefits. Here are some options you can consider to save or invest money for retirement.


Pension plan: Ask potential employers if they offer a pension plan that will pay for certain benefits after you retire. Give preference to accepting jobs that offer a pension plan.
Employer's retirement plan: Explore retirement plans offered by your employer such as a 401(K) plan. Your employer will contribute a share of the money that you invest towards retirement, which will lower taxes for you and your employer. You will only be able to access the money after retirement but you will end up getting more than what you contributed.
Banking: Invest money in bank accounts with high interest rates. The more money you invest, the more you will earn as interest. If you can make long-term investments, you may want to open a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) that can accrue interest over a long period of time and you are not required to pay taxes on any of the earned income as long as it is not withdrawn before retirement.
Real estate: If possible, buy a house that you can live in after retirement. Purchasing a home when property values are low will help you cut down your monthly living cost considerably after retirement.
Social Security: Pay taxes regularly before retirement. This will help you earn Social Security points and you can apply for Social Security benefits after you retire. On average, Social Security pays approximately 40 percent of what you earned before retiring as benefits to help you manage your cost of retirement. Applications can be filled and submitted online through the official website of the US Social Security Administration.

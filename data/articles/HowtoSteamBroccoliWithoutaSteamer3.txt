 The pieces can range from bite-size to twice as large as bite-size, but the stalks should be smaller than the florets and each piece should be evenly sized.


The florets should all be the same size, just as the stalks should all be the same size.
Remove any especially woody bits from the stems.
Smaller pieces will cook faster than larger ones.
 You only need to fill the stockpot with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water.
 The metal colander should be able to rest on the rim of stockpot. The basket portion should fit inside the stockpot without touching the water.


If the basket does touch the water, pour some of the water out.



If the water splashes through the holes of the colander, carefully dump out some of the water so that none of it reaches through.
, Put a lid on the stockpot and cook the broccoli until it becomes tender, but not mushy.


Check the broccoli after the first 5 minutes, especially if you cut it into bite-size pieces. Re-cover and continue cooking if it is not yet done.Large pieces of broccoli may need to steam for as long as 15 minutes.
A secure cover is essential in order to trap the steam inside.
 Flavor it with butter and salt, if desired.

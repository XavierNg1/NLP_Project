 With a small angled brush starting at your brows, draw two straight lines down the sides of your nose using a powder 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone. Connect these lines at the bottom, at an angle, between your nostrils. It should look like a downwards arrow.
 Using a fluffy shadow brush, blend the shaded lines well, concentrating on the outside of the lines.
 Using a brightening concealer or foundation, draw a very fine line between the center of your brows and down the bridge of your nose. Blend. Then dab the sides of your nose, near the nostrils, with the concealer and blend.

 What is your favourite genre? Reading what you like is often the key to liking reading. If you don't like chocolate cake, it doesn't mean you don't like all types of cake. It's the same with reading.;
, You can start learning about different varieties of books, and this can give you some ideas on where to look. Also, ask what these other people like about reading, and why that is.
 A lot of times, a movie is based on a book and because the screen version can only be so long, by reading the book, you get more details!

, If you're always itchy or achy while reading, you probably won't enjoy your book! Choose a clean, quiet area that will be easy to focus in.
 Take a couple of deep breaths before reading and have something hot to drink near you. Relaxing is a great way to enjoy lots of things.


If you're having a hard time finding a quiet place, try a backyard or park. The outdoors are always great.
 Find a reading level for you. If you don't know the words or expressions, you will find the book very dull and frustrating.
 Ask yourself what each character enjoys doing the most. Try connecting it to you by comparing your hobbies, talents, likes, and dislikes. Also, think if you would change the character at all.
 If you only read because you have to, change that. Don't pick a super boring book about the subject. Go to the library and try historical fiction based on the subject! It can be easier to digest and enjoy, but still be educational! When you're looking for books on a certain subject, ask the librarian for help.
 Keep everything balanced so you have time to read a little bit at least. You can never enjoy reading if you never do it.
 Try reading one page every day for a week, and challenge yourself to read two pages the next! Work your way up until you're at a comfortable amount of time for you.

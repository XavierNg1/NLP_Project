 The main difference between thermoplastic and thermoset is the reversibility of the coat. Like their name implies, thermoset coatings cannot re-melt after undergoing an irreversible chemical bonding process. Conversely, thermoplastic coatings can remelt because no chemical process takes place.


Thermostat coatings are ideal for things like electronics and appliances because they need to withstand higher amounts of heat, which might cause thermoplastic coatings to melt.
 Thermosets and thermoplastics have different chemical properties, making them ideal for different uses. Knowing some of those properties can help you choose which type to coat with:



Thermosets are said to reinforce the structural integrity of an item, making them particularly suitable for heavy wear-and-tear. They also supply the item with superior chemical and heat resistance, as mentioned above.

Thermoplastics offer a mixture of strength and flexibility. They are commonly used for items such as plastic bags and even mechanical parts.
 Thermosets are often used to coat appliances because of the heat they can withstand.


Advantages: beautiful aesthetic look; cheap; added strength and stability; resistant to extreme temperatures.
Disadvantages: irreversible process means thermoset can't be recycled; more difficult to finish; can't be reshaped., Thermoplastics are used for many items, such as park benches, that require both plasticity and durability.


Advantages: high lubricity or tack; recyclable; able to remolded and/or reshaped; increased impact resistance.
Disadvantages: more expensive (usually); can melt off if overheated.

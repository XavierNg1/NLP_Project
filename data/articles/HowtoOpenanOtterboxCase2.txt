 You can remove the cover by pulling any of the four corner tabs.
 Push the rubber shell off of one of the corners, then continue your way around the device until you've completely removed it. Be careful when removing the shell from ports on the iPad, as the rubber covers can be easy to tear.
 You'll be removing the panels from the back of the case.
 This panel will slide off about an inch below the Apple logo.
 This circle is the latch that keeps the two pieces of the case together.
 The case is split into two halves, and pulling the circle up releases the top half, allowing you to remove it.
 You can now pull the iPad out of the bottom half of the case. Connect the two halves if you want to store them.

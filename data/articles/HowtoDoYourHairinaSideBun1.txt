 Whenever possible, do not style freshly washed hair. Hair styling is easier and longer-lasting when the hair is one day unwashed.If your hair gets oily after one day, wash and use a sea salt spray.;
, Start brushing or combing the ends of your hair first. Gradually work your way up until your hair is completely smooth. For thick hair or especially stubborn knots, use a spray-on detangler.
 Side buns need the right amount of volume to look good. Thin buns will fall out quickly. Thick buns could end up protruding too much. To manage these issues you could:









Treat fine, limp hair, by curling it before you begin. Then, scrunch it with a small amount of mousse or gel. Just don’t let it get "crunchy."
Treat thick, curly hair by applying an anti-frizz serum from the ears down to the ends.
 Comb most of your hair on the side where you want your bun. Using the comb, draw a line through your hair. You can use hairspray sparingly to hold the part in place. Move the hair that pops up on to the appropriate side.
 Do this only to the roots at the back of your head. It will give your hair a bit more lift. Be careful not to create tangles.









This step is optional, especially if your hair is thick or frizzy.
 As you do this, brush out your hair to smooth out any bumps that might form. Tie your hair in place with an elastic hair band. This will help the bun stay in position.
 If you'd like to have a few pieces of hair hanging down around the ears, pull those out now. Use the wisps to frame your face in front of your ears. Don't leave too much hair down, or your final look will look sloppy.









This step is optional, but sometimes wisps fall down by themselves. If you don’t want your hair to hang over your face, pin it to the side of your head with a bobby pin or discreet barrette.

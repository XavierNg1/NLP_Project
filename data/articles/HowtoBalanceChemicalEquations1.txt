 For this example, you will use:


C3H8 + O2 --> H2O + CO2

This reaction occurs when propane (C3H8) is burned in the presence of oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide.;
, Look at the subscripts next to each atom to find the number of atoms in the equation.


Left side: 3 carbon, 8 hydrogen and 2 oxygen.
Right side: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogen and 3 oxygen.
, This means that you will need to balance the carbon atoms first.



C3H8 + O2 --> H2O + 3CO2

The coefficient 3 in front of carbon on the right side indicates 3 carbon atoms just as the subscript 3 on the left side indicates 3 carbon atoms.
In a chemical equation, you can change coefficients, but you must never alter the subscripts.
 You have 8 on the left side. So you'll need 8 on the right side.


C3H8 + O2 --> 4H2O + 3CO2

On the right side, you now added a 4 as the coefficient because the subscript showed that you already had 2 hydrogen atoms.
When you multiply the coefficient 4 times by the subscript 2, you end up with 8.
The other 6 atoms of Oxygen come from 3CO2.(3x2=6 atoms of oxygen+ the other 4=10)

,


Because you've added coefficients to the molecules on the right side of the equation, the number of oxygen atoms has changed. You now have 4 oxygen atoms in the water molecules and 6 oxygen atoms in the carbon dioxide molecules. That makes a total of 10 oxygen atoms.
Add a coefficient of 5 to the oxygen molecule on the left side of the equation. You now have 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
C3H8 + 5O2 --> 4H2O + 3CO2.






The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms are balanced. Your equation is complete.

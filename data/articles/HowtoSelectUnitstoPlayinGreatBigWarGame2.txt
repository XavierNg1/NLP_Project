 Vehicle units are the land-based transportation and attack vehicles. They are made in the Factory. Tap on the Factory to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission, on your Battle Stars, or on your available gold coins.
 There are nine different Vehicle units in the game.


A Jeep can transport infantry quickly to different locations on the map. It is a non-combat unit.
A Supply Truck resupplies all types of units on the field with fresh ammo and fuel. It is a non-combat unit.
An Anti Air Vehicle is a good combat unit against airborne units. It can’t attack other types of units though.
A Recon Tank is a fast vehicle, but doesn’t do much damage.
A Battle Tank is the main and basic battle tank, good against other vehicles.
A Tank Killer is a tougher version of the basic Battle Tank. It can take out most vehicles with just one shot.
A Behemoth is the toughest vehicle around. It can withstand some damage, and it can deliver great damage to enemy infantry, vehicles, ships, and buildings.
An Artillery is your best anti-infantry vehicle, able to take most out with just one shot.
A MLRS is your best anti-vehicle vehicle, able to deliver a lot of damage to vehicles and ships in one shot.
 Tap on the unit you want to build then tap on the “Buy” button with the amount of gold coins need to make it. The selected unit will immediately be generated from the Factory, ready for use.


You can only buy a unit that you can afford.

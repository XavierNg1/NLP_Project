 Make sure not to fill it to the top so the water doesn’t spill over when you add the cut potatoes.
 Scrape the potatoes off a cutting board using a knife. Add the potatoes slowly and carefully so the boiling water does not splash you. It’s best to wear a mitten-style potholder just in case.
 You are essentially partially cooking them here, but not all the way through. Any longer than five minutes, and you will overcook them before they are fried. If your cubes are very small, do not boil them for longer than three minutes.
 Use a cast-iron or non-stick pan and add the oil. Any of the following oils will do just fine: peanut oil, canola oil, sunflower seed oil, or just plain vegetable oil. Olive oil will work but is generally not the best of oil for frying.


The amount of oil you use depends on the size of the pan you are using and how large a recipe you are making. A good rule of thumb is about a half an inch (1.5cm) in the bottom of the pan.
Get the oil nice and hot, but be careful not to get it too hot as this may cause a dangerous grease fire. It’s better to start on the cooler side with the burner on medium and work your way up from there if you are not sure of the correct temperature.

, The problem is to set a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i = a^(b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i) = y. Algebraically, dividing both sides by a gives, after simplification, b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i = a^((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i).-1), and inverting the exponent and raising both sides to it gives (b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)^(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1)) = a, after simplifying. So, fine, there is an isolated and defined but isolating much of anything else is going to be quite difficult if not impossible. One can say, however, that since a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i= y and (b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)^(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1)) = a, that (b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)^(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1))bcdefghj = j. Therefore, (bcdefghj)^(1+(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1))) = y. But unless one knows the values of a or b through 0, one is at pretty much of a loss to say much else definitively. One might be able to build this structure up through series of steps, however, algebraically or by goal seeking. That is because ab = a^b becomes ab/a = (a^b)/a becomes b = a^(b-1) becomes b^(1/(b-1)) = a. The latter route of goal seeking has proven fruitful, however, if somewhat obvious. Obvious because, no matter the value selected for a, so long as b thru whatever multiply to 1 via reciprocals, they will also be raising a to the power of 1, via reciprocals that produce 1. So, for example, x*25*.04 = 1x = x and x^(25*.04) = x^1 = x also. And while there are other solutions, this one meets the criteria and is easy for Excel to calculate, so that's what its goal seeking function does in this case.
 Into column A, enter the labels for the various quantities, A2: a; A3: b, A4: c and so forth down to A10: i.  In A12 enter a*b and in A13 enter a^b. A14 may hold Diff as will equal 0, but it looks cleaner without it, so skip to A15 and enter a*b*c and into A16 enter a^(b*c). In cell A18 enter a*b*c*d and in cell A19 enter a^(b*c*d). In cell A21 enter a*b*c*d*e and in cell A22 enter a^(b*c*d*e). In cell A24 enter a*b*c*d*e*f and in cell A25 enter a^(b*c*d*e*f). In cell A27 enter a*b*c*d*e*f*g and in cell A28 enter a^(b*c*d*e*f*g. In cell A30 enter a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h and in cell A31 enter a^(b*c*d*e*f*g*h). In cell A33 enter a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i and in cell A34 enter a^(b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i).
 Then inspect carefully the formulas to see that it was all done correctly, else fix it manually. Then select rows 2:10 and Insert Names Create Names in Left Column, OK.
 Copy A12:A13 and paste it to B12 and insert an = sign before the formula in the new location and hit enter for both cells B12 and B13. Copy A15:A16 and paste to C15 and insert an = sign before both formulas and hit enter. Copy A18:A19 and paste it to D18, insert an = sign before both formulas and hit enter. Copy A21:A22 and paste to E21, then insert an = sign before both formulas and hit enter. Copy A24:A25 and paste it to both F24 and G24 and insert an = sign before all 4 formulas and press enter for each one. Copy A27:A28 and paste to H27 and enter an = sign before each one and hit enter for each. Copy A30:A31 to I30 and enter an = sign before each formula and hit enter for each one. Copy A33:A34 and paste to J33 and enter an = sign before each formula and hit enter for each one.
 until all are done including cell J35.
 Select B3 and enter 25, and then select cell B2 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=B3^(1/(B3-1))" and watch the difference cell in B14 go to 0. with 15 trailing zeroes. The balancing figures you should get are 28.588245902073

, Select C1 and enter 1 as the Initial Guess for goal seeking purposes. Select Cell C17 and do Tools Goal Seek...  Set cell C17, To value (input) 0, By changing cell (and click on cell) C2. The answer you should get in C2 = 1.08377795636471 and the balancing figures you should get are 53.6470088400507; so clearly there is more than one way to skin a cat than having the exponents reciprocate to 1.
 Copy cells C3:C4 and paste them to D3, In cell D4 enter 1 as an initial guess for goal seeking purposes. Select cell  D20 and do goal seeking by setting that cell to 0 and changing cell D4. D4's value should change to 0.0202020202020213 to make reciprocation come out to 1 for the 3 values, 0.0202020202020213, 25 and 1.9799999999999. Note that the balancing figure is the same as a_, 1.0240260766465 because of the reciprocation equaling 1.
 Copy cells D3:D4 and paste them to cell E3. Into cell E5 enter 2 and into cell E6 enter 1. Trying to trick Excel here; let's see if it works. Select cell E23 and do Tools Goal Seek on cell E23 to value 0 using cell -- and click on cell E6. Excel was not fooled.
 Copy cell F2 tp cell range F3:F6 and into cell F7 enter .5.Select cell F26 and do goal seeking as usual, using cell F7 at the end. Not fooled in the slightest. Converted the .5 to a 1 rather quickly.
 Copy cell range F3:F5 and paste it to G3. Enter 2 into cell G6 and 1 into cell G7. Goal seek by selecting cell G26 and doing Tools Goal Seek and confirm cell G26 and to value 0 and by changing cell G7. Not fooled at all.
 Try your own values for a_ in H4, I4 and J4 as you add H8, I9 and J10 and goal seek by changing them. Find out what there is to learn from the process.

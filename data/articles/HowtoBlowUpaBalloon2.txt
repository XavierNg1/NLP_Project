 A simple hand pump designed for use with balloons is cheap and easy to transport. Look for ones that have containers near the hand pump where you can store extra balloons.
 The nozzle should be ribbed to allow for a tight hold on the opening of the balloon.
 No need to stretch out the balloon latex. Just pump until the balloon has as much air as intended. You're finished!

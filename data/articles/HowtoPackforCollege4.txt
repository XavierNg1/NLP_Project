 Some of these items might be better if they're purchased on arrival––check online for places that are close to campus where you could buy things from with ease. These items include:

A desk lamp. Look for one that can clip onto any surface, as this makes it practical for moving around as needed, such as having over your bed at night as well.
A bulletin board
A dry-erase marker board
A trash can (although check to see whether anything is supplied in-room)
An ergonomic desk chair seat pad or your own office chair. Pack a comfortable office chair, and send the standard chair home with your parents to bring back at the end of the year. Or, just bring a seat pad to make your chair a bit cushier
Take a computer. Frequent trips to the library are a hassle. While a desktop works fine, on the whole the portability of a laptop recommends itself most. You can take a self-assembled stand to raise the laptop to a good level on the desk. Also get a flash drive/memory stick for storage (essential for back-up). If you're buying a new computer, don't pay to have programs installed––most universities will give you Microsoft Office for free. Even if they don't, you can download Open Office, which is very similar, for free at www.openoffice.org.
 If you're provided with a desk lamp/trash can/etc., it's easier to send the one you brought back home with your parents than to go without.

 You should cut a section of 3/4" x 11 gauge tubing and weld it to your steering tabs. Insert an additional 1" spacer loosely by the shaft near the steering hoop, grinding the shaft slightly near the hoop if too tight.Drill a three hole pattern with the holes equidistant from the center of the washer at the end of your shaft.
 Make your cuts at a 39 degree angle for your hoop. At this time you should verify that all measurements for your steering assembly are correct for your kart and allow for a full range of motion.


The hoop and shaft should be at a 90 degree angle to one another.
 These 2" long 3/8" diameter tabs keep your pedals in their resting and full forward positions. The closest tab to the center of the frame should be fixed a max of 1/2" after the crosswise piece your to which your steering column is attached. The second tab should be installed 1 3/8" after the first tab.
 You will weld these to the front axle of your go-kart. The spindle should have a 1" clearance above the front axle.
 Use a 3/8" rod in a vise to bend it with a hammer into the shape of your passenger footrest if applicable. This will keep your feet from resting on tie rods.
 This stud will serve as the pivot for your brake band. Weld a 3/8" round bar to the frame 1 1/2" after your axle.

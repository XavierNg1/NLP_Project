 For the juice, you’ll need 2 medium beets, 1 cup (100 g) of blueberries, and 1 cup (100 g) of halved, hulled strawberries. To make it easier to run them through the juicer, though, use a sharp knife to quarter the beets.If the strawberries are large, you may want to cut them into quarters as well.
 After you’ve cut the beets, run them through a juicer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Juice the blueberries and strawberries immediately afterward, collecting the juice in the same container.While the juices will be combined in the juicer’s receptacle, it’s a good idea to stir them with a spoon to ensure that they’re fully mixed.
 Once all of the juices are combined, cover the container and chill in the refrigerator for an hour. Next, pour the juice into a large glass and serve.

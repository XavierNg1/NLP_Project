 Set the chicken on the cutting board so that the legs and wingtips are facing you and the breast side of the chicken is facing up.
 Center the twine under the legs so that you have equal lengths of twine extending from either side.
 Lift the ends of the twine so they are taut underneath the chicken's legs, then cross the ends over each other to form an "x" across the legs.
 Pull the twine tight, so the ends of the legs are pulled close together.
 Hold the ends together at the top of the chicken, near the neck. Pull the strings taught so they don't come loose.
 While keeping the twine tight, flip the chicken over so the legs are now facing away from you.


This is the hardest step of trussing chicken, so don't get discouraged if it takes you more than one attempt.
When the chicken is flipped, you should see the twine bends threaded over each thigh and under each wing.
 Position the twine under the neck bone of the chicken and tie it in a tight knot.


If the chicken's neck bone has been cut off, just position the string near the neck opening.
Make sure the string is very taught. The chicken's body should make a creaking sound as it tightens.
 Use the scissors to cut off the excess length of twine after you've made the knot to prevent the twine from burning during cooking.
 Place it in the roasting pan and tuck the wings behind the neck area of the chicken. Pull the skin over the breast meat as tightly as you can, and tuck it into the cavity. The chicken is now trussed and ready to cook.

 Choose any flavour of Gatorade you'd prefer like Gracier Freeze, Rain Berry, Lemonade, Mango Extremo, Fruit Punch etc.;
, Begin to add the honey, yogurt, fruit juice, and ice cubes. Make sure the ice cubes are not near the blade or else the smoothie won't blend that well.
 Add more Gatorade, fruit juice, and yogurt if the smoothie is not blending properly.

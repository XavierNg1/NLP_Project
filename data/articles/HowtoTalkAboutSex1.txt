 Lay out your thoughts as plainly as possible. Avoid euphemisms, and try to work past your initial discomfort. It can be embarrassing to talk about sex, but remind yourself that you have nothing to be ashamed about!


Remember that sex is perfectly natural. One might argue that, indeed, nothing is more natural. It is how you came into being.
If you aren't comfortable referring to "sex," try using a similar but "softer" phrase. Instead of saying that you are "having sex," say that you are "making love," or "being intimate," or "getting down." Each of these phrases has its own set of connotations.;
, If you aren't comfortable doing something, then don't do it. If you let something slide even once, then it will be harder to stop it from happening in the future. Be firm about your expectations, and don't let anyone take advantage of you.
 Before you become intimate with a person, initiate a casual conversation about their sexual health and their testing history. Don't make a big deal about it â€“ just ask if they've been tested recently. Remember that you have the right to look after your own sexual health. You deserve to know if you're about to have sex with someone who might be carrying an infection.Use protection. It never hurts to use a condom, even if a partner has assured you that he or she is STI-free.
This might seem like a small thing, and in the heat of the moment you may be tempted to forego the questions. If you pick up an STI, however, it can plague you for years, and it can have serious health implications. You will need to explain your situation to all future partners.

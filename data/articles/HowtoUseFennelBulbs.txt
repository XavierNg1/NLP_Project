 Remove any outer leaves that aren't in good shape.


Smaller bulbs may need no trimming at all.;
, If the bulb is large, consider removing the core as well.
 There are different methods possible, including:


Steam the bulb. After steaming, drizzle with a little olive oil and add some freshly cracked black pepper. Salt to taste. Or, serve it along with other steamed vegetables.
Bake in a vegetable broth. Sprinkle cheese over the top if you like.

Roast the fennel bulbs. Halve the bulbs and core if needed. Roll in olive oil and place in a roasting dish. Roast in a hot oven (minimum 220ÂºC). The bulbs can be roasted with other vegetables at the same time.
 Fennel can be eaten raw in a salad. Baby fennel bulbs are best for this purpose. Either halve them or slice thinly and add to a salad.

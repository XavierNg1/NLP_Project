 Normal force refers to the amount of force use to counteract the force of gravity.


Imagine a block sitting on a table. The force of gravity pulls the block toward the Earth, but clearly, there is some force at work preventing the block from crashing through the table and finishing its descent toward the ground. The force responsible for stopping the block in spite of gravitational force is the normal force.;
, When calculating an object's normal force when that object is at rest on a flat surface, use the formula: N = m * gIn this equation, N refers to the normal force, m refers to the object's mass, and g refers to the acceleration of gravity.
For an object sitting on a flat surface, with no outside forces at work, the normal force is equal to the object's weight. In order to keep the object still, the normal force must be equal to the force of gravity at work on the object. The force of gravity at work on the object is that object's weight, or its mass multiplied by the acceleration of gravity.

Example: Find the normal force of a block with a mass of 4.2 kg.
 Doing so will give you the weight of the object, which ultimately equals the normal force of the object as it sits at rest.


Note that the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface is a constant: g = 9.8 m/s2Example: weight = m * g = 4.2 * 9.8 = 41.16

, The previous step should complete the problem, giving you your answer.



Example: The normal force is 41.16 N.

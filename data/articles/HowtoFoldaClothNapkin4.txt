 With the napkin flat, face-down in front of you, fold it in half diagonally and shift the open edge so that it is away from you (triangle points up).
 Fold both the right and left corners, one at a time, so that they meet at the center corner. Your napkin should now look like a square or diamond.
 Take the top corner for each side and fold it back inside, so that the point nestles in the respective left and right side corners. You should now see a basic heart shape.
 Turn the napkin over and fold down the back panel so that it disappear behind the drip at the center of the heart.
 Take the top right and left corners and tuck them under, rounding the edge as you go. This will form the final heart shape.
 Enjoy your heart napkin fold! It is perfect for a romantic dinner or Christmas celebration.

 Use a ruler or a measuring tape to make sure both pant legs will be hemmed to the same length.
 Use chalk or a marking pencil to make a mark 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the hemline around the entire pant leg, then trim the excess fabric with pinking shears. Repeat on the other side.
 Cut a length of fusible tape and remove the paper backing. Line up the edge of the tape with the crease in the fabric that you ironed. Press the tape down and continue lining it up and applying it around the entire pant leg. Cut more tape if you run out as you go, and fold the cuff back over the tape when you're finished. Repeat with the other pant leg.









If you don't have fusible tape, hem tape and other temporary hemming products can be used in its place. These usually fall out after a wash or two.
Make sure the tape is completely straight around the bottom of both pant legs.
 Place a thin cloth over the cuffed fabric. Heat up an iron and apply it to the cloth for several seconds. Remove the cloth and continue ironing the fabric underneath. Use this procedure to fuse the tape with the fabric around the entire pant leg, then repeat with the second pant leg.









After you've ironed a section, lift the cuff gently to make sure that the tape has fused with the fabric to hold the hem in place before moving on.
Make sure your iron is set to a heat that won't damage the fabric of your pants.
 Turn the pants right-side out and try them on. If you aren't happy with the length, launder the pants and run them through the dryer until the tape falls out, then hem them again.

 If your partner knew about the affair and encouraged you to end it, tell him or her that it's over. There may be a lot of work to be done to patch up your relationship. Your partner will be angry, and you may feel guilt for a long time to come. Stay strong in the knowledge that you made the choice to be honest and take action.


If your partner did not know about the affair, consider whether you want to tell her or him. There's risk involved, yes, but if you plan to continue the relationship, it's best to start from a place of honesty.
Another reason you may want to tell your partner is so that he or she doesn't find out from someone else. If the person with whom you had an affair is very upset, she or he may try to get in touch with your partner.
 Breakups are tough, no matter what the situation. You relied on someone to meet your needs, and now there's a gap in your life where that person used to be. Take care of yourself.
 Guilt is a healthy emotion to have when you feel you've done something wrong, but long-term shame won't help anyone at this point. We're all striving to be better people, and we all make mistakes that hurt others. The best thing you can do is move forward and try to live more honestly in the future. Be more upfront about your feelings with yourself to prevent this from happening again down the road.

 El Impoluto likes to take its path directly with high speed and then ram at your ship. When it does, it will inflict devastating damage.
 Try to stay away from its side cannons as well.
 This will decrease the speed of the enemy ship. Chain shots are most effective against El Impoluto since it won't be able to ram at you while you're at the rear.



El Impoluto fires an enormous barrage of cannonballs at once.
 When the ship begins to charge you, turn away from it in the opposite direction that you are traveling, instead of trying to outrun it and let it pass. If you ever let the ship pass you, it will swing to the side and attack you. If you turn away from it, you will be able to fire a volley into its side and then continue forward to come up behind it.


Halving its HP with your cannons and ramming it from behind will sink El Impoluto soon enough.
You will get 20,000R as reward for defeating El Impoluto.

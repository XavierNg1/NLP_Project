 If your dog has a favorite toy or treat, place the treat or toy on the ground. Then tell your dog to find it. This is often more effective with more than one person, so one person can hold the dog while you place the treat. This will start getting your dog to associate finding with the toy or treat., This will encourage a dog who doesn’t already dig to do so. They will want to get to their treat. Using a favorite toy or treat will be especially helpful if the dog seems reluctant to dig. Remember certain breeds were bred to dig; others were not., Once you've taught your dog to dig, make sure you reward them. Praise them highly and give them a treat. If they’re obsessed with the treat they dug up, still praise them, so they know they did what you wanted., Once you’ve got them thinking digging is a good thing, introduce the command. “Dig” can be a good choice, especially if paired with gestures to keep it from getting confused with “sit.” Remember to be consistent you’re your choice of command and gestures., If you want the trick to get more advanced, take progressive steps toward it. Going too fast can confuse or bore a dog, as they will not know what you want. But if you increase the depth by increments you will get them excited to please you. Try not to increase the depth more than once in the same session., If you want the dog to dig up the treat or toy, you need to keep the reward until they accomplish the task. If the dog seems confused, you might need to work on shallower depths of the treat or toy, or with the basic task of finding the toy. Try different treats if one doesn’t work or has stopped working., Again, practice is the most important part of learning any trick. With a dog who doesn’t already dig, practice is even more important. The key is to practice frequently, but don’t make the sessions too long (keep it to 10-15 minutes).

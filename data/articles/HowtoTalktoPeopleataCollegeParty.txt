 Say to yourself that you are the nicest and coolest girl/boy in the party. Have a drink and find someone that you think that you can chat with, then start the conversation with something you just saw or find an excuse to chat.

For example, say something like: "Oh sorry, I almost fell down on you! My name is ... "; or, say something like "Hey Lola/John––oh sorry, I thought you were someone I knew! My name is ... and I was hoping someone I knew would be here.";
, Have some pre-planned topics to talk about, and aim to steer the conversation towards those things, so that you have some fun things to share with others. This might be about hobbies, studies, personal interests, and the like.

Shared concerns about timetables, exam times, subject challenges, etc., might also be a good way to find topics to talk about. Commonalities are a very useful way to discuss things with other people.
 For example, you could ask something like: "You are not drinking?" or, ask: "What are you drinking?" Then be charming and seek to find out what the other person finds interesting. That's how you can chat and make a conversation with college party people., Go for it if you know what they are talking about and throw in your observations and summaries too. This can be a good way to join a conversation, show off your knowledge and potentially make some new friends.

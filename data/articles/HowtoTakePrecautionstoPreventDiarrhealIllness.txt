 Hands should always be washed with soap and water or ash and water after defecating, after cleaning a baby's bottom, and immediately before feeding children, handling food or eating.;
, Young children frequently put their hands in their mouths, so it is important to keep the household area clean and to wash children's hands often with water and soap or ash, especially before giving them food.
 Food should be prepared and thoroughly cooked just before eating. Food left standing can collect germs that can cause diarrhea. After two hours, cooked foods are not safe unless they are kept very hot or very cold.
 All refuse should be buried, burned or safely disposed of to stop flies from spreading disease.

 Most superheroes wouldn't be caught without this most dashing of accessories. Make a cape from any rectangular piece of old fabric you have lying around, such as an old sheet, that you can cut up. Felt also works well as cape material and is inexpensive at most arts and crafts stores.
 Make sure that the cape is not so long that you will trip on it when you walk.
 Use a ruler to connect the four corners of the dots and carefully cut out the rectangle shape.
 Attach a symbol or letter that represents your superpower in the center of the cape.


Felt works well for a cape embellishment because it is easily manipulable and won't fold as you fly around.
You can either glue this embellishment on using a hot glue gun or use leftover velcro strips to attach your symbol.
 You can either tie the fabric in a knot where it hits your sternum, use a safety pin to hold it in place, or attach velcro strips to your base outfit and the cape so that the two meet around the top of your shoulders.

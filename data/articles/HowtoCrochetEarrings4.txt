 Attach the thread to the crochet hook using a standard slip knot, then work a foundation of 34 chain stitches., Chain three, then work three triple crochet into the second stitch from the hook.

Chain one, skip a stitch, and work three triple crochet into the stitch that follows; repeat this pattern until you reach the final stitch of your foundation chain.
As you work down the chain, you should notice the piece curling into the desired spiral shape.
 Work one double crochet, one single crochet, and one slip stitch into the final stitch of the foundation chain.

Work all three of these stitches into the same chain. These will be the last stitches you'll make, so you should be able to see the finished spiral form by the end of this step.
 Cut the thread, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

You'll need a long tail to attach the spiral to the earring hook, so do not trim it after fastening off the work.
 Thread the tail through the loop at the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the thread around this loop.

Keep the thread fairly taut as you tie it and only make a small knot. The knot itself will be visible, but you should not see any unused thread in between the spiral and the earring hook.
 Weave any excess thread into the stitches at the inside of the spiral to both secure and hide it.

Consider trimming the excess down to roughly 2 inches (5 cm) before weaving it into the stitches. Weaving in too much excess can distort the shape of the spiral.
 Repeat the same steps to make another earring that matches the first.

Crochet the spiral, attach it to the earring hook, and weave in the excess.
After making the second earring, the set is finished and ready to show off.

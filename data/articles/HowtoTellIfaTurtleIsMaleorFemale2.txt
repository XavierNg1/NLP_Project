 Male turtles use their claws during mating rituals with female turtles. They also use their claws to fight and to claim and defend their territory. Therefore, the claws on the males' front legs tend to be longer than the claws of female turtles. Again, this is more obvious when you have two turtles of different sexes to compare with each other.The Red-eared Slider species particularly shows a pronounced difference between the male and female front claws.
 Both male and females have an opening or vent located on the underside on the tail. This is called the cloaca, and it is located slightly differently depending on the gender.The female's cloaca is rounder and more star shaped than the male's. It is found much closer to her body, at the base of her tail where it joins her body, almost disappearing into the shell.
The male's cloaca is longer and more slit-like. It is located in the last third of the tail, towards the tip.
 The male's genitalia are located within the tail, and to accommodate them, the tail is longer and thicker than a femaleâ€™s. The female's tail is shorter and thinner.Be aware that there is an overlap in normal sizes between male and female, so this can give you a hint, but it is not a foolproof way of sexing a turtle.
 The best approach to sexing a turtle is using a combination of the suggested steps to come up with the most likely gender for the turtle. Bear in mind that some methods are less reliable than others in determining the gender of your turtle.

If all the signs point in one direction, then it's more likely than not that you've determined the gender accurately. However, if the signs are mixed, you may wish to take your turtle to a vet to be certain.If you're not sure what conclusion to draw, wait until the turtle is older and try again. It is extremely difficult to sex a baby turtle.
Be aware that you might have to wait years until your turtle is fully grown and you can determine the gender effectively.

 Vegetables, particularly those that are brightly colored, are often packed with antioxidants that can prevent oxidative damage to your brain cells (and the cells in your skin and other organs).


Not only will your general health benefit from the variety of nutrients the vegetables provide, your mental health will be at its best when you take the time to provide it with a steady supply of protection in the form of antioxidants.
Try eating up to 5 different colors of fruits and vegetables each day to get the best variety of nutrients and antioxidants for your mental health.
 Curcumin, cinnamon, turmeric, garlic powder, and chili powder are loaded with beneficial antioxidants that can work wonders for maintenance of mental health.


Try using herbs (which are rich in flavonoids) and spices to season foods in place of salt and pepper. Adding them to whole grains can give you the added antioxidant lift of many grains.
 Dark berries, citrus, and tomatoes are packed with valuable antioxidants that can prevent the negative effects of free radicals on cells in your brain. Add bananas to the mix to get essential nutrients to reduce fatigue and boost mood.

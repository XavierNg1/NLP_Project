 It's better to listen to a piano version, but other instruments will also help. Your mind will pick up the melody and rhythm, and then knowing the tune makes it easier to know whether you are producing the intended sound for what you read.;
, It is very important to realise whether you can't -- by either technical skill or physical technique -- play the song; so, you don't start and have to quit because of things you don't know.
 It is very annoying to practice the song with a metronome, and one might not help. But, maybe it is syncopated (a kind of off-beat rhythm), varied from a standard rhythmic accent:Throw a pair of tennis shoes or jeans in the clothes dryer. Chances are the rhythm you hear will be syncopated, like an ad-lib, varied from standard, but in a general pattern, such as jazz.
 This follows the level of how good you are at reading notes.


Read and play only one hand at a time.

Practice the treble and the base clef separately.


Read and put both hands together when you can.
Read both hands and characterise the tune of the song properly working up to the desired speed.
 Learning to read notes takes many hours practice, but saves you from fumbling later. As a student you can read loads of notes, not only music supplied by the teacher, but also found other places by yourself.

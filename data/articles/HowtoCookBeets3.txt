 Try using a 4 quart (4 liter) glass bowl. The bowl needs to be large enough so that the beets fit inside in a single layer. Do not stack the beets. You can put them in the bowl whole or you can even quarter them., Drizzle the water over the beets, wetting the tops and allowing it to run down the sides. Do not attempt to microwave the beets without water.
 Place a lid over the bowl or loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap., Rotate the beets so that a new part of them is facing up to ensure that the are evenly cooked. Continue to microwave them until they feel tender when a fork is stuck inside.
 Allow the beets to cool in the microwave for one minute. Remove the beets from the microwave and cool for an additional four minutes, or until they feel cool enough to handle. Leaving them with the cover on can help steam them and cook them a bit further. This is better than overdoing it with the microwave, because microwaving the beets can make it harder to preserve their nutritional value., Gently rub the skin with a paper towel until it flakes off. If the skin does not flake off, use a vegetable peeler to gently peel the top layer of skin away. This may also mean that you should cook them for another minute so they become more tender.
 These microwaved beets are ready to be enjoyed on their own, in a salad, or in another recipe of your choice. You can enjoy them quartered, whole, or sliced.

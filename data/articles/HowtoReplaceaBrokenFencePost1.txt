Farm fencing usually only has the corner poles set in cement while suburban wood fences may have every wood post set in cement.
Tubular metal posts such as those used with chain link fence, are generally set in cement.;
,, If it is firmly set, proceed to the next step.
 If leaving the bottom of the post in the ground is a problem, do not cut off the post, proceed to the next step.



Dig around the post to look for cement.
Use a probe close to the post to feel for cement.



If it’s not set in cement push the post back and forth in the hole until it loosens, then lift it up. If it is stubborn you may need to dig around the post on all sides until the post loosens.
A post anchored in cement will need to be pulled out. Cut a notch near the top of the post. Attach a heavy duty chain or cable under the notch. Attach the other end of the chain or cable to a tractor or truck and pull it out.
, A post hole digger or a narrow spade works best.


Dig as close to the old hole as possible, exactly even with it.
Make the hole about 6 inches wider than the post on all sides.
To determine depth measure the old post from the top to where it set in the soil. Subtract that from the length of the new post. The answer is the depth you need for the new hole.
Rent a powered auger that can make holes for fence posts if you have a lot of posts to replace.
 Make sure the depth is correct by measuring as you would for a new hole.
 Place a small level on top and adjust the post until it sits level in the hole. Have someone hold the post level or use props to hold it in place.



Mix a bag of ready mix cement according to package directions. Pour it around the post to the top of the hole. Let it dry 24 hours.
If you don’t use cement, and are replacing a wooden post put small gravel in the bottom 6, inches,(15.2 cm), of the hole, then fill the hole with soil to the top and pack it down firmly. Metal poles do not need gravel.

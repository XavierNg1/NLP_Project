 This method works best when you are working with two numbers that are less than 10. If you are working with larger numbers, itâ€™s best to use a different method.

For example, you might need to find the least common multiple of 5 and 8. Since these are small numbers, it is appropriate to use this method.
;
, A multiple is a product of any number and an integer.In other words, they are the numbers you would see in a multiplication table.

For example, the first several multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.
 Do this near the first set of multiples, so that they are easy to compare.

For example, the first several multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64.
 You might need to extend your list of multiples until you find one both numbers share. This number will be your least common multiple.For example, the lowest multiple 5 and 8 share is 40, so the least common multiple of 5 and 8 is 40.

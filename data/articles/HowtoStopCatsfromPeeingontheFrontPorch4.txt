 The majority of household cleaners contain ammonia, which is also a constituent of urine. By cleaning away cat urine with a household cleaner, you are merely replacing that cat's scent with another urine-based smell. This actually increases the culprit's instinct to spray, because he feels his scent has been overwritten by another., To thoroughly deodorize urine smells without leaving a smell behind, create a deodorizing solution. Use enzymatic or biological laundry detergent (such as Seventh Generation or Biokleen) mixed with water.


Mix 9 parts water with 1 part laundry detergent. Spray on the surface that you want to clean. Scrub with a brush or rag to wash the contaminated area. Choose a nontoxic detergent.
Some surfaces such as carpet, soft furnishings, and painted walls may not be color fast. Test an inconspicuous spot before embarking on a major clean.
If carpet or fabric has been sodden with urine over a period of time, it is impossible to get the smell out. In this case, throw the item away., Using clean water, thoroughly rinse the area where youâ€™ve applied the deodorizing solution. Dry thoroughly with a clean towel.
 Use a spray bottle to cover the most frequently used areas where the cat urinates. Work the rubbing alcohol into any cracks or crevices with a nail brush. Allow the area to air dry., Avoid the temptation to put a strong smelling substance on the porch to deter the cats. The cat will merely feel the need to refresh his scent marker and hence will return to the spot to urinate.


Refrain from using essential oils such as eucalyptus or rosemary. Although it is popularly believed that cats don't like the smell of these oils, this approach can actually be counterproductive.

 If you're not sure what he or she likes, try a safe, popular candy, either something minty or fruity. Most people like chocolate, but if you rub chocolate on your lips it will look sloppy and unappealing. It will also ruin the surprise!

, Try to keep it just on your lips, as it may leave a shine or stickiness that would look gross on the rest of your face. The flavor may not last very long, so make sure your partner is nearby, but not watching you.


You may want to let the candy dissolve in your mouth and on your tongue, but beware: the bacteria in your mouth loves sugar and this can cause bad breath!, If you think your partner is up for it, you may want to keep the candy in your mouth (if it's a hard candy, like a butterscotch or mint). You can pass the candy back and forth between your mouths. This is a risk, though--your partner may think it's gross or choke on the candy if he or she is not expecting it!

 The first is for welcoming singular people, the later for plural groups of people.


Sha-gaw-tom;
, This is one is tricky if you've never spoken Chinese, as inflection is everything. Put a little extra stress on the first half of the word.FOON--yen.
 Written phonetically like this, "huānyíng, you want to focus of emphasizing the second half just a little louder than the first."Hoo-ahn Ying"

, Simple and easy, you've heard this plenty of times. It also means goodbye.


"Ah-loh-ha."

, Both of these will work, though the second is a little more formal.


"Sva-gaht"
"Sva-gaht ha-AIN", The first "O" sound is a lot longer than it seems. This is one where listening to an example or native speaker will be huge.


"Yo-O-Ko-So", Perhaps the toughest one on the list, it is a lot of syllables that come pretty quickly. Take your time learning each part before putting it all together.


"Hwan-yan Ham-ee-doh", Another tricky one, it is pretty guttural, especially at the end of the second word. Try to use a thick, breathy voice. The first word sounds a bit like "tafta."


"Tav-ta Mer-lehk-tuhn.", It almost sounds a bit French, with the words sliding effortlessly together. If you speak French, the first half sounds a lot like "Ce Soir."


Suh-swa-guh-ta-mon

, The first simply means "enter," and is used for one person or a casual acquaintance. The second is for groups or elderly people.

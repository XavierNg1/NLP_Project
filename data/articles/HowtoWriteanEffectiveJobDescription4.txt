 In many cases you might want to save this information for the interview stage, but if the salary and benefits are set in stone, you can go ahead and list them. Beware that if the salary and benefits seem insufficient to potential job seekers they may pass over the job without giving the position a closer look.
 If you anticipate getting hundreds of cover letters and resumes, you may want to specify how you want the documents formatted so you'll have an easier time keeping track of everything. Some employers ask applicants to include all information in the body of an email, while others prefer an old-fashioned letter in the mail.
 Listing a deadline may encourage applications to apply quickly, which could potentially help you find the right position for the job a lot faster. However, if people see the description a few days after the deadline has passed, they may not bother applying, and you could miss out on some excellent candidates this way.

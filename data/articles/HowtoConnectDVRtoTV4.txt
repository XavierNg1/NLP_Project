 If the TV and DVR are currently on, turn them both off before making any connections.


You can keep both devices plugged into the wall outlet or power strip while connecting them, but the devices must remain off until the end of the process.
 You'll need to use a standard S-video cable for the video. Plug one end of the cable into the S-video In port on the back of the TV., Plug the other end of the same S-video cable into the S-video Out port on the back of your DVR.
 You'll need to use a separate L/R stereo cable for the audio. Connect the plugs at one end of this cable into the matching Audio In ports on the back of the TV.


The red plug connects to the red Audio In Right port and the white plug connects to the white Audio In Left port.
 Plug the connectors at the other end of the same audio cable into the corresponding Audio Out ports on the back of the DVR.


Make sure that the red connector plugs into the red Audio Out Right port and the white connector plugs into the white Audio Out Left port.
 The DVR and TV are now connected. To use the DVR, turn on both pieces of equipment and switch the TV to the appropriate source input.


Press the "Source" or "Input" button on your TV or remote control to scroll through the options. Stop once you reach "S-Video."

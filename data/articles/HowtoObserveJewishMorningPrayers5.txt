 There is a specific order to taking off your tefillin


Unwrap the strap off of your hand
Take your tefillin shel rosh off of your head. You should bow your head as you take it off, in order to appear to be sad to be taking off a holy object
Carefully put the tefillin shel rosh into the tefillin case. Wrap the straps around the box and put the tefillin back in the "box."
Unwrap the rest of the tefillin shel yad from your forearm, and slide it off of your arm. Carefully put the tefillin back in its casing, and wrap the strap around the casing.
Place the tefillin back into the tefillin "box" along with the Tefillin Shel Rosh

, There is no set way to fold a tallit. Make sure to pack your prayer book as well

, Now that you have finished praying to God, you are ready to start your day! Even though you are done using your tallit, tefillin, and prayer book, make sure to treat them with respect, as they are holy objects.

 If reading and writing is important to your understanding of Japanese, it is crucial to spend time studying all four of the Japanese written systems. Hiragana and katakana can be learned in as little as a few weeks, and you can use them to write anything you want in Japanese. Kanji will take much longer to learn, but it is also important. Begin practicing Kanji as well.

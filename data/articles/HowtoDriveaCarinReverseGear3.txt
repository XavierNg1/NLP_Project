 If you cannot see out the back of the vehicle, you will need to use your side mirrors to see as you back up. Before you begin, adjust your side mirrors to ensure you can see the side of the vehicle, the ground, and anything coming up from behind you.In many cars you can adjust both mirrors from the driver’s seat, but in some you may need to adjust them manually by hand on each side.
 Using mirrors will only show you what is behind your vehicle on either side, so it’s important to check both sides often. This will prevent you from accidentally hitting something, or from not noticing as someone approaches from one side or the other.You likely will need to drive even slower in reverse when using mirrors to be sure you don’t miss anything.
It may help to pay closer attention to the mirror on a side with an obstacle, so you can keep your eyes on it.
 If you are backing up using only your mirrors in a difficult area, you may choose to ask a friend to guide you. Using your mirrors to keep an eye on a friend that is checking your clearances from the back may be your best option when driving a box truck or something else with severely limited visibility.Have your friend stand behind the vehicle on one side to ensure you can see them as they guide you.
Make sure to open your windows and turn off the radio to hear your friend’s instructions as you back up.

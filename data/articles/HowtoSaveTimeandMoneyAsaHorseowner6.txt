Join an organization that gives free insurance. The availability will depend on where you live but typical organizations that might provide free insurance include horse societies and jumping or eventing associations.
Buy online. Some insurance companies give online discounts.
Pay increased excesses in return for reduced premiums.



Have your horse security marked, namely, freeze-marked, microchipped. Your insurance company may give you a discount for having had this done.
Insure the horse for less then his worth. You will get the same veterinary cover cheaper, but will get a reduced payment if your horse dies or is stolen.
Insure only the basics. These include personal liability, and possibly vet fees.
 Put some money aside every month for unexpected veterinary fees and keep a good credit rating so, if necessary, you can go into debt.

 In recent years it has been discovered that flushing certain medications that contain hormones, antibiotics, and other substances can lead to contamination of groundwater and other detrimental effects. Instead of flushing these medications, the safest way to dispose of them is to disguise them and then throw them away with your trash.


Read the packaging on the medication and look for instructions on safe disposal.
There are certain medications considered to be too potentially harmful to throw out with the trash. If the medication is a highly controlled substance that could cause severe medical harm to someone else if they were to ingest it, the FDA recommends flushing it or disposing of it in another way.
If you're not sure whether the medication you want to get rid of is considered to be highly controlled, ask your pharmacist what to do.;
, Mixing either pills or liquids with an undesirable substance like kitty litter or coffee grounds will make it much less likely that a child or household pet will find and ingest the substance.


If the pills are large or brightly colored, crush them or dissolve them before mixing them with another substance.
 This extra level of protection is another way to make sure the medication won't fall into the wrong hands., Once the medication is thoroughly disguised and sealed in a bag, simply throw it out with your trash.
 Scrape off the labels so that the print is illegible before you throw the bottles away. This measure is taken to protect your identity.

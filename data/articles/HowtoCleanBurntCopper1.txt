 Fill a pot or pan with water. Add a few squirts of mild dish detergent and/or a generous splash of vinegar. If you’re cleaning anything other than a copper pot or pan (or cleaning the outside of a smaller pot or pan), place the item in the water. Set the burner to medium heat and bring to a boil.For heavy build-up of crusted-on materials, substitute the dish soap and vinegar with a cup (221 g) or more of baking soda for a more abrasive cleaning agent.;
, Wait at least fifteen minutes once the water comes to a boil. Then remove the copper with tongs (or the item’s handle if it wasn’t submerged). Use any pointed tool (like a butter knife or screwdriver) to prod at the offending material. If it only seems marginally looser, put it back in the boiling water. Otherwise, set it on a heat-safe surface and wait for it to cool enough to handle safely., Once the crud gives way when you poke at it, switch to a brush, sponge, spatula, or similarly soft item to avoid scratching the copper. Use this to brush or scrape off the crud. For especially heavy build-up:Combine baking soda and just enough water to create a thick paste. Apply an even coat of this over the copper before you start brushing or scraping.
Repeat as needed, since heavy build-up may require a lot of elbow work, during which time the crud may dry and crust over again.

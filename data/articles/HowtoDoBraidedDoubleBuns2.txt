 You will be creating two Dutch or French braids, one on each side of your head, then twisting them into a bun.
 You will be braiding the other side of your hair later. If you'd like, you can secure the other side with a clip or a hair tie to keep it out of the way.









A French braid blends into your hair. You cross the strands of hair over each other.
A Dutch braid sticks out. You cross the strands of hair under each other.
 Do a regular braid for two more cross-overs, then secure it with a hair tie. The color of the hair tie does not matter. It is only temporary, and you will be taking it out later.
 You do not need to tie this braid off, but hold onto it tightly.
 Remove the hair tie from the first braid, and use it to tie everything together into a low ponytail., Twist the ponytail into a rope first, then wrap it around the base into a bun. Tuck the end of the ponytail under the bun, and hold it securely.
 Start pinning the bun in place at the top, then work your way down the sides and bottom.
 If you want extra volume, use your fingers to gently tug on the loops making up the French or Dutch braids. When you are done, give your braids and bun a spritz with hairspray.

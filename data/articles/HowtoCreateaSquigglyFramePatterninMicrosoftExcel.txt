The External Ring and GMLL x,y and GMSL x,y formulas are unchanged. All other formulas and lookup tables are unchanged.
Check that F7:F1447 with F7 active contains "=IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))"'
Check that G7:G1447 with G7 active contains "=IF(A7=0,G6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*SIN(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+E7)))"
Check that Sync1 refers to H2 and Sync2 refers to J2. Check the H2 formula, "=H1/GMLL" and check the J2 formula, "=J1/GMSL".
Check the H7 formula, "=F7*GMLL*Sync1" and the I7 formula, "=G7*GMLL*Sync1".
Check the J7 formula, "=F7*GMSL*Sync2" and the K7 formula, "=G7*GMSL*Sync2".
Check that the lookup tables are unchanged.



Edit Go To cell range F7:G1446 on the Data worksheet and using Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts All/Other, Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter. Copy the Chart to the Chart worksheet and expand it with the double-headed arrow via the bottom right corner.
Select Chart Layout and get rid of the axes and grid lines and legend; select Data Series 1 and make Line Weight 1 color Deep Purple from the Color Wheel.
Create the second chart with Plot Area background Black Fill. and paste in the GMLL and GMSL series and edit the series if they've arrived wrong until they read in the formula bar as follows:

=SERIES(,DATA!$H$7:$H$1446,DATA!$I$7:$I$1446,1) Burgundy Red
=SERIES(,DATA!$J$7:$J$1446,DATA!$K$7:$K$1446,2) Turquoise (Blue)Green
=SERIES(,DATA!$F$7:$F$1446,DATA!$G$7:$G$1446,3) Blue Purple

 You will need a light proof 3–5 gallon (11.4–18.9 L) bucket, a plastic net pot that fits the bucket, a fish tank air pump, some airline tubing, an air-stone, a PH test kit, hydroponic fertilizer and a thriving easy to grow plant like a sunflower.;
, Set the empty net pot on top of the bucket., <Very important. Otherwise the growing medium of the chosen plant will get soaked causing problems such as over-watering, fungus, etc.
 Until roots protrude through the bottom of the net pot the plant must be watered by hand but certainly not over-watered. The nutrient solution must be in the desired range for the type of plant being grown. Typically a PH of 5.5 to 6.1 is best and of utmost importance.


Other factors that are vitally important for the chosen plant to thrive are environmental ones such as Light, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, air circulation and growing medium moisture.

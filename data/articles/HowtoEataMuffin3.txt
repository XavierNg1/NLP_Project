 The paper cup, when unwrapped and placed flat, can help keep any crumbs from spilling elsewhere.
 Eat the muffin bottom first, similar as to how you would eat an apple.


This method tends to be rather clean, as the bottom part of the muffin can often be eaten in one bite, leaving the top behind.
Consider this method if you are on the move, but also wish to respect the cleanliness of your surroundings.
 You may eat plain, or spread an icing or butter on the muffin top.


Unlike when you remove the top first, you'll find that this method typically produces less crumbs, since you aren't picking it apart with your fingers - most of it will end up in your mouth!
Bear in mind that this method, along with eating the muffin whole, can appear somewhat uncouth depending on the size of the muffin. Assess the social situation first!

 Most coyotes are no longer afraid of humans and there are reports of increased coyote sightings in urban and suburban areas. In other words, a coyote who does not immediately run away when encountering humans has probably become habituated to the presence of people. You can help prevent coyotes from wandering into your neighborhood by attending to the environment in several ways.


Keep trees and shrubbery neatly trimmed to eliminate hiding places for coyotes.
Install coyote-proof fences or other motion-triggered deterrents like light or sprinkler systems.;
, Humans increase the likelihood of conflicts with coyotes by feeding the animals directly and by giving them access to garbage, pet food and other food remnants.


Clean up fallen fruit and birdseed from your yard and do not keep any pet food outdoors.
Secure your garbage and compost bins with rope, chain, bungee cords or weights to keep coyotes from getting in. To prevent tipping, secure the side handles to stakes driven into the ground or keep the bins in a secured shed or garage., When hiking, bring a large stick or umbrella with you in case of attack. It is also useful to have noisemakers, like air horns and whistles, readily on hand in order to scare off any approaching coyotes. Other options include vessels filled with chemical solutions, such as pepper spray or a vinegar-filled water gun.

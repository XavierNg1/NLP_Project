 There's a guitarist, a bassist, a drummer ,and a pianist. You can add an extra guitarist if you like. If their not from the same household make sure that they're friends with one another. This will make it easier to invite them all over.;
, Make sure that each of them has full creativity skill.
 You can play gigs. It's really just a tip jar for each of the band members, but a ONE sim can make over 800 simoleons in one night.

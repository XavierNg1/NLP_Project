 If your device is not rooted, this app will not work. Review how to root your android to prepare your device to connect to a private server.


Rooting involves downloading a software that will help you delete certain restrictions that the manufacturer places on your Android. It also voids your warranty, so be aware.
 You can use Host Editor to connect to a specific server IP address.Tap the "+ Add Host" button in the top right corner. This will bring up a menu asking you to input the IP address and Hostname. Search online for Clash of Clans private servers, and input the server IP in addition to "game.clashofclans.com" after the entry "Hostname".
 This will enable you to connect to the private server easily any time you want. After saving the host, you can return to your home screen.
 For this hack to work, you must uninstall the game following saving the host server. When you have finished uninstalling, you will need to download the game again, but when you do you should be connected to the private server.


You will not be able to use old save data on a private server, but the new server you join might have a high resource limit or a high rate of resource replenishment.
There is no penalty for joining a private server with different settings.

 Add your apple cider vinegar, ground mustard, salt, and aquafaba to a small bowl. Blend them together with an immersion blender until they’re evenly mixed. This should only take a second or two., Once the other ingredients are mixed, keep the immersion blender running. Very slowly pour in ¼ cup (59 ml) of your oil while mixing it in with blender as you pour. The oil will cause the mixture to thicken, which means you’ll have to move the blender around more and more to cover it all, so pause between each ¼ cup to blend and judge the mixture’s consistency before repeating.You only need enough oil to thicken the mixture so it isn’t runny. If it doesn’t drip or pour off the blender when you remove it after the third 1/4 cup, stop there. If it still appears running, add another 1/4 cup.
 Pour the mixture into a jar with an airtight seal. Place the jar in the refrigerator. Give it a few hours to thicken, until it reaches the consistency of real mayo. Once it does, use it as a spread for sandwiches, a dip for french fries, or as needed in any recipe that calls for mayo.Once a can of chickpeas is opened, the aquafaba will last for one week when refrigerated, so adjust the recipe's proportions if needed to make an amount you're likely to use up in that time.

 However, it should also give a summary of the entire Statement of Purpose. Many graduate committees will read your first paragraph to decide if the rest of your application is worth reading as well.
, Avoid empty phrases like "I'm talented," "I'm very intelligent," "I'm a great writer/engineer/artist," or "I had the highest GPA in my department as an undergrad." Instead, show them your worth through your professional Statement of Purpose and application portfolio and let them decide if you are amazing enough to attend their institution. Should you attempt to explain how amazing you are, make sure that you justify it. Yet, you must remain humble. For example: "I believe that I have the confidence in myself to strive for the furthest goal."

, After committee members have read a few dozen, all statements start to look alike; some specific and interesting details can help a candidate stand out. Of course, it helps if these anecdotes are related to the broad point you're making in your statement.
 Many students make the mistake of summarizing their CVs. Committees that bother to read your application know already that you're a good student; they now want to see whether you'll successfully make the transition to a more self-directed and unstructured form of learning in graduate school. They look for evidence of this in how you describe your past research experiences and your future plans. The key is not particularly the topic you propose--the committee will expect this to change after you get some more experience. Instead, they will look to see whether you have a realistic and well-informed sense of what a graduate student would expect to do to earn a degree.
 Carefully examine all the requirements on the university's admissions webpage before you submit an application.
 Four distinct Statements of Purpose for four different universities should be your minimum.

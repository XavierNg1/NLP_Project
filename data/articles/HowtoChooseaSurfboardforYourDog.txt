 Boogie boards have the speed and maneuverability that a dog may be able to maneuver better. It is small and a dog tends to feel that it can control it better, so this is the best board to start your dog with.;
, Hard fiberglass resin boards are tough for a dog to grip but easier to walk on. This means less chewing and tears, but foam boards are great too as they won't hurt your dog if it were to wipe out and accidentally get bumped by the board. There seems to be some controversy about which board is better. It's really a matter of choice; they both have good things and bad things. If you do use a resin top, reduce the slipperiness by putting on a deck patch(traction for your dogs paws so he doesn't slip). Whatever board you choose, don't forget to take the wax out of your dog's paws.
 As your dog progresses from the boogie board, a longer board allows for more margin of error. Your dog can navigate from the nose of the board. It is also great for tandem surfing with you, as your dog can grip on to the board at the nose and get better traction with the claws.
 The more curvature to the board, the easier it is for your dog balance on the wave. The older boogie boards tend to have more curve, are softer, and are better for dogs to balance on. The newer ones are very flat. You might be able to pick up older ones from online auctions or used surfboard dealers.
 Your dog will become attached to its favorite board and in response, will probably chew it. Expect it, along with all the claw marks from digging in. See it as your dog modifying the board for its own personal use. And in other words, if it's your prize board and you don't want bite or claw marks in it, don't use it with Fido!

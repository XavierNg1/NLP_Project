 Use your creativity and paint it, if you like. Make a clear "laundry" label on the jar and place it somewhere for convenience. Every time you walk pass it, for example, coming home from the store or work, separate the quarters from everything else and drop them in there.;
, If you're a person that uses cash more or instead of credit or debit cards, you'll soon find yourself swimming with loads of random coins. Go to your local bank and request quarter rolls or individual quarter change instead of dollar bills.
 When receiving cash back, ask the cashier in advance if you can get four quarters instead of a dollar bill. You can also do this when receiving cash back from a debit card. Check with the Customer Service Department or Courtesy Booth, if they have one, as well.
 Ask your parents or siblings if they have extra change so that you can exchange them for quarters. If you have dollar bills to trade, they wouldn't mind relieving their heavy wallets. Take other coins as well and trade them somewhere else later.
 Air and water tanks at the gas station or car washes always accepts change. Stop by your local laundromat and see if there's any available. Video arcades and casinos are also excellent choices for public change machines. For these, make sure that they give back actual quarters instead of tokens in return.
 Designate it for coin change and use it every time you get food takeout or go through fast food drive-through.

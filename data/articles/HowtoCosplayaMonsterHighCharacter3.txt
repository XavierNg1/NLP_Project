 Clawdeen is confident, energetic, dramatic, and fierce. Have a strong personality and don't be afraid to have your own killer style. Don't listen to negative comments, hold your head up high and be yourself!, Clawdeen is a fierce trendsetter and diva. Don't be afraid to exaggerate a bit. You can wear skirts, neon colors mixed with dark colors, flare or skinny jeans, etc. For Clawdeen's basic look, wear a purple skirt, a pink or animal print top, and a purple/black jacket. For Clawdeen's Dawn of the Dance look, wear a purple military-style dress, neon green tights and gold shoes and jewelry. For the Gloom Beach look, wear a one piece bathing suit with cut parts on the sides, preferably neon pink, blue, green and/or yellow.
 Clawdeen has brown, wavy hair. If you have brown hair, great! Then you can just put your hair in two braids and sleep on them, the next day, take them out and enjoy your wavy hair.But make sure that your hair is wet when you put them in 2 braids. If you don't have brown hair, it's okay, you can still be like Clawdeen (she dyes her hair sometimes anyway).
 Use some gold or brown eyeshadow, blush, and raspberry lipstick or lip gloss.

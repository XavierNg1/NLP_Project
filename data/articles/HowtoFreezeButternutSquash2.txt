 Locate a baking dish with deep sides that is at least twice as wide as the squash.









If you do not have any baking dishes that are large enough to fit two halves, you may need to use two separate dishes.
 Use a sharp chef's knife to cut the butternut squash in half from top to bottom.









Remove the seeds and stringy pulp with a metal spoon, melon-baller, or metal ice cream scoop.
 Position the halves so that they are flat inside the dish with the cut-side facing down. Add roughly 1/2 inch (1.25-cm) of water to the dish.
 Cook the squash until it just begins to soften.









Remove from the oven and let cool, 30 to 60 minutes, or until it has cooled enough for you to touch the squash without burning your fingers.
 Peel the skin away with your fingers and use a knife to dice the squash into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.









If you are having a hard time peeling the skin off by hand, you can shave it off with the knife.
 Place the cooked cubes on a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper. Freeze for 1 or 2 hours or until the chunks are frozen solid.









The cubes must be arranged in a single layer and should not be touching one another. Otherwise, the pieces of butternut squash may end up freezing together, making them more difficult to use.
 Once the cubes are frozen solid, place them inside resealable plastic freezer bags.









You could also use freezer-safe plastic containers, but glass containers are not recommended since glass is more likely to break when frozen. Leave 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) empty headspace at the top of the container to allow the butternut squash cubes room to expand.
Label the bag or container with the current date so you will know how long the squash has been in your freezer later on.
 Butternut squash can be saved for 6 to 12 months when frozen.









Pre-cooked squash cubes are often easier to use straight from the freezer, without thawing them first, than raw squash cubes are.

 Put a towel over your head and gently dab the moisture away hair. You can also tilt your head and wipe a few chunks of hair at a time. Dry your hair completely by sitting in front of a fan to let the fan dry your hair, and then brush your hair gently and thoroughly.









Try to use soft towels, such as those woven from cotton or microfiber. Rougher towels may damage your hair.
 Blow-drying can make your hair softer, shinier, and more manageable. Avoid blow-drying your hair every day, and do not blow your hair for more than a few minutes. Heat-based products like blow dryers and flat irons can substantially damage your hair, leading to dryness.


Consider getting a professional blow-out at a salon. This may be best if you constantly flat-iron or blow-dry your hair, as it is a less damaging way to get your hair straight. Some of the blow-outs may cause damage to your hair, so make sure that you go to a well-reviewed professional to minimize damage.
 Ditch your plastic brush for a wooden brush. The wooden brush will distribute your hair's natural oils over your hair from roots to tips, ensuring that it stays soft and shiny. The plastic brush can actually strip your hair of its oils, making it greasy, stringy, and broken. The grease results from your hair trying to replace its natural oils.

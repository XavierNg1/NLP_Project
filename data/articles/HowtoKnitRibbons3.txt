 Scarves are the best way to use slotted ribbon yarn because the ruffles will be on display. Try making a scarf from slotted ribbon yarn to create a luxurious looking scarf for yourself or for a friend.

Keep in mind that your scarf will look narrower after it is finished than while you are making it.
 If you want a ruffled scarf that you wonâ€™t have to wrap up or worry about tying, then an infinity scarf is a great choice. These types of scarves slip right over your head and hang elegantly. Try making an infinity scarf for a different way to use your ribbon yarn., If you want to wear ribbons on your head, then try your hand at making a ribbon beanie. You can follow a normal pattern and either use slotted ribbon yarn or regular ribbon yarn to create a ribbon beanie.

Keep in mind that if you use slotted ribbon yarn, then it will look like a ruffled hat. If you use non-slotted ribbon yarn, then it will look more like a normal hat.

 Foods like salmon and omega-3 enriched eggs are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients promote healthy brain function as well as cardiovascular health.
 You can eat servings of protein that are lower in calories and higher in fiber by choosing proteins like beans or tofu. Chop up some tofu and add it to soup or serve bean and cheese enchiladas with a side of rice in place of meat enchiladas.
 A good rule of thumb is to remember that a serving size of protein is about the size of a deck of cards. Generally, a piece of meat or other protein should be no larger or thicker than your palm.

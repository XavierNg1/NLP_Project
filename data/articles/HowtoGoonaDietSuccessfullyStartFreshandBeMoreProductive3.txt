 Look up a style icon. Mine is Audrey Hepburn. When you go to shops, make sure to buy outfits not items, or at least think of what you are going to pair the item with in your wardrobe. When you go on holiday, pack outfits, not your favorite items. Also, go out of your comfort zone. Go to stores that have free customer shopping experiences like H&M and topshop.
 A simple trim or change of look will make a huge difference.  If you wear glasses and hate them, consider contact lenses. If you like wearing glasses, but hate how they look, try on every set of frames in the shop.  . Get a haircut if you are sick with your hair. Make sure you get a style that suits your face shape and hair type. Discuss it with your hairdresser beforehand. Invest in a straightener if you want sleek straight hair. Invest in a curler if you want loose curls.

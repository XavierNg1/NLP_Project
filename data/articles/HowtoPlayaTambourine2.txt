 Traditionally, the tambourine head should be struck with the tips of your fingers. Hold your four fingers together and quickly strike the head at a location about a third of the distance towards the center of the head from the frame. Striking in the center of the head will produce a muddled tone, as the head will not be able to resonate fully.
 Ideally, when striking the tambourine, you should hear both a short jingling from the zills and a short resonance from the head. Adjust your striking force and location until the instrument's tone is to your liking.
 In orchestral settings, it is best not to deviate from this technique. However, in less formal applications such as rock or pop music, you have enormous latitude in choosing a striking technique. For instance, you can strike the tambourine head with your entire palm for a fuller sound.

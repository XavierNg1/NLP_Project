 Food, of course, will help sustain you through the afternoon. However, taking a break from work is also important. It will help rejuvenate your brain, letting you glide through the afternoon., Snacks can give you a boost of energy to get through the afternoon. Try picking a snack that's high in complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains or fruits. Adding some protein can also help you sustain that energy.For instance, pair some whole-grain crackers and veggies with hummus or eat an apple with some peanut butter., Simple sugars such as sodas and juices can boost your energy. However, you may find yourself just as tired in a short amount of time, as insulin works to bring down the sugar levels in your blood. Simple sugars don't give you the sustained energy you need., If possible, try taking a short nap. For instance, if you can take a late lunch, go down to your car to shut your eyes for 20 to 30 minutes. It can help you feel less drowsy through the rest of the afternoon. Even a 5 minute nap at your desk can help, if you can get away with it., The best time to drink some caffeine is actually right before you take a nap. Caffeine takes about 30 minutes to kick in, so when you are waking up, the caffeine will kick in. Even if you don't have time for a nap, caffeine can help give you an energy boost in the afternoon., If you become dehydrated, your whole body slows down. Make sure you are getting enough fluids throughout the day by keeping water on your desk to sip on all day long., While most of the time, you can't stop for an hour-long exercise break, even short bursts of exercise can boost your energy. Try taking a lap around the office or running up and down the stairs for a minute. If you can take a walk outside, even better, as sunlight can increase alertness.

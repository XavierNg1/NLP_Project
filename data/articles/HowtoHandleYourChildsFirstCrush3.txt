 One of the hardest parts of handling your child’s first crush, is accepting that your little one is growing up. Instead of resisting this natural part of your child’s development, accept that it’s happening and support your child through the process.

Talk to other parents about how they handled their child’s first crush in order to get ideas for how to cope with your child’s feelings.
Avoid telling your child that their feelings aren’t real or appropriate because you aren’t ready for them to have a crush.
 You may want to talk about your child’s crush every opportunity you have or supply them with tips on handling the crush. But you and your child will handle the crush better if you step back a bit and let your child experience their crush.Ask about their crush every now and then, but avoid interrogating them about it on a regular basis. They may get embarrassed, or even annoyed, and resist sharing anything with you.
Let them experience the course of the crush on their own. Although you may want to, you can’t control how they feel or how anyone else feels about them. Let them experience their crush without too much input so that it seems like a normal part of life rather than a big deal.
 While childhood crushes are a normal, and even frequent occurrence, you should also trust your gut and judgment if you feel something isn’t right about the situation. If you have any concerns about the nature or result of your child’s crush, you should strongly consider finding out more about the situation.

For instance, if you think your preteens’ crush on the neighbor is making him do things that break your rules, you should trust your instincts and address the situation.

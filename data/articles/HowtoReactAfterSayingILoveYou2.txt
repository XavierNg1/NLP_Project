, You might say Thank you Keanu (no exclamation mark implied)and give them a gentle smile. Make eye contact! It my not be their dream reaction but if you pull it off they will know that their feelings are appreciated, they haven't made a fool of themselves and that they have a chance. When the air has cooled a little you can say something along the lines of how you really like them or give them a meaningful kiss.
 Say that you are very flattered but not interested. Do nothing crazy, like crying or running away. Always stay very calm and treat the person well so as to not hurt their feelings.
 Period." If they are a friend t it must be handled very carefully because there will be a lot of emotion in the air. Say that you are flattered and how you think of them as a beautiful person, inside and out, but that you just don't feel that way. Be firm. (A sidenote- this is not something that can be joked about, not for now at least. Be sensitive.)

, After all, it must of taken a lot of courage to approach you like that.
 'Eh...thanks?' is not good enough. A genuine 'Thank you Tom' with a smile and a hug isn't the response they might have wanted but if you're not ready to say 'I love you' it's the next best thing.
 Life isn't the movies after all. It's your job to improve the mood. Do not rush away from the situation. A lot can be said in a meaningful silence if there are good feelings on both sides and they need a minute to gather themselves together. If possible move along to a different room or bring the topic around to something they really like. Don't act like things are normal; they're not. Do give them your undivided attention and make them feel valued if there are feelings. If you're flat out refused, move to a group of people to dilute the situation. If there are feelings on both sides, spend some time in private enjoying each others' company.

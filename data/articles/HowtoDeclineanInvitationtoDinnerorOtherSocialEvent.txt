 Is your friend inviting you? Do you work in a small company, and your boss is inviting you to dinner? Are you expected to attend this invitation? What would the consequences be if you didn't attend?;
, There are many social obligations we face throughout life, some more important than others. A social event that typically occurs once in a lifetime, such as a 'coming of age' party or someone's wedding, should have more importance over a night at the movies. How does this invitation rate compared with your existing obligations and priorities?

, Someone is taking their time to invite you to some event they feel is worthwhile. Thank the person for their consideration.
 If you're confronted in person with a verbal invitation, respond with a request to check your schedule. This may be communicated within a question, as in "do you mind if I check my schedule and get back to you?", or a statement, "I really need to check my schedule before I commit to anything".
 To an extent, truthfully give the person a yes or no response. Sometimes a direct answer is desired, especially if the invitation is a social event with an RSVP. Many invitations will have a form on the card to select either yes or no. In this situation, it is not necessary to give an elaborated response. If you're unable or unwilling to attend, simply mark 'no' and thank the sender for his or her invitation.
 If applicable, let the person know you are interested in accepting the social event at a different time or under different circumstances. Showing interest softens the rejection of an offer.
, If things are going really badly, just say, 'I'm really sorry but,' and say something realistic and important and if they say ok, then just don't answer any calls at the time and stay away.

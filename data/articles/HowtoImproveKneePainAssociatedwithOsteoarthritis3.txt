 As AposTherapy comprises two convex pods fitted to the bottom of your shoe, you'll want to make sure firstly that your shoes are sturdy enough to attach the pods to, and secondly that they are comfortable enough that you won't mind them being made into your primary footwear both for work and for play.
 AposTherapy needs to be fitted by specifically-trained physiotherapists, so go with your sturdy and comfortable footwear to get AposTherapy applied by a professional - that should increase the likelihood of it working for you.
 With the application process completed, you should be able to walk around as normal. The pods work to adjust your foot's point of contact with the ground, redistributing the forces on the painful knee and, in theory, realigning the body as well.

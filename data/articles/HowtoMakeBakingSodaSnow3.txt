 The older they are, the less of a concern this is. However, with young kids, stick around and oversee their science project and playtime in case they’re tempted to make snowballs. This might seem to them like an obvious way to have fun with fake snow, but keep in mind that baking soda is pretty abrasive in large amounts and not something you want to get in your eye. It’s not the end of the world if it does, but stinging eyes might be the end of fun time.Baking soda snow isn’t advisable for very young kids who still have a habit of putting things in their mouths, especially if you’re using shaving cream or hair conditioner as a wet ingredient.
 Cover the table, floor, or wherever you’re making fake snow with a bedsheet, towel, or similar material. Once playtime is over, simply bundle it up by its corners, shake it over the bathtub, and rinse the fake snow down the drain. Then vacuum the floor where any of it may have spilled off the sheet.With the exception of shaving foam, all of them are commonly used as cleaners, so there’s really no stress if a big mess was made.
 To make clean-up even less of a concern, take your project outside as long as the weather is clear. Avoid doing so on wet or windy days, since moisture and strong winds will dissolve and scatter your snow. Otherwise, do the same activities as you would inside, or even decorate bushes, patio furniture, or other outside fixtures with freshly fallen snow.

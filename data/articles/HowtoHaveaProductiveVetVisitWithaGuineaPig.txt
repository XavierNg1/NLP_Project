;
, This is in the general article as well, but in guinea pigs, take specific notice of (and record if possible):


Weight loss. It can indicate any number of problems.
Anorexia (refusal to eat). Weight loss may be accompanied by this, but if you take note of whether the weight loss is related to anorexia, it can help with diagnosis.
Scratching and hair loss.
Cold/flu-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, crusty eyes, labored breathing or cough.
Bleeding from any opening.
Lethargy (general disinterest in life, lying down a lot).
Swollen body.
Limping, head tilt or loss of balance.(1)

, The adrenaline of the vet visit may cause the guinea pig to temporarily hide their symptoms, so make a record to help you remember.
, If you have other guinea pigs and they have not been separated due to quarantine, bring them as well. They will provide companionship and a healthy example for the vet to compare to your sick pig.


Keep the guinea pig away from dogs and cats in the waiting room. The presence of these animals will cause additional stress.
 Refer to your written record.



Put a reminder alarm on your phone.

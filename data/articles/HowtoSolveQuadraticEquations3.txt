 Make sure that the a or x2 term is positive. Here's how you do it:2x2 - 9 = 12x = 

2x2 - 12x - 9 = 0

In this equation, the a term is 2, the b term is -12, and the c term is -9.
 The constant term is the numerical term without a variable. Move it to the right side of the equation:

2x2 - 12x - 9 = 0

2x2 - 12x = 9


, If x2 has no term in front of it, and just has a coefficient of 1, then you can skip this step. In this case, you'll have to divide all of the terms by 2, like so:

2x2/2 - 12x/2 = 9/2 =

x2 - 6x = 9/2


, The b term in this example is -6. Here's how you do it:

-6/2 = -3 =

(-3)2 = 9 =

x2 - 6x + 9 = 9/2 + 9


, Factor the terms on the left side to get (x-3)(x-3), or (x-3)2. Add the terms on the right side to get 9/2 + 9, or 9/2 + 18/2, which adds up to 27/2.
 The square root of (x-3)2 is simply (x-3). You can write the square root of 27/2 as ±√(27/2). Therefore, x - 3 = ±√(27/2).
 To simplify ±√(27/2), look for a perfect square within the numbers 27 or 2 or in their factors. The perfect square 9 can be found in 27, because 9 x 3 = 27. To take 9 out of the radical sign, pull out the number 9 from the radical, and write the number 3, its square root, outside the radical sign. Leave 3 in the numerator of the fraction under the radical sign, since that factor of 27 cannot be taken out, and leave 2 on the bottom. Then, move the constant 3 on the left side of the equation to the right, and write down your two solutions for x:

x = 3 +(√6)/2

x = 3 - (√6)/2)

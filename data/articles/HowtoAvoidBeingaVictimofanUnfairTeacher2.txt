 Many teachers make their expectations clear at the beginning of the semester. Learning these quickly and adhering to them will give the teacher fewer reasons to pick on you. Keep a copy of the syllabus with you during class as a reference.
Be sure to follow any special formatting rules they may have for homework assignments.
 Teachers want students to listen to their lessons. Looking interested and engaged shows them that you take your learning seriously.


Sit up straight at your desk.
Look up from your notebook to show you are paying attention.
 Make sure you are setting aside enough time to prepare for exams in the teacher's class. Maintaining a good grade in the class will show the teacher you are invested.
 Make sure you are raising your hand and answering questions a couple of times per class to show you are interested. Donâ€™t over do it. Some teachers can be just as put off by the teacher's pet as they can a slacker student.

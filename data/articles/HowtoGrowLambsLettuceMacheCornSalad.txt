, Purchase a container that has space for a dozen or more plants. That is the amount required for a small salad.
 Add the seeds or seedlings. Keep the container in full sun and keep constantly moist. A windowsill is an ideal place for it.
 Once the plant is about 10 centimeter (3.9Â in) in size, pick two to three leaves from each plant daily.

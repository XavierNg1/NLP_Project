 One should be bigger than the other, to be used for the handle. This can be found at any craft store.









Gather the rest of your materials. These include some tape, scissors (to cut the paper into squares), and, optionally, a small, heavy object, like a penny.;
, It should now look like a triangle.
 It should now look like a smaller triangle.
 Now, it's a triangle with a crease.
 The edge of the side you're folding should line up with the crease. Flatten the fold down.
 Then tuck the extra paper inside the kunai.
 This step isn't that necessary. It just makes a flatter kunai.
 Tape it.
 You may need to openÂ  the blade a bit to allow the tube to fit.
 Make sure there's enough of the tube that you can hold it. The extra bit, sticking out from your hand, should be flattened.









Optionally, before flattening the extra length of the tube, cut a chopstick to the length of the handle and stick it inside to improve the stiffness of the handle.
 You'll be making 90 degree folds in the flattened tube, in a counter-clockwise fashion.
 One piece of tape connecting the end of the tube to the unflattened section should do it.
 Make sure the handle is secure. Use extra tape here if necessary.
 Pennies work well and are cheap. This step is optional.
 Place tape over where the blade and handle meet, enough of it to seal and secure the heavy object in the blade.
 You've now got your very own paper kunai knife. Avoid throwing it at people as you could injure someone.

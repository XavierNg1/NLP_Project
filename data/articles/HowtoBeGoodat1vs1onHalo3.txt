 If possible, try to get your opponent to agree to play on a map you are very familiar with, thus giving you the upper hand.;
, You can predict their strategy if you have a good grasp of the maps. On most 1v1 maps, there are only two spawning areas.


For example, in Guardian, if you spawn at elbow, you will know that your opponent spawned bottom blue. He will either go towards you up the sniper lift or he will go up to yellow lift.
Elbow is the better spawn for the beginning of the game. It is better because you can get the sniper right away, your opponent will most likely go snipe lift which leads to an easy out BR for you right away 1-0, and you can get nice map control. Use sniper to get him to one shot then pull out that BR for an easy finish.
 Other power weapons such as shotgun or rockets are also effective and the sniper/shotgun combination is very powerful in this form of the game.
, Sticking your opponent is extremely useful in one player duels, especially as a last-ditch effort to take your opponent down with you if he is about to kill you.
 If you have a shotgun or sniper rifle, this is a good tactic, but if your opponent has explosive weapons such as rockets or grenades, then limiting your time in each spot may be a better option.
 Although anyone can get a kill, you'll need to out-think and out-play your opponent to win. Throwing a grenade and shooting with your battle rifle is a good move for example. Pick up all the tricks you can so that you have a good chance of winning.
, You may lose, but you'll earn the respect of your peers if you put up a good fight and play it through, rather than conceding an early defeat.

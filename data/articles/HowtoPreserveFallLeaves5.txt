 This preservation dries leaves, but does not preserve their color. Sandwich your fall leaves in between two clean sheets of heavy white typing paper.Use paper that is at least as heavy as typing paper, rather than something thin like tracing paper. Otherwise, the leaves may bleed through and create stains.
Lay the leaves out in a single layer. Do not stack or overlap the leaves since doing so will cause them to stick together.
Choose leaves that are in good shape. They should be recently fallen and moist. The tips should not be dried or turned up.
 A large, heavy book should work. To reduce the risk of staining the book or other pressing object, as well as the work surface, place sheets of blotting paper or paper towels in between the typing paper and the book. This will help to absorb the moisture from the leaves.
 Use an old book that you do not mind staining just in case the leaves damage the pages. Simply tuck the leaves away into the pages of the book. Allow at least 20 pages in between leaves for best results.

Telephone directories work very well, if you have one available.
Put weight on top of the book. The pressing helps press out moisture as well as keep the leaf flat. This can be other books, bricks, or any object with some heft.
 They should be dried; if they are still pliable, press them for another few days.

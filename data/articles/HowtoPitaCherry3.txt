 You will need a straw that is fairly rigid but not too large. If it is too big it will cut an unnecessarily large hole in the cherry., If there are any bruises, splits, or patches of mold then dispose of it and pick another one. If it is fine then continue.


Wash the cherries in water that is roughly 10 degrees (Fahrenheit) above room temperature in order to prevent damage to the fruit.
 Hold it on the sides, leaving the top (with the stem) and bottom exposed.
 Continue to push the straw through to the other side. The pit will be pushed out, hopefully with a minimum of the fruit.
 Repeat the steps on additional cherries until you have all you need.

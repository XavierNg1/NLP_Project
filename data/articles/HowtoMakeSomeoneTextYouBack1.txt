 Depending on what your relationship with this person is, there are going to be different boundaries based on social hierarchy, family ties, gender and cultural norms, etc. Are you close with this person, or are they relatively new to your life? Determine the nature of your relationship with them and you already have the foundation of healthy communication.


Amongst close friends and family there is often more space for being vulgar and less consequences for being awkward. However if we're texting potential lovers, coworkers, business partners, or anyone with whom we have a formal relationship, different rules of appropriateness apply. Keep this in mind when phrasing your text.;
, Starting strong, and composing a meaningful message can help you avoid this problem in the first place. Many people lead busy lives and choose not to respond to texts that are vague or do not have an obvious purpose or appeal. And so a lot of us are more likely to respond to messages that have a clear purpose. Ask yourself these questions:


What do I want to communicate?
Is there a purpose to what I'm saying?
How do I think they will receive my message?

, You've given a sincere effort at understanding who you're talking to, what you want to say, and how you want to/should say it. So now you know at least that whether or not they respond has less to do with your actual text, than their situation, or the nature of your relationship.

 Pour 36 grams potassium nitrate and 24 sugar into 60 milliliters hot water. Stir the mixture until the potassium nitrate and sugar dissolve.This mixture can be very smokey. Add aluminum or titanium flakes to the mixture for a more distinct glow.
 Soak about 3 meters of yarn with the water, potassium nitrate, and sugar mixture. Using a cookie sheet, arrange the yarn so you can dry them out into lines.Do not use acrylic yarn.
 Air dry the yarn by keeping the cookie sheet in a dry area that won’t be disturbed by pets or children.If you do not have time to air dry the yarn, dry the yarn in your oven at 300 °F (150 °C) for about 20 minutes. Remember to watch the yarn. Open the oven and use tongs to shuffle the yarn off the pan after 5-10 minutes to prevent them from sticking.
 Once completely dry, cut the yarn into straight pieces to make sparklers. You can make them as long or as short as you want but don’t make it too short because it can quickly burn your hand., Use a glove to hold these homemade sparklers. You can also use a clip, clothespin, or anything else to keep the sparkler away from your fingers and hand.

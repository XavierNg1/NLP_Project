 When you bleach hair, the cuticle (the microscopic scales on the shaft of your hair) open up, which causes the hair to weaken and sometimes snap. So when you wash your hair, try to just gently massage it into your scalp, then rinse with water. You want to be ginger with your newly bleached hair.
 Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils that keep it healthy. Since bleached hair naturally has less oil, you don't need to do this as much. What's more, excessive shampooing will lead to dry, damaged hair.


Avoid shampoos with wax and sulfates whenever possible.
 Conditioner does the opposite of shampoo -- it adds oils to you hair to give it healthy, happy sheen. Make sure you condition once a day to protect your hair and promote healthy growth with your new look.
 Hot water opens up your cuticles much like bleaching does, which can promote further damage from already weakened hair. When you shower, use the coldest water you can stand for the healthiest hair.


Even lukewarm water is better than a hot, steamy shower.
 Bleaching, which dries and opens up hairs, is notoriously bad for creating split ends. Split ends are when the end of the hair shaft divided into multiple, smaller hairs. This can travel all the way down your to your scalp, resulting in damaged, frizzy hair. Soon after getting your hair bleached, have a hairdresser clip off split-ends to prevent the damage from moving down the shaft.

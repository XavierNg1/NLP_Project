 For darker colors, you can use chalk pastels.


Colored chalk and chalk pastels are widely available at arts and craft supply stores, or in the crafts department of large retailers.Feel free to mix different colors of chalk together to make your own custom colors.
 You will be grinding the chalk or pastel into the sand or salt, so make sure your work surface is protected, or disposable, as the color might stain.


A clean piece of thick, strong paper or plastic is ideal. This will also make it easier to transfer the colored sand to your storage container.
When mixing different batches of sand, make sure the surface is very clean so the colors don’t mix.
 This method is a bit time consuming, so it’s best for making colored sand in small amounts.


The best sand to use for this is the white “colored” sand found at craft stores.
Avoid using sugar, as this will get sticky.
 Use an even motion for best results.


The chalk will gradually be ground into the sand or salt.
To make this go faster, you can also scrape the chalk into the sand with a craft knife, palette knife, or other tool.
For large batches, you can also pulverize the chalk beforehand with a mortar and pestle, or other grinding tool.

If you do this, use the powdered chalk in the same way as the powdered tempera method, above.
Make sure to clean your grinding tools very well afterwards, especially if they will be used for food.
 Feel free to alternate colors of chalk or pastel to create your own custom color.
 Make sure that your container does not leak or spill.

 Make sure it is in reasonable condition (without holes or stains) and fits you or is somewhat larger than necessary. Don't worry if it is stretched, faded or old - it is about to be transformed!


Avoid using a white T-shirt. Even if you do not get the suit wet, it may be too see-through to wear.
 Put it onto a broad, stable surface on which you can cut fabric. If you don't have a table big enough, lay an old towel out on the floor and put your T-shirt on top of that. (The towel will protect wood flooring or carpet from damage from the scissors).
 Using dressmaker's chalk (or a piece of bar soap), make marks to show where you will cut the T-shirt.


Mark the shape for the bottom of the bikini. To mark where the bikini bottom will be cut out, draw an hourglass-type shape in the middle of the shirt. Make sure that you leave enough space between the two curves to adequately cover your crotch, as well as making the two semi-triangles wide and tall enough to fit you. If you don't feel comfortable eyeballing it, take your measurements. (Remember, you can always cut off more fabric, but you can't add it back on without a lot of trouble. Mark cautiously.)

, Note that this square cut will not go all the way across the T-shirt - leave a few inches on one side of the shirt (including the seam) intact.
 Add pins to keep the two cut pieces aligned. Put them inside the hourglass shape you've marked.
, Include the seams in your cuts - you'll trim them off later.
 Your cut should run from the shoulder seam to the bottom hem.

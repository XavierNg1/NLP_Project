 While you may think it's best to focus on your abs, it's actually better to do exercises that work your whole body. That's because these exercises help you lose weight all across your body, which in turn takes fat off your belly. They also help strengthen your stomach muscles.For an exercise that works your whole body, try swimming, running, or walking., Many cities have adult community leagues for sports. Alternatively, your workplace may have a baseball or soccer team. Joining a team gets you active even when you're just having fun., While working your abs by doing crunches and sit-ups can help your overall health, it's not going to flatten your stomach on its own. That's because exercising increases muscle in the areas you work, but it draws fat from your whole body. Therefore, while crunches and sit-ups can be a good workout, you can't focus only on them to flatten your stomach.If your main goal is to lose belly fat, then it's fine to stick solely with aerobic exercise.You should be getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week.If you want to add in abdominal work, you can add 10 to 20 minutes to your routine.
 If you're like many people, you may eat when you're bored. Instead of reaching for a snack, go on a walk instead. Exercising instead of eating will help cut down on the fat in your body.

 The amount of bears you use depends on the number of popsicles you’d like to make. However, you can still enjoy the vodka soaked bears even if they don’t make it into the popsicle mold.


Keep soaking the bears in a cool, dry spot in the kitchen, preferably covered with plastic wrap. If you have curious pets who can jump on the counter, be on the safe side and keep these puppies well covered and away from interested cats, dogs or even kids.;
, There are a few ways you can do this:


Pour bowl of soaking bears into a strainer and allow the vodka to run down the drain (which would be a pity to waste all that good vodka).
Set a strainer over a large bowl so you can capture the vodka in the bowl and re-use for drinks later. The vodka may be flavored so you won’t want to return it to its original container.
 Don't overdo it, but simply coat the inside of the tray or cup so your pop is easy to remove once frozen.
 Fill cups or trays approximately ¾ of the way with drink base.
 Use approximately 5 gummy bears per popsicle.


Push bears down toward the bottom of the mold using a chopstick.
Don’t overload the popsicle as it could create problems with the freezing process.
 If you are using a cup, you may need to tape toothpicks to your stick and prop the stick in place on the sides of the cup.
 Consider adding a light covering of plastic wrap to protect your pops from any foul odors in the freezer.

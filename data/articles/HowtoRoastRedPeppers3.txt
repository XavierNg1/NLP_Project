 Wrap the peppers in two layers or one layer of heavy duty foil, making sure that you've got them completely covered. If you don't wrap them up, you'll still be able to roast them on your grill, but they can get a bit messy. You can, of course, just roast them without wrapping them if you don't mind the messiness.
 This will be hot enough to give them enough of a roast, but it won't be so strong that they'll get overly burned.
 Every few minutes, you should give them a quarter turn with tongs, just as you would do if you were roasting them over a gas grill. The peppers should feel charred and soft, and ready to collapse. This will let you know that you're finished. If they still feel tough, you can roast them for a few extra minutes, as long as you continue to check on them.
 Not done yet! Now you've got to carefully place the peppers in a sealed plastic bag or in a bowl covered with a plate so they can continue to cook and so that their skins become nice and soft and easy to remove. Do this for about 20 minutes if you want the peppers to be steamed to perfection. Then, you can cut off the tops of the peppers, gently remove the skin, and scoop out the seeds with a paper towel or fork and you're all done! Drizzle them with olive oil for best results.

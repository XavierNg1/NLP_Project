 Any chiles will work, but New Mexican, Ancho, or Californian chiles work particularly well. Make sure your chiles are red so your adobo sauce has its distinctive red color.
 Use a small plate to keep the chiles completely submerged. Soak for approximately 30 minutes. Reserve soaking liquid.
 On a high setting, combine the following ingredients in a blender:


Chiles
1 cup reserved chile water
½ tablespoon oregano
½ tablespoon cumin
Half an onion
3 cloves garlic

, Traditional adobo sauce is often served with pork shoulder, but you can also use beef chuck or even chicken. Do not fully cook meat in this step — meat will cook fully in the next step.
, Top with onion relish, guacamole, and serve.

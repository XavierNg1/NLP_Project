, Arrange a time to call back. You can say you'll call them "on the way" to something or in between tasks to guarantee a short call back.


Telling them you got the message too late to return the call also works.
 If it doesn't show up with a number you may want to avoid the call. Someone who expects you to avoid their call may privatize or block the number.

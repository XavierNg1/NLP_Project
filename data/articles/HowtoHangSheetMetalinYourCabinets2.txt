 You can purchase sheet metal at any home improvement store.


Sheet metal typically comes in a variety of pre-cut sizes.
Choose the size closest to the size you will need.
You will likely have to cut it to size or have someone at the store do it for you.
It should be about the thickness of a sheet of poster paper. If it’s too thick, it will be very difficult to cut and be more expensive.
Be sure you are not buying sheet aluminum! They look similar, but aluminum is not magnetic.
 Transfer the horizontal and vertical measurements from the reference marks you made on the door onto the sheet metal, and draw lines where you will cut.


Use a Sharpie® ,as it will easily make a solid line on the sheet metal.
You can wipe it off with window cleaner later.
 Cutting your metal requires a pair of tin snips, usually under $10 at your home improvement store.


Put on your leather work gloves, because cutting sheet metal creates very sharp edges. As you cut with the tin snips, chances are your hands will come in contact with a freshly cut edge.
Cut your metal as you would cut a sheet of poster board with scissors.
Go slowly and do not completely close the tips of the tin snips at the end of each “snip,” as this tends to create a sharp “tooth” along the cut line.
Complete the vertical and horizontal cuts and carefully discard the excess.
 Use a file to remove all sharp edges along both surfaces of the metal.


Also, slightly round the sharp corners.
Very carefully, feel the edges to make sure they are smooth.
 Before you attach the sheet metal panel, clean the interior surface of the cabinet door and the mounting surface of the sheet metal.


It is likely that the sheet metal is treated with an oily film when it comes from the factory, and adhesive will not stick properly to oily or greasy surfaces.
Use a household window cleaner to clean metal and the cabinet door.

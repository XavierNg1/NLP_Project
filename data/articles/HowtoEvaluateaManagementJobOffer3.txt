 Add up what you will be required to pay in gas, tolls, car maintenance and more. If there isn't any compensation for commuting expenses, list the approximate costs you will incur per year during your commute.
 If you are moving from another locale, you may need money to pay a moving company and a place to stay while you look for a rental or house. Some companies will offer relocation reimbursement, or you may be able to request it if it is a large expense.
 Some companies provide day care for a lower cost at their facilities. If you have young children and you have to invest in more child care because of the position, add up what those costs might be.
 This will give you a more realistic view of how your salary will affect your cost of living. If the company provides relocation reimbursement, day care or commuting reimbursement, only subtract the remaining portion after this is subtracted from your estimated expenses.

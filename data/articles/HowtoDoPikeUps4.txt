 A Swiss ball (a.k.a. stability ball, yoga ball, gym ball, or Pilates ball) is an inflatable, rubbery ball that can be used to improve balance and stability. By adding it to the pike up, your upper and lower bodies are forced to work together to stabilize, and all the work comes from the core. This makes it an excellent variation if you're trying to strengthen your abdominals beyond the usual crunches.


Your toes should be pointed so that the top, or laces, of your sneakers are resting on the ball.Keep your back flat and straight — not sagging or rounded. Your arms should be in push-up position, under your shoulders and straight (though not locked).Be careful when attempting this exercise. It's extremely challenging and requires balance, and you could harm yourself if your arms give out or you fall off the ball.
 As you raise your hips, the ball will roll forward. Do not roll the ball so far forward that you fall off — your toes should maintain contact with the ball while you are in the pike position.


Keep your abs very tight, your hips square with the ground.
 You may only be able to hold this position for a moment. Start with one second and, as you improve, hold for longer. Again, make sure your abs are tight, which will help keep your balance.
 Using your core for stability, slowly lower your hips back down, rolling the ball backward, until you are in the raised plank position. This return to plank is the completion of one repetition.


You may only be able to do a couple of reps at first. That's okay. Work your way up to doing eight or ten reps.

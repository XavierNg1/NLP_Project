 Shapewear is designed to smooth out any unintentional lumps and bumps you might have. Shapewear is available in a variety of cuts for both tops and bottoms and can be purchased at a Target or department store near you.Wear shapewear if you plan on wearing anything formfitting.
To choose the correct size in shapewear, measure your waist and the fullest part of your hips.Treat shapewear like regular lingerie – hand wash it in cold water and allow it to air dry.
You do not need to wear underwear underneath your shapewear.
 There are certain fabrics that naturally disguise panty lines and the thicker the fabric, the less likely you are to see any underwear. If you are going to wear something tight on your lower half, select a thick fabric, like denim or wool; the more textured the fabric, the better.If you still want to wear fabrics like jersey or silk, look for clothing in loose cuts.
Prints can also be useful in disguising panty lines.
 If you’re wearing a tight skirt, try creating a barrier between your underwear and your skirt. You can do this by adding a layer of tights or pantyhose, or by slipping a light slip under your skirt.You can also wear tights under your pants in the winter to add another layer of warmth and to conceal your underwear line.
Get rid of static electricity by running your skirt and slip through a wire hanger a couple of times before trying them on.

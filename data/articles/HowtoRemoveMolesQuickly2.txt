 Mole removal creams are an affordable and fairly effective method of removing moles at home.


Most creams work by lightening the mole until it is no longer visible, which can happen in a matter of weeks.
Stronger, over-the-counter creams focus on peeling the skin away layer by layer until the mole is removed.
 A general-use whitening cream can also be effective at reducing the appearance of moles. This works much like the mole removal creams since it removes the mole at a superficial level using skin lightening.

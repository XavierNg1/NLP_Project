 You're going to need more than one person to stage a stakeout, as you can't hang out in the lunchroom all the time. Therefore, talk to some of your friends at work, and make an agreement to "cover" the lunchroom, meaning that you stagger lunches so that one of you is in there at all during lunch., Once you've staked out the lunchroom, keep an eye on what's being eating by whom. If you notice someone is taking something that doesn't belong to them, you've caught the person who's stealing the food, or at least one of them. This step works best if food is labelled, so you can see who it belongs to., If only a few of you are in the office late at night, listen to hear who's going in the kitchen. Food is more likely to be stolen when fewer people are around. If you hear someone in the kitchen, go investigate. You don't have to confront the person, just see what they are eating. You may know who it belongs to. If it's not them, you have your thief.

, To do this, just use your fingers to make the hair that isn't "part" of the ponytail looser, so it is not pulled so tightly into the ponytail. Do this until you are satisfied.
 Using the tail, section your hair off into quarters, pinning three of them to your head. Use the comb to tease the remaining section. Make sure it is completely teased from the hairband to the tips, then spritz with hairspray and pin to your head. Repeat this process until you have an extremely silly-looking afro-ponytail, all four sections teased.
 This is the bun part (geddit? Fun part, bun part...no?). Gather up your afro-ponytail and twist very lightly, gathering all the strands in together. Wind this around the base of the ponytail to create a bun, as you normally would. Make sure the end of the ponytail is pinned securely at the back, and pin where desired to keep your bun in place.
 This is where you get artistic license You can put a cute bow in front of it, wear a bandana, pull strands out around your face...just make sure you spray it lots with hairspray, and you have enough pins in! If you shake your head around a bit and the bun doesn't feel secure, then make it secure! You can use closed or opened bobby pins.

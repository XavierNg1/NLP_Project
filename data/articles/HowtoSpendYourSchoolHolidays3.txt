 Sports offer a great means to stay fit and be social at the same time. Play a pick-up game of basketball, sign up for a marathon, or just swim some laps at the local pool. Most sports cost very little to get involved in and can provide hours of fun. Plus, it will be harder to find the time to stay fit while you are busy with school. Take advantage of the extra time you have now to keep yourself in shape.
 Make good use of your time by bettering yourself. Learn to play an instrument, take up gardening or knitting. The key is to take up a hobby you have always wanted to do that is still within your budget. You will be proud of your accomplishments when the summer is over., Museums can be fun, inspiring and educational. There are museums for art, science, history, and more. No matter what your areas of interest are, you can find a museum that will teach you more about them. Itâ€™s a great way to have fun while learning.
 Not only are you doing a good deed by adopting a pet, but you will have a companion that is always there keep you company during your holidays. Pets require a good deal of care and attention, so be sure you are up to the task. You can adopt all kinds of pets by visiting local pet adoption organizations or just stopping by your local pet store.


If your parents aren't okay with getting a pet, consider volunteering at a local animal shelter. These organizations are almost always in desperate need for volunteers. You will get to spend time with animals and have some volunteering experience to add to your credentials.

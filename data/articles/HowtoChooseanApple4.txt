 Apples release ethylene gas over time. This gas causes other fruit to ripen faster, so it won’t last as long. Store apples in an unsealed plastic bag, and when you can, store them in an area of the fridge away from other fruit.You want to leave the bag unsealed so the gas will dissipate from the apples themselves, too. If the gas is trapped in the bag with the apples, it will cause them to go bad faster, as well.
 Apples can absorb smells from other food if kept in close proximity. It is best to store apples in a drawer of their own whenever possible. At least try to put them in the fridge as far as possible from strong smelling foods.To help keep apples fresh, store other foods in tightly sealed containers so the smell will be contained and not spread through the fridge. Onions are a good example of a food that will pass its smell to apples.
Other foods to keep sealed and away from apples are garlic, fish, and most types of pepper.
 You may choose to leave your apples out on the counter, which is fine. However, apples left out of the refrigerator will go bad much more quickly. Stored cold, apples can last 6-8 weeks, while room temperature apples only last 1-2 weeks.


If you buy apples that are not quite as ripe as you want them, you can leave them out for a few days and then move them to the refrigerator. They won’t last as long as those kept cold the whole time, but longer than if you leave them out.
Apples left out can also draw bugs, which is usually not an issue in the refrigerator.

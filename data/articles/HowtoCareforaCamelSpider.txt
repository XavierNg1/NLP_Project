 These creatures are not cheap you will need.

At least 10-15 gallon enclosure, with heat control.
Hard plastic or glass lid with holes.
Sand, peat moss, or potting soil.
Water dish.
Logs, rocks, and other hiding spots..;
, This enclosure will need to be strong, escape proof basically. They are fast and can climb incredibly well. They will need anywhere from 3-8 inches of sand, peat moss, or potting soil to be able to burrow. They also enjoy other hiding areas such as rocks, logs, etc. A little water dish would also help but they get most of their water from their prey., Make sure there is no possibility for escape. Pull on the lid, smack and push on it to ensure that it won't be easily knocked off. Make sure it's on a solid ground/table and that can't be knocked over.,, Especially if you live in a colder climate you will need a heat control for this. Keep the enclosure at 80-95 degrees Fahrenheit, and 75 degrees Fahrenheit at night. At night, increase the humidity with a light misting., They will eat alive or dead mealworms, crickets, cockroaches, spiders, lizards, scorpions, mice, etc. They eat a lot so feed them every day and every other day with something larger.

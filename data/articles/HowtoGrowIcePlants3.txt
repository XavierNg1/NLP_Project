 This helps to remove air pockets and get the soil to settle around the roots.


If there are pockets of air around the roots, they will dry out and die.
 Do this for the first few months after you have planted them., Ice plants can be watered with a watering can, a soaker hose or the sprinkler. If they are watered with a soaker hose or sprinkler, set a 1-inch deep tuna or cat food can right next to the ice plants. Shut off the sprinkler or soaker hose when the can is full of water.
 These are extremely drought-tolerant plants that do not need supplemental water to survive after the first few months.They will begin to look a little rough, however, during extended periods of drought. The leaves will turn yellow or brown and shrivel. Giving them 1 to 2 inches of water every three to four weeks during an extended dry spell will keep them looking good.
, Use a balanced garden plant fertilizer with a ratio of 8-8-8 or 10-10-10.This means 8 parts nitrogen, to 8 parts phosphorous, to 8 parts potassium (or potash).
 Sprinkle the fertilizer on the soil around the plants but be careful not to get any on the ice plants. It could burn the leaves and stems.


If fertilizer does get on the plants, wash it off immediately with clear water. Water the ice plants right after spreading the fertilizer to help wash it into the soil.

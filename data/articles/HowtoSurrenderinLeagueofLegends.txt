 In order to initiate a surrender vote, the timer must reach 20 minutes if you're playing on Summoner's Rift, and 15 minutes on all other maps.;
, Use the /surrender command or click on the surrender button in the menu.
 At least 70 percent of your team must vote for the motion to surrender in order for it to pass. Teams of 3 or fewer summoners must all vote for the motion to forfeit. If a summoner does not vote, he is taken to be against the motion. If a vote to surrender fails on Summoner's Rift, a surrender vote cannot be initiated again for 3 minutes.

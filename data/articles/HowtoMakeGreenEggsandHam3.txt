 Get some white chocolate candy melts. Place a few wafers into a microwave-safe bowl. Melt them in the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir them with a spoon. Keep heating them for 30 seconds and stirring until they are completely melted., Place a piping bag into a cup and fold the edge over the rim. Pour the melted chocolate into the bag. Tie the bag shut. Do not cut the tip off yet.

If you don't have a piping bag, use a plastic sandwich bag instead.
 You can use any kind you want. If you really want it to look like green eggs and ham, get the sour kind in green. You will need two strips to make one serving of green eggs and ham.

If they are more than 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long, cut them in half.
 Cut the off the tip from the piping bag. Place a drop of melted white chocolate in the middle of one strip. Place the second strip on top to make an X., You can also use a different type of cookie as well. It needs to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. If you need to, glue the cookie down with another drop of melted chocolate., This will make the whites of the eggs. Pipe the chocolate around the edges of the cookie first. Next, fill the top of the cookie in with more melted chocolate. Make sure that no cookie is showing.

Jiggle the eggs and ham to help make the chocolate spread.
 If you can't find a green M&M, you can try using a green Skittle instead. The candy must be green, otherwise you don't have green eggs and ham., This will take a few minutes. If you can't wait that long, pop it into the fridge or freezer for a couple of minutes.

You can use the rest of your ingredients to make more candy green eggs and ham.

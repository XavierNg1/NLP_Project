 Unless you’re putting in new trim from scratch, the plinth block will fit right over the casing you already have in place with little difficulty. Stretch your tape measure across the bottom of the door jambs horizontally, then measure the depth of the trim to where it meets the wall. Write these dimensions down so you’ll be able to refer to them later during the fitting and installation phases.As the old saying goes, “Measure twice, cut once.” If you want your plinth blocks to fit naturally, it’s essential that you take down your measurements as accurately as possible.
 Most home improvement stores sell prefabricated plinth blocks that can easily be installed over your door’s existing trim. For many people, purchasing readymade blocks will be the simplest option. These blocks tend to come in standard sizes, so there will be no need to do a lot of guesswork if your home is already outfitted with a conventional trim style.Talk to a store representative or contractor if you have any questions about how to install plinth blocks in your home.
One downside of using prefab plinths is you’ll be limited in your style selection. Most commercial blocks will either be of Victorian influence or feature basic routing or beveling., If you’d rather fashion the plinth blocks yourself, you’ll have more say over the look of the finished product. Think about how subtle or ornate you’d like the moldings to be, then settle on a specific design that matches your sensibilities. Your blocks might utilize smooth, angled edges, a grooved face or simply stand out in relief from the door jamb.Ideally, the style of your plinth blocks should go with the rest of your home’s trim and general decor.Unless you’re an experienced woodworker, it will probably be a good idea to stick to simple shapes and designs.

 Scruffing is when you grab the fur on their neck (Be careful not to grab the ferret's actual neck. Their scruff almost feels like an extra flab of skin behind the neck.) Some say to then forcefully say "NO!" but this is WRONG. Ferrets do NOT know what no means. Scruffing and/or saying no will not stop biting but instead could make it worse due to the fact the ferret feels it needs to defend itself. Instead use positive reinforcement to reliably train your ferret and build a better relationship with them. You can stop biting by calmly and gently removing your hand or what the ferret is biting and ignoring the ferret until he or she is calm. NEVER physically punish your ferret they will learn not to trust you and will bite harder next time because they feel threatened and will defend themselves. You can then play with your ferret and treat them. If they bite again simply repeat the process. It will take a few repetitions before your ferret gets it. Your ferret then learns that when they bite the fun stops and if they don't bite fun continues. With consistency this easily teaches a ferret not to bite and does so without damaging your relationship.

 You want to wash your face at least twice a day. Acne is genetic and sometimes can not be stopped with just regular face wash, so see a dermatologist to see what they can prescribe you with. Cerave works very well and is dermatologist recommended. Do not scrub too hard as it will leave your face red. Buy washcloths only to be used by your face and wash them and your pillowcase frequently. Everyone likes a clean face.;
, Straight hair is the normal stereotype style, but curls work great too. If you have straight hair, you should wear it in loose curls every once in a while (twice a week is good), if it's curly, straighten it occasionally! Be sure to get your hair cut about every 3 months.
 You want to brush your teeth twice a day with whitening toothpaste. Then floss. Then rinse with mouthwash.
 Make sure that when you wear something that you put it in the wash as soon as possible. That way the clothes smell better and more like the detergent you're spending a fortune on. And to help the environment use the 2x concentrate bottles. People notice if your clothes smell clean or dirty.
 Have a good sense of style. Wear a graphic t-shirt with jeans, a nice tank top with a skirt/shorts. Putting ribbons in your hair either as a headband or as a bow when your hair is in a ponytail is a very cute way to top off every hairstyle. Designer Sunglasses are super cute, but if you can't afford it then knock-offs or just regular sunglasses are cute. Big purses are 'in' right now and so are designer purses, but designer are always expensive so look on eBay or just look around and you can find ones that look similar at a low price.

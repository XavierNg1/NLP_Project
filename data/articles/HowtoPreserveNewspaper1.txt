 Handling delicate newspapers that you want to preserve requires a lot of care and extra precautions. This means washing your hands before touching the newspapers to remove any possibly damaging residue on your hands. You should also have a clean workspace – like a big, clean table – to use while handing the newspapers.Make sure your hands are dry before touching the newspaper, especially if you just washed your hands.
Keep food and drinks away from the area while you are working with the newspapers.;
, When handling newspapers that you intend to preserve, try to never fold them except on their original middle crease. Keep the edges aligned neatly so that the center fold remains intact and other portions of the newspaper don’t get folded inadvertently.Additionally, you should avoid folding the corners of newspapers, even in a dog ear fold to mark a certain passage, as this will further damage the newspaper.
 Newspapers are extremely fragile and can be permanently damaged by contact with most other surfaces or items that aren’t intended for use with newspaper conservation.This includes paper clips, rubber bands, adhesive tape, or any kind of glue.

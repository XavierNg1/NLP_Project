 Take a sheet of paper in your hand and crumple it into a ball. The tighter the ball, the more creases your paper will have.;
, After uncrumpling the sheet of paper, fill a squirt bottle with your chosen liquid. Then, squirt the paper until the spots you’re looking to shape and color are damp.


Note that the liquid you use will give the paper a different look. Water won’t color the paper, but will enable further alterations. Tea will give a slight brown color, while coffee will give the sheet a darker color.
 Now that it is damp, the paper will be easier to shape. Try tearing off edges, removing small circles with your fingernail, or creating tiny wrinkles. This damage simulates the passage of time; the older you want the sheet of paper to look, the more damage you need to include.


If you want to make darker, deeper creases, crumple the damp paper again. Be careful not to rip the page in half.
 Place the paper on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. The sheet should completely dry in a few hours.


Alternatively, you can use a hair dryer to speed up this process.

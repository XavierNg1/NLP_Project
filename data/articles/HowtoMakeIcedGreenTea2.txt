 Brewing tea in hot water brings out the bitter flavors of tea. Brewing tea in cold or room temperature water does not do that. Instead, it gives you a smoother taste.If you'd more servings, switch to a pitcher and add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water for serving you want to make.
 Some people find that snipping the tea bag open and pouring the leaves directly into the cup results in a better flavor.If you'd more servings, and add 1 tea bag per serving into the pitcher.
A tea bag is equal to 1 tablespoon (2 to 3 grams) of loose-leaf tea., If you like a stronger brew, leave it in the fridge for 6 to 8 hours.
 If you are having more servings, take out more glasses. Plan on having 1 cup (240 milliliters) of iced tea per glass/serving.
 Give them a squeeze to release any excess liquid. If you used loose-leaf tea, don't worry about it just yet.
 If you used loose leaf tea, pour the tea through a strainer. If the tea leaves are finely ground, you may have to line the strainer with a coffee filter first.
 Be sure to stir the honey in well, if you are using it. If you made a lot of tea, store it in the fridge, and drink it within 3 to 5 days.

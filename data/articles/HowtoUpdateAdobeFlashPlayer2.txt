 If you do not know for certain whether or not your version of Adobe Flash is up to date, check it by visiting the "Find Version" page on the Adobe site. This page will automatically tell you which version you have and whether or not it needs an update.

If you are attempting a clean update because a previous “quick” update did not go through, you can skip this step, since you already know that your version is outdated.
 Click on this to have the uninstaller automatically downloaded to your computer.
 Close all open windows and applications to prevent anything from interfering with the uninstalling process. The only window you should have open right now is your uninstaller program.


It is strongly recommended that you close out of everything not needed to complete the process to avoid any loss of information or installation errors.
 Navigate to the uninstaller file you just downloaded and double-click the file to open it. The program will usually begin automatically, but if there are any on-screen instructions presented to you, follow them to complete the process.


Check the status bar as the program uninstalls. When done, the uninstaller should state that the process is "Completed."

, You will usually receive an output box stating whether or not you need to restart Windows. Even if you do not get this box, however, it is still recommended that you restart your computer.


Sometimes, some programs and files only allow themselves to be deleted upon reboot. Restarting your computer wipes as many of these files out of your system as possible.



If using Windows 8 or 8.1, you can skip this step. Otherwise, navigate to the following directories by copying and pasting the paths into your path bar in an Explorer window:

C:\Windows\system32\Macromed\Flash
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash (if you are using a 64-bit system)
%appdata%\Adobe\Flash Player
%appdata%\Macromedia\Flash Player


You should also navigate to the C:\Windows\system32\ or C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ directory to verify that files “FlashPlayerCPLApp.cpl," "FlashPlayerApp.exe," and "FlashPlayerInstaller.exe" have been deleted.
 Follow the instructions used in the quick install method for Windows to download the installation file and install the latest version of Adobe Flash. The instructions from this point on are exactly the same as those used in the “quick update” section.

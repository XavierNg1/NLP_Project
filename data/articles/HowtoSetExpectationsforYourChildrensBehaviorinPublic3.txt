 Even the best intentioned children are prone to get distracted or sidetracked (just like adults). When you see this happening, you should prompt your child to go back to doing things they way that you discussed before coming out. This gives them a chance to get back on track before you directly point out that they aren’t meeting your expectations.For example, if your child has strayed a little too far from the cart, you could say something like “Watch me. I can touch the cart. Can you touch the cart?” This will usually prompt them to come back to where they can touch the cart.
 If prompting your child does not bring them back to meeting your expectations, bring up that you talked about the scenario before leaving. This will remind your child of the conversation and the expectations that were agreed upon. It will also remind them that they agreed to those terms before coming out with you.For example, you might say something like “Do you remember when we talked earlier? You told me you would stay close enough to touch the cart. I expect you to come back so that you can keep that promise.”

, If the behavior continues to be unacceptable, you will have to discuss consequences with your children. Pull them aside quietly and talk to them rather than embarrassing them in front of people. Be sure to kneel down when you talk with them and stay calm as you do so. Make it clear that your expectations are not being met, and that in order for you both to continue having fun they need to start doing the things that you have asked them to do.For example, you could pull your child aside to an empty aisle in the store and explain that their behavior is making it difficult to finish the grocery trip. You could say something like “You agreed to stay close enough to touch the cart while we were shopping. If you can’t do that anymore, we will have to end our trip early. This means that you will not get a chance to pick out your cereal.”

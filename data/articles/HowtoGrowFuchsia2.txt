 Several stems, each with multiple sets of leaves, should have developed. Gently tug at the base of the center stem to determine if it feels sturdy. If so, tip the pot on its side, slip a short trowel into soil next to the side, and slide the pot away to reveal the soil beneath. If you can see white, even roots that fill the entire pot, the plant is ready to be moved to the garden. If not, you should wait a few more days or weeks.
 An east facing spot works best. Depending on the variety, you may need a location that receives shade by the afternoon. Varieties with lighter blossoms or double blossoms tend to need more shade, but bright red, single blossoms can stand a little more sunlight.
 In the hole, add compost and garden-grade manure, both of which are available at garden and farm supply stores. These elements improve the quality of the soil. Fill 1/4 to 1/2 of the hole with these elements.
 Slide it out of it current container and place it, root side down, into the hole. Pack more compost and manure into the gap around the newly planted root ball.

, Say you get 30 min to 2 hours per day, you don't want to waste time, so unless you're confident you can beat any bad guys quickly, just run past them and get to the objective.
 Before you know it you will be at your first boss, find his weakness. If it rushes you then try to make it crash or dodge/evade to get behind him to check for a weakness, if he fights at a range, fight back or destroy what he's standing on, you get the idea.
 Sooner or later you'll hit your first puzzle, not like a jigsaw puzzle, like a puzzle where you have to do ____ which unlocks ____ so you can get ____ to open the ____. It shouldn't be too much trouble, but if it is I find that writing the elements down and figuring the possibilities out on paper helps a lot.
 The Final Boss/Level is going to be the hardest thing you've yet faced, like I said in step 3 it has a weakness! but usually he goes through a cycle of events, one of those being his most vulnerable time to attack. for example, he might fight ranged so fight ranged back, then he comes closer to attack he goes like this for awhile, then damage him enough and he whips out a very powerful attack which depletes his energy so he rests, that would be the time to go all out, although it can take multiple tries.

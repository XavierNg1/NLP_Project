 Before you turn on your car, make sure all connections are solid and correct., Excess wire should not be sticking out and relatively close other wires of different charge. Use fuses for all battery to amp connections. If you blow a 60- or 80-amp fuse just by listening to music, then check specialty stores for 200- and 300-amp fuses.
 A thin strip can stop your entire system from being nothing but overpriced junk.

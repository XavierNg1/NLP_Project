 Even if you allow your rabbit to roam freely around your house, it is a good idea to have an area for the rabbit to stay when you are not around. This should be a safe, nesting area, so include a bed, toys, a soft towel or carpet to sit on, and a litterbox. This kind of regular restricted space is also good for cleaning., Rabbits are fairly clever and easy to house-train. Get yours to restrict the number of places it goes to the bathroom, which will keep the habitat cleaner, and make clean-up easier for you.Get a small tray with low walls so your rabbit can get into it, and fill with paper or untreated wood chips, then hay. Make sure you keep the tray near places your rabbit usually uses the bathroom so itâ€™ll get used the box as a place to go. If you notice your rabbit squatting, carry it over to the box.
Remember to clean and disinfect the tray at least once a week.
Do not use oil-treated wood chips like pine or cedar, or cat litters.
 Get excess hay, fur, or other items off the floor, which will make a cleaner area for your rabbit to stay in. Throw away the excess stuff to get it out of the room., Look for stains on floors or rugs. If you notice any, use a vinegar spray on the spot, then wipe up with a dry paper towel. If the stains are really set in, or have otherwise ruined the rug, throw it out and replace it.

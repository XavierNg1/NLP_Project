 Whether the person you are trying to communicate with can understand a single word you are saying or not, simple gestures can often be helpful in reinforcing meanings or conveying basic ideas. Use gestures such as pointing at objects that are almost universally understood.Using your hands to indicate size, location, and so on can be very helpful.
Be careful, not all gestures are universal. Some common gestures in America have very different meanings in other places. For example, the common sign for "ok" or "perfect" made by touching the tips of your thumb and forefinger is an offensive gesture in Greece and Turkey.So keep it simple!

, While it might seem silly, sometimes you can communicate by acting out what you are trying to communicate, like in a game of charades. People might laugh at you, but if you can get your point across, it's probably worth it.For example, if you are trying to find a good place to eat, you might act out the motion taking some bites with a fork, then rub your belly and and make a contented sound, such as "Mmmmm."

, If you're carrying a notepad and pen or pencil, you may be able to communicate effectively by drawing things. Looking for the bus station? Try doing a quick sketch of a bus.You can pass the pad off to the other person and let them respond using a picture too, if that helps.
 If you have a smart phone and access to the internet, there are numerous translation apps you can use to make conversation easier. Many of these allow you to simply talk into the phone and will translate what you've said to the language of your choice.Some of these apps are free. It's a good idea to download one before going on a trip somewhere where English isn't spoken.

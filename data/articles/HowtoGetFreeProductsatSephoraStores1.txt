 Chances are, there’s a Sephora not too far from you. It may be located inside a mall, a JCPenney, or in your city’s downtown area. You can use the Sephora website’s shop locator to find one., Try to visit the store at a time when they won’t be busy. If you’re available to visit in the middle of a weekday, that’s best. Most people will be at work, and the store probably won’t be busy.Asking for free samples when salespeople are very busy can sometimes seem bothersome or rude.
When salespeople have downtime, they’re much more likely to be happy to make you plenty of samples.
 You can ask for samples of any of the products that you see. Generally, Sephora salespeople are instructed to offer three free samples per customer. You can always try asking for more, but you may not get them. If the salesperson sees that you’re actually planning to buy something, they’re more likely to offer more than three samples.
Some Sephora “cast members” are assigned to certain “worlds” such as perfumes or eye shadows. It’s usually best to ask for the sample from the person working in that “world” rather than the cashier.
 Always express gratitude for the free samples. If you’re friendly and appreciative, you’re more likely to be offered more samples in the future. Let them know you’re excited to try the products at home and report back.

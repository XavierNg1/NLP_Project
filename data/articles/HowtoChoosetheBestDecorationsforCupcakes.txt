 You are probably saying to yourself, “I already know this”. Well, the cheapest way to decorate your cupcake is to use a decorative cupcake liner. When cupcake liners first appeared, they only came in a white paper color. Through the years, cupcake liners have evolved and now you can get them in almost any size and design. Polka dot cupcake liners and gingham cupcake liners are among some of the most popular liners that there are. Want a cheap and easy way to decorate your cupcake? Throw away those white cupcake liners and get some pizzazz going with decorative cupcake liners.
 After you find that perfect cupcake liner for your cupcakes, you need to find the perfect cupcake wrap to match your design objective. Cupcake wraps have become the biggest cupcake trend to-date. Instead of presenting your cupcakes in those plain cupcake liners, use a cupcake wrap the next time you want to dress up your cupcake. Cupcake wraps are like clothing for your cupcake. You don’t want your cupcake to be naked now, do you? Cupcake wraps are pieces of paper that are cut, usually by a paper laser cutter, to fit around each one of your cupcakes. Cupcake wrappers come in many different designs and sizes. They are available in mini, standard and jumbo cupcake sizes. You can find a design perfect for any party theme or event. Cupcake wrappers are placed around the outside of the cupcake liner after the cupcake has baked and is cooled. You do not want to bake the cupcake wraps as they will catch on fire and burn your house down. After the cupcake wrap is placed around the cupcake, then you will apply your frosting., The typical edible cupcake decoration is usually the cupcake sprinkles. Sprinkles are fine, if you want the regular run-of-the-mill cupcake, but there are so many more options for edible cupcake decorations in order to bedazzle your cupcake. Today, they have edible decorations like colored sanding sugar, edible glitter, edible confetti and even edible spray paint. One example of using an edible decoration would be to top your cupcake with brown sanding sugar. This would make the cupcake’s top look like a sandy ground. Purchase some edible candy seashells and put on top of the brown sugar. Now you have a sandy beach theme going and would be perfect for the beachcomber’s birthday party.
 Cupcake toppers are very popular. If the cupcake liner, cupcake wrapper and the edible decorations just aren’t cutting it for you, then move on up and add a cupcake topper. To conclude the decorating idea from the edible cupcake decorations section, you could purchase a cupcake topper like a surfboard and use the sandy ground and seashells as a backdrop for your cupcake toppers. What do you end up with? A beach themed cupcake decorated just like the professionals. The sky is the limit with these easy and affordable cupcake decorations. Don’t forget the sea blue cupcake wrapper to complete the look.

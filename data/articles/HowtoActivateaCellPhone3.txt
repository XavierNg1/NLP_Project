 In order to activate your used phone, you will need to insert a SIM card for your plan.


Unless the device has been unlocked, it can generally only be activated on the same carrier it was originally activated on.
 This may not be required during activation, but it can be helpful to have around.


Dial *#06# to display your new phone's IMEI number. You can also usually find it printed on the phone itself, either on the back or behind the removable battery.
 The quickest way to get your used phone activated will be to call the carrier directly. It may be difficult to activate the phone using the online site, especially if it is older.

 A boned corset would be ideal, but any form-fitting top in black velvet, satin, lace or brocade will do the trick. Look for elaborate designs with some metal accents, such as grommets, buckles or zippers. In terms of color, black, dark purples and deep reds are best, although a ruffled, immaculately white shirt can be striking.
 A full-length, floor-skimming skirt is essential to complete your vampire costume. Try to find full-skirted black tulle for a glamorous edge, or choose figure-hugging satin to reveal your seductive side.
 Wearing high heels will elongate your figure and and ensure your vampire costume retains its classy style from head to toe. Wearing heels will also lend you an air of confidence and authority essential to any female vampire. Again, black is best, either in matte leather or shiny patent.

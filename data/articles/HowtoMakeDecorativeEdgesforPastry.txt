 This is one of the most well-known pastry edgings and it's very simple. Use a fork to press evenly around the entire outer edge of the pie or other pastry item. It is best if the fork is floured before pressing, to prevent sticking.;
, Again, this is a very simple edge and requires only your fingers. Press the edge of the pastry between your thumb and forefinger to raise the pastry edge. Continue all the way around the pastry until it joins up again.


Make a crimped edge. This is a variation on the previous edge. Use your forefinger and thumb the press as before, only this time also use your other forefinger to create an indent where each peak has been made.
 This requires a teaspoon. Press an upturned teaspoon on the pastry edge to create half circles.
 This is made by using leftover pastry pieces. Roll these into long rope shapes and then twist two strands together so that they weave around each other. Attach to the pastry by moulding it around the edges. Keep in place with egg wash or tiny dabs or water.
 This is a slightly more complicated than the roped edge. Cut three long strips of pastry and plait (or braid) them into one long length. Attach to the pastry edge as in the roped edge step.
 Take the edge of the pastry and stand it up. Make even diagonal cuts all the way around the edge. Once the cuts are in place, bend one in and one out in alternate turns.
 You can make a lot of different shapes out of pastry and attach them to the edge with water or egg wash. Some suggestions include:


Stars
Crescent moons
Leaves - cut the leaf shape and create the vein design with a knife
Animals from cookie cutters
Hearts
Flowers, etc.

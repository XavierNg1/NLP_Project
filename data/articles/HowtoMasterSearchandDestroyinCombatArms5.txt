 If it's a small map you should find a spot where you can easily check both sites for enemies and if it's a large map you should run between the sites every now and then. Most of the times you will know what site they are planting at - for example if you are camping one site and the other teammates are camping another and you see that they are killed you know that enemies are at the other site and will likely plant there.
 Unlike a solo Alpha player which can merely distract the enemies once he/she planted the bomb you actually need to defuse it and chances are high you get killed while doing so if there are any enemies left alive. This is why it's important to predict what site they will plant at as you only have 30 seconds once the bomb is planted. As for Alpha, if you have clan members available through Vent/Skype they might be able to help you. Quickly get there and if there are several enemies look at the common camping sites and try to take them out.
 If you are running out of time (you need at least 7 seconds to defuse the bomb) and there are still enemies alive you have to take the risk of getting killed because otherwise your team loses anyway. Check so there are no mines around and then hold your thumbs while defusing.

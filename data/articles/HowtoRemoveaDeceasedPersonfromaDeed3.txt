, The surviving owners of the property will be required to submit a certified death certificate proving that a person who owns the property is deceased.


To get a copy of the death certificate, you can either ask for one from the mortuary or funeral home where the decedent’s final arrangements were carried out, or, if you are unable to get a copy at the time of the death, you can contact your state’s vital records office and request a copy., If there were more than two owners besides the decedent, you may be required to file an affidavit of ownership.An affidavit of ownership is simply a document that you use to prove that you own the property. Check with your local authorities for additional detail if you believe that you may need to file this type of affidavit.
You can build and print your own Affidavit of Ownership here. The basic information you will need to include on the affidavit includes:

A legal description of the property
Statement of ownership (include all owners and information about how ownership passed from the deceased to the new owners)
A statement describing the possession history of the property and whether there have been any title disputes or liens.
The purpose of the affidavit
Your signature (or the signature of all owners)


The affidavit should be signed in front of a notary public, who should then notarize the document before you submit it to the courthouse.

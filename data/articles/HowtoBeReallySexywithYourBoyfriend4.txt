 If you think you look sexy, your boyfriend will think so, too. Instead of asking him for reinforcement about your looks, be proud to show off your beautiful face and body.


Pick at least three attributes you love about yourself, and show 'em off. If you love your legs, wear a shorter skirt, and if you think your arms are to die for, expose them in the perfect tank top.
Have fun with your body. Dance in front of the mirror to your favorite song, and you'll see how much fun it is to inhabit your body.
Be healthy. Eating right and exercising can have a positive impact on the way you think about yourself. Exercise can also be an opportunity to do something sexy with your boyfriend, like taking salsa lessons.
Pay attention to the way you talk about your body. If you're wearing a new dress, instead of asking your boyfriend, "Do I look okay in this?" tell him, "Don't I look fabulous in this?" He'll be turned on by your love for your looks.
 There's nothing sexier than showing your man how confident you are. Instead of spending time telling you that you're amazing, he'll be busy loving your natural ease with yourself, which will make you look even more sexy. Here are some ways to be confident:


Be aware of the things that make you a beautiful, unique, and talented individual. When you're having doubts, remind yourself of these qualities. It may even help to write them down.
Be confident--to a point. Part of confidence is accepting that you are a flawed individual. You're already awesome, but there's always room for improvement. Your boyfriend will be impressed not only by your confidence, but by how comfortable you are in admitting you're not perfect.

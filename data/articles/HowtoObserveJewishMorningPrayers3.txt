 Customs vary in almost every respect, and you should consult your rabbi on what is the right way to wear the hand portion of the shel yad. A common way is:


Once you are wearing your tefillin, talking outside of praying is strictly prohibited unless necessary, or if you are going to speak words of learning.
Start by wrapping the strap toward the insides of your hand
Continue wrapping the strap on your middle finger, once on your middle knuckle and twice around your bottom knuckle
Continue wrapping the strap around your fourth finger, and slip it over to the outside of your hand
Wrap the strap into the inside of your hand, and around one more time to for a Hebrew letter "Shin," as in the picture above

 Chocolate is always a good flavor but you can make it into any flavor you want!;
, Add the frosting to the top of the cupcake. If you are serving this to guests, it may be best to put on a dairy free frosting -- carrot is a good idea.
 You can make this yourself by melting the chocolate and molding it into shape or you can ask a local chocolate maker to create some for you. You could also use chocolate frosting and apply it with a medium-soft paint brush, or squirt it on.
 Add a small round chocolate cookie or truffle to the center of the scarf. If using a cookie, stand it upright as shown in the image. If using a truffle, sit it on firmly in the middle.
 Make sure you don't paint on the scarf! Apply a little frosting to the head a time. If you glob it on, the frosting will drip down onto the scarf.
 You can also add small jelly candy, or leftover candy corn (from Halloween) for the nose.
 Put a lovely big smile!

, Add a small flat cookie to the top of your snowman's head.
 Place a square chocolate candy on top of the round cookie brim. Use melted chocolate or frosting to glue the chocolate to the cookie.
 Sprinkle a little powdered sugar or coconut flakes over your snowman. If you're serving them on a serving plate, it may be a good idea to only apply the "snow" when it's on the platter. You can also cover the platter and snowman with "snow".

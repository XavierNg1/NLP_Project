 For this sorbet, you'll need:

1 medium watermelon (approx. 2 lb or 1kg)
1 cup/ 200g granulated sugar
1 cup/250ml water
1/4 cup/60ml freshly squeezed lemon juice
Fresh mint leaves, for garnish.
 Choose a watermelon without blemishes or nicks in its skin., Add the sugar and water to the saucepan. Heat over a medium heat, then bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Stir constantly for two to three minutes, or until the sugar completely dissolves. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.,

Slice a little off the base of the watermelon so that it will sit without rolling. You can make the base either sideways or vertical, whichever way you'd prefer to display the watermelon.
Cut off the top third of the watermelon. Scoop the flesh out with care, using a dessertspoon. Take care to leave the skin completely intact.
Remove the seeds from the flesh.
 Place into the freezer. It will remain in here until serving time., Place the watermelon flesh into the blender or food processor. Add the lemon juice. Process until smooth., Pour the resulting mixture into your usual ice cream maker. Freeze following the manufacturer's instructions.

If you don't have an ice cream maker, use a baking dish. Freezer for an hour, then remove and chop up the sorbet with a fork and return to the freezer to freeze again.
 For a really fancy touch, pipe the top layer in to make it appear more interesting. Add a mint leaf or two for garnish, then place the lid on top., Provide a scoop or large spoon for guests to help themselves from the watermelon base.

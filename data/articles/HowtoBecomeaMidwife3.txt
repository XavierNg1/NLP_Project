 Each midwifery program has a different "personality." Some require a degree in nursing before the midwifery study begins, and others are more focused on the philosophical, political or spiritual aspects of the profession. Find a program that's right for you and start the application process.


The majority of midwives working in the United States today are Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs). This certification is recognized in all fifty states.
It is possible to become a midwife without also being a nurse and become a Certified Midwife (CM). This certification is only recognized by a few states. Choose the professional path that is right for you.
Your personality is as important as your grades when it comes to getting into midwifery programs. Read books written by midwives and do research on the politics of the profession to inform your personal statement and essay. Demonstrate your passion for becoming a midwife. Explain why you think midwives play an important role in society today.
 This will include a set amount of courses, a clinical internship and, depending on the program, a degree in nursing.
 In most countries you are required by law to take and pass an examination in order to get a license to practice midwifery.
 You can look at hospitals, clinics, and birthing centers. Consider setting up a private practice.


In addition to practicing as a midwife, you can use your knowledge to work as an educator at the undergraduate or graduate level.
Health policy is another popular choice for CNMs and CMs.
Some midwives work at nonprofits or other organizations that provide advocacy for women making their own health decisions.

Housefax will check the address to determine if there is enough information on the property to provide a valuable report.
 If the information is available, Housefax will display the payment page. Select the package you would like by clicking on the package price.
 If you select the full package that includes the Property History Report and the additional Claims Report, then you will be asked a series of questions about whether you are the homeowner. We need this information to be able to legally gain authorization from the homeowner before providing the Claims report. Everyone will receive the Property History Report immediately. However, if you are not the homeowner, Housefax will need to get the homeowner's authorization before sending the Claims portion.
 For first-time users of the site, or for users that have not created a Housefax account, you will be asked whether you want to create a password so that you can come back to Housefax anytime to retrieve your report. Housefax stores the report for you if you create a password. The password, combined with your email address will allow you to gain access to your purchased reports anytime.

The Housefax Claims Report will take an hour to several days depending on whether you are the homeowner. Once Housefax processes the Claims report, you will be notified by email.

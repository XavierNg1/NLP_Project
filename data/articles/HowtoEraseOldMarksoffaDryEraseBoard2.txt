 Rub ordinary white toothpaste onto marks on the board. Wipe clean. Toothpaste contains a very mild abrasive and is water soluble.








This method will also remove permanent marker marks from most smooth, non-porous surfaces.
Any brand will work.
 Spray a light film of hairspray on the old marks. Let it soak in for a couple of minutes, then wipe off with a paper towel or cotton rag. Clean off any residual stickiness with soap and water.









You can also clean off old marks with spray deodorant.
 Clean the old marks with a muscle cream like Ben-Gay. This removes permanent marker stains with only a few wipes. Muscle cream is less abrasive than toothpaste, and it contains alcohol, which makes it a great cleaning agent.
 Pour a generous amount of acetone on a sponge or paper towel. Wipe a section of the board. Repeat the process in the same section of the board using more acetone on a new paper towel. Wipe the board clean with a dry paper towel.









Acetone is combustible. Dispose of the paper towels responsibly.

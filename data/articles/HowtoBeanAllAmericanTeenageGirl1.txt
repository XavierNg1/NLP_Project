 American culture values independence, so being “all-American” means you’re not afraid to say what you think. Share your opinions, respectfully, even when others disagree you. Be honest and confident when sharing your opinions. Make eye contact. This shows people that you are confident and trustworthy.
State your case clearly. Avoid words and phrases like “maybe,” “um,” “I think,” and “I’m not sure.” They make it seem like you either don’t know what you’re talking about or don’t really believe what you’re saying.;
, When you’re “all-American,” you’re not just willing to say what you think; you back it up with action. Get involved in issues that you think are important. Work hard to achieve what you think is right.


Make contact with decision-makers to let them know what you think. This could mean making phone calls, creating or signing petitions, or using social media.
Get involved in your community by volunteering with local clubs or organizations.
If you’re old enough, vote in local, state, and national elections.
 Part of being independent means accepting that other people are unique individuals, too. As an “all-American” girl, you don’t always have to like what other people think, and you’re not expected to. However, it’s important to remember that they have the right to their own opinions, just like you do. Make sure that you respect other people the same way that you want them to respect you.

 Unfortunately, many symptoms of pneumonia don't show in pigs until the situation is life-threatening.Any sign of going off food during winter should be treated as an early warning to consider with great care. Symptoms of pneumonia in a pig include:Disinterest in food, loss of appetite, picky eater. (Number one worry sign.)
Coughing.
Lying down (sick pigs will usually lie down while other pigs are up and about).
A dull appearance.
Thumping (shallow, rapid breathing).
Fever and lethargy.;
, Anything over 101ºF is a fever in a pig, and pneumonia ranges from 102ºF to 104ºF at the start.The temperature is taken through the rectum; for tame, pet pigs this may be an approachable task but for larger pigs that do not have regular human contact, this is an affair that should be approached with caution. Pigs are very strong and can cause severe injuries.
 Your pig will need a course of antibiotics or "antibacterials" and the sooner the treatment begins, the better the pig's chances of survival. The vet may prescribe these as injections or feed-given.
 Keep the pig well fed and ensure that the pig receives the full antibiotics course.
 Things to consider include:Removing any sources of stress from the pigs' environment.
Ventilating the pigs' housing adequately, without creating draughts.
Preventing overcrowding.
Keeping pigs warm during severe cold weather.
Keeping pigs wormed and drenched against internal parasites.
Speak with your vet about developing a management plan for the herd if your pigs continue to get pneumonia. All pigs and piglets at risk of contracting pneumonia should be vaccinated against the possibility.

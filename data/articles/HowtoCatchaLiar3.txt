 If you are talking to someone and something seems out of place, they may be lying. You can sometimes pick up on subtle cues that you are not even consciously aware of. These cues manifest as a feeling of unease or a ‘gut feeling’ that tells you something is wrong., When someone is lying, their emotions may not match their words or actions. If someone is saying that they are sad, but seem to be laughing, they might be lying about something. They also may be lying if their emotions do not match the situation.For example, someone who is having a good time at a funeral may be lying about how sad they are.
 If someone is breaking bad or uncomfortable news, they may look like they are lying. Likewise, if they are under stress, their behaviors may be a little odd. When you have no reason to assume the person is lying, it is best to trust them.For example, if someone tells you that they were in a car accident earlier that day while laughing, do not assume that they are lying.

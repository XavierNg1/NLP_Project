 This is to find out if you did receive the chest. It should be under the system mail tab and the mail should say:


Your Friend sent you a Special Evony Happiness Chest!;
,, If you have a chest awaiting to be accepted, then the present will move a little.
 It is called 'My Package Locker'.
 (If there is any other chest that says 'Requirement Unmet', ignore it. It means that you do not have the ability to open it without doing something first.)

, To check, look under the page and you can see all of the packages you have claimed previously.


To open it, you must have the Silver Key. You can get it by buying it with dollars. The Silver Key can be used only once.

 If your partner did something that bothers you, take time to process things before you lash out. If you need to go for a walk or have some alone time, excuse yourself and go collect your thoughts. Once you think through the situation, you will be able to choose your response carefully., When you feel yourself getting angry, frustrated, or upset, pause and reflect on whether it's worth it. Sometimes, your emotions show something's wrong that warrants discussion. Other times, however, anger and frustration can be due to minor annoyances that can be let go.For example, if your spouse made a comment that hurt your feelings, this is definitely something to discuss. If you're annoyed by a bad habit, like your spouse occasionally leaving a dirty dish in the sink overnight, this is something you can let go.
 While thinking over the issue, try not to let your thoughts unfurl. It's easy to take a small thing, like who's going to do the dishes that night, and let it turn into you examining who does more chores in general. This can make small matters seem bigger than they really are. Focus on the single issue and how it made you feel.

 Gas, vomiting, and diarrhea are symptoms of a problematic diet for the dog. If the dog is exhibiting any of these symptoms, they may not be adjusting to their new food. To ensure that they are in good condition, you should inspect the dog’s feces after they eliminate. Look for runny or loose stools; these indicate that the dog is having gastrointestinal distress.Consult your vet to find a better food.
 If at any point at the process the dog starts vomiting or having diarrhea, you should give them a few extra days on the last step of the process. For example, if you just increased the ratio of new food to 75% and they are having problems, return to feeding them a 50-50 ratio of old and new food. After a few days, try increasing the amount of new food again.Because different dogs adjust differently to food transitions, it is important that you keep extra food on hand. While most dogs may take ten days to transition to new food, you should have at least a two week supply of the old food, if not more, just in case the dog does not transition well.
 If you have tried slowing down the feeding transition and the dog is still sick, they may be allergic to an ingredient in the new dog food. Slowly transition the dog back to their old food by gradually increasing the old food and decreasing the new food., If the dog’s stomach problems continue or if the dog is refusing to eat, you should visit their vet for advice. The vet may be able to diagnose an allergy, find a balanced food that benefits the dog, or recognize another underlying condition that may be causing their problems.

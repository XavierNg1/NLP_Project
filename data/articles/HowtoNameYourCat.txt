 You don't want to name your cat Princess and later discover it's a boy. Determining the gender of a newborn cat can be challenging, regardless of where you acquired the kitten. The best way to do so is by judging the relative distance between the anus and the urinary tract opening.;
, If there is a black splotch surrounding their eye, consider a name like Pirate. If your cat is completely black except for her white paws, consider the traditional but cute name, "Boots".
 If this will be a family cat, make sure to consider the kid's choices too. If the children want to name the kitten after himself/herself, you might not want to take him/her up on his suggestion. But if your sister or brother thinks of "Peanuts", for example, that's not a bad name. Have everyone make a list of three names they think are good options, then share the lists and come up with a name everyone will like.
 If the cat is always hiding, maybe he could be "Bashful". Or if your kitten has a weird habit of crying during thunderstorms, but only when lightning crashes, you could call him/her "Lightning".
 There are many interesting and unique names available in these categories.
 Once you've found one that you like best, stick to it to avoid confusion.
 Pet and spend time with the cat while saying its name over and over.

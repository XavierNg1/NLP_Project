 Blades wear down naturally over time. The more you use your blade, the duller it will become. If dulling a blade is your goal but you feel uncomfortable using a sander to dull it, you should make an effort to use the tool as much as you can.


Harder and thicker objects will cause the blade to blunt most quickly. For example, you might cut kindling for fires with the sword you are trying to blunt.
 This is another blunting technique that is similar to using a whetstone. By dragging a blade against a whetstone, you sharpen it, but by dragging a blade against a hard surface, especially a coarse one, you'll cause the blade to lose its edge.You might consider using a rock, cinderblock, or a piece of metal. This can be very effective with smaller blades, and you can even do this as you watch TV.
Be careful when performing this dulling technique. It's easy to lose your grip on the knife or to drop it and potentially hurt yourself.
 Cardboard is a perfect household item you can use for blunting a blade's edge. Scrape the point of the blade's edge against cardboard repeatedly, checking the sharpness with your finger every so often to gauge your progress.


You can also use your blade to cut cardboard to receive the same dulling effect. This way, you can blunt your blade while disposing old boxes., Apply some polish to a cloth and coat your blade with it after you've blunted it sufficiently. This will rejuvenate the blade's appearance and make it look sharp again in spite of being dulled. Now you can display your blade without fear of it causing harm.

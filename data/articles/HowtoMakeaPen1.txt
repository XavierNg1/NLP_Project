 Take out a pen's ink cartridge and cut a bamboo skewer to the same length. Wipe the skewer with petroleum jelly and use it to pierce a small ball of polymer clay. Roll out the clay until it extends along the whole skewer, seal it over one end, and bake according to clay's label instructions. Let cool 5â€“10 minutes, remove the skewer, then glue in the ink cartridge once the clay has cooled completely., A thin piece of bamboo is ideal, but any sturdy hollow cane will do. Cut off a cane segment underneath one joint, and just below the next. Drop an ink cartridge from an ordinary pen into the hollow end. Gradually make an angled cut into the solid end, until you can poke through with the ink cartridge tip. Seal the end with clay or putty to prevent ink leaking out.


If the cartridge is too loose, hold it in with strong glue. If it's too long, hold it in place with tape.
 Choose a large tail feather, and trim away enough feathers to comfortably hold the tip. Sand the tip smooth, then cut it away at a steep angle. To let the quill pick up ink, cut a slit from the tip inward, and chop off the extreme tip to make a flat edge.For best results, before you begin cutting, soak the feather in hot water until it bends easily, then harden it again in hot sand.

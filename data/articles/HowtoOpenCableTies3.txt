 First, be sure to squeeze your hands into fists with the tops of your hands facing up when your hands are being bound. This will make them as big as possible (and thus make your restraints larger, too). Then, when no one’s looking, relax your hands and turn your palms toward each other. Focus on worming your thumbs out first to make the rest easier.Always try this method first, since another method will require you to tighten the cable tie (which will make trying to do this afterward much tougher).
 If you’re being held with other prisoners, coordinate between yourselves. Find a shim of some sort that’s small and firm enough to manipulate the bar inside the locking mechanism. Have one person use that to free the other by lifting the bar from the zip tie’s grooved tracks. Once it’s lifted, pull the tie free of the mechanism.Possible shims could be a nail, screw, fork, pin, pen, pencil, key, or the corner of a credit card. If nothing’s in reach, try your fingernail.
This is method works best with a partner, but you can also attempt it on your own.
 For this, you want to hold the cable tie’s locking mechanism (which is where the tie is weakest) in between your hands. Use those and/or your teeth to get the mechanism into position and pinned between your hands or balls of your thumbs. Then grip the tie’s loose end between your teeth and pull to tighten it as much as possible. Next:Raise your hands above your head and then swing them down in toward your stomach as fast as you can.
As you swing them down, focus on touching your shoulder blades together and sticking your elbows out like wings.
Repeat if needed until the locking mechanism snaps in between your hands.

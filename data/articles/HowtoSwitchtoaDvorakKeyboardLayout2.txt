 Once you have made the change to Dvorak in your operating system, you may want to purchase a new keyboard. Although eventually you will not need to look at the keyboard to type comfortably, it may be useful in the beginning to have a keyboard labelled for the Dvorak type setting.A Dvorak keyboard is no different internally from your current keyboard; the only difference is that the keys are labelled according to the Dvorak format. These keyboards can be bought at Staples or online on Amazon.
 If you do not want to buy a new keyboard, you can just buy a Dvorak keyboard slip. These slips are fit right over your keyboard and are labelled according to a Dvorak keyboard setting. They can be found on Amazon. This is a good option if you are using a laptop because the keyboard is built in, so buying a new keyboard would probably not be the best option.
 You can put each letter over the keys of your keyboard so that the keyboard is labelled like a Dvorak keyboard. These stickers are designed for the shape of the keys and will not come off.
 If you are feeling crafty, you can go to a store like Staples, buy stickers or labels, write letters on them, and stick them to your keyboard. This is a cheaper option than buying a keyboard or a keyboard slip. You will also easily be able to peel them off to see your QWERTY keys if you decide to switch back.

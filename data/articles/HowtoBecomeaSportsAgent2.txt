 Sports agents have at least a BA or BS, and often a higher level degree. Majors like sports management, marketing, communications, business or pre-law are excellent preparation for a career as a sports agent.


Sports management firms offer courses for people who already have a degree and want to learn the specific skills that come into play in sports management.
 Major sports agencies offer internships or shadow programs for people interested in learning more about the field. Having an internship can also give you a better shot at getting a job with an agency once you've completed your education.


Consider what sport you want to specialize in. Most agents focus on one sport and become experts on the players and regulations in that particular realm.
Think about whether you want to work with professional or lower league players. The competition is much higher in the professional leagues, but the pay is lower when you're dealing with lower leagues.
 The requirements for certification vary between leagues, but you will definitely be asked to display an understanding of league policies. Before being granted certification, you'll also have to pay a fee of up to $1,500 and get professional liability insurance.


Study up on the rules, bargaining agreement, player's benefits, and agents' rights and responsibilities of your chosen league. Read books and websites on the subject, and talk with people who work for the league for detailed information.
Apply to get certification by sending in your personal information, fee, and resume.
Your league may require the completion of one or more courses before granting certification.

 If you just want to cut back on the amount of spam you get from a bot, unsubscribing will stop messages but allow you to stay in contact with the bot. Try sending a "Stop" or "Unsubscribe" message to the bot to stop receiving updates. If you're successful, you'll receive a message saying that updates will be stopped.


The process for unsubscribing varies depending on the bot. Try a few different ways before moving on to blocking it.;
, You can block any bot directly from the conversation screen. You can find your conversations in the Recent tab.
 You'll get two different options: "Block all messages" and "Block sponsored messages."

, You'll no longer receive messages from the bot, and will no longer be able to send messages to it either. This will also block sponsored messages.
 Bots can show up in your private conversations and offer goods and services that match keywords. You can disable these messages but keep the bot unblocked by toggling this option on. This will allow you to continue using the bot for general queries but it won't interrupt your private conversations., If you want to start chatting with a blocked chat bot again, you can unblock it from the conversation screen.


Open a conversation with the bot. If you deleted the conversation after blocking it, you'll need to search for the bot again on the People screen.
Tap the "Block" option at the top of the screen.
Toggle "Block all messages" off. You'll be able to chat normally with the bot again.

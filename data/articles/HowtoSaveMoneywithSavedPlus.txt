Decide how much you want to save every time you spend; from 5% to 20% of your purchase amounts will be additionally transferred from your checking to your savings account.

 SavedPlus is bank-independent, meaning it works with any bank or financial institution. If you don't yet have a savings account, please do that first!

, 
 If you have more than one checking account, in order to save the most you will want to choose as your source account the one you use most frequently. Your destination account can be a savings account, a money market account or CD, or a long-term investment account like a 401(k) or IRA.

Currently SavedPlus employs an ACH process that uses a 3rd party ACH Processor to transfer money between your accounts.
This process differs from the inter-bank ACH process that banks use internally which takes 2-3 business days.
When an ACH debit of your checking account is initiated, it takes 2-3 business days to clear this debit transaction. Then, once it is cleared, SavedPlus initiates a credit transaction to your savings account which takes another 2-3 days to clear and be posted on your savings account.
All transfers will take a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 business days.
Please refer to SavedPlus's ACH page for more details.

Some suggestions for savings goals:


Build your emergency fund

Pay off your credit card debt
Save up for a down payment or car loan
Contribute to your retirement account
Set up a shopping account to use instead of credit

,
Once you are set up, SavedPlus will begin saving automatically according to the Savings Percentage and other settings you selected. You can change these settings at any time through the app or online at SavedPlus.com, as well as track your savings over time.

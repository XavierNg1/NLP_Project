 Getting a degree online means you need to have regular access to a computer and high-speed internet service, as well as a comfortable and quiet place to work. Computers are reasonably cheap but renting one can be even cheaper and enables you to access the latest products and software without having to shell out the total cost. As for internet access, if you can't afford high speed internet at home, some options for places to work on your classes include:


The public library. Many public libraries provide computers with high-speed internet access for patrons. Check with your library for restrictions on use of the computers; it's no good if you're only permitted half hour slots here and there!
Your college’s computer lab. If you're pursuing your online degree from a local college or university, its computer lab should be available for your use during lab hours. Check with your school for more information.
A restaurant or café that offers wifi. Many restaurants, cafés, and coffee shops offer customers free wireless internet services.

 Your picture is surrounded by a set of white dot-shaped sizing handles. The floating Picture toolbar appears above the picture.;
, The "Crop" button displays a pair of overlapping right angles. After clicking it, the dot-shaped sizing handles change to a set of black dashes, which are the cropping handles.
 Your cursor will change from a 4-headed arrow to the shape of the cropping handle it is over.
 Which handle you drag depends on how you wish to crop the picture.


To crop a single side, drag the center cropping handle on the side you wish to crop toward the center of the picture.
To crop adjacent sides, drag the corner cropping handle touching the sides you wish to crop toward the center of the picture.
To crop opposite sides evenly at the same time, drag the center handle on either of the opposite sides while holding down the CTRL key.
To crop all 4 sides of the picture at once, drag any of the corner handles toward the center while holding down both the CTRL and SHIFT keys.
 The cropping handles will change back to sizing handle dots.

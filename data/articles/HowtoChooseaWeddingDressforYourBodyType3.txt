 Youâ€™re an hourglass if you have a rectangular shape (same width hips and shoulders), but you have a pronounced waist.
 Low-cut styles will expose your neckline and are appropriate for your hourglass body type. Choices include halter tops, v necks, and sweetheart necks.
 These will accentuate your curves and show off your figure.
 Both work well on hourglass figures.
 They may be too snug for your curves and too loose for your waist. Gathers or pleats in the skirt can make your hips look disproportionate.

 They're best kept under 2.5cm or 1-inch height for the standard dollhouse. However, if making for a baby doll, you'll need to make them much larger., You'll need two pieces of cardboard at this measurement. Trace the lines on the cardboard, then cut them out, so that you have two separate pieces for the cover.
 Using printer paper, measure the strip to be slightly smaller than the cover you've just made. As for all the books in this tutorial, you don't want the paper insert to be larger than the cover.

The longer the strip, the wider the book will open and the more "pages" it will contain; and vice versa.
 The folds should be slightly smaller than the width of the cardboard cover.
 You'll need one piece for each cover, allowing for extra to fold onto the inside of the covers. Trim the corners to miter them for easy folding.
 Carefully align them so that an equal amount of fabric will be folded over onto the inside of the covers for each edge. Glue in place on the outside of the cover, then carefully glue the folded edges onto the inside cover.


The folded gluing is a little tricky, so take it slowly and work methodically around each edge until they're all intact.
 Glue the outer last sheet of one end of the accordion strip to the inner side of one cover. Repeat for the outer side of the last sheet at the other end of the accordion strip, only this time gluing it to the other inside the cardboard cover. Allow to fully dry.
 The concertina pages will open out revealing distinct folded pages. You can write or draw on these, or stick images or letters onto them.
 Glue another little piece to the front cover. Tie in a bow to keep the book closed when not in use.

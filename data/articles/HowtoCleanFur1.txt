 Take the coat by the shoulders and, as you would when changing a bedspread, swing the coat out in front of you.


You may want to do this outside, or an area of the house that can be easily swept. Once you begin flinging the coat, debris will fly in all directions.;
, Furs should always be hung on broad, padded hangers to prevent the shoulders from losing their form. Because of the nature of the fur, it can easily be stretched and deformed.Never fold your fur coat.
 Using a proper fur brush, begin at the top of the coat and begin working your way to the bottom. Be sure to brush the direction of the hair, and to use small and even strokes as you work a small section at a time. Fur brushes have wider spaced teeth and soft edges, which prevent the brush from damaging the skin of the fur.


If you do not have a proper fur brush, you can run your fingers through the fur to help clear-out any dirt or debris.
Never brush your fur with a "normal" brush. This will damage the coat as the teeth on a normal brush are too fine.Avoid making long strokes the length of the coat. This can cause the coat to stretch.
 Mix one-part isopropyl alcohol with one-part water and apply directly to the stain. Because fur coats are delicate, you should always avoid using any type of cleaner or solvent. .
 Do not rinse the solution out, instead, place the coat in a well-ventilated area and allow it to dry thoroughly. The alcohol will prevent any water stains from forming on the coat.


Never use heat on a fur coat. Heat will damage the coat and lining.Be gentle as you rub and be careful not to stretch the skin.
Be sure to use a white cloth or rag or else you may transfer color to the fur.
 Again, work in the direction of the fur and work small sections at a time.

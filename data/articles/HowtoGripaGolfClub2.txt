 The head of the club should rest on the ground as you adjust your hands in the proper positioning. Take the grip of the golf club in the palm of your left hand so that handle lies across your palm and the heel of your hand matches up with the end of the handle. Then curl the remaining fingers of your left hand around the handle so your fingers are positioned directly next to each other.The interlocking grip is often recommended to golfers with small hands. If your hands are on the smaller side, this grip might be best for you., Align your right hand so it is slightly lower than your left on the club. Try not to complicate your grip at this point by adding fingers aside from your right pinkie to the grip. Allow the palm of your right hand to rest against the handle. Then, interlock your right and left hand by putting your right pinkie underneath the forefinger of your left hand.You can often tell your grip is too tight when you feel discomfort in the overlapped pinkie/forefinger. If you feel this sensation, you should relax your hold on the club.
 The fingers of your right hand can now be added to the grip. They should curl around your club firmly so that your fingers are arranged one after the next without gaps in between., Much like the overlapping grip, your thumbs should align to follow the shaft of the club. Your end grip should have both hands holding the club as a single, interconnected unit.

 You may be restricted on where you can draw your piercing if you want to make it look as realistic as possible. Hoop piercings are more difficult to draw on because of the depth perception usually made by the hoop shape.


You may not be able to draw a realistic hoop on your eyebrow, but it should work for the nose or lip.
Fake septum hoop piercings are not achievable if drawing on the hoop.
 A white base will guarantee that your liquid liner pops out in the light, you want your piercing to be noticeable. Use a cream formula, this will hold more to the skin and last longer. Use a white eyeliner pencil.
Use a thin makeup brush and dip it into your leftover white Halloween makeup.
 A liquid liner will be more effective in faking a facial piercing because it is more vibrant than gel or charcoal liners. Choose any color you want for the eyeliner, be creative with it! Metallic colors such as silver or gold will definitely look the most realistic when compared to actual piercings.
 Do not use the applicator that comes with the liquid liner because it may go on too thick to start, which might not be what you want. Use a thin makeup brush or a thin paintbrush to apply your liner.


Dip your thin brush into the bottle of liquid eyeliner and apply as much or as little as you want, depending on how thick you want your “fake” piercing to look.
For a fake hoop lip piercing, try applying your liner vertically down the center of your bottom lip.

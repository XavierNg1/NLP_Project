 Combine the butter and confectioners’ sugar in a medium mixing bowl. Cream them together with electric beaters on medium speed, until the two are fully incorporated.You can use a whisk if you don’t have electric beaters. Beat the butter and sugar together vigorously with the whisk in order to cream them.
You can also use a stand mixer to make this buttercream.;
, Pour in the whipping cream, orange extract, and five drops of orange food coloring. Beat the mixture on medium speed until the ingredients are fully combined. If necessary, beat in more food coloring in five-drop increments until you achieve the desired color.


The food coloring is optional in this recipe, and you can leave it out entirely.
 If you want the frosting to be orange but don’t want to use the artificial color, substitute the food coloring with reduced carrot juice.


Heat fresh carrot juice in a medium saucepan until it reduces to a paste, then use that in place of the food coloring., For the best results, use a pastry bag to frost desserts with buttercream. If you don’t have a pastry bag, spoon the frosting into a freezer bag, push it all to the bottom left corner of the bag, and snip a small hole in the corner of the bag.


You can frost desserts with buttercream by using a knife, spoon, or icing knife as well, but you'll get more interesting designs and a cleaner look if you use a pastry bag.
This recipe makes enough icing for up to 24 cupcakes, or two cakes.

 You can do this by pulsing them in a blender, or by crushing them in a plastic, zippered bag with a rolling pin. Keep crushing them until you get a coarse crumble. The pieces should be finely crushed, like coarse sand or coffee grounds.;
, For an extra touch of sweetness, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. The milk and ice cream should be evenly combined. You may have to pause the blender, and scrape any unblended ice cream down the sides of the canister with a rubber spatula.
 Since you have already crushed the Oreo cookies, you just need to mix them in. You don't want any large chunks of Oreo cookie in your milkshake, but you still want to see some specks.
 Use a rubber spatula to help you guide the mixture into the glasses. You may also have enough to make four small servings instead.
 Add a swirl of whipped cream on top of each milkshake. Cut an Oreo cookie in half, and place each half on top of the whipped cream.For an extra fancy touch, you can garnish the milkshake with chocolate sauce and a maraschino cherry.

 Text her fun messages or leave her voice messages to wake up to in the morning. Sending her little messages lets her know you're thinking about her and makes her feel loved and supported. It's sure to put a smile on her face.
 When she lets you know that she needs or wants your help, make sure you are there. If she's upset, make sure you provide a shoulder to cry on. When you say you'll do something, make sure you're there. If you make a date with her, show up on time and be genuine about it. If she knows you are true to your word and a person she can depend on, she'll definitely smile more.
 You could lightly arm wrestle with her or tickle her, too. Not in a mean way, but in a cute way that allows her to realize you want to share a special connection with her. Try holding her hand or hugging her by surprise. However, if she pulls back, make sure to let her go, as she may not want to be touched right then.
 That's it, you've done it again. You've done something wrong, and now you're girlfriend's mad. The only way out of this situation is to apologize, truly and sincerely, by admitting what you did wrong and asking how you can make up for what you did. Only then will you have a smiling girlfriend again (eventually).For instance, just saying, "OK, I'm sorry," isn't going to cut it. Rather, you should say something like, "I'm sorry I forgot to meet you after school. I know I made you wait around for me, and that sucks for you. Maybe I can buy you a soda right now to make up for it?"

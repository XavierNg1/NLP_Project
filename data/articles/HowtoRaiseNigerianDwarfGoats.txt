 A good recommendation is to feed the goats Eastern Grass Hay, or Alfalfa mix. Note: If you have wethers and Bucks, that are older, do NOT feed Alfalfa, as it can cause Urinary Calculi. You can also feed kids (0 days-12 month old goats) COB (Corn Oats and Barley) and some Calf Manna. A good place to start is to feed the babies a mix of 2 cup COB and 2 cup Calf Manna, and give them each get a cup of the mix. These are just example measurements, so do research!;
, You can also have a salt-lick block as free choice. Above all, you need fresh, cold and clean water!

, You must clean or "Muck" out where they stay at least every day. Shelters that can be enclosed so that nothing but air and light can get through is ideal. Small babies are easy targets for coyotes. Make sure it's warm, dry and comfy so when the weather gets harsh, you are ready.
 If anything goes wrong, you'll have the supplies.
 Only so many acres can support a goat. You don't need spacious acres with lush green pasture and browse running miles long, you just need a pasture, a shelter, nutritional supplies, health supplies and lots of love and compassion for your little bundle(s) of joy.

 Rupture to the uterus increases the risk of hemorrhage to the mother, neurological complications for the baby and death for both. Fortunately, the chance of having a uterine rupture is extremely small, generally less than 1%.
 An immediate emergency cesarean is the course of action to be taken. A quick response is vital. The longer a rupture goes undetected the more serious complications become.



Watch for bleeding from the vagina, sharp pain after every contraction, abdominal tenderness, slowing down of contractions, contractions that become less intense and sharp pain at the site of prior incision. These are all symptoms of uterine rupture and should be evaluated immediately.

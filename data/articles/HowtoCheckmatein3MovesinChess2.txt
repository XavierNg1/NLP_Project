 This is a very similar method to the previous one. You are basically aiming to get your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns forward one and two squares respectively, while freeing your Queen to enable it to move onto h5. The end result is the same as the previous method.









You are trying to tempt your opponent to move her Bishop and Knight Pawns.
You need you opponent to respond by bringing out her Bishop Pawn one square to f6.
It can also work if she moves her Knight Pawn forward two squares on this turn, as long as she moves the Bishop Pawn on her next move.
 The next move for you to make has to free up your Queen so it can get into a checkmate position on the next move. To do this, move the White King Pawn ahead two squares to e4. Now you have opened up an avenue for your Queen to reach h5.









In order to clear the way to your opponent's King you need her to move her Knight Pawn ahead two spaces to g5.
 Checkmate! And that's it, you have trapped your opponent's King in the same position as the previous method, but this time you did it without even capturing a single piece. Game. Set. Match. Over.








Again, this looks simple and it is. So don't expect it to work very often!
In theory, there are loads of variations on this. The key moves are getting your Queen to h5, and your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns out of the way of her King.

 Look for natural moisturizing oils like Babassu and grape seed oil, products that moisturize the skin deeply and revitalize it. You want to use products that are free of any side effects and can be used by people of any skin type, oily or dry.


Mineral oils provide temporary moisturization and they clog the skin's pores. In this way they leave them suffocating for fresh air. The skin cells are unable to get rid of the toxins and this leads to acne eruptions, allergies, irritation, rashes and photo sensitivity.
Explore the fragrance compounds used. Often, these are made up of synthetic chemicals and they cause depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, hormonal disruptions and interfere in the normal functioning of the central nervous system.
Avoid parabens. Parabens are cheap preservatives used to improve their shelf life of skincare products, but they are thought to be linked to some types of breast cancer and other health concerns.;
, Different moisturizers can help certain skins. Rinse your face gently and rinse your face thoroughly of products. If you don't rinse well, the pores will stay open, that way more dirt and oil comes through the pores. Wash your face with cool water and pat dry.
 Greasy hair, especially bangs, can lead to greasy forehead and cheeks.
 Try to drink at least eight glasses of water every day to maintain proper hydration and promote healthy skin. While it may sound like a lot, traditional Ayurvedic practice recommends that to clear our body of impurities, people must drink at least three or more glasses of lukewarm water the first thing in the morning to process toxins and promote overall health.

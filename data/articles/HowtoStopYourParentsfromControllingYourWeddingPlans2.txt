 When enduring this power struggle with your parents, be sure to clarify their role in the wedding planning process. Remind them that you are the one getting married and tell them that you will always consider their suggestions. Avoid always saying “don’t” or “no” to them, but do remind that you do have the final say.You might say “Mom, I’ve always wanted a mermaid shaped wedding gown, but I do think that the ballgown that you picked out looked nice. I really felt like a bride in the dress that I picked out and I hope that you respect my decision.”

, Though you parents may want you to invite your second cousin by marriage twice removed, know that you do not have to. Say ‘no’ to them in a polite way when they try to make any unwanted additions.Go over the budget with them as well if you cannot afford additional guests.
 If your family is not contributing financially to the wedding, keep the talk of it to a minimum when together. Though your wedding is an important day, it is not worth suffering unnecessary stress over. Inform them of any necessary information, like their role, the date, and time, but avoid discussing other details that you might argue over.If they try to engage with you about it, you might say something like “You know Mom, the last time we talked about the wedding, we both got really upset. But I will say that Jess and I picked a nice venue that we’re really excited about. Now can we talk about something else?”

, If you know that your mom has an eye for decoration and your dad has a lot of connections in the area, use this. Doing so will allow them to feel useful while you are also planning your perfect wedding.

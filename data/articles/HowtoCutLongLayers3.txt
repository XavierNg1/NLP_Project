 Begin with dry, clean hair. Carefully brush your hair until it is smooth. Pay particular attention to removing any snarls or knots in your long locks., Bend forward at your waist. Brush your hair forwards towards your forehead. Gather your hair into a ponytail at the base of your forehead. Secure it tightly with a rubber band.Imagine that you are transforming your hair into a unicorn’s horn. The ponytail should be located in the same place as a unicorn’s horn.
 Remain bent over at your waist. Slowly slide your rubber band towards the ends of your hair. Stop 1 to 2 inches from the ends of your hair. Adjust the rubber band to the desired length—remember, it is always better to cut a little bit off at a time!, Position your non-dominant hand securely over the rubberband. As you stand up straight, try not to shift your hair or the position of your hand. Using a pair of sharp shears, cut just below the rubber band. Set down the hair you cut off and assess your layered look. If you want to cut more hair off, repeat the process.

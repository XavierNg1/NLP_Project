 Copic marker tips will not take on the colors of other Copic markers they touch, so feel free to mix and match any colors you like.It is okay if the colors dry a little before you start stamping. Just work until you are happy with the color composition of your stamp.
 This helps re-wet the colors, and will also help them adhere to paper or cardstock.Use a misting bottle to spray the alcohol onto the stamp.
If a misting bottle is not available, dip a small bit of paper towel into the rubbing alcohol and dab it onto the stamp very lightly. Be careful not to smear or remove any colors.
 You can stamp the image approximately two times before needing to reapply the alcohol mist.To keep consistent coloring in each image, check the rubber stamp after each stamping to see if any colors need to be reapplied.

 If the spider is on the floor, sweep the spider onto the dustpan. You can also do this if the spider is on a wall, but be careful not to sweep the spider on you!, With the spider on the dustpan, head to the door. As you are walking, tap the underside of the dustpan with the sweeper or with your fingernails. The noise and the vibrations of the tapping will scare the spider so that it stays still and doesn’t run off the dustpan., When you get outside, place the dustpan on the ground. The spider should run off. If it doesn’t, you can leave the dustpan there until the spider leaves it, or you can use the sweeper to sweep the spider off the dustpan.
 If using a dustpan is too up close and personal with the spider for you, use a vacuum instead. On the lowest setting, vacuum up the spider. Then empty out the filter outside of your home.


You can use a regular vacuum cleaner, but be warned that this may possibly kill the spider. A dust buster is a slightly better option.You can also buy vacuums made especially for bugs and insects. You can purchase these on Amazon.

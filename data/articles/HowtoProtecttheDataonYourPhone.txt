 This is the number used by the Police when trying to recover a stolen phone, without this number, the are virtually useless. Network providers also use the number to block a stolen phone, so that nobody else can use it. Your IMEI is usually found under the battery of you can get it on-screen by dialing *#06# .Register you phone at www.immobilise, a site set up by the police.;
, This is your first line of defence against someone stealing your phone. This method of protection is in use from the second that your phone is stolen, not 3 hours later when you finally get through to you service provider!!!

, If you have lost your phone, you can clear the data before the thieves get to it. Android users can use Google Sync along with Google Apps Device Policy to clear data remotely. iPhone users can use Find My iPhone for this, and Blackberry and Windows Phone users can try out Lookout. (Please see note below)

, Especially Android users, where virus attacks are much easier to perform than on another device, iOS or Blackberry for example.
 Most smartphones now has GPS that will make tracking easy and fast, so that you can see exactly where your phone is at any given moment. For Windows Phone users there is a free app called My Phone for Windows Mobile, which is made by Microsoft. For iPhone there is the Find My iPhone, and for Android, I would recommend a free app which is called Theft Aware.

 With your dog off-leash, hold a treat in your left hand. Look behind your left shoulder as you walk. When you see your dog following you, click and give it a treat. Ensure as you give it a treat that its head remains up and facing forward., Once your dog successfully learns to walk along your left side, and understands why it is being rewarded, put your dog on a leash. The leash should be held in such a way that it does not drag on the ground between you and your dog. Hold the clicker and leash in your left hand and the treats in your right. Continue the training as before, rewarding only proper form with treats and clicks., If your dog is trained incorrectly, it will only cause another problem that will require retraining later. If you notice your dog not perfectly adhering to your gait-correction training, take immediate action to correct it. For instance, if your dog is veering off course or running rather than walking, say “Oops!” or “Uh-oh!” in a friendly way. Return with the dog to your starting point and try again.Do not reward your dog for pulling or veering off course.
 Improving your dog’s show ring gait is a process. Your dog’s show ring gait will not improve with just one or two training sessions. For some dogs, improvement will take longer than it might for others. But for all dogs, you will need to invest a significant amount of time in the training process.Use random intervals between training sessions, otherwise your dog might come to associate performing an appropriate gait with a certain time (for instance, right when they wake up).
For instance, if you wish to teach your dog to keep its head up to improve its show ring gait, perform a head-up exercise with your dog, then again 15 minutes later, then again five minutes after that.
 Do not push yourself or your dog too hard when training. Working in sessions of five minutes or less several times per day should be sufficient to improve your dog’s show ring gait.

 In order to create an awesome GIF, a series of photos or a video file is essential. Go to the image or video website to download some photos or short videos to process it. It’s also accessible to take some snapshots using your camera. PicGIF supports multiple import file formats such as hundreds of image formats, GIFs formats and almost all video formats. Just drag and drop your photos or videos into PicGIF to get started.;

Once you add your photos or video to PicGIF, it couldn't be easier to edit your GIF size with many preset sizes in PicGIF for Mac. Just chose the suitable size or custom the exact size you want using the feature of Manage Custom Sizes.
There are three fill modes (Fill, Fit, Stretch) for option. You can choose a favorite color to fill the GIF canvas in case the GIF size you set is larger than the actual image size.
Then, you are able to create GIFs with your desired FPS by manually setting the frame delay. Go to Sequence option to change the looping direction in two ways: Normal and Reverse, with each option looping endlessly. PicGIF for Mac allows you to control individual frame order by easily dragging any frame and putting it to anywhere you want.
 In this step, optimize the GIF by using a very handy function for adding some text captions to multiple layers, if desired. You are free to play around with the Font, Style, Size, Alignment, Shadow, etc.



Once you’re happy, save it on your computer directly. Of course, PicGIF enables you to share your fun GIFs with your family and friends via E-Mail and iMessage. However, iMessage sharing can be only accessible for these users under Mac OS X 10.8 or above.
If you don’t satisfied with your GIF? Re-edit it to make it perfect. PicGIF is a great app for Mac users to edit the existing animated GIFs, changing the playing sequence, ordering frames, and altering the duration.

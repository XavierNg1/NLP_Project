 Each specific game has its own design, plot, and rules, so you'll have to proceed differently for each. Figure out how you acquire the Chaos Emeralds, looking up instructions or video walkthroughs if you need help. Collect all seven before you proceed.
 Once you get all seven Chaos Emeralds, you will watch a cutscene in which you see Sonic transform into Super Sonic!

, Depending on your game, you may have to perform this last challenge once you have become Super Sonic. However, this only applies to Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2006, and Sonic Unleashed.

 Have no band attire or merchandise on you.
 Pick up on it and follow like you belong.
 The more you seem to know if you're caught, the better off you'll be.
 Don't turn back, don't hesitate. When there's a break, go for the doors as stealthily as possible. You're best off to wait for a distraction before trying. If you need to, make the distraction yourself.

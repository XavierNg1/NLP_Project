 You will need to decide what kind of juice you will use on your creation. Any fruit juice will do, but in general the more liquid the juice (orange as compared to mango, for example) the more "orangina-like" the result.
 This is also referred to as seltzer water and carbonated water. Making soda water can be done through fermentation using yeast and sugar (as demonstrated in How to Make Cream Soda), but the most effective, efficient and inexpensive way is through forced carbonation using a rechargeable siphon, as shown in the video below. You can buy these from Amazon, cooking utensil stores such as Williams-Sonoma, eBay vendors and other sources. Be careful of used siphons; see the Warnings below., Most siphons use a standard 8 gram CO2 cartridge. You can get them from the same sources for new siphons, or from mail and online vendors. Stay away from Chinese-made soda charger cartridges, as they have been known to impart a bad taste to the resulting carbonated water due to the use of low-quality CO2 gas. , Follow the manufacturer instructions. Siphons should not be filled to the very top. If your tap water does not taste good, neither will the resulting soda water; use filtered or bottled water for best results. Use cold water, or cool the siphon in the refrigerator before using. Warm soda water does not taste good!, Follow the manufacturer's directions and do not overcharge (see the Warnings below)., Usually a tenth of the volume of the glass will do., Be gentle when pressing the siphon's trigger, or else the soda water will come out very fast and spill all over the place. Now you know why being a Soda Jerk was not an easy job. Enjoy!

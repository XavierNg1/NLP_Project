 Wash the exterior of each sweet potato under running water, using a vegetable brush to remove any stubborn dirt.
 Poke into each sweet potato three to five times with the tines of a fork.
 You can also use a microwave-safe plate with a rim. Do not cover.
 Set the microwave on full power and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Pause the microwave halfway in between to flip and rotate the sweet potatoes to ensure even cooking.
 Cut an "X" in the top of each potato and gently press on the sides of the skin to push the flesh upward.
 Use about 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) of butter per sweet potato. Add salt and pepper to taste.

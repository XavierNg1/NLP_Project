 Raise the head, arms and legs. Move the arms and legs like riding a bicycle. Think the mantra "Cycling". Move to the left and right side.;
, The arms surround the head. Rotate the pelvis to the left and head to the right. And vice versa. Focus on the spine. Do this gently several times, so that you solve well the tensions in the spine.
 Move the legs, such as cycling and think the mantra "Candle".
 Embrace your legs and relax rocking from side to side. It is as if you swing lovingly a little kid.
 Lift the right arm and the left leg stretched as far as possible. Then lift the left arm and right leg. Do this several times and count the numbers from 1 to 20 in the body.
 Focus on the spine and twist as much as possible.
 The head rests on the hands. Focus on the feet and move it relaxed and gently on your way.
 The back is straight and the belly relaxed. Think the mantra "Om Shanti" until your mind comes to rest.
 May all people be happy. May the world be happy."

, First stop one minute every thought, focus on the feet and move it gently. Then relax for a few minutes completely.

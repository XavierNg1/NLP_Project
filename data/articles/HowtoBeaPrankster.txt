 Great pranksters can come up with some pretty awesome pranks. If you're ever going to be a great prankster, you're going to have to, too. You'll also have to be able to think outside of the box.;
, Certainly don't tell more people than you need to. Your prank could be ruined if you're not careful!

, If you do get a friend to help you, split up the steps evenly between the two of you to be fair.
 Don't save the embarrassing realization for later!

, You don't want to go overboard on just one prank - keep the pranks cheap!

, Don't sacrifice the prank just so you can do some unimportant finishing touches. Think through the prank beforehand so you have everything you need and enough time.
 Snickering prematurely can murder a perfectly executed prank. Don't laugh, take deep breaths, and think about something entirely different. Imagine how you would really act if you didn't know about the joke.
 At worst, the person should be rolling their eyes with a halfhearted smile. But if you make a mistake and cross that invisible line, you need to be willing to offer a sincere apology and quickly help reverse the damage, if possible.

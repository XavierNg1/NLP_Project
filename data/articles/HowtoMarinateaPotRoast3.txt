 If you only used red wine for a marinade, but now wish you added more flavor, never fear. Simply pour the wine from the bag into a saucepan. Place the meat on your cutting board and absorb as much moisture as you can by patting it with paper towels. Then rub in a half-teaspoon (2.5 grams) of salt and pepper respectively., Set the burner under the saucepan to medium-high heat. Once the wine begins to boil, lower the heat to simmer. Leave uncovered for about a quarter of an hour, or until the wine reduces to approximately 1.5 cups (354.9 ml), or roughly half of its original volume., Pour about 1.33 cups (314.7 ml) of beef broth into the reduced wine, followed by a ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of tomato paste. Then stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of Dijon mustard; 1 tablespoon (15 g) of herbes de Provence, four minced cloves of garlic, and two bay leaves. Continue to simmer for another five minutes., Place your meat in your crockpot or Dutch oven. Pour your new wine sauce over it. Cover your crockpot and set it to low heat and cook for eight to ten hours.For a Dutch oven, preheat your stove’s oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 Celsius), cover your Dutch oven, and then bake for three and a half hours., To speed things along, start cooking your meat before reducing the wine. Line the bottom of your crockpot or Dutch oven with olive oil. Transfer the meat into the pot or oven and begin cooking. Set the heat to low for a crockpot, or medium for a Dutch oven. Turn the meat over periodically so that each side browns evenly in the cooking oil.,

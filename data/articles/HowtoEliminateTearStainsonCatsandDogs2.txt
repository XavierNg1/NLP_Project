 Longhaired dogs are particularly prone to tear stains as their fur irritates their eyes. Long hairs around the face can easily brush against the eyes, leading to tearing and irritation. Regular trimming can help combat this problem, so make regular appointments with your groomer.Unless you have specialized training in pet grooming, it is not advisable to attempt to trim your dog's face yourself. When trimming near a dog's eyes, it's very easy to accidentally clip into your dog's face or eyes. Always consult a professional.
 While there is no clear link, a high quality diet can prevent health problems overall. If other means have not helped with tear stains, have a talk with your pet about your animal's current diet. They may recommend switching food types (i.e., switching from wet food to dry food) or trying a more nutritious brand of cat or dog food.Switches in food type should usually be made gradually to avoid stomach irritation. Talk to a vet about how to slowly introduce new foods to your pets to prevent indigestion.

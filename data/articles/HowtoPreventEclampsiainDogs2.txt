 Once the dog has given birth to the litter and is nursing the pups, you should give her a calcium supplement. This will ensure her calcium levels do not drop. It can also be beneficial for the puppies, especially a large litter of puppies.You can find calcium supplements for dogs at your local pet store or online. Make sure you check the label of the supplement to confirm it contains mostly calcium. If you are unsure about the supplement, speak to your vet before giving it to your nursing dog.
 You should also try to get the puppies to have milk replacer instead of their mother’s milk within the first 24 hours of birth. This will put less of a demand on the mother to produce milk for the puppies and reduce her risk of developing eclampsia.You should then start giving the puppies solid food when they are three to four weeks old. This will help to lessen the demand on the mother to produce subsistence for the puppies.
 When the puppies are three to four weeks old, they should be weaned off the mother so they can be self-sufficient and not put the mother at risk of eclampsia. Start by separating the mother from the litter for a few hours at a time. Once the puppies are separated from the mother, have the puppies eat high-quality puppy food from a pan. Moisten the food with water or milk replacer.Encourage the puppies to eat from the pan by allowing them to lick the food off your fingers. Most puppies will get the hint and feed from the pan on their own.
Put a bowl of fresh water out so the puppies can also drink whenever they’d like. This will ensure they stay hydrated.
Make sure the mother is on a separate feeding schedule as the puppies so she remains healthy and does not overproduce milk. You can speak to your vet about exactly how much food to feed the mother so she gets the nutrients she needs once she stops producing milk.

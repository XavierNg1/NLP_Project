 To measure the length of one section of countertops, run a measuring tape flush along the back edge of the section from one end to the other end. The beginning and end of a section is marked by a wall, edge of a cabinet, or an appliance.Round the measurement to the nearest ⅛ inch and record this measurement on your diagram or a separate sheet of paper. Repeat this process until you have measured the length of each section of your countertops.Do not stop measuring when you reach a sink, but continue to measure beyond the sink until your reach the end of a cabinet, appliance, or a wall., Use a measuring tape to measure the width of each section of countertop. Run the measuring tape from the back of the countertop to its finished front edge.Round the measurement to the nearest ⅛ inch and record this measurement on your diagram or a separate sheet of paper.

Calculate the area (or square inches) of each section by multiplying the length times the width of each section (Length x Width = Area).
Calculate the total square inches by adding together the areas of each section.
Calculate the square footage by dividing the total square inches by 144 (Total Square Inches ➗ 144 = Total Square Footage).

 Any temperature between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (107 to 121 degrees Celsius) should be suitable for roasting macadamia nuts within ten to fifteen minutes. Mist the nuts with your buttery spray while you are waiting for the oven to warm up.
 When the oven is ready, put on a pair of oven mitts and slide the tray of macadamia nuts into the oven. Place in the center shelf of the oven., You may want to roast longer or shorter, depending on your preference and taste. Monitor the nuts closely as they roast. If they turn anything darker than a golden brown, they will likely burn.

  Make sure your legs are straight and your torso is facing forward. They should be wider than hip distance apart. If they're too close together, it'll be hard for you to bend down to twerk effectively.
 Turn your toes out as you lean down. You can have a slight bend in your legs and make sure at least your fingertips touch the ground. If you're more flexible, nobody's stopping you from getting your entire hands down on the ground. This will help you maintain your own balance.
 Bend and straighten your legs quickly, accentuating the booty pop during the move. Bend and straighten your legs along with the rhythm of the music.  You can also shake and move your booty as you twerk. To do the regular twerk, just arch your back and then hallow it out, letting your booty move up and down, up and down. For the Miley, quickly wiggle your hips from left to right.

 There are many roles needed for this game. Police officer, jail attendant (can be a police officer or someone else), suspect(s) and base attendant., You need a room for the base, the suspects house, the court and the jail. Choose these according to your house. Tips on the best rooms are in the tips section below.,, Ask them not to lock the door. Have them lean heavily on the door instead., Have them say this rather loud, but not shouting.,, Or, they can continue leaning against the door, and have the police try to force it open., This is extremely difficult if you have (a) strong suspect(s), but can be easy if your suspect(s) is/are less strong., Now, the police officer should say, "I'm arresting you for(insert crime here). You will be taken to (insert prison name here)".

The suspect(s) will then be taken out of the room.
 As tempting as it may be, do not tie them down in any way.,, When your jail attendant hears this, they should pretend to call an ambulance. A police officer or the jail or base attendant can be paramedic. The suspect(s) should thrash about screaming and then suddenly faint again a number of times. The ambulance person should pretend to give them tests and jags and then they should turn their back. While their back is turned, the suspect(s) escape(s)., All police should be returned to base at this point, except for the jail attendant. The jail attendant should look away then the suspect(s) escape(s).,, Bring them in to your court room and try to ask them questions. From their answers and what they did, give them a sentence, from 15 minutes to life, until their not suspect any more., After as long as you want, change roles. After you have changed, follow all steps again.

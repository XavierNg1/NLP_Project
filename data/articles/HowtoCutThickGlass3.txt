 A wet saw is a motorized saw with a diamond blade that is used to cut tile, glass, porcelain, and other delicate products. During operation, water is sprayed out of the front of the saw to ensure that the blade stays cool and lubricated. Wet saws cut through thick glass very easily. They are a great choice if you plan to cut glass frequently or if you want to avoid the scoring and breaking process.


You must wear safety goggles and heavy-duty work gloves when operating a wet saw. Do not allow anyone in the work area unless they are wearing safety goggles and protective clothing.
 Using a power saw to cut into thick glass is very dangerous without the aid of water, because the glass can get extremely hot and eventually explode. Fill up the saw’s tray completely with water and inspect the saw to make sure nothing is blocking the water flow from the reservoir. Adequate water flow must be maintained during the operation of a wet saw.
 Precise measurements and accurate cut lines are important no matter which cutting technique you employ. After measuring and drawing your cut lines on the surface of the glass with a straight edge and a sharpie, carefully line up the saw’s blade with your first cut line. Make sure that your hands and clothing are well out of the way of the blade before you turn it on.
 Using light pressure, gently push the glass towards the wet saw. Do not push the blade into the glass, as this will result in a messy cut. Push the glass slowly, lightly and steadily against the blade. Continue until the blade has cut the glass along the entirety of the cut line you drew on the glass.


Move onto the next cut line and continue.
Turn off the wet saw when you’ve finished with the job and empty the water from the saw’s tray.

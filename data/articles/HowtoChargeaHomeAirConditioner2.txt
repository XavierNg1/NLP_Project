 Before you recharge your AC, it is very important that you perform standard maintenance on it.


Replace the air filter
Clean the evaporator and condenser coilsâ€”if any of the above are dirty, it can cause symptoms similar to a unit that is low on refrigerant. If refrigerant is added under these conditions, the unit may be damaged.
 These must move sufficient air through their respective coils to effectively handle the heat produced (removed from your home's interior) by the air conditioner's operation.
 Missing insulation, leaking duct-work joints, poor electrical connections, and other minor problems won't change the refrigerant requirements of your air conditioning system, but they can reduce the efficiency of the system.

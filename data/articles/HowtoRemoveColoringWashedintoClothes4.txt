 One of the easiest ways to prevent coloring from one piece of clothing transferring to another is by reading the labels on your clothing. Many items, like dark denim, will include tags that state the dye might transfer. These tags will also instruct you to wash the items separately., You can prevent color transfer between clothing items by sorting and washing the items accordingly. For example, you should sort white clothing, dark or black clothing, and brightly colored clothing into separate piles. You should then wash each pile of laundry separately to prevent color transfer., There are certain items of clothing that can be particularly problematic and result in the unwanted transfer of color. You should wash these items by themselves and according to the directions on the clothing label. For example, it is a good idea to was a new pair of dark denim jeans or a red cotton shirt by themselves.
 Forgetting to remove your wet clothes from the washing machine can result in dye transferring from one item to another. To prevent this from happening, always remove your clothes when the washing machineâ€™s cycle ends. Do not allow them to sit unattended in a laundry basket while wet.

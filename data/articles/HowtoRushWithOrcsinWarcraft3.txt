 The one you sent away, have him start building a BARRACKS, not an altar.;
, The first peon that comes out builds a burrow. The next one goes into mining for a total of 5 at that point. and the next two peons go to collect lumber. Stop making peons at this point, you should have 9 total.
 With one of two peons now free, start building an Altar and with the other build another burrow as soon as you have enough lumber which is very soon at this point. As soon as your 1st grunt comes out, you will have just enough to make another...well go head and make it.
 Keep making grunts. At this point its up to you what you wanna do with the one free peon. You can build a lumber mill, another burrow, or a shop to buy potions, up to you.
 When your hero finally comes out, your 4th grunt will also come out at the same time. Notice how everything happens at the same time. Anyway right about then it will turn to night and you can:


Start creeping with a decent size army
Start your rush. 4 grunts with more on the way is ahead of the game at this point. Everyone else with the conventional build order will only have a hero and maybe 2 units at this point.
Take your Blademaster and Wind Walk into an enemies base to scout it out and see what he's doing. If no one is there start killing his workers. When his army comes you Wind Walk again and make a decision to retreat or bring in the rest of your army and fight.


If you're playing 2v2 and you and your partner both know this strategy, its damn near unbeatable. 8-10 grunts and 2 heroes in one base at the first break of night = win. Good combo for heroes are witchdoctor or Far Seer getting wolves or Flamespitters.

 Most men have dreams of teaching their children how to play their favorite sports. Others may dream of taking their kids hunting and fishing or working on cars together. Whatever your husband’s interests, use it to your advantage. Mention your future kids to him while he’s participating in his favorite activity to get him thinking about passing it on to his kids.For example, if your husband is into baseball, watch a baseball game with him. During the game, mention how great it would be to teach your children how to play baseball, dress them in a onesie with his favorite team’s logo on it, or take them to games.
 If you want a child, start discussing with your husband the exciting possibilities your future holds. Talk to him about what you’re looking forward to about having a child. Come up with stories and ideas about what you think your family will be like and what you think your child will be like.Ask him how he might feel teaching his kid to drive or watching his baby start walking.
Talk to him about what it might feel like to hear his baby say “Da-da” for the first time. Ask him about how it will feel to have a daddy’s girl or a son to bear his name.
 Give your husband time to adjust to the idea of having a child if he is reluctant. Having a child is a huge decision, even if you have children already. People come to huge life decisions at different speeds. You may be ready, and he may be in the future. Be supportive and understanding as you continue talking about having a kid.If you love your husband no matter his decision about kids, tell him that.
If you want to give him an ultimatum because you don’t want to be with him if you don’t have a baby, you should think about consulting a marriage counselor.

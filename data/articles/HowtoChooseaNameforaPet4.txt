 You will be working with your pet to persuade good behaviors and dissuade bad ones. You want to be as clear as possible when communicating with your pet. If your petâ€™s name sounds like a command, it may be confusing for the pet.


These might include names with a long o as it may sound like "No." Names like these include: Joe, Bo, etc.



You may want to avoid names like Mississippi, Sacramento, Fitzgerald. If you like the sound of a long name, consider abbreviating it (Missi, Mento, Fitz).
 You will be using this name on documents. You will be calling your pet this name in public and others will have to say it as well. Stay away from offensive names and stick with something that can be heard or read by all.


Avoid names that include curse words or bodily functions.

 If there is no one in the room, there is no point in lighting it up and all you are really doing is wasting both electricity and money. You can buy timers if you are worried about burglars and other things but make sure that you do not leave unnecessary lights on. You could also try switching to energy efficient bulbs. These might cost you a little bit more to buy at first but in the long run, they can save a huge amount on your bills.;
, You do not need to fill the kettle up for just one cup of tea so only put in the kettle what you need to make the drink or drinks. Also, turn the tap off when you are brushing your teeth and try not to shower rather have a bath. You could even go one step further than that and only flush the toilet after every two or three times of people using it – just make sure that you put the seat down to prevent any awful stenches. Water can be one of the most expensive bills and you waste it even if you don’t think you are so to cut water bills, don’t waste water and give the dishwasher a break – do you need to put it on for a couple of pots and pans?

, Around forty percent of the energy that you use to heat your home is wasted due to poor insulation. This can make such a difference to how much it costs to heat your home, so make sure that everything is as insulated as it can be and remember that short term investment in thicker insulation will mean long-term savings in heating bills.
 Just changing from thirty to forty degrees can reduce your heating bills and you will find that these days, most laundry detergents are designed to be used at the lower temperature anyway!

, Who are you leaving the TV on for? By unplugging the things that you don’t use such as the toaster, TV and lamps, you can massively reduce the amount of electricity your home uses therefore saving yourself money on your fuel bills.

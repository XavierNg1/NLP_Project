 Annuities are generally safe and predictable sources of income. However, you can increase the amount by purchasing a tax-deferred variable annuity with a guaranteed income feature.With a variable annuity, you can allocate your investment to different mutual funds.Your monthly payment will depend on how the subaccounts perform.This is the source of risk and also the reason why a variable annuity might pay you more than a fixed annuity.
You can get a variable annuity with a guaranteed income rider, guaranteed death benefit, or a minimum rate guarantee. You will have to pay for these. These riders can protect you by guaranteeing a minimum payout regardless of how well the subaccounts perform.
Always pay attention to the fees, which can add up quickly on this type of annuity. You’ll be charged investment management fees, administrative fees, and charges for your rider.
 Stocks are more volatile and, thus, capable of generating more income than bonds and CDs.You can invest in stocks through your employee-sponsored retirement account, an IRA, or a broker.If you want income to grow during retirement, stocks should be part of a well-balanced investment strategy.


Realize, however, that even blue-chip stocks carry risks, and they don’t promise to pay any fixed amount like bonds do.
You can mitigate against this risk by purchasing a mutual fund, which pools together the money of many different investors. The fund then typically buys stock in many different companies.
Mutual funds are best if you don’t have the time to evaluate stock on your own.
 Some stock pay a portion of their earnings to stock holders based on how much of the company’s stock they own. Most companies that pay dividends pay four times a year.Since 1928, dividend stock has averaged annual returns of 9-11%.You can purchase dividend mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to add diversity to your portfolio.

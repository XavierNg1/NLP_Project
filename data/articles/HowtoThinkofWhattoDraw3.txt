 Read, listen to music, dance, or do some other creative activity. Take a walk around the block. Clearing your mind can make you feel creatively refreshed. You can also look to these as sources of input to get drawing ideas. For instance:While walking around your neighborhood, look for a seemingly banal object or scene that might make a great subject for a drawing.
Think about what images are suggested by the music you are listening to, and draw them.
 Trying out a new medium can be invigorating if you're stuck and don't know what to draw. Even revisiting familiar subjects can seem newly inspiring in a fresh medium. Try a variety of media, like:


Pencils
Charcoal
Pastels
Pens
Markers
Crayons
Conte crayons

, Push through and draw something, even on the days when you can’t seem to think of a good idea. Even if you don’t feel like what you draw on a given day is any good, don’t give up. By getting in the habit of drawing regularly, you will be more likely to produce good work than if you wait for inspiration to strike.

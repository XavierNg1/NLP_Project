 A network printer is a printer that is installed directly on your network. A network printer is not dependent on a connected computer being on, but can be somewhat difficult to configure, especially if the printer is older. Not all printers can be configured as network printers.
 Installing a network printer can be a bit trickier than installing a USB printer, and many printers have specific ways that they need to be installed. Referring to your printer's specific installation guide can save you a lot of headaches down the road. You can usually find the installation guide as a PDF file on the manufacturer's support page for your model.


You can quickly find the support page for your printer by opening Google and searching for "manufacturer model support".
 There are generally two ways that you can connect a network printer to your home network: wired or wireless.


Wired - Connect your printer to your network router using Ethernet network cable. Generally this doesn't require any further network configuration.
Wireless - Connect your printer to the wireless network using the display screen (if available). Most wireless printers will have a small display screen that you can use to find and connect to your home network. If your network is secure, you will be asked for the password. If you don't have a screen, you will likely need to connect the printer to your computer using USB and configure it in OS X first.
,,,, Your network printer will be installed in OS X, and you will be able to select it from the print menu in any program.

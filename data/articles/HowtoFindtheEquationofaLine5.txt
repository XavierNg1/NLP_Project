 Consult the examples above for more information., In other words, flip it over and change the sign. The deal with perpendicular lines is that they have negative reciprocal slopes, so you have to make changes to the slope before you can use it.


2/3 becomes -3/2
-6/5 becomes 5/6
3 (or 3/1 â€” same thing) becomes -1/3
-1/2 becomes 2

,
Multiply the slope (m) by the x-coordinate of the point.
Subtract that amount FROM the y-coordinate of the point.
You've solved for b, or the y-intercept.
,,, "Given (8, -1) and the perpendicular line 4x + 2y = 9, what is the equation of the line?"

Solve for slope. The slope of our new line is going to be the negative inverse of the slope of the old line. Figure out the slope of the old line:






2y = -4x + 9
Subtract "2" from both sides: y = -4/2x + 9/2
Slope is -4/2 or -2.


The negative reciprocal of -2 is 1/2.






Rearrange your equation. b = y - mx.
Plug in and solve.





b = -1 - (1/2)8.
b = -1 - (4).
b = -5.


Double-check that your y-intercept is really -5.
Write down the equation: y = 1/2 x - 5

 If your horse often spooks at a particular type of object, like tarps or bicycles, try “following.” This may help your horse become accustomed to these objects.Drag (or roll) the object around in front of your horse, leading away from him. Allow your horse to follow you.
Don't approach your horse with the object, or drag it towards him – this will probably frighten him.
Pull the object around calmly, until your horse becomes curious and comes to explore it. This may help get rid of his fear of this type of object.
 One way to help your horse become accustomed to a particular scary object in the ring is to gradually direct him closer to it., If your horse seems to be afraid, but is still allowing you to control him, be sure to praise his behavior. Speak in a calm, reassuring tone of voice.Place the scary object at the far end of your ring or paddock, and ride your horse in small circles in the center of the ring.
Gradually ride in wider circles until you are closer to the object. Don't get so close that your horse spooks.
Praise your horse for remaining in control, and repeat the exercise another time. Ride closer to the object each time.
 If you don't have much experience with horses, find a local trainer who will work with you and your horse together, to establish trust between you. A good trainer will assign exercises you can do with your horse, to strengthen the bond between horse and rider.

 Try to avoid drinking anything with caffeine, such as coffee, black tea, or soda, at least 6 hours before going to bed.Caffeine is a stimulant, so it will make falling asleep difficult.


If you must drink something hot before going to bed, opt for an herbal tea, such as chamomile, instead of a black tea.
 Eating meals that are too heavy or spicy before bedtime may cause some discomforts in your stomach, which might prevent you from falling asleep.Eating a light meal or snack, such as crackers, before going to bed is fine and will not disrupt your sleep.
 While exercise is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, try not to exercise before going to bed. Plan your exercise or workout routine 3 to 4 hours before your bedtime., Instead, reserve sleep for the evening. If you feel sleepy during the day, distract yourself by talking to a friend, doing some exercise, reading, or performing some other activity. Persistent napping during the day will detract from the amount and quality of sleep you get during the night.

 Yandere characters usually have a special look they use to cue when they're about to go on the rampage. Oftentimes this is a somewhat creepy expression, represented in animation by a shadow cast over the face. When people are interfering with you and your target, glare at them through your eyelashes to imitate this.


When someone is edging in on the target of a yandere individual's love, another common reaction is to open their eyes wide with an expression that might be described as "menacingly shocked."A twitching eye or mouth can be just the thing to show you're about to blow your top. When you feel your inner beast stir, let a twitch signal your feelings to the rest of the world.
Avoid doing this around people who aren't in on the joke, as you may scare them.
 Be expressive with your face. Show the target of your love clearly how you feel with smiles, wistful looks, and lovelorn glances. Oppositely, when things get romantically rocky or someone butts in on you and the target, let your features reflect your disapproval.Although expressiveness is a common feature recognized in yandere, this may be due to the fact that Japanese animation and manga, which are often very expressive, are the most common mediums in which the yandere archetype occurs.
 Use your phone or an audio recorder to take a sound clip of your laugh. Listen to it. Your laugh should be cute but with an underlying edge. Adjust your laugh little by little, using the recorder to check the changes you have made. Do this until your yandere laugh is second nature.


Changing a natural reflex, like laughter, can be difficult. It may take a while and some trial and error before you get the laugh up to yandere standards.

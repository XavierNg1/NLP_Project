 This is usually done by right-clicking on the shortcut of the application intended. Select "Properties" and then the "Compatibility" tab. From here you can set a program to run on your current Windows OS in such a way it will not cause any problems with your modern OS (eg. Windows XP) -- In theory.;
, A quick and easy way to do this is to download virtualization software (Innotek VirtualBox, QEMU or Microsoft Virtual PC 2007)

, Make them.
 For this part you need a Windows 98 CD or a CD Image of one. Insert it into the Virtual Machine and install Windows 98 on your virtual computer.
 Running Windows 98 on top of your current OS shouldn't be too much of a burden, but when using processor-intensive applications, large installations or playing games you may need to temporarily turn off your Virtual Machine.
 This varies from software to software, but the defaults for Microsoft Virtual PC and VirtualBox are Right-Alt (normally 'Alt Gr') and Right Ctrl respectively

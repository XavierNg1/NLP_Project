, They will be your headliners and will ensure that you get a large enough crowd. Hopefully, they will supply you with the drums for the night and some amps. If they won't, get one of the other bands to do this. It's more effective, and it's cheaper than renting instruments.
 It's recommended that you get at least one band that is totally unheard of; they can open the night and it will promote them, as well as earn you one new contact., Some bands may have a fee, but often, unsigned/local bands will play for nothing if you throw in a few free tickets for their friends. However, don't take advantage of their generosity and always set aside some cold hard cash from the budget to give each band. Even if its only 40 or 50 quid a band, they'll appreciate it. Throw in a few quid extra for whichever band supplied the drums etc. just for wear and tear, and as a thanks. Add this cost to your budget figure.
 If the venue has one, and has a PA installed, use him. If not, a Sound Engineer may supply a PA and set up the system for a cost. If you are familiar with using a PA and miking amps etc, feel free to organise this yourself, but it is an added hassle. Maybe one of your friends/new-contacts can do this for free. Add any costs incurred to your budget.
 This is the guy that introduces the bands, and closes the night. Try to get someone locally famous on the band scene, or do it yourself. It just takes some confidence, and a few minutes of preparation. Caution, a rubbish/drunk/unpopular MC can ruin a night and cause unnecessary hassle, better no MC than one that causes you problems

 If an excess of mucus has made its home in your throat, it's okay to evict it by coughing it up. Find a remote place, such as a bathroom, and try to loosen the mucus from your throat by coughing or hacking. Make sure not to cough too hard or too much, as it can do some damage.;
, Dissolve a teaspoon of salt into 8 ounces of lukewarm or warm water. Take the water into your mouth, tilt your head back, and without swallowing, gargle the salt water in the back of your throat.
 The right liquids can help loosen the mucus from the lining of the throat as the liquids pass down the esophagus. Try the following for time-tested mucus relief:









Warm tea with lemon and honey. This should be one of your mainstays. The acidity of the lemon is good at breaking up the mucus while the honey coats the throat with a pleasant protective layer afterward.
Warm soup. Chicken soup is a favorite because the broth is light and cuts the mucus. Stick with lighter broths instead of thicker, creamier soups.
Cool water. Listen to your thirst and drink as much water as you need to stay satiated.
 Give yourself a steam treatment and let warm steam travel down your sinus and throat, loosening up some of the mucus that's lodged there. Try the following for relief:









Wrap a towel around your head and breathe in the steam issuing from warm water. Even better, steep some tea (chamomile works great) in a large pot, carefully lower your head over being and breathe in the steam.
Take warm showers. If you take a long shower, be sure to moisturize afterward as warm water robs your skin of essential oils and moisture.
Use a humidifier/vaporizer. Allow your humidifier to pump moist air into your room. Take care not to pump too much moisture into the air; a little bit goes a long way.
 Generic medicine, like Mucinex, is available to thin out and loosen mucus. Look for medicines that are labeled "expectorants," which means to clear out phlegm or mucus.

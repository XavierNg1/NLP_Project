 Choose your favorite colors because you will be wearing this project.
 You will be making magazine "beads," so you can choose to make them all 2 inches (5 cm) wide or they can vary from 1 to 5 inches wide (2.54 to 12.7 cm).
 Fold it over again and then begin rolling until you have a tightly rolled strip of magazine page. Take your hot glue gun and glue the corner down with a very small amount of hot glue.
 Each strip will be a bead on a necklace, so make 5 to 7 for a small necklace or 20 for a large necklace.
 Sit on the book until the rods are squashed flat. This will make them easy to roll up into a bead.
 When you get close to the end, put a small strip of hot glue on the strip of paper so that it will stick together in a spiral bead form.
 When you have all your beads made, you can start constructing your necklace. Arrange the beads in any shape you prefer.


You can make a small cluster of magazine beads or a large horizontal cluster that will go across your chest. This part of the process is fairly abstract because you must decide how you want to arrange the beads.
 Allow them to dry completely.
 You may need to break a chain in the middle to do this so that the clasp is in the back. Hot glue 1 broken end of the chain on the right and 1 on the left side of the bead cluster.
 Then wear your necklace.

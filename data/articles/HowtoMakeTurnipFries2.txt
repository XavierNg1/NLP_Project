 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the fries, set the temperature to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat. Next, line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.You can substitute foil for the parchment paper if you prefer.
 Place 1 pound (454 g) of turnips that have been peeled and cut into ½-inch (13-mm) thick sticks into a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of black pepper, ¼ teaspoon (2 g) of paprika, ¼ teaspoon (¼ g) of garlic powder, and ¼ teaspoon (¼ g) of dried parsley, and mix well so the turnips are completely coated.You can substitute coconut oil for the olive if you prefer.
 When the turnip fries are seasoned, transfer them to the lined baking sheet. Spread them out in a single layer so they will cook evenly., Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the turnip fries to bake for 30 minutes.At the 15 minute mark, turn the fries over with a spatula so they cook evenly on both sides.
 After the turnip fries have cooked for half an hour, increase the oven’s temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius). Let the fries cook for another 5 minutes or until they are crispy.Keep a close eye on the fries for the last 5 minutes to ensure that they don’t burn.
 When the turnip fries are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Transfer the fries to a platter, and serve them while they are still warm.You can serve the baked turnip fries with ketchup, garlic aioli, or your favorite fry dipping sauce.

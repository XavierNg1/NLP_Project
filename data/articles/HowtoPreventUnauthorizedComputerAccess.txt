Change your password often, at least every 2 months.
Do not leave your password written down in a place where others can easily find it.;

Open email attachments only if you trust the party that sent it. Many times, email attachments will house viruses and malicious spyware that will allow unauthorized access to your computer.
Ignore or delete phishing emails, which are email messages that masquerade as official emails from your bank or shipping companies that want you to divulge sensitive and private information; such as your social security number, passwords and more.

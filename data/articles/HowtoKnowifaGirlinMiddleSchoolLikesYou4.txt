 Asking her friends is she likes you is a less bold way of basically telling her that you're interested in her yourself. Still, if you're feeling shy but really want to know how she feels without asking her directly, then just ask her friends how she feels about you. They probably won't tell you how she feels, but they'll make it obvious that she likes you by acting excited and saying that you should talk to her. They'll also tell her that you like her right away, so be careful.


Her friends will, however, let you know if the girl doesn't like you and this will spare your feelings if she doesn't.
 If you're feeling brave and really want to date this girl, then just find a time when you're alone together, like by your lockers after school, and ask her how she really feels about you. You can even admit that you like her first (if you do) and wait for her to respond. Don't put too much pressure on her -- just casually say that you've noticed that she might like you and that you want to know how she feels.


You can even complement her a bit to put her at ease.
 If she admits that she likes you and you like her too, you don't have to jump up and down for joy or you'll look uncool. Instead, just show her that you're excited that you both like each other and ask her if she wants to hang out some time. If she doesn't like you, don't be a jerk about it. Just say, "Cool, it's no big deal," and act cool and calm as you say goodbye. This will show her that you're comfortable with yourself and who knows -- maybe she'll change her mind about you in the future.


Whatever happens, remember that you're in middle school. Relationships in middle school are fun, but they're usually short and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Just try to have fun and if it doesn't work out with this girl, someone else will definitely fall for you.

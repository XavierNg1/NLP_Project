 This app allows you to load mod files into Minecraft PE for your Android device. You can use either the free or the paid version. When it comes to installing and using mods, both versions work equally well.
 You can download mod files from a variety of different sites that specialize in Minecraft PE mods. Some of the more popular sites include:


http://mcpebox.com/minecraft-pe-mods/
http://mcpedl.com/category/mods/
http://mcpehub.com/mods

, There are tons of different mods available for Minecraft PE on Android. Find a mod that suits your needs and open the details page for it.


The mod must match the version of Minecraft PE that you have installed. You can see your Minecraft PE version in the bottom-right corner of the Minecraft main menu.
 It may be difficult to find the exact link to begin downloading the file, as many sites use tricky ads to try to get advertising clicks. Beware of redirects when tapping links, as some sites will open ads in new tabs. The file you are downloading should be in .JS format.


It's recommended to start with just a mod or two, and then slowly add more. Mods tend to break each other, so it's best to keep it simple as you get started.
 You'll be using BlockLauncher to start Minecraft PE instead of the regular Minecraft PE app. BlockLauncher will load Minecraft PE and add the mod files you select.


Tap the wrench button at the top of the screen after starting BlockLauncher.
Tap "Manage ModPE Scripts."
Tap the "+" button in the corner and then select "Local storage to browse your device's files.
Open the "Download" folder and tap the mod file you downloaded. Tap the Back button to return to the main menu.
 After selecting the mod file, tap "Play" on the main menu to start Minecraft. You can create a new world or load one of your existing ones. The process for accessing the mod's content will vary depending on the mod.

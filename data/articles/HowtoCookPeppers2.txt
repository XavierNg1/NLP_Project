 The grill should be set to medium heat, whether that grill is a charcoal type or a gas type.


Spread a moderate amount of coals into a charcoal grill, light, and wait until the fire dies down and white ash forms on the coals. The peppers will be placed directly over the heat.
For a gas grill, preheat the grill completely before reducing the heat to medium. Again, the peppers will be placed directly over the heat.
 Coat all sides of each pepper with olive oil or cooking spray. Again, this helps to keep the peppers from becoming stuck. Olive oil also imparts a nice flavor. Note that peppers should be grilled whole instead of cut.
 Place the prepared peppers on the grill, turning them as they cook so that all sides get evenly charred. Large peppers, like bell peppers, will need about 25 to 30 minutes total.Smaller peppers usually need about 8 to 12 minutes.


Leave the grill uncovered if you have a charcoal grill. Cover the grill if you have a gas grill, though.
 Remove the peppers from the grill and wrap them in aluminum foil. Let them slowly drop in temperature for about 15 minutes, until they are just barely cool enough to handle with your hands.


If you steamed the peppers by wrapping them in aluminum foil as they cooled, you should be able to peel off the charred skins with your fingers, making it easier to serve the fire-roasted flesh beneath.

 When registering your business name, think up a good business name that is not common. Most business owners have seen their choice business names rejected because they had been already used by another individual. Now, you have to be creative and ingenious about it.Once you have chosen an uncommon business name, you must have saved the headache of going through the whole process again and purchasing of another availability form would have been avoided.;
, In the CAC availability form, you’ll be required to submit two back up names to your most preferred business name. This is for fear that the one you want has been taken by someone else. You can also have few more business names in mind.
 As you want to register your business name, make sure you’re familiar with the type of business name you’re registering with CAC.The N200 availability form contains the following: Private Limited Company, Public Limited Company (PLC), Unlimited Company (ULTD), Change of name, Company Limited by Guarantee (LTD/GTE), Business Name, Incorporate Trustees. What you want is a business name, so just tick the column box by the slide of the business name.
 To correct your mistake, simply strike it neatly with a line. This keeps the availability form and file tidy and also saves you time and money.
 Business names that include words like Consult, Guru, Expert, Technician etc should be avoided. You could be required to provide a certificate backing to prove that you’re well trained in the area of business concerned.If you insist on using the name, then get a partner who has all necessary certificates to use such names and must be from a government approved institution.
 Check after 2-3 weeks to avoid risk of your business name being taken by someone who submitted after you but was following it up more closely.

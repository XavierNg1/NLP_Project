 Make sure you have enough paper towels to cover the sheet, but you do not need more than a single layer.
 Do not put leaves on top of one another; they should be separate and have their own space.
 They should not be in direct light of any kind.
 You can flip them once during the 2 week period to ensure each side dries evenly.
 If they are still dark green in spots or soft, they may need 1 more week to dry.

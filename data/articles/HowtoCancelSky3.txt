 Another way to cancel your account is by sending an email. This can be more long-winded than the other two options, as Sky require clarification of your account information above and beyond your email before they will close your account. In practice this means that they will need to speak to you over the phone in addition to your email.


It can take a while for an email to receive a reply, so send it as soon as you want your notice period to start.
Your notice period will start on the day you send the email, not the day you get a reply., Make sure you include all the pertinent information in your email. Put your name, account number, address, postcode, and telephone number in the email. State clearly that you are hereby cancelling your account, which will close at the end of the notice period.
 Once you have composed the email, send it to Sky at mysky@bskyb.com. Sky will reply back to you within five days of receiving your email.Note the day of the email and the date when the end of the notice period will be reached.


Keep a copy of all correspondence in case of any later disputes.
 After you have sent the email and received a reply, you will still need to call up to get your cancellation request processed. Make sure you have a copy of the email and reply handy. The reply may give you instructions on what you are required to do for your account to be closed.Be prepared for a potentially long and frustrating phone conversation.
Remember you have already cancelled in writing, and you are just phoning up to confirm your details as requested.
 Your services should end 31 days after the date of your initial email saying that you were cancelling your account. The notice period is the same whichever method you use to cancel your account. Once your services have ended return any equipment promptly and make sure your direct debit has ceased.

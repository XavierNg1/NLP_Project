 This variety of cockroach are considered large cockroaches and can grow up to two inches in size. If you were to lay the cockroach next to an American quarter, the quarter would take up about three-fourths of the cockroach’s body.
 American cockroaches are unique from other cockroaches in that they have a red-brown color that has an amber look to it. Most other cockroaches are a muddy brown color. Check to see if the roach you are looking at has a reddish glow to it. Also look for two large dark brown spots on the shoulders of these roaches--they are the only part of the bug without that reddish color.
 Aside from their unique color, American cockroaches are also the shiniest roaches. Their exterior, including their body and wings, has a shiny quality to it that many call glossy but no one would call glamorous., American cockroaches are notorious for only eating moist foods--like human and pet food--making them a personal problem as well as a household problem. If you see a large cockroach eating your food or your dog’s food, it is very likely that it is an American cockroach.

 Generally, the cutter mechanism of the manual can opener features a sharp tip to puncture of the can lid. You may see a curved or hooked point. It usually sits at the apex of the two long "arms" that you use to open and close the device. It should be situated alongside the handle, the axle, and the serrated wheel that will bite into the rim of the can lid., Don't hold the can in the air. A stable base provides a force of resistance against the bottom of the can. This will give you added leverage for piercing the can lid. When you hold the can in the air, you also place yourself at a greater risk of cutting yourself or spilling the contents.
 Spread them as wide as they will go. This will allow you to fit the opener against the can in the correct starting position., Make sure that the puncturing point rests on the lip of the can lid. This should align the serrated cutting wheel with the edge of the can. Check that the rotating handle faces the outside of the can.

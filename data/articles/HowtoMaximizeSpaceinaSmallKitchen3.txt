 Pots and pans are one of the largest space-fillers in your kitchen. Keep them from filling up storage areas by installing a pot rack or individual hooks on an open wall. Another good option is hanging up a piece of pegboard, which will allow you adjust the location of hooks and other hanging apparatus., One way to make an island work in a small kitchen is to make it mobile. This is definitely worth working into your kitchen, as it will add both surface area and storage space, and can be moved out of the way when not in use. You may simply be able to add wheels to a freestanding island you already have, or adapt a cart into a kitchenette.You can also use a build-your-own shelving unit and attach a wood cutting surface, or any surface of your choosing, to the top level with a bit of DIYing. Building your own allows you to customize it with the features that will be most helpful for you.
Whatever sort of island you purchase or put together, make sure the wheels have locks so you can securely fix the island when using it.
 Want to get rid of that knife block once and for all? Easy: install a magnetic strip designed to hold knives on the wall, ideally near where you like to do your prep work. Make sure the strip is elevated, and ideally above a counter or other feature that will keep any children or pets away.Install a paper towel roll nearby too. After washing a knife, simply wipe it on the towel roll and put it on the magnet strip.
 If you’re short on dry food storage area, or struggle with a deep pantry that’s hard to see or reach into, consider making better use of the space by installing a slide out shelving unit. Slim, tall spice racks or can shelves can slide in and out of surprisingly small spaces that you may not currently be using.

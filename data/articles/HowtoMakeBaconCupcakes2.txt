 Preheat the oven to 375º Fahrenheit or 190º Celsius. Prepare the cupcake or muffin pan by arranging the cupcake liners on it.
 Place into the skillet and cook over a medium to high heat. When browned, removed from the skillet, drain and set aside.

When cooled, slice the bacon into small pieces for adding to the cake mix and topping.
 Add the sifted flour, ¾ cup of cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt to the large mixing bowl. Mix to combine.
 Form a well in the center of the dry mixture. Crack the eggs and add, along with the cold coffee, buttermilk and oil. Stir until just blended.
, Use a tablespoon or ice cream scoop to help transfer the batter. Keep the batter to an even level in each cupcake case.
 Place the baking pan in the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops of the cupcakes spring back to the touch.
 Remove from the oven. Leave the pan on a wire cooling rack to cool for about 5 minutes.
 Frost with a chocolate frosting. Sprinkle the remaining chopped bacon pieces over the top. Finish with a dash of cocoa powder.

Alternatively, instead of chopping the last quarter of the bacon into fine pieces, cut in small, neat slices. Dip each slice into melted chocolate and allow to set. Then add a slice or two to the top of each cupcake. This looks refined and tempting.

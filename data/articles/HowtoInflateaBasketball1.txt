 Purchase a decent air pump for balls if you have not done so already. Pumps aren't too expensive and are easy to find. You can even use a bike pump with the proper needle.


You’ll need to purchase a ball needle if your pump doesn’t already have one.;
, Connect your needle to the pump. Moisten the needle with water and insert it into the hole of the ball.


The hole where you insert the needle is a small black rubber circle with a smaller hole. Check with the manufacturer if you cannot find the hole for your ball., Start pumping your ball. Check the air pressure after 3-5 intervals by feeling your ball. The point is to check how much air you have pumped. Compress the ball with your fingers to check the air pressure.


Another way to check is to hold the ball beneath your chin and drop it. If the ball reaches around your waist level, then it has the correct amount of air., Once you have a well inflated basketball, you’re ready to take it to the courts. Enjoy your game with a pumped ball. There isn’t a better feeling than a well pumped ball.

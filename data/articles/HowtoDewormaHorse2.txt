 Your horse's mouth should be empty, with no wads of grass or straw in it. These could make it easier for the horse to spit the medicated paste out. Your horse should also wear a halter which will give you something to hold onto when administering the dewormer. Have the syringe ready by removing the cap and dialing the dosing ring back to the appropriate mark on the barrel of the syringe.You may want to feed and water your horse before giving the medication, since the taste of dewormers might keep your horse from eating or drinking for a while. This is especially important if your horse has exercised and is hotter or thirstier than usual., Aim the nozzle onto your horse's tongue by lifting the lips and angling it towards the back of the mouth. The best place to place the syringe is the gap between the incisors and canines at the front of the mouth and the molars at the back.Make sure you're able to hold the plunger in such a way that you can easily press the plunger.


Do not worry too much about the exact placement of the nozzle. As long as it is inside the mouth, chances are the dewormer will coat either the tongue, teeth, or lining of the cheek and most of it will be swallowed., Press the plunger down to squeeze the medication into your horse's mouth. Be quick so as not to upset your horse. Once all the medication is inserted, remove the plunger and hold your horse's head up for a few seconds. This will keep him from spitting the dewormer paste out.If your horse routinely spits out the medication, try inserting smaller amounts at a time or mix the paste into his food.

 When rebuilding trust, it's mostly a matter of time. You'll need to demonstrate good behavior, good choices, and a good understanding of your responsibilities. If you act in a way that is consistently trustworthy, your privileges and things will be returned to you soon.
 Trust between you and your parents can be fragile. Building up trust can take a long time, while breaking it can take only a few seconds. While you are trying to restore or maintain your parent's trust in you, always avoid doing anything that could cause more trouble. Try to avoid some of these behaviors to keep you on track, maintain trust, and keep your stuff:Yelling, angry outbursts, or screaming can all take away the feeling of trust that feelings can be shared openly.
Don't break important rules that your parents have given you. For example, sneaking out at night to hang out with friends can get other privileges taken away from you.
Don't lie to your parents. If you've been caught, lying about things can only make your situation worse.
 If you are ever unsure if something would be okay or not, ask your parents. It's a lot easier to ask and be told “no”, than it would be to break your parent's trust and rebuild it. Although it might not be easy to ask your parents, doing so can show your consideration for their rules, demonstrate respect, and help keep the feeling of trust strong. Always check with you parents before doing anything you think might break their trust and cost you some of your things or privileges.


You could try saying "I was wondering if I could stay out an hour later than normal with my friends. I know I'm not usually allowed, so I thought I would ask."
Don't get upset or argue if your parents say "No" after you ask.

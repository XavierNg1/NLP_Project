 Remove the casings from 1 pound (453 g) of Italian sausage links. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the links into 1-inch (2.5 cm) slices and put them into a Dutch oven or large soup pot. Chop two medium onions and add them to the pot. Cook the sausage and onions over medium heat until the sausage is cooked.Stir the sausage and onions frequently to prevent them from sticking.
The sausage should no longer be pink in the center once it's finished cooking.;
, Peel and chop 6 garlic cloves. Add them to the pot with the sausage and onion. Let the garlic cook for one minute. Cut 1 pound (453 g) of boneless skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes and add them to the pan. Keep cooking the mixture until the chicken is completely cooked.You'll probably need to cook the chicken for about 8 to 10 minutes.
If there's a lot of grease in the pan, consider draining it before you add the chicken.
 Open two (15 ounce or 425 g) cans of white kidney beans. Rinse and drain the beans before adding them to the soup pot. You'll also need to stir in two (14.5 ounce or 428 ml) cans of chicken broth, two (14.5 ounce or 411 g) cans of diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano.If you don't have white kidney beans, you can also use cannellini beans.
 Turn the heat up to high, so the soup begins to boil. Turn the heat back down to medium-low, so the soup just bubbles gently. Simmer the soup for about 10 minutes. This will develop the flavors.Keep the lid off while the soup simmers. This will thicken the soup a little.
 Measure out 6 cups (1.35 kg) of fresh spinach leaves and roughly chop them. Stir this into the soup and heat it for a few minutes, so the spinach wilts a little. Sprinkle a little shredded Parmesan cheese, if you like and serve the soup.If you want to use frozen, chopped spinach, add it to the soup before it simmers with the beans and tomatoes.

 if they don't have an e-mail address, write letters. If she is calling just to see how you and your family are doing, that is a good way to keep her updated while keeping your space. Another way is to just let your husband talk to her. Listening to her voice all the time can be like she is living with you and you feel lack of space, therefore, let your husband talk. Usually men are brief but at the same time they give simple information, this way she gets what she wants but in a not intrusive way. If your husband is not brief, you can ask him to call her when he is coming home from work, that way he will let it out. Another thing is if you let your husband/wife talk to their own mothers (your mother-in-law), if she says something that you would take it badly, you won't know and you will still have peace.;
, Let her know that even though she hardly talks to you, it's not because you are mad at her or anything like that.
 Letting them deal with them on their own is better. Why? Because they grew up with them whole life with their mom's therefore they know how to deal with them and if they do get them mad, they did it, not you! And there are advantages to this too, the conflict is minimal and she will forget it in no time, because it's her own son/daughter therefore she is very forgiving.
 Should I say more? Grandparents can be really intrusive when it comes to grandchildren and can turn our world around. They expect pictures, updates and everything. What you can do is set a certain time to send pictures, you don't have to set a time with her but set the time for yourself. You can tell her: 2 to 2 weeks we will be sending pictures.
 Let her talk to your child as well, some children hardly say anything and some talk a storm, use that time to do something around the house (which we know we have a lot to do). Also, it's really important to encourage grandchild - grandparent relationship.

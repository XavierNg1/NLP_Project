 Before you begin your project, make sure you have all the supplies you need. You should be able to find most of the necessary supplies at a local craft store, although the gems are typically sold at dollar stores. They may be cheaper when purchased there.You will need a color nail polish you like. Nail gems look best when painted with glittery polish, so opt for a glittery shade if possible.
You will need glass gems with a dome top. Go for the larger gems, as these are easier to work with.
You will need paper towels to set down over your work station. This will catch any nail polish that leaks out.;
, Take the gem you're working with and turn it so the flat back is pointing upward. You want to paint on the flat back, and not the dome-shaped top. Using the brush that comes with the nail polish container, paint your chosen nail polish shade over the back of the gem.








Make sure to cover the entire gem. You don't want any bare bits of glass exposed.
You should let the nail polish dry completely before moving on to the next step. This can take between half an hour and an hour. If you want to speed up the project, consider buying fast dry nail polish.
 How many layers you need depends on the consistency of your polish. Thinner polishes may need several layers to adequately coat the gem. Thicker polishes may only require a couple of layers. Always wait for each layer to dry before adding another layer of nail polish.
 Before turning your gem over to see the results, let it dry completely. You don't want to smear the nail polish. It should take about half an hour to dry. However, some nail polishes can take longer. If you want to play it safe, you can set the gem aside overnight. It should be dry by morning.When you set the gem on the flat back, the nail polish should shine through, creating a sparkly, attractive effect.

 Squats are a safe body-weight exercise you can do during pregnancy.Squats target your entire lower body. To do a squat, start with your feet hip-width apart. Draw your abs in and keep your chest up as you lower yourself down. You should push your hips back as you keep your chest up, like you are sitting in a chair. Then stand back up.Try to get at least parallel, but your mobility may limit how far you can go down while keeping good form.
Make sure you keep your knees over or behind your toes. Your knees should never extend beyond your toes.;
, Lunges are another lower body exercise you can do while pregnant to strengthen the lower body and stretch out the hips. Step one leg forward in front of you and lower down until your knee is at a 90 degree angle. Bend your back leg until that knee is also at a 90 degree angle. To finish, step your front foot back to the original position.

You can either do a number of reps with the same leg or alternate back and forth.
The knee of your front leg should always be directly over your foot. Don’t extend your knee beyond your foot. This can lead to injury.
 Another lower body movement you can do while pregnant is a plie. Stand with your feet wide. Turn your toes out away from your body. Bend your knees as you lower your hips down. Squeeze your glutes and thighs as you lower down and then squeeze back up.You can hold light three to five pound weights during this exercise for some added arm strength work.
 Opening up your hips is important during pregnancy because it can help you during delivery. Start this stretch by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Move all your weight to one leg. Swing your free leg forward, getting it as high as possible. Next, swing the leg back as you try to get it as far up as you can. Do this for one minute before you switch.Try to get the leg you’re swinging parallel to the ground.
Hold on to the wall or a chair for support if you need to.

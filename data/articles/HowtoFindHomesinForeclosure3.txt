 Investors can find houses in foreclosure within the local market by monitoring public records and news reports. Many governments require full disclosure of properties in foreclosure in newsprint.


Public record searches may be 30-to-60 days behind in some situations.
Local properties listed as for sale may, in fact, be foreclosures. Many are listed through traditional means with a local real estate agent.
 Auction listings are another great local resource. Many government websites or government offices provide notices of area auctions of real estate. Contact local officials for more information.

 Your country's exit code + country code of the country you wish to call + area code + local telephone number.


For example, if you are placing a call from the UK to Los Angeles, CA, you would dial : 00 (exit code)-1(country code) – 323 (area code)– xxx – xxxx (local number).
For a step-by-step breakdown of this process, see the following steps.;
, This is the number that routes your call out of the country you are in. Other names for this code are the international access code or IDD International Direct Dialing code.


For the United States and Canada, the international access code is 011.
In the example above, 00 - 1 - 323 - xxx - xxxx, 00 is the exit code.
The code differs for each country. A more complete listing of the international access codes can be found here.
 The country code ranges from 1 to 3 digits, and directs your call to a telecommunications circuit for the country you are calling.


For example when dialing, 00 - 1 - 323 - xxx - xxxx, "1" is the country code for the US.

 This narrows your call further to the particular state, city or town that you are calling.


Generally, area codes may range from 1 to 5 digits.
Returning to the example, in 00 -1- 323 - xxx - xxxx, 323 is the area code for Los Angeles.
 This is the more familiar number that is similar to the phone numbers we dial all the time, although some countries may use more or less digits.


For some countries, many local numbers contain a “trunk prefix” that should be omitted when dialing from overseas. This number is only used within the country’s phone system.
This number is usually 1 or 0. You can search for trunk prefixes online, or simply try skipping the first number of the local number you are using if you are having trouble connecting.
In the US, the trunk code is 1, and is typically used before the area code when dialing long distance within the US. When dialing from abroad, the trunk code is omitted.

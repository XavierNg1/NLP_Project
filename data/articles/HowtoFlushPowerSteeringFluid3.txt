 Many owner's manuals never even mention steering fluid, and despite the urging of some mechanics, there is growing disagreement that a full flush is really needed for most cars.If the fluid doesn't smell burnt and there are no metallic bits in the fluid, you can get by with a simpler "flush."


If your fluid is dark or you are losing sleep worrying about your car, this simple procedure will refresh your fluid for the foreseeable future., This is usually labeled with a steering wheel icon on the cap.
 Note the color and consistency of the fluid. If it smells burnt or has bits of metal in it, you'll need to do a full flush of the system. Note the current level of the fluid.
 This will take some time, and you will not get everything, but this is a simple and easy way to get old fluid out without a complicated flush., This simple procedure will protect your car, cheaply, and is just as effective a method as a full flush if you have no other problems. The power steering system is, relatively speaking, rather clean and simple. Unlike other fluids, like oil, the power steering system doesn't even need a filter. This quick "refresher" is likely all you'll need to do to keep your wheels turning easily.


Many cars don't even recommend changing this fluid â€” you'll be ahead of the game if you even do this.
 Drive the car around, recirculating the fluid, and repeat a few weeks later if you want a full "flush." This won't get everything out, but more than enough to keep your car running happily.

 Every device that supports universal remotes has a code that will allow you to control it. You'll need to identify yours in order to pair your dish remote with the device. You can find the code in the Dish database here..


Visit the link above and, in step two, click on your remote model, product type, and device manufacturer. Write down the three-digit code, as you'll need to reference it later.;
, The device will need to be turned on before you start programming the remote.
 You can control most TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, and home theater receivers.
 Hold the button that corresponds with the type of device you want to control.
 This indicates that the remote is ready to program.
 Be sure not to press any other buttons while entering your code, or this step won't work.


Note: If entering a code for an AUX device, you'll need to add a digit to the front: 0 for TVs, 1 for DVD, 2 for other devices.
 This will lock the code into the remote. The device button that you just programmed will flash three times.
 This should turn your device off. You can now use the remote to control that device as long as the correct device button has been pressed.


If the code didn't work, you'll need to repeat the process and try a different code. Many device will have multiple codes you can try.

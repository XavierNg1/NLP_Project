 Nothing is worse than wearing footwear without grip while walking in the snow. It will send you sliding in no time. Instead, pick sneakers or boots that have lots of traction. If the soles have treads with deep grooves then they are less likely to slip when you take a step.


Avoid wearing unstable shoes or any sort of shoe with no tread while walking in the snow. Wearing sensible shoes in the snow will help you tremendously.
Of course, shoes designed to be worn in snow are probably the best choice. They should have great traction for snow, as well as usually being waterproof.;
, Having ankle support can help you avoid a slip. Supporting your ankles allows you to have more stability when your feet start to go, especially if you have weak ankles to begin with. Ankle support may also help you to avoid an ankle injury if you do indeed fall.


Without ankle support you are more likely to get an ankle strain if you fall, especially if you have injured your ankles before.You may try to use your ankles to steady yourself if you begin to slip and this can injure an unsteady ankle.
 If you will be doing a lot of walking in the snow, and you are less than thrilled with the amount of grip your shoes are giving, then add some traction to them. You can buy removable ice grips that you can add to any shoe or boot. They can usually be put on and taken off easily and will increase your stability immensely.If you are in a pinch, place a plastic bag or sock over your footwear. This will increase the grip significantly.
 Whatever kind of shoes you pick, be sure to knock the snow off of them when you get a chance. This will clear the grooves on the sole and allow them to create traction again. Use any opportunity you can to stamp the snow off your footwear.


Knocking the snow off your shoes will it prevent the ice from melting into your footwear, and it will give you that extra comfort when walking.

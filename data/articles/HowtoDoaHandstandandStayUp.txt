 If you bend your elbows, you will collapse onto the floor - but if you lock your elbows, you will hold your weight on your hands almost effortlessly.;
, Before you try a handstand, try high kicks. Place your hands about shoulder length apart on the floor in front of you. Lean upon your hands so that a majority of your weight is positioned onto the floor through your hands. Practice kicking one leg at a time up into the air, just to get the feeling of lifting onto your hands. You do not want to go vertical - just kick your legs off the ground one at a time and return to your original position.
 Getting everything right is important, you will fall right back down if your form is not perfect.
 A good way to figure this out is to do a cartwheel and see which foot you put in front.
, You should be able to draw a straight line from your hands to your non-dominant foot. Once your hands hit the ground, push off your dominant foot and bring it up to your non-dominant foot which should be straight in the air at this point.
, If you are trying to look forward, you will lose your balance, it is best to look at your hand to create a center of balance.
,, When falling backwards, arch your back and try to land in a bridge position. When falling forward, try to land on your feet.
 If you have a short shirt be sure to tuck it into your pants. You don't want your stomach to show.
 It may take you a few minutes or a few hours. But if you keep practicing you'll get it. Remember that you have to do it slowly or else you will collapse.
 Once you become comfortable being in a handstand position, you will be able to hold the handstand for longer and longer amounts of time. Always remember to lock your elbows.

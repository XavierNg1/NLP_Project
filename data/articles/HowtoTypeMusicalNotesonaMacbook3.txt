 If you are looking to type more than just a few decorative musical notes on a page and want to actually start writing your masterpieces on your macbook, there are a few great options out there for music writing applications. Finale NotePad is a wonderful option but for Mac software, it is a bit pricey at almost ten dollars. A few great and free options are MuseScore and Scorecloud., Download the software you have chosen either from the app store or from their site. Make sure to be wary of scams and viruses. For this tutorial, we will be focusing on MuseScore but most of the software will operate in basically the same way.
 When you first open the music writing app, you will see a window entitled "Start Center." This is where you will be able to open existing projects or start a new one., Create the title of your new piece before continuing on.
 After you name your piece, you will be able to select from given templates or choose to create your own. It is here that you will be able to choose your key, tempo, clef, and whatever else you need in order to write your piece.
 Once you have entered the basic information for your piece, select "Finish" and start working on your music.

 It is important to set personal boundaries with the person you dislike at work. Setting boundaries may include not discussing personal or family matters in the workplace, not sharing a personal cell phone number, and limiting the number of projects you work on together. By setting clear boundaries, you will know you only have to deal with the individual you dislike in certain situations at work and only in relation to work related matters.Avoid giving them your personal cell phone number.
Tell them you are only comfortable talking about work related matters and that personal topics are off limits.
If they ask you for your personal cell phone number, you could say: “Sorry, I actually prefer to use my work number. You can call me there and I’ll answer as soon as I can. You can also contact me on email. Hope you understand.”
If they invite you to the bar after work, you might say: “Sorry, I have a prior engagement this evening. I also like to keep my work life separate from my personal time. Hope you can understand.”

, If you have a choice between a face-to-face and a skype meeting with the person you dislike, choose the skype meeting. Meetings on skype tend to be a little more perfunctory and it can be easier to avoid small talk. Alternately, see if you can cut down on meetings and get more coordination done via email., If you have to interact with the individual you dislike in order to get a project done, see if any work friends are willing to help you out. Although you may dislike them, you may have a friend at work who has a better working relationship with them. If this is the case, they may be able to help you by taking on the brunt of the work that needs to be done with the individual you dislike.

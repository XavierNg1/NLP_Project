 Children need structured scheduling as they grow up. Though every day does not have to be exactly the same, there should be a routine or regular schedule that you follow throughout the week. Let your work schedule be dictated by your toddler's schedule, not the other way around., If your work phone rings during your set "non-business" hours, let it go to voicemail. Limit checking your work email to your set office hours, too., There are natural times throughout the day when you can focus on your work, such as when your toddler is resting. In order to stay healthy, a toddler must take daily naps, so use this to your advantage by making progress in the afternoon., In order to maintain attention on your child, take breaks from your work. Tell your toddler when your next break will be and how you plan to spend that time with them, so that they can look forward to it.Taking a walk with your child can be a fun and healthy way both to spend quality time together and to stay energized during the workday.
 Allowing for some “you” time is important so that you don’t become overworked and exhausted. Schedule free time for relaxing and rejuvenating yourself.
 Although you may have a plan in place as to when you are going to tackle work assignments, be flexible in order to meet your toddler's needs. Something unexpected could come up that requires your full attention, such as your child falling and getting a cut on their knee. Be ready to stop working at a moment’s notice.Understand that your toddler takes priority. If you are on a phone call and your child is screaming, apologize and ask if you can call back later.
Save your work frequently if working online or in a document, since you never know when you will have to move away from your computer to attend to your child’s needs.

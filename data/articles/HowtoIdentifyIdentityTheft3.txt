 If you are a merchant and you believe that a customer just committed or attempted to commit fraud with a stolen identity, call the police. If you are a consumer whose identity has been stolen, you can report the theft of your identity, but the purpose of making a report is to mitigate the harm rather than to catch the perpetrator. However, any information you can provide can help the authorities track identity thieves.
 If someone stole your personal information, contact the company where the fraud occurred. Speak with the fraud department and explain what happened. The company can help you close or freeze your account, and change your login and PIN information., Contact one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies and request a fraud alert. The alert will make more difficult for the thief to open a new account in your name. Once you contact one credit reporting company, that company is required to notify the other two. Use the following contact information:


Equifax: 1-888-766-0008, or http://www.equifax.com/CreditReportAssistance/

TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, or http://www.transunion.com/fraud

Experian: 1-888-397-3742, or https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html, The Federal Trade Commission accepts complaints online or by phone. Once you file a complaint, you will receive an Identity Theft Affidavit. You will need the affidavit to file a police report.


File an FTC complaint by calling 1-877-438-4338, or visiting https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&panel1-1

To update your affidavit with new information by calling the same number., Visit your local police department and ask to file a police report regarding the theft of your identity. You may need to show the police report to business to prove that your identity was stolen. To file a police report, take the following documents to the police:


Your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit;
A government-issued photo ID (such as a driver's license or state ID card);
Proof of your address (such as a utility bill or rental agreement);
Any proof of the theft (such as bills or notices from the IRS); and
The FTC's "Memo to Law Enforcement," which is available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/articles/pdf/pdf-0088-ftc-memo-law-enforcement.pdf.

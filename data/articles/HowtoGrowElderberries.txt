 The best soil for elderberries is free-draining and fertile.


Add compost and work through the soil.
Ensure good drainage; elderberry doesn't like waterlogged soil.;
, Take a hardwood or softwood cutting when the canes are still dormant and place in a container of quality soil. Water regularly.
 Plant in early spring, as soon as you can after transporting it from the nursery. If you have propagated your own, plant it when it's ready. Elderberry has short roots, so do not cultivate deeper than 5cm / 2 inches.


Space elderberry 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0Â m) apart.
, Wait until the berries are ripe and remove the whole cluster.


The berries should be used as soon as possible after harvesting. Keep in refrigeration until used.
The berries must be cooked; uncooked they have a dark purple juice, and are astringent and inedible.
 Prune later winter to early spring. Prune off dead, damaged, or broken canes. Second year canes fruit the best.


Remove all three year old canes. This will encourage new growth.
Leave an equal number of one, two, and three year old canes.
Remove all canes over three years old. Older canes weaken and lose their vigour.

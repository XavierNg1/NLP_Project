 Use an oil-based makeup remover to dissolve waterproof eyeliner. A dual-phase makeup remover removes most eye makeup. Cleansing water is perfect for sensitive skin or eyeliner that comes off easily, like liquid liner., A pad is preferable to a cotton ball, which can leave behind fibers that may get stuck in your eye.If you are just trying to fix a small mistake, dip a cotton swab in the remover and squeeze out the excess liquid with a tissue.Then gently erase the mistakes.
 You can wiggle the pad and add a little pressure to get between your lashes, but don't scrub.This give the makeup remover time to break down the eyeliner so it will come off quickly and easily.
 Be careful not to scrub or tug on your skin.Flip the pad over to the clean side and repeat.









Follow up by washing your face with your usual cleanser.

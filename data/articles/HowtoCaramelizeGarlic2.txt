 To ensure that your oven is hot enough to caramelize the garlic, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and make sure that the oven rack is set in the middle position.Keep an eye on the oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Many models will beep or flash an indicator light to let you know that it’s reached the desired temperature.
 Leave the head of garlic intact, but peel away the outer papery layers from the bulb. Use a sharp knife to carefully trim away approximately ¼ inch (.63 cm) from the top of the head so the tops of the individual cloves are visible.When you’re peeling and trimming the garlic head, make sure that all the cloves remain connected to one another. You don’t want them to come loose.
 Once the garlic is peeled and trimmed, place it on a piece of foil. Next, drizzle approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons of olive oil over it to cover all of it.When you’re pouring the oil over the garlic, make sure that it sinks down into and between the individual cloves.
 Wrap the foil up over the garlic head, and place it on the middle rack of the oven to bake. After 40 minutes, unwrap it and check the garlic. The individual cloves be a deep golden color and soft when pierced with a knife. If the garlic isn’t fully caramelized yet, let it keep baking but check on it in 10 minute intervals until it’s done.The exact roasting time necessary to caramelize the garlic will depend on its size, age, and variety.
When you check on the garlic, be sure to use an oven mitt or pot holder because the foil will be very hot.
 When the garlic has finished baking, remove it from the oven, unwrap it, and allow it to cool for approximately five minutes. To remove the garlic from the paper, push on the bottom of the clove. You can use the caramelized garlic right away or store it in the refrigerator for later use.The garlic will last up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If you freeze it, it can last up to three months.

 While many are available online, the design used in this article was created by the staff of the Missouri Department of Conservation and it is known to attract bluebirds.
 In this project, a piece of old cedar siding which measures 8' (2.4 meters) long by 11 1/2" (29.2cm) wide, and 3/4" (1.9cm) thick will make three bluebird houses. Additionally, 10 exterior grade 2" (5cm) screws are needed. A single bluebird house can be created from one 1"x 6" x 5' (2.5cm x 15cm x 30.5cm) board.
 For this project, you'll need a circular saw, 2 drills, a speed square, a pencil, and a brace-and-bit.
 This board was cut in to a 5 1/2" (14cm) wide piece and a 4" (10cm) wide piece.
The front and back parts are 5 1/2" (14cm) by 9 7/8" (25cm) and 16 1/2" (42cm) respectively.
The side parts are 4" (10cm) wide. The short side measures 9 3/4" (24.7cm) and the long side measures 10 3/4" (27cm).
The base section measures 4" x 4" (10cm x 10cm).
The top part is 6 1/2" inches (16.5cm) long and 6 inches (15cm) wide (so there is a little overhang to block rain). This last measurement is a little different from the plan shown above.
The dimensions for the front and sides will leave a little gap for ventilation under the lid when the box is assembled.
, You can use a spade bit, a hole saw, or an adjustable size hole bit. It is easier to do this before assembly.
For best results, drill the hole about three quarters of the way through, flip the board and finish the hole by drilling through the reverse side. Some of you may find this boring.
NOTE: Rough up the interior and the exterior of the front part so the chicks can easily leave the nest and so momma will have an easy time landing on the front of the box. This can be done with a knife, nail, or a chisel.
 Base may need additional trimming to get the proper fit in the assembled box.
The base is inserted about 1/4" (6.35mm) above the bottom of the sides. It is recessed to provide a drip edge.
 Pre-drill the holes with a "twist bit" which also drills a countersink for the screw head. Use exterior grade screws. Four in the front, four in the back, and two to secure the base.
, Insert a nail or screw which can be removed for cleaning the box after nesting.

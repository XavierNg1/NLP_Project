 Fill a small frying pan with approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Bring the water to a gently boil over medium-high heat.


As soon as the water boils, turn down the heat so that the water is just barely simmering. The water must bubble at a gentle pace before you add the eggs.
 As the water boils, crack each of the eggs into separate ramekins.


Open the eggs carefully to avoid breaking the yolk. Use a serrated knife to carefully saw through the shell and membrane at one end, then pour the inner egg into the ramekin through that opening.
Ideally, you should only cook three to four eggs at a time. For larger amounts, you may need to work in batches.
 Carefully pour each egg into the bubbling water. Space the eggs apart so that they do not touch one another.


Position the edge of the ramekin as close to the surface of the water as possible before pouring in the egg. Doing so will allow the egg to gently slide into the water, thereby preserving the yolk.
 Cook the eggs for about 1 minute, or until the whites are set and the yolk has reached your desired level of doneness.Use a spatula to carefully remove the finished eggs from the water. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels so that the water may drain.
 Serve the eggs immediately.


Poached quail eggs are typically served atop simple green salads or cooked green vegetables, but you can also enjoy them separately.
If you need to save the eggs for later, keep them in a bowl of ice water for up to several hours. Reheat the eggs in simmering water for 30 seconds, or until heated through, before serving.

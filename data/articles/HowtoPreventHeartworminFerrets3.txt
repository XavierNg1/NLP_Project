 A single adult heartworm can kill your ferret. Accordingly, early diagnosis of a potential infection is of vital importance. Catch an infection as early as possible by watching out for lethargy, chronic cough, shortness of breath, and/or low physical stamina. If any of these symptoms develop, take your ferret to the vet., A ferret with heartworm may exhibit either mild or severe symptoms. This can make diagnosing heartworm challenging. Watch out for weakness in your ferret’s hindquarters, changes in their eating habits, or swelling in their abdomen. While lots of illnesses may contribute to these symptoms, they should be monitored and reported to your vet., Your vet will rely on observation of symptoms, x-rays, and blood tests to determine whether your ferret has heartworm. Blood tests alone do not work as well on ferrets as they do on cats and dogs, so your vet will likely need to do a thorough assessment of your ferret’s health. While surgery to remove adult heartworms has successfully occurred, the chances of recovery from an advanced heartworm infection are quite low. Further, the medications capable of killing adult heartworms can also result in in your ferret's death. Take prevention seriously!

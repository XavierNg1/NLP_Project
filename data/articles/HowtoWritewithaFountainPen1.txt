 Depending on the size of your hand and the size of the pen, holding a fountain pen could cause weight and balance issues. Experiment with the cap posted (i.e. placing the cap on the back of the pen), and with the cap removed. The pen is usually more in balance when the cap is in place, but each person’s experience is different., Pinch the pen lightly between your thumb and index finger, then slide it towards the end of the index finger. Use the bottom of your hand, including your ring and pinky fingers, to anchor against the page. Do not press so firmly against the paper that free movement is restricted. Do not grab the pen towards the bottom. If the hand is placed too far towards the end, it can affect the proper writing angle and potential ink flow., This is similar to the positioning in which most people write. If the middle finger is guiding and squeezing more than being used as a resting point, adjust the pen’s rear closer to the V created where the thumb meets the hand.It may feel more comfortable to place the pen closer towards the end of your middle finger, past the knuckle.
 Poor ink flow is usually due to an improper angle.Keep in mind that each fountain pen requires a slightly different angle at which the tines and feed separate. You will learn to recognize this through practice.
Some nibs have been modified by technicians to accommodate angles ranging from 35 degrees to nearly 90 degrees.The feel will be different than that of a ball-point pen, which is designed to write from various angles, including vertical. A vertical fountain pen does not utilize the full width of the nib (the tip of the pen)., You don’t want the nib to rock side to side as you write. It’s possible for ink to flow from a variety of angles, but each pen has an optimal spot where the ink flows the best. Writing with a fountain pen can feel inconsistent if the nib is lifted or angled incorrectly off the paper.

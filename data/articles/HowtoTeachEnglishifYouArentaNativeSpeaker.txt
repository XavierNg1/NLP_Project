 It's true that you know English, but a certification can back you up. Ask around and see what certification tests are available in your country. CAE, TOEFL, ECPE, IETLS are some names to look for. Get the highest score you can.;
, Knowing English is a must to teach it, but having a certification is essential. Check the requirements for English teachers in your country to see what certificate you need. There are two key qualifications that are international recognized â€“ CELTA and TESOL. Both of them are types of TEFL courses.
 While being a native speaker might provide your students a taste of "real" English in class, having learned English consciously gives you a better understanding of grammar rules and the difficulties facing your students.
 Whether you are a native speaker or not, get some training before starting a class. Learn the skills you need to manage a class and the methodology you need to plan your course in advance. That way, you'll feel more confident about your skills.
 The teacher is an invaluable source of natural English for their students, but since you're not a native speaker, try to provide other sources like video, conversations, etc. Look for material that gives your students the chance to get to know real English.
 This approach will give your students the opportunity to talk, and become better while you talk less.
 This will give you support and help you to become better through interaction and exchange of ideas.

 Determine whether you have oily skin, normal skin, or dry skin before purchasing an exfoliating product. Dry skin is often flaky or itchy, whereas oily skin can feel greasy or look shiny. Many people have a combination of the two types in different areas, in which case use products for normal skin or products for the type of skin you have most of.
 If you have oily or normal skin choose a product that contains either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients can help to improve and prevent breakouts. You can also apply an alpha-hydroxy-acid cleanser, which helps remove dead skin cells. Use a product with retinoic acid to balance out skin tone and reduce wrinkles.


If you have dry skin, avoid using the above products and strong exfoliants that contain glycolic acid. Generally avoid any chemical products and opt for physical-based products that are less invasive.
Stay away from products that have higher than 10% glycolic acid or 2% salicylic acid.If you are allergic to aspirin, you should not use any product containing salicylic acid.
 If you have sensitive skin, look for products that are labeled as suitable for sensitive skin. Choose a product with smooth, synthetic exfoliating beads. These products are good for dry or easily irritated skin, too. If your skin is on the oily side, choose a product with coarse, rough beads that will exfoliate more aggressively.
 Brands like Clarisonic have developed tools that can be used to remove the outer layer of dead or dry skin from your face. These brushes use sonic frequency to remove dirt and debris from your face without irritating your skin. Though not as effective as a professional microdermabrasion treatment, these tools are much less expensive.

 Babies can often sense if you're uncomfortable or upset. Relax. Confidence is the key; holding a baby for the first time can be extremely terrifying for some people. You just have to remember that you can do this, and the joy of holding that baby will outweigh all of the anxieties! Though it's always important to be as careful as possible also remember: Babies are not as fragile as we think.;
, A newborn baby's head is by far the heaviest part of their body, and a baby's head and neck needs careful support. Usually you will hold the head gently with one hand. Use your right arm to scoop up the baby's bottom. Do this while supporting the head with your other hand.
 Bring the baby close to your chest, so that they can rest their head against your chest. Babies are instinctively comforted by hearing your heartbeat. Your right hand and arm should be supporting most of the baby's body weight, while your left hand supports and protects the head and neck.


Just make sure that your baby's head is facing to one side so that they can always breathe.
 Holding a baby can be incredibly soothing for both you and the baby. This is a great time to sing to the baby, read to the baby, and entertain the baby until it's time for the next feeding, diaper change, or nap. You will need to switch hands from time to time. When you do this, remember to always keep one hand under the baby's head as you switch hands.


Listen to your baby. Each baby has their own preferences for how they want to be held. If your baby is crying or being fussy, try switching to a different holding position.

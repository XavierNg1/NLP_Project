 Notepad is automatically installed on all Windows computers. You can find it in the Start Menu. Once you are in Notepad, click "File" and then click "Save As" in the dropdown menu. Choose "All Files" in the file type menu. Save your file as an HTML file. Usually, the main page of a website is known as "index.html" in order to be able to access everything on the website from that single page.
 Tags are basically some text inside of <angle brackets>.
You will use a variety of tags to create your webpage. There are also "end tags" which end a line of code. An example is of an end tag is:</text>.
These end things like a bold font or a paragraph.

You can put this at the top of your Notepad file.

The next tag, <title>, tells the browser what to put at the top of the window, and the optional meta tags, tells search engines like Google what the site is about.
,, Please note that not all colors are supported on all browsers. (for instance, dark grey probably wouldn't be supported on most browsers)

, Let's start with a header. A header a a section of large text, and is specified in HTML with <h1> through <h6>, with <h1> being the largest. So at the top of your webpage, after the body tag, might be something like <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1> Make sure you remember the end tag, or your whole webpage will be in giant!

, So after your header, you might have <p>. I'm learning how to make a website! wikiHow rules!If you want a new line in your site, use the <br> tag, or break tag.
 So let's put in some formatting. <b> for bold text, <i> for italics, and <u> for underlining. Remember your end tags!

, Even with formatting, who wants to look at endless words? Use the <img> tag to do this. But, like the body tag, it needs some extra information. An img tag might look like this: <img alt=dog src="dog.jpg" width=200 height=200>.
The src (source) is what the picture is called. The width and height are the width and height of the picture in pixels.
 You want your visitors to be able to see more than just one page. To create links, use: <a href="otherpage.html">Another page</a>.
The text in between the tags is what the user clicks on to get to the next page, and the href part is where their click takes them. Using a tags you can let your users move effortlessly around your website.
, Open the .html file in your favourite web browser to see how it looks. Congratulations! You just made a webpage.

 Hip replacement surgery removes damaged portions of your hip joint, such as the ball part of your femur or the socket part in your pelvis. It then replaces these deteriorated parts with artificial parts. This can be painful because your hip is one of the largest joints in your body.It can be replaced by metal or ceramic parts.
 There are some conditions that can lead to hip deterioration. The most common cause of this deterioration is osteoarthritis in the hip. Other causes include:


Rheumatoid arthritis.
Osteonecrosis, caused from bone death due to insufficient blood supply to the hip.
Injury.
Fractures.
Bone tumors., You may not know that you have any of the issues that cause hip deterioration or know when it is bad enough to need replacement. Most people need to undergo hip replacement if their joint is deteriorated enough to cause extreme pain that interfere with daily activities. These symptoms include:


Hip pain that limits your daily activities, such as walking or bending.
Hip pain that occurs even while resting, during either the day or night.
Enough hip stiffness that it limits your ability to move or lift the leg.
Pain bad enough that adequate pain relief cannot be received from anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs, physical therapy, or by using walking supports., Once you have your hip replacement, you will likely experience far less pain and be able to move your hip much better. This means that you will want to start doing your normal exercises and activities again. Low impact activities, such as walking, swimming, golfing, biking, and some forms of dancing will be great activities for you to do.


High impact activities, such as jogging, playing basketball, or playing tennis generally are not recommended, even after you recover.

 You may want to make sure you've mastered the process before unveiling your blooming marshmallows with all of your friends around. To do so, practice beforehand. If the flower doesn’t “open,” when you place if in hot chocolate, make sure the walls of the chocolate base aren’t too high, and that your individual petals weren’t stuck together too firmly.

Further, your buds will only open if the hot chocolate is hot enough to melt the chocolate. Accordingly, use hot chocolate that is still steaming and add the blooming marshmallow before the beverage cools.
 It almost goes without saying that blooming marshmallows are meant for use in one particular drink. Of course, if you want to try it in another hot drink, the world is your oyster. One particular interesting option would be making the base with caramel flavored chocolate chips, adding allspice to your flower bud, and serving this alternative blooming marshmallow in hot apple cider.Never to be forgotten, coffee is always a good call for sweet and seasonal garnishing.
Always add the marshmallow buds carefully, with the chocolate base down.
 Simply sprinkle cinnamon or whichever spice you have in mind onto your marshmallow bud before adding it to your hot chocolate. When you do, the petals will turn over as the bloom, dispersing the spice into your beverage and adding aroma in tandem with the visual allure of the opening marshmallow flower.Other spices that you can use to top your marshmallow include nutmeg and allspice. Similarly, consider sprinkling crushed candy cane or dark chocolate shaving on the marshmallow too.

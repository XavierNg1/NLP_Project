 If you have other wood items or surfaces, especially wooden bowls, you can clean these items with safe ingredients that are safe to digest.You make an effective and harmless wood cleaner with a lemon, olive oil, and water.
 Take one lemon and cut it in half, then strain the juice in a container. It’s best to strain the pulp and seeds out for your solution. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and water each.


You can stir your mixture together, but it’s best to mix your ingredients in a container with a lid and shake it up to diffuse the lemon juice and olive oil into the water.
You can also use distilled white vinegar if you don’t have a lemon.
If you’re mixing olive oil and vinegar, add one tablespoon of vinegar for every three tablespoons of olive oil., With a clean cotton cloth, dip it into your solution and ring the cloth out so it’s moist, not wet. Simply wipe down your surface with your homemade solution.


Test your solution on a small area first just to make sure it reacts well with your wood.
This homemade product is not only safe for you, but it won’t leave a film or streaks behind.

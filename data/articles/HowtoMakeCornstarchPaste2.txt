 This variation creates a stronger glue that can be used in craft projects in place of regular school glue. Mix 3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 2 tablespoon (29.6Â ml) corn syrup, and 1 tsp white vinegar into a saucepan. Place the pan over low heat. Stir the mixture it until it's blended together well, then remove it from heat.
 Pour an additional 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water into the saucepan. Slowly and continuously stir the mixture until everything is well combined. The mixture will begin to thicken into a glue-like substance after a few minutes of stirring. , The mixture will be very hot, so handle it with care. After bringing it to room temperature, spoon the mixture into a plastic or glass container for storage.


Don't pour the mixture into a container while it's still hot, as it could melt the storage container.
Do not allow a child to use the paste until it has completely cooled.

 To make an above-ground pit that you can take down again with little fuss, all you really need are some bricks or cinderblocks, and your grill. A steel sheet will be necessary if you are building it up fairly high above ground. This is a job that is very easy to quick to do, but you still need to take care with the construction and follow the safety precautions as you would with a more complex Barbecue pit.









As always, how many cinder blocks or bricks you need will depend on the size of the pit you want to construct.
 Once you have chosen a safe place to put it, you need to do a bit of work preparing the ground. The main job is to clear the space and make sure that the ground is level and flat. If it isn’t level you will end up with a wonky grill, which could end in disaster.
 Now lay out the bricks or cinderblocks according to the size you want and the plan you have drawn up. Be sure to measure everything carefully and check the stability of it all as you go. If it doesn’t seem stable you need to step back and have a rethink. This will most likely be because the ground isn’t sufficiently level for the blocks to sit easily on it.









You can build them up in a simple regular-sided shape, or try a circle. This might require you to cut the blocks, which will require more tools, like a chisel and hammer.
 If you building it up quite high, you don’t want the coals to be too far away from the grill. Think about how low you drop the grill down over the coals when you use a regular stand-alone Barbecue. A good way to take account of this is to add a steel shelf two bricks below where you will be putting the grill.
 Once you have installed the shelf build up two more layers on the same pattern you have been using. You can just lay the grill on top of your top layer, but you could add another layer of bricks around the edges to help keep it in place.

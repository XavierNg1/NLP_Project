 Tightening up on the stick or moving your arms rigidly when cradling will result in less efficient motion. Learning to keep your cradling technique smooth and intuitive will take practice. Fluid cradling will allow for you to focus on other aspects of the game during play instead of being overly focused on how you are handling the lacrosse stick.Try to keep your grip and muscles loose.
Always keep your stick moving when cradling the ball.
 The only way to get better at your cradling technique is to practice. Regular practice has been shown to build skill and allow that skill to stay fresh and strong. Try to practice cradling as often as you can to increase your skill quickly and effectively.Keep your stick handy so that you can easily practice in your free time.
Try to practice at least once a day to keep your skill fresh.
You can still practice the motions even if you don't have your stick nearby.
 Although it can be tempting to exclusively use your dominant hand and arm to cradle, making use of both hands can make you a more versatile and skilled lacrosse player. There may be times during a lacrosse game that using your non-dominant hand can even give you the advantage. During your practice sessions make sure to practice cradling with both hands.Chances are your off hand will require much more practice than your dominant hand.
Looking in the mirror and watching how you use your dominant hand can give you a good idea of how to move your non-dominant hand.

 Many people turn a shot glass, wine glass, or tumbler upside down over the Ouija board when they don't have a planchette. The glass magnifies the answer and bends the image, making the experience spookier.
 Another makeshift planchette that provides a window to look through is the lens on an old pair of sunglasses or glasses. It's best to use the cheap kind you can purchase at drugstores, not your friend's prescription spectacles or a fancy pair of designer glasses.
 Try using a lucky coin, or an old coin that has been touched by thousands of people. Of course, a coin will not point to an answer or give you a window to look through, but it can move on top of the letters or numbers on a Ouija board.


One superstition holds that a silver coin will prevent evil spirits from getting into your Ouija board.

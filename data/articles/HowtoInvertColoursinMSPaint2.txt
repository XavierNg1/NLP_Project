 You can do this by from inside or outside Paint.


Inside Paint: Open MS Paint by clicking the Desktop icon or locating it in Programs. Once Paint is open, click "File" and then "Open." Find and select the image that you want to invert. Then, press â†µ Enter or click "Open."Outside Paint: Find the file that you want to invert. Right-click on the file, and select "Open with" MS Paint. The file should open in MS Paint.
 This will immediately invert the colors. The colors in the inverted image are the scientific complements of the colors in the original. A yellow ball will appear blue (not purple, the traditional complement) in the inverted version.For a quick invert, simply press Ctrl+I. Remember: this only applies to Windows Vista and earlier!

, Click "File," and then "Save as..." Choose a memorable file name for it, and pick the file type as needed. Be sure to save it somewhere you can find it later. Then click "Save" to confirm.

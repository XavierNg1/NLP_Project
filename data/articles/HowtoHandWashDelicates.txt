 Colors like navy, red, purple and black should be sorted into the dark clothing category. Items that are white, cream, pink or other pastels belong in the light category of clothing. Sorting delicate items allows you to wash them together without fearing that they will fade or bleed on each other.;
, Hot water may shrink your garments or fade their color. Lukewarm or cool water will get the stains out without causing shrinkage or damage to your garments.
 Many detergents are specifically created to wash delicate items by hand. Use the amount of detergent as directed for the amount of clothes you intend to wash.
 Let your clothes soak for a few minutes, but do not go off and forget about them. Delicate items should not soak for longer than 20 minutes because they may shrink, fade or get damaged.
 There's no need to be rough with them and rub them against each other to remove stains. Embellishments or decorative trim may be harmed by doing that. Carefully swirl your delicate items in the soapy water to get them clean.
 Swirl them like you did when washing to rinse them and get the soap out. Swirl the items several times to rinse them thoroughly.
 Wringing your delicate items to remove extra water may damage them, cause embellishments or trim to fall off, or harm the fabric. Fold the delicate items into layers and press the layers against a dry edge of the basin to squeeze out the extra water.
 Getting delicate items wet may affect their shapes. Gently stretch them back out to the size and shape they normally are when dry.
 Spread out a clean, white towel and lay the items on the towel. When the top side is nearly dry, flip them so the bottom side can dry, too.

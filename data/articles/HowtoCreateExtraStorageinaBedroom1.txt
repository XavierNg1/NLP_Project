 Instead of just placing comfortable chairs or extra seating in your bedroom, choose pieces that also have storage space. For example, pick a chair that has an ottoman. These usually match the chair and you won't even be able to see that it's storage. You could also use a chest or trunk.Chests or trunks are great for long-term storage, since you can still place things on top of the trunk. For example, store winter clothes in the trunk and use the top of the trunk to display photos, books, or accessories.;
, Wardrobes or armoires are a beautiful way to add interesting furniture to your room. Most of them open up to include space for hanging clothes, shelving, and small drawers. You can find some with full-length mirrors.


You can get one with a large mirror on the front. This can reflect light and make your room appear larger.
 If you don't have a closet, you'll need an organized space to hold your clothes. Purchase a dresser that will hold all of the clothes you'll need for the season. If you need to, you could store unseasonable clothing in storage in another room.


Test the dresser drawers before you buy the dresser. Ensure that they open easily and close completely.
 Consider swapping out your bedside table for a nightstand that has storage. You can easily find nightstands that include storage compartments and small drawers. Many even have charging spaces for your technological devices.If you don't have enough space for a nightstand, install small storage cubes vertically, so you can make the most of the space.

 Visit some college websites to determine if the degree you are interested in may be obtained online.


If the program or parts of the program you want is not available online, you will need to enrolling in traditional face-to-face classes. In some cases, you may be able to do some of the work online but have a component where attendance is essential. Consider whether this can be worked into your budget and time availability.



Do any of the programs sound as if they could help you achieve your goals? If your dream is to become a botanist, for example, and there are no online degree programs related to the field of botany, you may want to skip the online degree and obtain yours in the traditional manner. However, if you have always wanted to work in the law and find several paralegal degree programs available in your area, online school may be the right choice for you.
Are most elements of the degree suitable but one or two key areas are missing? Investigate whether you'll get the qualifications you're after by pursuing the degree and taking a few extra shorter or tailored courses to fill in the gaps.

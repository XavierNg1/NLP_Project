 Make sure that your blender is clean, and that the lid fits tightly.
 You will need 1 teaspoon of instant coffee, Â¾ cup (177.441 milliliters) of milk, about six ice cubes, and 2 teaspoons of sugar.
 You can further enhance your blended instant coffee by adding in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract or 2 teaspoons of chocolate syrup. You can also add other flavorings, such as caramel sauce or even maple syrup.
 Put the lid on the blender and turn it on. Blend everything until the ice is completely crushed. You want to end up with a thick, smoothie-like consistency.


If the consistency is too thick, add a little bit more milk. If the consistency is too thin, add one ice cube.
 Turn the blender off and take the lid off. Slowly pour the blended coffee into a tall glass. You may have to use a spoon or spatula to get everything up.
 You can make your blended coffee extra fancy by adding some toppings to it, such as whipped cream, chocolate sauce, or shaved pieces of chocolate. Here are some ideas:


For a simple blended coffee, add a swirl of chocolate or caramel sauce on top.
For something fancier, squeeze a whorl of whipped cream on top of the blended coffee.
If you want something super fancy, top the blended coffee with some whipped cream. Then, add a drizzle of chocolate sauce on top. Lastly, sprinkle some bits of shaved chocolate on top of the cream.
 Stick a straw into the iced coffee and serve it immediately, before it melts.

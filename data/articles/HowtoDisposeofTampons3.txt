 It is easier to remove the tampon when you are seated on the toilet. Being seated will allow you to spread your legs apart and access the tampon. It will also help you angle your fingers so you can easily slide out the tampon.Sitting on the toilet will also ensure that any blood that drips out when you remove the tampon will go into the toilet. This will make for less mess, with no blood on your underwear or on the floor.
 Your tampon should have a white string that dangles off the end of the tampon. You should be able to look between your legs and find the string coming out of your vagina.If you do not see a string dangling out, it may have gotten stuck in your vagina throughout the day. Often, the string gets broken or tangled up when you exercise. You may need to use your fingers to probe around your vaginal opening for the string., Once you have located the string, you should grip it gently with two fingers. Then, carefully pull on the string to slide the tampon out of your vagina. It should slide out fairly easily with a gentle pull.If your tampon does not come out or appears to be stuck, you may need to seek medical attention. Sometimes tampons can get stuck if they are left in too long, if the string gets stuck in your vagina, or if you accidentally have sex while wearing a tampon. You should get the tampon removed as soon as possible by a doctor as leaving the tampon in can put you at a high risk of developing Toxic Shock Syndrome.

 For this method of fake blood, you'll need:


1/2 cup tropical fruit punch (or a cup of coffee if you'd like to experiment)
1 cup corn syrup
2 tablespoons red food coloring
1 tablespoon chocolate syrup
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon cocoa powder.
 Blend for 10 seconds.
 You may need to adjust a little, depending on the brand of fruit punch you've added. Try different amounts of punch, chocolate syrup or cocoa powder until it's just right for your needs.
 Decorate yourself (skin, unwanted old clothes, face, etc.). Or, since this is edible, you can add it to food that needs a tinge of fake blood for Halloween.

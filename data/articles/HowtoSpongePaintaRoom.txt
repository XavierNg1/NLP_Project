 If you don't want the door frames, windows, ceiling, or baseboards painted, make sure to cover their edges with masking or painter's tape. This might also be an excellent time to throw drop cloths over all the furniture and flooring.;
, Depending on what color you want the base coat to be, this step may already be done. However, if you hate the color of the walls, purchase some paint and rollers and apply one or two even coats of paint as needed before you begin sponging.


Try to decide ahead of time what color you want to sponge on top so that you'll end up with two colors that display well together.
Allow the paint to dry fully before moving on.
 A good ratio is four parts glaze to one part paint. However, you may want to experiment with these ratios until you find something you're happy with. More glaze means a more transparent sponge layer.
 Pour the glaze/paint mixture into shallow container, such as a paint rolling tray or even just a paper plate.
 You may want to practice on something disposable first (like a trash piece of cardboard) in order to find the optimum amount of paint to put on the sponge.


If you want a darker top layer, use more paint.
Wring the sponge out whenever it gets too saturated with paint.
 Don't let the sponge layer dry before this step. You'll want to use a second sponge, dampened, to lightly pat the areas you already covered and remove some of the paint. This way, you'll allow more of the base coat to show through. Remove as much of the paint as you want.


Feel free to pat more paint on with the first sponge if you mistakenly remove too much.

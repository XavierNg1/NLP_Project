 Make sure that the jeans are turned completely inside-out. Fold them loosely and set aside.









Turning your jeans inside-out will lessen the amount of fading that will occur. Your jeans should still shrink the same way without any problems, even if turned inside-out.
This step is especially necessary if shrinking new jeans with a fairly dark wash. If working with a pair of light wash jeans or an old pair of jeans that area already faded, you might be able to skip this step without causing much if any damage.
 Fill a large stockpot halfway to three-quarters full with standard tap water. Set it on the stove and bring it up to a full, rolling boil using high heat.









The water is at a full boil when large, rolling waves of bubbles violently break the surface of the water.
You need to make sure that you use enough water and a large enough stockpot so for the jeans to be completely submerged.
 Use tongs to place your jeans in the boiling water. Let them soak for 20 to 30 minutes as the water continues to boil.









Do not cover the stockpot as your jeans soak.
Check periodically to make sure that the fabric stays submerged in the water. If needed, push the jeans under from time to time using your tongs.
 Remove your jeans from the boiling water and transfer them to your dryer immediately. Use the hottest dryer setting possible and dry your jeans completely.









The intense heat of the dryer will further tighten the fibers already tightened by the hot, turbulent water.
Make sure that you use tongs as you hand the jeans since they will be very hot.
Do not air-dry the jeans.
Make sure that the jeans are completely dry when you remove them from the drying machine.

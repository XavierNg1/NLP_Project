 This should kill any bacteria that may contaminate the milk.;

If using a thermos ensure it is clean.
If using an esky, fill it with enough warm water to mostly cover your container. If it is not waterproof simply place a tub or large jug of warm water inside. The water should be quite warm to the touch but not so hot that you can't hold your hand submerged for ten seconds.
If using a warm spot you may want to place a sign or note there asking other members of the household not to move or open the container.
 This is to kill any bacteria already in the milk.
 Try not to get milk on the rim of your container as is may provide a pathway for unwanted bacteria.
, The warm, clean conditions should let the beneficial bacteria grow and ferment the milk.
 The fermented milk should be about the same colour as normal milk and be only slightly thicker, it should have a mild yogurt smell with a hint of tang and a smooth slightly tangy taste.
, Two to four teaspoons of sugar per cup is about normal.

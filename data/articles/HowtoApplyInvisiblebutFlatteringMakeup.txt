 Something that will not cake on your skin and leave it looking moist and almost dewy. Once you have found the brand, also buy the matching concealer in the same colour (or one shade lighter if you have dark circles). For this look, I recommend one of the many 'Recover' or 'Sleep effect' foundations now available.;
, Rub the foundation on to the palest piece of skin showing, like your inner elbow and back of your hand. Rub it in lightly and if it disappears, you've got your match.
 First wash your face and apply a rich moisturizer, not a light one, as you want to create a dewy radiance about you. Un-perfumed is best, as it will not sting your eyes when you sweat.
 Brush the hairs upwards with a toothbrush and hold in place with a dab of Vaseline or something similar.
 This shouldn't be too much foundation. Now, with your fingertips, blend it all together in a circular motion until you get even coverage.
 If any blemishes or dark circles show, now is the time to use that concealer. Apply it thinly to the offending areas and leave for 2 minutes to soak in, before using your fingertips to pat it into the skin. If some is still showing, don't worry at this stage.
 Use both patting and circular motions to apply the talc and finish off the blending.
 Pinks are more natural than reds. Form a large smile so that the apples of your cheeks swell, and in a circular motion once again, apply the blusher.
, Apply a thick bold dusting of eye-shadow onto your upper lids. Where the skin just below the upper lid creases, apply the same amount of shadow again. Blend it all together with your fingers.
 Sweep it across with a cotton bud right into the corners to create a subtle but eye opening line.
 As for the lower lashes, the best thing to do is to wipe the wand til it is almost dry, and dab the remaining mascara gently onto each bottom lash using the wand tip. This looks less obvious.

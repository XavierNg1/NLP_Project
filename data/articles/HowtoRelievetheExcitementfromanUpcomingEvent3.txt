 Tell them about the event if it does not apply to them, and chat a bit about it. Chances are, you will become absorbed in the conversation and forget the impatience for the event itself. Talking time, however, could probably stay around a half hour, tops.
 Go to the movie theater and have fun! Munch on popcorn, and watch the little guppy outsmart the shark.
 Choose a friend or two and plan out your day. Stop at the Halloween shop to look for and mumble over some neat d√©cor. Visit the grand opening of a new amusement park. Study for a test, or go to the library.


Try to do things unrelated to the event.

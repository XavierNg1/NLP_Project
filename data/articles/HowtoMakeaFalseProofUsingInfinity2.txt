 The final equation will be in the format a = b. In this step you are choosing what "a" will be. It can be anything. Examples of possible choices:


5 = b
1 + 1 = b
7 x 4 = b
2 ^ 3 = b
7 - 7 + 1 = b.
 In this step you are choosing what "b" will be. It can be anything just like "a" can be.
 If you chose 12 to be "a", then you would say "What is ∞ + 12". No matter what "a" is, the answer will always be ∞ + a = ∞.
 This will work the same as it did in step 3. ∞ + b = ∞

, Make sure not to actually write down the letters "a" and "b". these are just markers of where you should put the numbers you chose in steps 1 and 2.
 Since ∞ + a = ∞ and ∞ + b = ∞, you know that ∞ + a = ∞ + b. Make sure your friend understands clearly what you are doing in this step.
 The formal name for this operation is called the subtractive property of equality. What you are left with is a = b.
 He or she will want to look at it more closely and try to figure out what the flaw is. He or she will probably fail. You might feel inclined to laugh at your friend's bewilderment or make fun of him or her a little. This would be a good time to do so. The catch is that when you subtracted ∞ from both sides, your friend assumed that ∞ - ∞ = 0. Because ∞ is not a real number, it follows its own set of rules. Almost nobody knows this. ∞ - ∞ is indeterminate because some infinities are actually bigger than other infinities.

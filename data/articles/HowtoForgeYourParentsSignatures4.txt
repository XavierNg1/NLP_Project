 A pantograph is a crude copying device used to create duplicate documents or signatures. Thomas Jefferson used a version of the pantograph, called a polygraph, to create a second copy of every letter he wrote. Similar machines/devices are variously called auto-pens or writing machines, and produce an identical signature when perfectly traced over an authentic signature.You can buy a pantograph online, or build your own by connecting two pens by a straight piece of wood or plastic, though a purchased pantograph will probably be more accurate.
 The beauty of a pantograph is that it will create a perfect replica of any signature you create. For the purposes of forging a parent's signature, however, you can also trace over an existing signature to create an identical duplicate.


You may want to take the ink cartridge out of the tracing pen so that it does not draw over your parent's existing signature, or use a signature that is not important and can be discarded (like a credit card receipt from an insignificant purchase).
Try tracing the signature onto a blank scrap of paper before you attempt to "sign" the actual document. This will ensure that you get the signature's motion and fluidity down correctly.
 If you borrowed a check, receipt, or document to trace your parent's signature, it's important that you return it where you found it. Be sure that your tracing does not invalidate any important documents, and use caution to cover your tracks.

 Make sure you create a new folder in Programs on C drive and rename it Movie Maker 2.1. This is because the program file for Movie Maker 6 is also called Movie Maker,which is the same name as the Movie Maker 2.1 program file. So if you do not create a new folder and rename the Movie Maker 2.1 file,there will be two program files with the same name. And Windows will replace the older file(the Windows Movie Maker 6 file)with the new Windows Movie Maker 2.1 file that you have just installed.Leaving you without Windows Movie Maker 6. But if you already have Windows Movie Maker 2.6 installed,you do not need to rename the 2.6 program file. Because the 2.6 file is called Movie Maker 2.6 not Movie Maker.;
, This is because Windows Movie Maker 2.1 uses some of the dill and program files of 2.6 in order to run.In fact the two versions are very similar to one another. And if 2.6 is not installed, Movie Maker 2.1 will not work properly.
 And they all run side by side. But you cannot have more than one version open at the same time. For example. if you are using Movie Maker 6, and then you want to switch to Movie Maker 2.1.You must close Windows movie Maker 6 first,before you open 2.1.
 That is, the two are different. But you can run Windows Live Movie Maker alongside all of the other versions of Windows Movie Maker if you want to.
 It is also possible to run Windows Movie Maker 1.1 in both Windows 7 and Windows Vista.Which is an earlier version of Windows Movie Maker for Windows ME. Windows Movie Maker 1.1 can run alongside the other versions of Movie Maker but the functions are limited.
 Just like it does on Windows XP.

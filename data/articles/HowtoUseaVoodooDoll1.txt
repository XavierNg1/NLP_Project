 When making a voodoo doll, picture the person you you would like the magic to affect and how you would like it to affect them. Because voodoo largely depends upon the connection between you and the voodoo spirits, it's important that the doll you are holding symbolizes the person who will gain good or evil in their life.;
, One of the ways to create a replica of a person through a voodoo doll is by printing out a full size picture of the person and sewing it together with fabric.Once you have found a picture or printed one out, cut around the body frame of the person in the picture and then use fabric for the back. As you begin sewing the fabric and picture together, fill the doll with stuffing.
 Maybe you don't have a picture of the person you want to represent or you'd rather make a voodoo doll from something associated with that person. A lock of hair or piece of clothing will serve this purpose. Find some yarn, string, or fabric and sew or piece together a simple doll. Then, sew the object you have to represent the person to the doll you have created.
 Before you plan to use your voodoo doll you will need to clear it of all previous energy, thus neutralizing it and giving you a clean slate to perform actions on it. To do this, place your hand over the object and direct your energy through it, focusing on making it new and pure. You can also wash your doll in salt water, cover it with purifying incense such as sage or sandalwood, allow natural light such as sunlight or moonlight to cleanse it, or bury it in the Earth and allow the universe and Mother Nature to transform the energy.


There will likely be previous energy attached to any object you use in making your voodoo doll, so always remember to clear that object so that the energies don't become confused and muddled.
To make the clearing process easier, use objects and supplies that have had little contact with others, unless you are specifically using that object to represent someone.

Organize a neighborhood pickup game. Challenge your family to a match. If you’re on a league team, set up a match with a local rival.
 Go to any one of the many horse races, soccer matches, and cricket matches scheduled on Boxing Day.Don’t worry about traveling; most teams make sure to play another that’s nearby so neither the players nor their fans have to go too far from home., Participate in one of many icy swims organized on Boxing Day. Wear something absurdly fancy, take a plunge into the winter sea, and win a medal for bravery while warming back up in front of a beach bonfire with all the other daring souls.Many of these events raise money for charity, so consider it a good deed done!

 Locate the app on your device and tap on it. The app icon has the HP logo on it with a colorful border.
 Tap the printer icon from the bottom menu bar, and you will be brought to the “Add a Printer” screen. The options for adding a printer will be shown, with the last one being “QR”; tap on it.
 The app will use your iPad’s or iPhone’s camera for scanning the QR code. A black box will appear. Point your device on the printer’s QR code. Properly place it inside the box given, and the app will read the code and detect your printer.


The location of the QR code will differ on printers. It is a sticker placed on different places depending on the printer.
 A couple of buttons will appear after the app detects your printer. Tap the “Add Printer” button, and the printer will be added to SureSupply.


If the printer is turned on and is on the same Wi-Fi network as you iPad or iPhone, the app will immediately find it. The newly added printer will then be displayed on the screen, with all its ink levels properly stacked by color. You can immediately see which inks are running low.

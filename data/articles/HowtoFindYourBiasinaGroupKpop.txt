 It is suggested that you try this with a group you already know and love because it's better to get to know who's who, how their voices sound, etc. (however, you can still try these steps with an unfamiliar group).;
, Watch variety shows the most because they seem to show the members personalities the best.
 After you have watched videos about the group, you will probably have a member that you like slightly more than the others.


Sometimes finding out whose voice you like best can help in deciding who is your bias.
If you want, you can watch videos about each member alone so that you can be sure who your bias is.
 Research them. Know their full names (because some Kpop idols change their names), birthdays, etc.
 You can have more than one bias, just try to spread them out across different Kpop groups.


Even though it may be frustrating when it comes to picking your ultimate bias (favorite idol out of all idols in all groups), it's totally okay to have more than one bias in a group. You could have a bias for all sorts of things. Take EXO for example: your singing bias could be Chen, your aegyo bias could be Xiumin, your Voice bias could be D.O, your stylish bias could be Chanyeol...

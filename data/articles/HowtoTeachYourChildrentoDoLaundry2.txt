 Let kids move wet clothing themselves. This is a step that any child can do. Since young children can participate, you can make laundry fun to do together as a family. It can even be a good idea to start children on dryer duty before teaching them the more complicated wash cycle., Pull up the lint catcher. Remember that a clean lint catcher helps the dryer work better. You may explain this to kids. Don’t forget to tell them to clean off the lint and replace the catcher before each cycle. Remind them to do this until they remember it for themselves., If you use dryer sheets, have them throw one in before the cycle begins. Young children can do this too. Fabric softener may be used instead, but this can be a bit challenging for younger kids to handle on their own.

Dryer sheets and fabric softener soften clothes, add a pleasant scent, and reduce static. Using them is not mandatory, however.
 Start off with a normal drying cycle. Explain to children what the buttons do and which ones they need to press. Work your way up to more uncommon options like permanent press or low heat cycles. Don’t give them too much information at once.Like with the washing machine, label the dryer buttons with permanent black marker or stickers. It may prevent you from a costly repair bill for a broken knob.
 Read the drying labels together. Show the child how to squeeze out excess water without wringing. Delicate clothing does best when rolled up in a towel and gently squeezed. Otherwise, hang up clothing you wish to air dry.An accordion-style folding rack is a great tool for younger children who aren’t tall enough to reach a clothesline.

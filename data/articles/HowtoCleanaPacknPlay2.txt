 Take the mattress out of the Pack 'n Play, and fold up the frame. The whole Pack 'n Play and mattress will fit in most bathtubs. If yours doesn't fit all at once, you may need to do it in parts. Begin filling up the tub with warm to hot water.You can use the frame to hold the mattress down in the water.
 As the tub is filling up, pour in a mixture of detergent, vinegar, and baking soda. You'll need about 1/2 a cup (120 milliliters) of laundry detergent, 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda, and 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of vinegar. If you're using powdered detergent, you may want to mix it with water before adding it to the tub., Once the you've added the soap and filled up the tub so the Pack 'n Play is submerged, leave it to soak for at least an hour. If it's not completely submerged, flip it after half an hour, and leave it for another thirty minutes., You can rinse it in the tub if you have a removable shower head. If not, you'll need to take it outside to rinse it down with a hose. Try to rinse out all the soap and grime.If your Pack 'n Play was especially dirty, you might want to start over again with soaking it in soapy water.
 Set up the Pack 'n Play outside on a sunny day, preferably a warm day. Lay out the mattress so it gets air flow around it. You may need to prop it up and then turn it over partway through the drying process. Let the sun completely dry your Pack 'n Play before putting it back in use.

If you are cleaning a ring, bracelet or earring that has a smooth surface, just pop it in the container of ketchup to soak for a bit.






If the silver item has a more detailed surface, then use an old toothbrush to work the ketchup into the crevices.;
, With a bowl of water, rinse the ketchup off the jewellery and dry thoroughly to reveal your lovely clean silver, all thanks to the natural acid found in the tomatoes!

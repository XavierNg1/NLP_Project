 Is it a good friend or your sibling who probably would know it was you? Figure out a good reason to call them. Were they going to do something today? Did they recently do something they wouldn't want anyone to know about? Do you want to freak them out with a call from their crush or ex-boyfriend? Or do you just want to bother them?;
, If they recently had a party when their parents weren't home, call their mom pretending to be someone who was at their party and wanted to tell them how great it was. People usually ask who is calling if they don't recognize the number, so.
 If you are calling someone claiming to be a telemarketer, then you won't need a name. Just say "I'm with _ company and I would like to interest you in _ product" every time they ask for your information.
 If you are a girl, you probably shouldn't go for a deep voice unless you're sick. But if you're a boy, doing a high voice never works. if you want to sound like a moron, say "what chu talkin' bout?" every time they ask you about who you are. But if you want to sound like a parent or cop or principle or someone in power, then don't sound like a wimp, sound like you know exactly what you're talking about.
 Try not to chicken out. But if you do, hang up and use a different phone with another number.
 Say "Oops! (your name) is back, gotta go!" and hang up.

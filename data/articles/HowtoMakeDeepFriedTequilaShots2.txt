 Since tequila is often associated with tart slices of lime, the fruit makes a logical garnish for this dessert dish as well. Try placing lime slices around the rim of your serving bowl for a festive presentation. Alternatively, squeeze half of a fresh lime over your shots when they're done to give them a sour kick.
 Another great idea for presentation is to recreate the traditional garnishes used for margarita glasses. Try wetting the rims of glasses, dipping them in margarita salt, and putting a few of your deep fried shots inside each glass. Optionally, include a lime slice or a paper umbrella to complete the look.
 These deep fried treats go well with many sweet dipping sauces. To make your own lime-flavored sauce, try combining about a cup of your preferred vanilla frosting (homemade or storebought) with the juice from half a lime (a little less than 1/4 cup). Green food coloring can be great for presentation purposes but isn't required.


Optionally, add the zest of the lime you juice for additional flavor and aroma. See our article on zesting limes for more information.

This key lime frosting recipe makes a great dipping sauce as well.
 To add tropical flavors to your deep fried shots, just mix the tequila with your preferred fruit juices and soak the cake bites as normal. When they're done, your tequila treats will have the flavor of whatever juice you used. Orange, pineapple, lemon, lime, and mango juices all make great choices.

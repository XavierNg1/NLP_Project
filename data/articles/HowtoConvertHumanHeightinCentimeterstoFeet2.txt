 Centimeters are used broadly in Europe, Canada, Asia, and most other countries using the metric system. Though Americans almost always measure height in feet, centimeters are much more common. For an example, say you are 180cm tall.It is almost always easier to convert to inches, then convert to feet later. However, you can directly convert to feet if you have a calculator, which may be more accurate, too.

To check your work, know now that 180cm is roughly 5'10 in feet.
 There are roughly .39 inches in every centimeter. If you are calculating by hand and need an easier approximation, you could even multiply by .4, though you will not be as accurate. Note that this answer to this equation is always smaller than the original number of centimeters.


180cm∗.39incm=70.2inches{\displaystyle 180cm*.39{\frac {in}{cm}}=70.2inches}

The fraction above stands for "inches per centimeter."


, There are twelve inches in each foot, and the example has 70.2 total inches. If your divide 70.2 by 12, you get 5.85ft, but be careful -- the decimal is not the number of inches. Since 12∗5=60{\displaystyle 12*5=60}, and 12∗6=72,{\displaystyle 12*6=72,} you know that the height must be above 5ft but below 6ft. So, if you have 5 full feet in 70.2", than 60 of your inches are accounted for. You just have to deal with the last 10.2".


180cm=70.2in{\displaystyle 180cm=70.2in}


70.2in12={\displaystyle {\frac {70.2in}{12}}=} 5' + 10.2


, Once you know how many "perfect feet" fit into these inches, just add in the leftover to get your final answer!


180cm=70.2in{\displaystyle 180cm=70.2in}


70.2in12={\displaystyle {\frac {70.2in}{12}}=} 5' + 10.2"


180cm = 5'10.2


, If you need super accurate conversions, you must use a more accurate decimal for your conversion from centimeters to inches. To see it in action, note how the example above subtly changes.


180cm∗.393701incm=70.86inches{\displaystyle 180cm*.393701{\frac {in}{cm}}=70.86inches}


70.86in12={\displaystyle {\frac {70.86in}{12}}=} 5' + 10.86"


180cm = 5'10.9

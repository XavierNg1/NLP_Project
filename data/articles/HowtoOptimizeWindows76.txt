 Windows uses a variety of special effects to make transitions between windows smooth, as well as to add transparency and other visual flair. While this makes Windows look great, it can also have a major impact on your system's performance, especially if it is older. Disabling these effects can really help speed up your system.
,,, All of Windows' effects will be listed in the "Custom" list. Uncheck anything that you don't want to use anymore.


Unchecking "Enable transparent glass" will give you one of the biggest performance increases.
If you don't care about visual effects at all, select "Adjust for best performance" to turn everything off.
 Windows will take a few moments to make the changes, and then you can see what your new settings look like.

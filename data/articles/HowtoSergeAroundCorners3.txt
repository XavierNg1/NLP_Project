 To move the fabric in a curving fashion, you will need to release the pressure on your fabric. By lifting up the presser foot and using your fingers to guide the fabric along, you will be able to serge around the outside curve.You may want to just lift the presser foot for the sharpest portion of the curve and then lower the foot back down when you get past this part.
Watch your fingers when you have the presser foot up! Keep them well away from the needle.
 If the curve is on the inside of your material, then straightening out the fabric may be your best option. Tug on both sides of the fabric to straighten it out and then serge in a straight line down the edge., No matter what kind of curve you are serging, going slow will probably improve your results. Take your time and stop the machine if anything starts to bunch up.

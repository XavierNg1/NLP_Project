 10 minutes of warming up, on either treadmill or bicycle.;
,, Do 3 sets of 8-10 reps (3x8-10). For legs. Excellent exercise. Video link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVujjfzphI


When squatting, focus on keeping the weight on your midfoot to heel. Keep your knees out and to the side, imagine pushing the ground away from you to your sides.
A lot of people make the mistake of half squatting. Half squatting is ineffective compared to the full squat. A squat is considered a full squat when the crease of your hip travels below your knee.
Start with no weight on the bar, to work on your technique.
 Simple exercise, but great for overall upper-body strength. Do 4x10 with variations, wide grip (elbows pointing out) and tricep pushup (arms in and elbows pointing towards your feet). Do them on your knees if you aren't strong enough yet.


Think about form and technique. It's easy to cheat on pushups.
If your gym has pushup handles, use them.
 A strong core is every athletes base of support. All the power you will generate stems from here. Situps are great, do 4x10. Do some planks for 10 sec, then 30, 45, and last 60 seconds:http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/abdominalcorestrength1/qt/plank.htm. If your gym has an ab- rolling wheel, use it, one of my own personal favourites and it blasts your core!

, For shoulders. Shoulders are key to running fast. They create a motion that adds to the forward momentum. Do 4x8. Remember to keep a slight bend in your elbows, to reduce the risk of elbow tendinitis.

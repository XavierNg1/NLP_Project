The best time for planting bulbs is in the early fall. You want to ensure that the bulbs have 2 to 3 months to root before the ground freezes or gets cold.



Before planting the bulbs, prepare the flower beds. Make holes in the ground as per the instructions on the bulb package. Follow their guidelines on how close to put the bulbs and how deep to plant them.



Place the bulbs, 1 in each hole, flat root end down. The pointed tip of the bulb should be facing upward. Cover the bulbs with soil and press it down with your hand. Never walk on the soil as it will compress the soil too much. Then water your bulbs. You need to water the bulbs so that the moisture reaches the bottom of the bulb. This is imperative if you want the bulbs to root and bloom in the spring.

 It doesnâ€™t matter which city you go to.
 The messenger should tell you that he has a letter for you. This will be the letter that will inform you of lands that are available to purchase.


These lands include Windstad Manor in Hjaalmarch, Lakeview Manor in Falkreath Hold and Heljarchen Hall in The Pale.
 Choose any of these three cities; all three will have their respective Jarl and quest that you must fulfill.
 Once inside, talk to Jarl and you'll be given a task.


In Skyrim, you're unable to purchase a house/land unless the Jarl recognizes you.
 Once you've finished it, the Jarl will name you his/her thane. You now have the rights to buy a piece of land under that Jarl's jurisdiction.
 The Jarl will confirm the auction of the land. The Jarl will then tell you to speak to his/her aide.
 You will now be able to purchase a lot.


Each lot costs 5,000 septims (gold) and will require you to travel to its set location.

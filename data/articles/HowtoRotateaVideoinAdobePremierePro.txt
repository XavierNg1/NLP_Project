To invert a video that's upside-down, type "180."
To rotate a video between portrait and landscape, type "90" for a clockwise rotation or "270" for a counterclockwise rotation.

Performing this type of rotation will cause some of the image to disappear and black bars to appear on the clip. To fix this, adjust the aspect ratio:
Click on Sequence in the menu bar, then click on Sequence Settings near the top of the menu.
Swap the numbers that appear in the "Frame Size:" part of the "Video" section of the dialog box. For example, if frame size reads "1080 horizontal" and "1920 vertical," edit the settings to read "1920 horizontal" and "1080 vertical."
Click on OK, then click on OK, again.


Your video is rotated and can be edited or spliced with other videos.

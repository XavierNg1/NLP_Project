 Over-the-counter pain medications can help you deal with the pain; however, it's very important to ask your doctor before starting one, as they can interfere with your treatment. You may be able to take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin, for instance,but NSAIDs like ibuprofen do interfere with some cancer treatments.Chronic use of NSAIDS can also lead to gastric ulcers.;
, When it comes to pain management, it's best to take only what you need to manage the pain. Therefore, try starting with a weaker opioid, such as codeine in combination with acetaminophen, to help you manage your pain from multiple myeloma.Talk to your doctor for a prescription. Most doctors are more than willing to prescribe pain medications for cancer patients.
 If the opioid you are on isn't strong enough for you, you may need to try a stronger type of opioid. Alternatively, you may just need to try a different kind of opioid, as not everyone responds to the same painkillers. Some stronger opioids your doctor might put you on include methadone, oxycodone, morphine, or oxymorphone., In some cases, antiseizure medications can help with your pain. Usually, these medications are most helpful if your pain is mainly the result of nerve damage. Ask your doctor if this type of medication is an option for you., Another option that can be helpful for pain from nerve damage is an antidepressant. In some people, taking an antidepressant decreases the chances of a pain signal reaching the brain, decreasing your pain overall.

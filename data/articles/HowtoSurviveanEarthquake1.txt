 Avoid stopping near, or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. They can fall onto your vehicle.,


Stay calm, metal will protect you and your family from most debris and falling objects.
The only exception to this is when you are in a garage or multi-level parking lot. When you are in a garage, get out of the car immediately, and crouch down next to the car. The metal will not protect you from the concrete that will fall on it. If you are in a multi-level parking garage, survival mainly comes down to luck. The best way to maximize your chances of survival is to do what you do in a garage - crouch next to the car.
Do not try to rush back to your home. Most major earthquakes have aftershocks, which should not be underestimated.

Aftershocks have the power to bring down buildings that were damaged in the main quake.
Aftershocks can range from very slight, to the power of the original earthquake itself. These secondary quakes can last for about ten seconds or longer and can be life-threatening. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing when they will happen, so there is no choice but to stay alert.
 Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.
 You shouldn't have to wait in your car for very long for relief efforts to arrive with food, water, and supplies.

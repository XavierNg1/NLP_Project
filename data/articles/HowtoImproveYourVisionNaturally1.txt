 Draw a letter, number or dot on the side of the pencil. For this exercise, you'll focus on the pencil and the dot as you move it toward and away from your eyes. Pencil push-ups are reputed to correct double vision and crossed eyes, but it can't hurt to try them for other issues — it's free, painless, and only involves focusing and refocusing your eyes.;
, Keep the pencil vertical, so that the eraser is pointing toward either the ceiling or the floor. If you're having someone else help you with the exercise and hold the pencil for you, hold out your arm to determine how far away it should be.
 Don't proceed to the next step until you feel like your eyes are solidly focused.
 Try to move it in a straight line, toward your nose.


As the pencil comes closer, your eyes will have to adjust to maintain the same level of focus.
 As soon as the pencil doubles, stop moving it closer to your face.
 Without moving your head or the pencil, shift your focus away from the pencil for a moment. Focus on something else in your visual field, and don't worry about looking at the pencil at all for at least 5 seconds. If you're having a hard time, close your eyes for a moment.
 Once your eyes are refreshed, try to focus on the pencil so that you aren't seeing double.


If you're still seeing two pencils, rest your eyes for a few more seconds and try again. Don't get discouraged if you still see two pencils after your second try — you'll get better! Just move on to the next step.
 Keep your focus on the mark you drew on the pencil as it moves back. Keep going until it's at arm's length again.
 Pencil push-ups work best when you do them repeatedly, as part of a daily routine. Set aside five minutes a day at first, then try ramping up to 10.


If you struggle to keep track of the time or stay entertained, try listening to music while you practice. For instance, two songs equal roughly five minutes, and three songs are roughly 10.

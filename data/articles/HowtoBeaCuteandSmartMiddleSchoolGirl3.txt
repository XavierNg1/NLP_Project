 Follow along in class! If you struggle with remembering things, take notes on flash cards, index cards, or in your notebook. This will help later on when you have homework and projects. If you have to remember terms and equations, write them down!

, If studying isn't helping you, ask for help from your teacher, an intelligent classmate, or get a tutor. Being behind in classes can send a lot of insults and names your way, which, in large amounts, can be hard to shrug off.
 Have to color? Make it vibrant and unique. Got a project? Put in lots or colors and add little features. A book report? Cut out and paste newspaper letters for the title and vocabulary words.
 Fill in your notes with bright pens and highlighters. Have designed or colored notebooks and binders. Write with eccentric pens and pencils. Also, color code by the subject/class (this includes book covers!)

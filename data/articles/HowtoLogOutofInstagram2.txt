 You can log out of the app from within the app's settings.


If, after you tap the Instagram icon, you are prompted to input your username and password, you are already logged out and don't need to take any further action.
 This icon should look like a small ID card or the silhouette of a person.


If you launch Instagram and you're taken directly into camera mode, this means you were using the camera just before you exited out of Instagram last time. You won't be able to see the profile icon in camera mode, so tap the "X" in the top left or use your device's "back" button to exit.
 This can be found in the upper-right corner of the Profile screen. You'll see your various Instagram options.
 You will be asked if you are sure that you want to log out. Confirm your choice to complete the process.


After you log out, you will be brought to the Instagram login screen. If you want to use Instagram again, you'll need to provide the username/email and password you registered with your account.

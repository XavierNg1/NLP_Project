 Take time to reflect, absorb the criticism, and to get away from the tense situation. It’s important to note the criticism is likely about actions rather than you as a person.Leave the room. Remove yourself from the critic’s presence and close the door behind you.
Take a brief walk. Give yourself an extra few minutes to really think about what was said.
Disengage from the critic by avoiding them. Avoid their attention and maybe the criticism will cease.;
, Laughter is virtually a 100% positive endeavor that interrupts your brain from negative feelings.Taking the criticism too harshly could very well be a misunderstanding of intent or degree, and it could affect you psychologically. Find the humor in the critic’s demeanor or unfounded criticism, and you’ll feel better about the situation.



Make yourself laugh by thinking about how the criticism relates to a difficult or embarrassing time for you.
Reflect on the encounter with the critic in a different outfit, hair-style, or other modification that makes them look goofy.
Be introspective and realize you may have just been completely misguided, and the criticism may be warranted for a legitimately boneheaded mistake.

If the criticism is from someone you do not respect, it is much easier to dismiss. Irrational criticism is part and parcel of our lives. We can't live like normal humans without criticizing others and receiving criticism. When too much emotion gets involved, we often go beyond what can be a civilized way of criticizing.
Criticism containing lies or blame incorrectly attributed to you is destructive and not worth accepting. Dismiss the criticism and inform the critic of the mistake.

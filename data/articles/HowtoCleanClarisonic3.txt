 Add 2 parts baking soda to 1 part hydrogen peroxide in a small dish. Stir the two together well until a paste with a yogurt-like consistency forms.If the mixture is too dry, mix in more hydrogen peroxide.
If the mixture is too liquidy, stir in more baking soda.
 After the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide mixture has reached the right consistency, cut two to three slices off of a lemon. Squeeze the juice from the slices into the mixture, and stir well to combine.It is normally for the mixture to fizz when you add the lemon juice.
 With the brush head attached to the Clarisonic handle, turn on the device. Allow the head to spin in the baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and lemon juice mixture for 30 seconds to 1 minute so the bristles are thoroughly coated.If you prefer not to run the Clarisonic as you clean the bristles, you can remove the brush head from the handle and dip it in the mixture. Swish it around the mixture for 30 seconds, and then rub it against your palm to work the cleanser into the bristles.
 After you’ve allowed the brush head to spin in the cleanser for about a minute, take it out of the mixture. Run it against a clean towel for another minute or two to allow all of the dirt and residue to come loose.The dirt from the brush head may stain your towel so be sure to use an old one that you don’t mind getting dirty.
 With the brush head still running on the Clarisonic, turn the warm water on at your sink. Run the brush under it under all of the dirt and cleanser residue is removed., If your Clarisonic brush head is particularly dirty, you may need to repeat the entire cleansing process more than once. When you’re satisfied that it’s completely clean, allow it sit out on your counter with the brush cap in place to dry completely.You can use the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide mixture to clean your brush head weekly, or you can save it for times when the bristles are looking particularly dirty.

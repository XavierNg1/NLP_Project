, To create the cups, you'll need to use the convex mounds of the base for molding. You need a muffin pan for large muffins.
 Cover and crimp the foil as you're laying it, so that it molds around the mound of each muffin space.
 The secret to making sure that this works effectively is to weave the bacon slices into place––don't simply slap the bacon slices on. To weave into place:


Make a plus sign, "+", or cross over the top of the first mound.
Wrap the sides once, and at the same time, weave the top portion in and out.
Lay the next slice on one side of the top slice.
Repeat the side weaving with another bacon slice with the new top piece.
Lay another slice on the other side on the top. This will then give you a fully-covered bottom cup.
Repeat the side weaving with another bacon slice, using the third top piece.
 You will need to monitor the bacon since the timings will differ on how crispy you want the cups to be.
 If the bacon sticks to the foil, carefully set the bottom of the bacon pieces in a large pan and move them around so that they loosen up. Wait until they are cooled down before removing them from the foil.Using the grease from the bacon during the pan cooking process makes it easier to separate it from the foil, rather than pre-greasing the pans prior to cooking. If you spray the pans beforehand, the cups may not hold their shape during the cooking process, thus risking more of a chance of the bacon moving around and shrinking.
 One idea is to make easy BLT filling for the cups.

 Sty is typically seen as a red swollen spot on or near the eyelid, often filled with pus. Sty occurs when the oil glands present in the eyelid become infected, most often by staphylococcus. There are two types of sty: hordeolum, which infects the either the sweat glands or sebaceous glands in the eyelid, and chalazion, which specifically infects the meibomian sebaceous gland in the eyelid.The infection will typically clear up on its own, but can be quite painful in the meantime., The most common symptoms typically include:


A small, red swelling on or near the eyelid that may resemble a pimple.
Pain and irritation on or around the eyelid.
Excessive tear production., Anyone can develop an eye infection like sty, but there are certain activities that increase the likelihood of an infection.Anyone who touches his eyes and face without washing his hands first may become infected with sty.
Anyone wearing contacts that have not been disinfected prior to use may be at risk of developing sty.
Anyone who wears eye makeup on overnight without washing or wiping it off before bed may be at risk of developing sty.
Some patients with preexisting conditions like rosacea, a skin condition, or blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelid may have a higher risk of developing sty., Do not try to pop the sty. This may cause the infection to worsen, and could allow it to spread., The best way to treat sty is to address the symptoms while you wait for the infection to heal.


Wash the infection gently. Do not scrub or excessively rub the sty.
Use a warm washcloth compress. Re-wet as needed for five to ten minutes.
Do not wear contact lenses or eye makeup until the infection has cleared up., Increasing your daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids may relieve some of the symptoms of a sty infection by increasing sebaceous gland production.

 While you've probably done a good job in asking her about her interests and learned a lot about her, don't shy away from sharing information about yourself. The more she learns about you, the more she's going to find she has in common with you. People tend to gravitate toward people they relate to and share interests with.


Share your own favorite hobbies, music and movies, but also share the more in-depth subject matter as well. If you're passionate about a particular topic, talk about it! Chances are you're going to be very charismatic and truthful in what you say. After all, you're passionate about it!

, A great way to garner and maintain interest is to have more one-on-one situations. Develop as many chances as possible to get the girl alone to learn all you can about one another. Human beings are pretty complex creatures, a simple interaction and conversation isn't going to be enough. Have as many as you possibly can.


Where the date is isn't as important as what you're doing during the date. Make sure it's somewhere you both will be able to enjoy yourself and have plenty of opportunities to interact with one another. A concert may sound like a great date idea, but the focus will be on the music and band rather than each other.
 Never try to be anything more than you already are. While there may be certain parts of yourself that you don't like, that doesn't mean you should pretend to be something completely different. Be yourself - you have plenty to offer anyone and everyone who comes in contact with you, whether you realize it or not. Just because you're interested in this girl doesn't mean you should change.

, Brooms can be a hindrance however, so feel free to not use brooms.
 Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch.
 Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers.
 Each score is worth 10 points.






Beaters try to peg players with their bludger. If a player is pegged they have to stop what they're doing and pay a penalty; i.e. (drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds.






Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers' attempts at scoring. If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers.






Seekers try to tackle the snitch (a person) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag. You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch. A common way to play is to make the snitch a person, and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries. Then the seekers search for the snitch, and attempt to tag the player. Other methods, such as the method adopted in 2005, makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock, hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner. Regardless of method, the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team, unlike the books, in which the snitch is worth 150 points. The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch.






The snitch, generally a track runner, runs around (usually the boundaries) trying to evade the seekers.






The referee should ensure that rules are being followed. They also keep track of the score.
 The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch.

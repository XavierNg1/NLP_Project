 It lets you make tighter turns without slowing downs and makes you faster when turning. It even lets you have a nice speed boost after drifting., This varies based on what controller or what game you are playing, but it is usually the B button for most games. Press and hold the button when at a turning point in the track to start boosting., The blue or orange stuff you see from the drifting is the friction produced from the speed of turning tightly on the track. The longer you drift, the longer you will turn and boost afterwards., To turn a large turn or to even boost through what seems to be a straight path but is actually part of a turn, simply steer the kart in the opposite direction you are drifting; and vice versa to make sharper turns than before. When you drift long enough, the blue friction sparks will turn to orange!, Make sure you let go only when (if possible) when the kart has orange sparks behind it and try to cover a large portion of the track when drifting. You can also and should drift when on a ramp, taking a shortcut, or going over a boost.

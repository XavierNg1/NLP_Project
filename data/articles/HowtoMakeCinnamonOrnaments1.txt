 If you don't want to bake your ornaments, you can air dry them instead. This will take a few hours, however; baking will only take 2 hours and 30 minutes.
 Try to use smooth applesauce instead of the chunky kind. Keep stirring until it forms a ball of stiff dough.


If your applesauce has large chunks in it, pulse it in a blender first, or your ornaments will be lumpy.
To make the ornaments last longer, add 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of white craft/school glue into the mixture., Take one fourth of the dough, and roll it out on a sheet of wax paper. To prevent sticking, dust it with extra cinnamon.


You can also roll it out between two sheets of plastic wrap instead.Working with smaller batches of dough is much easier than working with one big batch.
 You can make them any shape you wish, but stars, gingerbread men, and trees are the most popular.After you have finished cutting the first batch of cookies, you can roll out another batch of dough, and cut some more.
 You can do this using a skewer or straw. The hole needs to be big enough to allow a piece of ribbon or string to pass through it., If you choose not to bake the ornaments, let them air dry for 1 to 2 days; be sure to flip them every 6 hours so that they dry evenly., You can decorate them with paint or glitter, or leave them blank. If you'd like to make them look like real gingerbread cookies, decorate them with white puffy paint; it will look just like icing! When you are done decorating, set them out to dry again.
 Make sure that the loop is big enough to fit over one of the branches on your tree.

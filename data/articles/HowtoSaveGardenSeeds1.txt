 Choose plants early in the season. Select plants and flowers that are bright, healthy, and able to survive different conditions, including rain and heat. Choose vegetable plants that are plentiful, bright and full of flavor. Perennials and annuals are reliable for keeping their look and growth patterns from generation to generation.
 When flowers stop growing, seeds will begin to show up. Keep some fading flowers on the plants. This is called going to seed, which means they produce seed heads or seed pods. Allow the seeds to dry while they are still on the plant, if the weather is not wet.
 Gather seed pods from the flowers when the seed pods are dry and brown. Pick the pods by hand, or use clippers if stems are difficult to remove.

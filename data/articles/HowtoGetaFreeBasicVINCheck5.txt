 If you're interested in a vehicle but really don't want to shell out for a VIN check, check to see whether the seller of the vehicle has a VIN check that they can produce.


Sometimes, sellers will do potential buyers a favor by paying for it themselves, saving the PDF or printout, and sending a copy over to would-be buyers.
Always keep your eyes and ears open and be cautious, since sellers could doctor the VIN Check and try to mislead you. When you're dealing with a purchase that ranges in the thousands of dollars, it's easy to be penny wise and pound-foolish. If you get an uneasy feeling, or simply don't trust the report, then paying a small fraction of the overall cost of the vehicle will give you peace of mind as well as the truth.
 This obviously isn't free, but — as noted above — very few options truly are free. Bottom line: if you're interested in potentially purchasing a used vehicle, factor in the cost of VIN checks into your total budget. The following sources will provide trustworthy VIN checks for a small fee:


Carfax
Edmunds
AutoCheck (part of Experian)

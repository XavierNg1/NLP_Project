 Wellington has a gorgeous red cable car that winds its way from Lambton Quay up to Kelburn. The ride is hair-raising but perfectly safe and you'll often meet great characters driving the cable car who enjoy the thrill from the seemingly narrow pass the cable car goes through. The kids will love it. And at the top there's a caf√©, the Wellington Museum and a cable car museum. There are also lookout points over Wellington which are definitely worth lingering for (take your camera).;
, Te Papa is an excellent free admission museum down on the waterfront. There are children's programs on weekends and during school holidays . The Discovery Place is excellent fun and there is a great kid's store with New Zealand storybooks for kids being a key feature, along with toys. Storyplace is for kids aged 5 and under.
 It's educational entertainment rolled into one, with a lot of interactive activities, children's theatre and TV. Look especially for workshops, reading sessions and special events.
 Your kids will love seeing kiwis in the nocturnal kiwi house that is shared with a tuatara. There are many animals to see and if you book ahead you can have a chance to help feed the red pandas for a small extra cost. You can feed the giraffes for free! The zoo has a conservation focus, so the kids will learn a lot about biodiversity and preserving endangered species.
 This is a fenced and mostly predator-free sanctuary where kids can roam and see over 30 native bird species and the wonderful weta insect. The rare giant weta is also found here. The kids will also get to see native forest and bushland and can participate in special events.
 There are plenty of great playgrounds along the waterfront. Kids can also rollerblade or cycle around the waterfront paths. Check out the giant slippery dip; even adults make excuses to try this one out.

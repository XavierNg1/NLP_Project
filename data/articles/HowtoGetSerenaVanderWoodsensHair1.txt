 A hallmark of Serena’s style is that her hair is long and flowing. You want your hair to fall at least to your mid-back.


If you have short hair, you can use extensions to achieve that added length.
Go to a salon to have your extensions put in, or put in clip-on extensions yourself.You can find these at most beauty supply stores, or order them online.
If you plan on going to a salon, feel free to buy glue-on or sew-in extensions. You can also ask your stylish to cut and color your hair while you have your extensions in to make them look more seamless.
You should buy extensions made from human hair because you can't use hot tools on synthetic extensions.You can style extensions like you should style your own hair, but brush delicately when you have clip-on extensions in, as these can come out.;
, You want your hair to be either slightly wavy or straight before you begin to style it.


If your hair is naturally straight or wavy, you won’t need to create a base style.
If your hair naturally forms tight ringlets, however, you’ll want to either straighten your hair with a flat iron or blow dry it straight.
If you straighten your hair either way, make sure you first apply a heat protectant serum, spray, or mousse.
 If you are really committed to maintaining Serena’s style, you might want to consider getting your blonde touched up.


If you have bright blonde hair, you could get some blonde low lights to add depth to your waves.
If your hair is a darker blonde, chunky and bright highlights would give you that sunny, textured glow.
If you decide to color your hair, go to a local salon, especially if you’re planning on highlights, rather than trying to add color yourself.

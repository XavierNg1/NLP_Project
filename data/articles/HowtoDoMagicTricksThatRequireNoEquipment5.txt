 Tell your friend, "I bet you will move before I finish walking around you three times, without anyone touching you." If she won't agree, reassure her that no one will be helping you, and she won't need to do anything but stand still.
 Walk around her while pretending to concentrate very hard. Leave at least two ft (60 cm) between you. Turn to her and say "one" the first time you circle around her.
 Continue to circle around her slowly. Pause and wipe imaginary sweat off your forehead, and say "Okay, you're a tough one, but I can still do this." Finish circling her a second time, and say "Two."

, Quickly turn and walk directly away from her, before she realizes what's happening and tries to grab you. Wave to her and promise you'll come back in a year or two to walk around her the third time!

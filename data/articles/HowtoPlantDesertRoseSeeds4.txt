 A south-facing window that receives plenty of direct sunlight is ideal, and your desert rose should receive at least eight hours of sun per day.
 Place your plants six inches (15 centimeters) below fluorescent grow lights, and allow them to soak in 12 hours of light per day.
 Allow the soil to dry out in between waterings and only add water once the top inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of soil feels dry to the touch. Water lightly when necessary, making the soil moist without saturating it.
 Ideal daytime temperature ranges between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius), with night temperatures dropping by as much as 15 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius). Never allow the soil to drop below a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). At this temperature, the plant could suffer severe damage or even death.
 Use a 20-20-20 fertilizer, diluted to half strength. A 20-20-20 fertilizer has completely balanced levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen encourages the growth of foliage, phosphorus mainly helps with root development, and potassium maintains the flowers that bud. If the fertilizer contains a higher percentage of any one element, your desert rose may develop poorly.



Give your desert rose a water-soluble liquid fertilizer every other week during the spring.
By summer, switch to a single application of slow-release palm fertilizer.
Feed your plant with another application of slow-release fertilizer during the early fall.
Give the flower a few doses of liquid fertilizer during the winter, as long as you manage to keep the temperature of the soil at or above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius).
After three years, when the plant matures, stop giving the desert rose liquid fertilizer. It can still benefit from slow-release fertilizer, however.

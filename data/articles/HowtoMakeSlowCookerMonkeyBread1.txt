 Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray onto the parchment paper., Heat the water in a saucepan or microwave to about 110 °F (43 °C). Mix in the yeast and 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar. Allow it to sit for about five minutes.The mixture is ready once it’s foamy and the yeast is dissolved.
 Add 2 cups (240 g) of the flour, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar, salt, the yeast mixture, 1/4 cup (60 g) melted butter, vanilla, and milk warmed to about 110 °F (43 °C)., Use a large bowl and mixing spoon, or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. Mix with the spoon or on low speed for ten to fifteen minutes, until the mixture becomes a soft dough.When the dough is finished mixing, it should be soft without sticking to the sides of the bowl.
 Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour. Let the dough rest on the floured surface for about ten minutes., In one bowl, melt 3/4 cup (180 g) butter. In the other bowl, combine the brown sugar, a cup (200 g) of white sugar, and cinnamon., Pinch off 2 tablespoons (30 g) of dough at a time. Roll each piece in your hands to shape it into a ball. Dip the ball in the melted butter, then roll it in the sugar mixture to coat it evenly. Place the ball on the parchment paper in the bottom of the slow cooker.The dough balls can be stacked; a single layer isn’t necessary.
Repeat this step until you’ve used all of the dough.
 Put a double layer of paper towels beneath the lid. This will prevent condensation from dripping onto the dough., Turn off the slow cooker. Take the bread out by carefully lifting it along with the parchment paper. Alternately, you can dump it upside-down onto a serving platter. The bread will taste best the day it’s made, but you can store it in an airtight container for up to five days in the refrigerator.

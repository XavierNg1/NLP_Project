 The image needs to be about the same size as your finger. It's okay if the image is a little bit wider, but not by too much.


To make a more durable puppet, use cardstock paper instead.
 If the character has some thin parts, like antenna or antlers, leave some white space around those areas. This way, they won't break off.
 This will make the band for your finger to slide through.Try to match the color of the strip to the color of the puppet.
 Overlap the two narrow ends until you get a ring shape. The ring should be large enough to fit your finger. Don't make it too tight, or the paper will rip when you bend your finger.
 Once you have the right fit, wrap a piece of tape around the seam to keep the ring together.
 The bottom edge of the ring should be aligned with the bottom edge of your puppet.
 Wait for the glue to dry, if you were using it, and slide the puppet onto your finger. Wiggle your finger side-to-side and back-and-forth to make the puppet move and talk.

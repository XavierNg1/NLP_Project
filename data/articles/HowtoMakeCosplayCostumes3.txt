 It'll make the project look less daunting.


Survey your current wardrobe for costume components. Anything you already have lessens the amount of work you have to do. Items such as gloves, shoes and hats can easily be modified.
Try to match the footwear as close as possible. AVOID wearing sneakers with a great costume!

Ask other cosplayers how they made certain components. It's a great conversation starter and is generally taken as a compliment.
See what you can find in a thrift store for a base or item you can modify.

For example, in doing a Jesse from Team Rocket cosplay, you can look for a white turtleneck and a fitting black top and a white skirt. Those can easily be transformed into her outfit.
 You may find some sudden inspiration for replicating details, and you might find good materials and ideas.


Take your reference pictures to the store so you can be sure you are getting the right colors and materials.

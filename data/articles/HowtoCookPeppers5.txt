 Fill the bottom of a steamer with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Sit the steaming basket on top, making sure that the bottom does not come into contact with the water, and boil the water over high heat.


If you do not have a steamer, you could use a large stockpot and a metal/wire mesh colander. Just make sure that the colander fits onto the rim of the pot but that the bottom of the colander does not touch the bottom of the pot. Also make sure that the lid of the stockpot will still fit on the stockpot with the colander inside.
 Cut small peppers into rings and large peppers into rings or strips.


Keep the pieces consistent in size and shape to ensure even cooking.
 Add the peppers to the steamer basket. Cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes.


The cover must stay on the pot during the cooking process so that the steam will remain trapped inside. If you lift the lid off too often, you will release too much steam, thereby increasing the amount of time the peppers will need to cook for.
 Remove the peppers from the steamer and enjoy them on their own or in any recipe calling for pre-cooked peppers.

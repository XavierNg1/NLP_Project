 When a label just won't budge, try the oven method. Place the bottle into an oven at 250ºC/475ºF for about 10 minutes.
 Wear good oven mitts to handle the hot bottle!

, With the help of a knife or a razor blade, delicately lift up one corner of the label and carefully peel back. Pull it gently and evenly.
 Labels that need to be removed in this way have a glue that will not dry. To keep the label, you will need to put it on something, such as a clean sheet of paper.

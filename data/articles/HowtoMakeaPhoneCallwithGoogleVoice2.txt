 Open a new browser tab or window, and visit the Gmail. Enter your Gmail email address and password into the fields provided, and click the “Sign in” button to proceed.
 If you’re still using the old Gmail Chat feature, you will need to enable the new Hangouts in order for you to make calls. To enable, click your profile photo at the top of the chat list (left panel). From the options that appear, select “Try the new Hangouts,” and your Gmail will reload, replacing the old Chat feature with Hangouts.
 To make calls, you will need to use credits. Add credits by clicking the phone icon at the very bottom of the left panel. A pop-up will appear with your contacts list and their phone numbers.


Click the + icon at the very top of the pop-up, and on the new page, click “Add $10.00 credit.” A Google Wallet window will appear. Enter your credit card details and information here, if you don’t have any set yet, and click “Buy” to purchase the credit.
 Click the phone icon again on the Gmail page. From the pop-up select the contact you want to call, and click “Call.” The credits being used will appear at the top of the pop-up. When you’re done, click “End” to end the call.

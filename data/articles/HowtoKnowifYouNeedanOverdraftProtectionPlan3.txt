 Many banks will email you or send you a text message once the amount of money in your checking account falls below a certain level.This is a good option to choose because alerts are typically free.


Once you receive notification, you can adjust your spending levels until you get more money in your checking account.
 According to U.S. law, you must opt-in for overdraft protection for your debit card. However, banks can still automatically charge you a non-sufficient funds fee for checks.If you avoid opting-in, then your debit card might be declined when you try to use it. This might be embarrassing. However, you’ll avoid any overdraft fee, which will save you money.
 You need to identify why you are overdrawing money from your checking account. If it is because you are living beyond your means, then you need to create a budget and stick with it.


Identify fixed expenses. These are expenses that don’t change month to month, such as your home (rent or mortgage), health insurance, and some utilities.Calculate your variable spending, which differs month to month. Variable spending includes entertainment, meals out, vacations, and other luxuries. You should reduce this amount as much as possible when creating a budget.
Increase your income if necessary. Find a part-time job to supplement the income from your day job.
 Cash is the least expensive method of paying for an emergency.If your car breaks down and you need a cab home, or if you need to stay in a motel during an emergency, you can pull out your saved cash and pay.


Remember to carry the cash with you. Put it in a money clip and store it at the bottom of your purse or in your wallet.
Avoid spending the cash on non-emergencies. If you spend it, then you won’t have the money when you need it.

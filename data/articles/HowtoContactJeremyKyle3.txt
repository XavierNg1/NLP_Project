 Use the online form on Jeremy Kyle's website to request tickets to the Jeremy Kyle Show. It is located at http://www.itv.com/jeremykyle/be-in-the-audience-show. You will need to include information such as your name, address and email address.


You also need to be at least 18 to be a member of the Jeremy Kyle Show audience.
 It's stated on the Jeremy Kyle Show website that tickets to the show are not sold, and can only be obtained by using the online form. If you see tickets to the show for sale on a different website, it's most likely a scam.
 If you have any problems when applying or any questions regarding being an audience member you can send an email to jeremykyleaudience@itv.com.

 You can do this by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del or by searching for it using the search bar in your Charms menu.
 You will see a tab in the Task Manager window which says "Startup". Click it.
 Be careful not to disable anything important. Look up programs first if you are unsure.


More options are also available if you right-click on the item.
 You can also add programs by adding shortcuts to the Startup folder on your computer. The address for the startup folder should look something like this: "C:\Users\wikiHow\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup". Just replace "wikiHow" with your user name for your PC.

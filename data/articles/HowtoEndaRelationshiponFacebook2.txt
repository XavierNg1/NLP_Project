 Locate Facebook on your device’s home screen or app drawer, and tap on it.


Enter your registered email address and password in the fields at the middle of the screen, then tap “Log in” to access to your account.
 Tap on the three vertical lines at the top left corner of the screen to open the left side bar, and then tap your profile name.
 Once your profile loads, tap “About” at the top of the page.


Look for the “More about you link,” and tap on it. This will load all editable information about you.
On the “More about you” page, scroll down until you find “Relationship.” Once you find it, tap the “Edit” link at the side of “Relationship.”

, To do this, tap the people icon at the bottom left (the icon also has a down arrow on it). The options to the privacy settings will appear as a drop-down list.


Scroll down the list and select “Only me.” Now, ending your relationship status will be private.
This is optional. If you wish for your friends to know, select “Friends” instead.
Once you’ve set the privacy appropriately, tap “Save.”

, Tap the current relationship status you have, which should be just below the “Relationship” heading. The status should have a down arrow next to it.


Select the very first option on the list, which is three hyphens (---). This will leave your relationship status as “blank.” Or you can select the second option, which is “Single.”
After tapping “blank” or “Single,” your ex-partner’s profile name, picture, and your relationship’s anniversary date will be removed.
If you set your privacy settings to “Only me,” your ex-partner will not be notified of the changes, but if your privacy settings is set to “Public” or “Friends,” your ex-partner will be notified. It will not matter if he or she accepts the notification; your new status will be updated on your profile as soon as you save.
 Do this by tapping “Save” to the right of the screen, on the line below the relationship status drop-down list.

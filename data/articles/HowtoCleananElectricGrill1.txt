 Protect yourself from electric shock by unplugging your grill before you put it anywhere near a wet sponge.;
, The best time to clean the grill plates is when they’re still warm. After you unplug the grill, let it cool down for about ten minutes., It’s important not to use abrasive scouring pads that can scratch the nonstick grill plates. Some electric grills come with a rubber spatula that can scrape off caked-on food, but any rubber spatula will do. Scrape along the ridges and crevices of the grill surface., Wet a soft sponge or rag and wring it out thoroughly. Rinse the sponge frequently while you wipe the plates down, because it will get greasy and grimy quickly. Use a dollop of dish soap on your sponge for tough jobs.
 Dismantle your electric grill by taking the plates off and remove the drip tray. Squirt some dish soap and wash it with a soft, wet sponge or rag.
 Dry the drip tray and give the grill plates another once over with a paper towel. You’ll remove any leftover gunk and get your pieces dry.
 Some electric grills have detachable pieces that can be cleaned in the dishwasher. Follow the manufacturer's directions, but put the drip tray and cooking plates in the dishwasher if you can.

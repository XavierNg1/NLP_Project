 Garnet's hair post-Jailbreak is a bit smaller than it was before. A large wig will still do the job, though.
 Sewing will be pretty much unavoidable with this version of Garnet. Buying a cosplay online might be your best bet if you can't sew and really want to cosplay this version.
 Cut them both exactly down the middle and sew them together as one, with blue on the right and purple on the left. If you can, use the remaining fabric to sew the bottom half of Garnet's shirt; that way you won't have to worry about matching colors.
 You'll need a pale pink or dark blue top as a base, then hot pink and red to create the star, which is at the lower left of the chest. The sleeves could be recreated with styrofoam.
 Garnet has deep purple gloves, which stop at the wrist save for her third finger. Get a cheap pair of long gloves and cut them out in this pattern.
 Shoes could be a bit of a challenge. You might want to buy shoes specifically for this cosplay or get subtly colored shoes that blend in with the leggings.
 As always, Garnet has a great pair of shades in this incarnation. They cover her whole forehead along with her eyes and appear to have a pink and blue tint, but normal sunglasses are good nonetheless.

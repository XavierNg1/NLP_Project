 Even simple homemade gifts can often mean even more than a gift you purchased in a store. You can make them more personalized and it shows a lot of additional effort on your part to make something. If “it’s the thought that counts” is indeed true, then the thought and effort you put into your homemade gift will warm your significant other’s heart.For instance, if you have never cooked for the person before, give it a try. Even if your risotto turns out better suited as brick mortar, you can laugh about it over a pizza later on.
Once more, listen and learn. What does your partner like? Make something special that shows you’ve been paying attention.
 Is it too old-fashioned to give your class ring or letterman jacket to your high school sweetheart? Maybe, maybe not. But giving something that has special meaning to you lets the other person know that you care and that you want things to continue for the foreseeable future.


You know that old, faded, but ridiculously comfortable sweatshirt that your significant other likes to borrow when you’re watching TV? Why not make a gift of it?
Be realistic, of course. A one month anniversary doesn’t generally warrant giving away a family heirloom like your grandmother’s ring.
 Why not make your gift something that will help both of you be better people and improve the lives of others? Seek out volunteer opportunities in your community. Help clean up a playground. Spend time with seniors or shelter pets. Collect food for the needy. This gift will provide rewards for both of you and many others.


Think about a cause or issue that your partner is very interested in or concerned about. Try to find a way that you can spend quality time together supporting that cause.

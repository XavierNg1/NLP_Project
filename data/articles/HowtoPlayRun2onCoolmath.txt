 This is where you will startup the game.;
, This is the better option for beginners, as the runner is easier to control. While you don't jump as far, the levels are designed to work around that.
 Your first goal is to complete the level; your section objective is to get the little bonus.


Many players switch these objectives and try a level 10 times just to get the bonus. Do not play this way, even though it is tempting; you can always go back and replay levels if you want.
 This level just requires you to press each of the keys once: left, right, then space. The walls even look like arrow keys, showing you the way to go. At the end of the level is a block that looks like a space bar (hint, hint) and the bonus.


Many times the bonus will be sitting on the underside of a block, and you need to figure out how to get to it, but not this level. Just press space once you have jumped up once, and you will get the bonus. Once the floor beneath you starts to turn different colors, you know you are at the end of the level.
 One strategy is to run through the level, on the main path, then look for the bonus as you are completely the level. If you can spot it, try to get to it. If you can't jump high enough, or you can't see the bonus entirely, then maybe there is another path that leads to the bonus.


For example, on Level 2, if you hold down "right" from the start of the level, you can get past the long wall to the right of the level, and you'll find the bonus along that path.
 If running on one path doesn't work, jump to the wall on your right. What was the wall on the right will become the floor, and the floor will become the wall on the left. This will shift perspective and sometimes allow you to see hidden areas you haven't seen before.
 After level 25, special bonus levels will be available depending on how many bonuses you got.

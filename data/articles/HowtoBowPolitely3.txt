 Bow to denote respect, as you would in a non-corporate situation, but be especially mindful of the rank of those to whom you bow. Japanese culture is highly hierarchical, meaning that that older people have higher social status than younger people, men usually have more status than women, and senior executives demand more respect than junior executives.Japanese businessmen often exchange business cards before bowing or shaking hands. Make sure that your business card clearly states your rank—this will determine who your negotiating counterpart should be.
If you are bowing to someone who ranks higher than you in his/her respective company, make sure to avert your gaze to show respect. Bear in mind that higher-ranking individuals may not bow back—bowing is often a one-way gesture in practice., Cross your legs and ankles while standing, then bend your knees slightly. Lift the fabric of your dress out to your sides. This is a traditional European and American way of showing deference, but its use has declined sharply over the past century.


Curtsy in any situation that might call for a bow. As with bowing, the curtsy is still regarded as a polite gesture, but it will come across as a bit outdated.
 In Western culture, it is common to bow after a speech or performance to acknowledge the applause of the crowd. As your audience claps (or snaps, cheers, etc.), put your right hand on the center of your chest. Breathe in deeply. Bend your back. Briefly bow your head, then stand back up.


Do not bow for too long, nor too quickly. Bow for 3-5 seconds, but do not let it drag on.
Stand still. Do not shuffle about while you bow.

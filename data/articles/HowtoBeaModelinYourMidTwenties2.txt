 That means, no tanning! EVER. Unless of course it's sunless, in which case, don't overdo it, and don't look orange. Ask a family member or friend who you think would be bold enough to tell you if you look orange or not. If you do, tone it down or avoid it all together. Photographers will apply bronzer to your skin if they think it's too pale.
 Agencies usually cut off open calls to models over the age of 25. Take 4 photos of yourself. The first should be a photo of the front of your face with NO MAKEUP on (if you insist on wearing it, however, make sure you keep it down to mascara and concealer that matches your skin tone perfectly. Second, a photo of your profile. Third, a full body shot of you in a bikini (NEVER send nude photos. They are UNACCEPTABLE). And finally, a full body shot of you in a bikini from the side.
 Are you a size 4, 6, or 8? Are you over 5'9"? If not, you should probably go with commercial/print/plus-size modeling. Seek out agencies with these divisions.
 You can have tremendous success as a commercial/print model, and best of all, unlike those of us in high fashion, you never expire. You can model until you die. Plus, it's still super glam, super fun, and you have the opportunity to make lots of money.

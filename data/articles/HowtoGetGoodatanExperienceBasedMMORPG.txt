 Make sure before you do anything, read the lore behind the game. Lore is the essence of playing MMORPGs. Why are you fighting for your cause? Why do you follow this leader and why do you want to kill your enemy?


You should also familiarise yourself with in-game terms, weapons, tactics and so forth.;
, Get to know how strong you need to be to kill a monster. For example, in the game Runescape, a character can be level 82 and beat a level 100 monster. Always fight the strongest monster you can beet. This will maximise the amount of experience points you receive.
 You can grind monster in a particular area, you can raid bosses or you can even fight real players (PVP). In some games you even gain XP by doing peaceful stuff like cooking and fishing!

, Not training regularly will hinder you from advancing in the game. Set aside a little time to train f. ex. your combos.
 In all MMORPGs there is a currency (most often cases gold) used to purchase items within the game. These items can be weapons, armor, potions, mounts, pets etc. Buying better gear enables you to fight tougher enemies.
 In many games, there tend to be prize fluctuations. For example, If there are too many similar items on the market, prizes tend to lower. When the items quantity lower during other times, the prize of course lowers.
 You don't want to miss out on special in-game events. You have a chance to get something that can later be extremely valuable.
 This makes level grinding much more enjoyable. You can go from a level 50 to 60 without even noticing it! Time flies when your having fun as they say! Some games even have clans and friend list. So use it to your advantage!

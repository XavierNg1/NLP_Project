 It is possible to RP by yourself. Make sure they know what they are getting into, and the basics of zombies.;
, If a person wants to have most of the bows, so be it. Make sure it's equal to everyone.
 If everyone wants an over-the-top story, let them. But if there is just one person out of ten that want a ridiculous story (depending on story), make it more realistic.
 If you decide to have real people, make sure they know when they are shot and they cannot break the rules. And if you choose fictional air zombies, then make sure you don't suddenly say a zombie has appeared and ate my arm. No.
 This can be inside, outside, anywhere. Build one if necessary. It can be big or small, but make sure you have an eating spot, campfire and bed area.
 Make sure this food is not poison and if you are really going to eat, pack some food ahead of time or from a garden.
 If you are by yourself, make sure you have the building secure.
 Have fun! Don't argue (unless it's in the RP).

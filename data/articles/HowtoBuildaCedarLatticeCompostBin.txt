 This is usually made with 3/8-inch thick cedar strips.;
, Each piece should then be 32-inches by 48-inches.
 Now you have two pieces each 24-by-32-inches. See the accompanying pictures. When finished you'll end up with a compost box 48-inches long, 24-inches wide, and 32-inches high.
 This is shown in the pictures above where the four finished pieces are laid out. Drill holes for the screws through the cedar to prevent splitting. Use bright-finish wallboard screws with small washers - again to prevent splitting.
 These should be 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2Â cm) down from the top and the same up from the bottom. Drilling pilot holes makes it much easier to screw these in. Put the hooks on the long side and eyes on the short sides - it doesn't actually make a difference, but being consistent makes it much easier to assemble the box.


These images provide good views of the scrap used to beef up the sides of the panels.
, This way, when it's time to spread your compost, simply remove the sides and spread the contents with a rake - no having to fill and dump a wheelbarrow. Next growing season place the bin somewhere else in the garden.
 You can leave it open to the rain. The water soaks through and carries nutrients to the roots of the nearest plants. You'll notice those plants next to the bin will grow like they're on steroids. If you want to cover your bin, do so with something that will let in some rain or water from your sprinkler - a piece of plywood with holes drilled into it - or even a few boards. The spaces between the boards will let in some water.

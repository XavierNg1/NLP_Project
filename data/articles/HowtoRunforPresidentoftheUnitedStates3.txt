 Now that you're an official candidate and your committee has said, "Yes, believe it or not, we can do this," it's time to spread the word. And it's also time to make even more connections at your local print design shop (if you haven't already) and sucker your friends and family into touting around your logo for the next 2 years.


Design t-shirts, car magnets, sandwich boards, yard signs, and bumper stickers all with your name and/or catchphrase. Ask local establishments if you can put flyers in their windows (or if they can name a product after you (at least temporarily)). Send these out to your friends on the opposite coast and have them distribute them there.
Go virtual! Start a YouTube channel and get a website or blog. Get an account for your campaign on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. How else will you reach the newest generation of voters?

, When people start seeing your name out there, they're going to ask, "Who is this guy/woman? What does he/she stand for? Is he/she serious?" Yes, you are serious and you have the sensibilities to prove it.


If you like something or think it needs to be changed (for example: humanitarian aid to foreign countries), have it all planned out. What party are you aligned with? Do you support their generic stance on all issues? Where do you fall on the liberal/conservative scale?
Make these beliefs clear on your blog, your social networking accounts, and to your friends and family. The more people who can explain you for you, the better.
 What are your goals? Lower taxes? Reducing poverty? Creating jobs? Higher standards of education? Think about all the biggies when it comes to previous elections -- what changes do you want to promise?


It's a good idea if you actually believe what you're putting out there. It'll be much easier to remain consistent and not get caught switching sides or dilly-dallying on an issue. If you believe something the public doesn't want to hear, quite frankly, good luck.

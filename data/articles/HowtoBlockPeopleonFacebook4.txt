 If you decide that someone you've previously blocked deserves another chance, you can unblock this person in just a few steps. Start by clicking the button in the top right corner of the Facebook page that looks like a padlock next to a few lines. This will bring up the "Privacy Settings" menu.


This button is the same one used in the first method above.
 This is just like what you would do if you wanted to block someone in the first place.
 This link is right below the text box you use to search for people to block.
 A window will pop up showing you the names of people you have blocked. Clicking the "Unblock" button will bring up a small confirmation window. Click "Confirm" to finish.


Note that, after you unblock someone, you will not be able to re-block this person for 48 hours.
 Unblocking someone doesn't automatically make this person your Facebook friend again. For this, you'll need to send a friend request and the person you've unblocked will need to accept it.


See our article on adding Facebook friends for step-by-step help with this.

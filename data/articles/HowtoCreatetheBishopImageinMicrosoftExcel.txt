 Select your image you want to make art from trigonometry by -- here, for example, the objective is a black chess bishop. Decide on the basic curve to employ. Here, for example, the curve selected was the spherical helix curve because it stacks nicely like the lathing work on chess pieces, also because of shading considerations it's better than the sine wave  sphere  and finally because of the way spheres are joined, they settle atop one another in a smooth fashion. The basic plan is to select one side of the Square of Spheres previously done in the article How to Make a Square of Spherical Helixes, then to modify the curves of those spheres as if lathing had been applied.;

Edit Go To cell range A6:A364 and enter into A6 the formula "=(A5+(-Top*2)/(ADJROWS))" w/o quotes and Edit Fill Down.
Enter into B5 "=c_base" w/o quotes and format fill light rose.
Edit Go To cell range B6:B364 and enter into B6 the formula "=B5" w/o quotes and Edit Fill Down.
,, Edit Go To cell range E5:F64 and format fill yellow and enter to E5 the formula "=((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*COS(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2))) *GMLL)+G5)^(N-0)" w/o quotes and where the last symbol is zero, not oh. Then tab over to cell F5 and enter the formula "=I5*((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*SIN(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL) +H5)^(N-0)" w/o quotes, and do Edit Fill Down.


Then the remaining 300 cells or 5 spheres are reversed and the call to column I is on the X side=: Edit Go To E65:F364 and enter to E65 "=I65*((SIN(A65/(B65*2))*GMLL*COS(A65)*GMLL*(COS(A65/(B65*2)))*GMLL)+G65)^(N-0)" w/o quotes, then tab over to F65 and enter "=((SIN(A65/(B65*2))*GMLL*SIN(A65)*GMLL*(COS(A65/(B65*2)))*GMLL)+H65)^(N-0)" w/o quotes and Edit Fill Down. You may wish to follow me and format each 60 row x+y set as a lightly filled different color to tell them apart.
, Edit Go To H6:H364 and enter to H6 the formula "=H5-p/360" and Edit Fill Down.
 Enter to I5 1.075 and enter to the cell range I6:I64 1 and Edit Fill Down. Enter 4.5 for cell range I65:I68 via Edit Fill Down. Enter "=PI()" for cell range I69:I73 via Edit Fill Down. Go To cell I125 and enter "=1/-1.33" and select cell range I73:I125 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Trend (or possibly Growth Trend -- I forget), OK.

 Scatter, Smoother Line Scatter. If not in Chart Wizard where a chart is automatically opened, copy or cut the chart from atop the Data worksheet and activate the Chart worksheet and paste it in the upper left corner. Expand it by pulling on the lower right corner by hovering over it until the cursor becomes a double headed arrow and then grabbing the corner and pulling down and to the right to form an approximate square.
Do Chart Layout to remove the Chart Grid Lines, Axes and Legend. At far left under Current Selection, choose Plot Area and beneath that select Format Selection. Do Line No Line. Do Fill Pattern or Texture -Texture White Marble. Do 3D Format Top Circle Width and Height 6 pts each and Depth & Surface - Surface = Dark Edge. OK.
Back under Current Selection, choose Series 1, Format Selection. Do Shadow checked perspective, black, 63% size, all the rest 0's. Angle is 115 degrees quoted and unchangeable.
Line - Smoothed. Gradient (see picture please). Weight = 35 pt. Path states Upper Left Corner (but I don't believe it and didn't select anything) and Gradient from left to right is 15% Very Dark Navy Blue, 41% Black, 48% Charcoal Grey, 52% White, 54% Charcoal Grey, 66% Light Grey, 71% Light (not lightest) Blue, 81% White, 96% Very Dark Navy Blue. Glow is Light Blue at 8pt size and 25% transparency with 4 pt Soft Edges, OK. Effect is to resemble adhesed marble with various light and medium spray glazes.
 Then, with the Shift key down, Copy Picture, lift the Shift key and select the Saves worksheet, and depress the Shift key and do Paste Picture below the formulas -- that way, you'll have a record of how your settings were when you accomplished the image. If you want, copy the BISHOP column too, for safety's sake, along with the MAIN X and Y columns and x and y of p columns. Fortunately, there aren't all that many rows.

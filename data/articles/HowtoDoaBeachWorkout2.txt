 Take off your shoes and place them by a towel. Drink plenty of water, if you have just completed the cardio workout.


Make sure you can swim and get a friend to workout with you if you want to workout in the water. Always check the beach conditions, so that you can try to avoid riptides and other dangers.
 Stop when the water is just less than knee deep. Run for 5 minutes with the added resistance of the water.


If you want to walk instead, go into the water until it is just over knee height. Walk through the water for 5 minutes. The added resistance of the water will make it harder to move your legs. Keep your core stable and your hands at your hips.
 Start at your towel, sprint into the water, dip your body below the surface, and sprint back.


Do this whenever you want to cool down during the latter half of your workout.

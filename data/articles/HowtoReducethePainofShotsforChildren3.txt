 Sometimes the simple act of showing that you are there can help comfort your child. Say, “you did a great job, I’m so proud of you!” They will feel a sense of pride for their accomplishment.
 Pack a few special treats in your bag or purse such as your child’s favorite candy bar or snack. You may also want to pack a favorite drink. Another option is to offer to take your child out for ice cream or another special treat on the way home.


If your child doesn’t like sweets or if you don’t want to overload them with sugar, consider taking them to do a fun activity instead. This could be anything from stopping at the playground, playing a favorite game together at home, or renting a movie to watch at home.
 Redness and swelling at the site of the shot should not last longer than 48 hours. If your child feels warm and is acting lethargic, take their temperature. While low-grade fevers are normal, they also shouldn’t last for more than 48 hours. A temperature is considered a fever if it is 100.4 Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius taken rectally. Take your child’s temperature under the arm for more comfort.If your child has symptoms beyond what your nurse suggested than call them right away.


To reduce a fever, give your child plenty to drink. Dress your child lightly.
Only give your child medicines his doctor has approved.
Do not hesitate to take your child into the emergency room if things don’t seem right or if their temperature is above 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Discuss room rental costs and what is included in those fees.
Determine what the hours are that you will have access to the room. If no one books it the night before, can you have access to get in and decorate or set up? Are they providing the service ware for the food, or do you need to bring in or rent your own linens, plates, napkins and silverware?
Does the food have to come from that location, or can you bring in an outside caterer?
If you can bring in your own caterer, start meeting with potential vendors to taste their food and determine their pricing.
Determine if your venue requires you to bring in outside security for your event. This not only protects you from liability, but this can help keep outsiders from crashing your party.
Look to hire a licensed bartender if your facility cannot provide one, and you choose to have alcohol at the event.
Find out if the venue can provide decorations or if you have to supply your own. Some facilities have a wide variety of items that you can use such as candles, mirrors to set on the table, glass jars, etc. So if you can take advantage of anything being provided for free, you can save quite a bit on your budget.
 Will it be a buffet or a sit-down, plated meal? Are you doing appetizers ahead of time, and/or are you considering a dessert bar later in the evening? Iron out the exact details and timing so that your guests don't go hungry at any point.
,,, If there are any details that you still need to cover or are time-sensitive, make sure that you have created a countdown list to stay on top of the little details.

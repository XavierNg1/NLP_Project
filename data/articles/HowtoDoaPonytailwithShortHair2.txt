 Brush your hair behind your eyes. Divide it into three sections. Pull the middle section into a low ponytail. Secure it with a clear elastic. Leave the other two sections down.Let the middle section be the thickest. It will be difficult to twist your hair if the other two sections are too thick.
Brush your hair out first if it is straight or slightly wavy. Do not brush it if you have curly hair that you want to maintain.
 Put the left section over the right section. Leave a space in between the two section and pull the left section through the hole. Then pull the section into a knot. Pull them back over the top of the ponytail. The knot should cover the clear elastic.Lightly spray the other two sections that have been left out.
 Wrap the ends of the two sections and pull them around and under the ponytail. Push the leftover ends into the bottom of the ponytail. Use bobby pins to secure the loose pieces at the bottom of the knot., Smooth out the loose ends and flyaway hairs with your hands or with a brush. Lightly hairspray your hair.

 In a small bowl, mix 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons (14 g) of honey, and 2 teaspoons (10 g) of baking soda. Stir the ingredients together until they are fully combined.The citric acid in the lemon helps lighten dark spots and other discolorations on your hands. You can substitute lime juice if you prefer.
 When the ingredients are fully mixed, carefully apply the mixture to your hands, rubbing it in in a circular motion. Once your hands are both covered, allow the mask to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.Be sure that your hands are clean before you apply the mask.
 When you’re ready to wash off the mask, run your hands under warm water to remove it. Pat your hands dry, and apply a hand cream. You can repeat the process up to twice a week to help get rid of discolorations on your hands.If you’re going out in the sun after using the hand mask, apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 to your hands to protect them.

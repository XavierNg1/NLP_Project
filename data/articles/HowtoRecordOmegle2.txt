 Once the installation is finished, double-click the icon on the desktop.
 Select “Open Capture Device.”

 Click “Next,” then click “Add” beside the text field. This will let you set a filename and save directory.


Select a directory by navigating through the folders. The desktop is an ideal, accessible place to save.
Type in the name of the video file in the field below, and click on “Save.”

 Head to www.Omegle.com on your favorite browser. Click “Video” under “Start a chat” to begin chatting.
 Click on “VLC” on the taskbar below, then click “Stop.” The video should then appear in the directory you set earlier and should be available for viewing.

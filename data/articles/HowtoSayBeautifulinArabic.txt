 In Arabic, this translates directly to "beautiful".Pronounce it "jah-meel" or "jah-meel-ah". The Arabic character is: جميل.


Some Arabic speakers (e.g. Egyptians) tend to pronounce the word with a hard "J", as in "gah-meel" or "gah-meelah". Be aware that people may make assumptions about you if you pronounce the word in a certain way. Listen carefully before you speak, and try to take your cues from those around you.Bear in mind that "jameel" and "jameela" are only phonetic approximations of the Arabic word (جميل). There is one official way to spell these words in Arabic, but you may come across various acceptable English spellings: jamila, jameelah, gamila, gameela, etc. The important thing is that you know how to say it.;
, When Arabs say "jameel", they mean more than just "good-looking". The term refers to a deep, inner beauty, as in, "there's something beautiful inside you". Respect the word and the culture by only calling something "jameel" if you are truly impressed by its inner beauty., Pronounce it "an-tay jah-meelah" (female) or "enta jah-meel" (male).


Be careful with your words. Only call women "jameela" if you know them or you are meeting them formally. Don't go around saying this to women that you don't know, or they may think that you have bad intentions toward them.
Call a woman "ya amar" (يا قمر) to mean "my moon" or "my most beautiful". Pronounce it "ya kamar". This is a powerful phrase, so only use it if you truly mean it., Say "hatha jameel" or "da gameel" if you like something and you think it is good or beautiful. Pronounce it "hah-thuh jah-meel".

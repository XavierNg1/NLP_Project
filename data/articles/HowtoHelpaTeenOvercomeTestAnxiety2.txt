 Asking a teacher or professor to help develop a study plan or for one-on-one tutoring or help is a great way prepare for exams. Teachers and professors can help point the teen in the right direction as far as what specific course materials they should be studying.

Mrs. Smith stayed after school to help me study — and earned an A! What if you asked Mr. Goines to help you with biology?"

, Procrastinating until the last minute will only increase anxiety and negatively affect the teen’s sleep and performance. Urge them to make study time for exams a priority. Stick to the established study schedule, and add more time to study for a particular test if necessary.
 How well a student performs on a test can be directly related to how much sleep they got the night before. Being well rested will help them do their best on test day. Shoot for at least eight hours of sleep the night before an exam., Stick to whole grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and lean proteins like turkey bacon. Make sure they avoid foods high in sugar like many breakfast cereals. Feeding one’s brain a healthy breakfast can positively affect test performance.

Instead, encourage the teen to drink water to stay hydrated., If they find themselves feeling anxious while taking the exam, urge stop and do one of the relaxation techniques they’ve been practicing.

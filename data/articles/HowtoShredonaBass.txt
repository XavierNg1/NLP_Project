 Look for strings you feel good playing on; it's important to be comfortable when you play.
 This is optional. The goal is to get a better feel on your strings. In this way, your fingers will slide with greater ease. Beware though––this is only to help you, but don't overdo it, don’t apply too much “fast fret”!



 

, If you work without it, you will practice the technique but you will not keep the rhythm. If you do practice with one, be aware that you will not be able to use it in a band or a composition., If you only play with two fingers, start playing with your third finger on a song that you already know. Don’t play a high speed rhythm at the beginning. (Don’t start with Slayer’s Raining Blood, for example.)





, Just scrape the string with the tip of your fingers to be fast enough. If you lose power in the sound, you can use a boost or distortion pedal to offset it. It is also a good way to highlight your shred when you play it in a band!, Focus on your right hand (for right-handed players). The D or G strings are the best for training., Try to change the note when you play. After that, work on your right hand by changing the string you are playing.

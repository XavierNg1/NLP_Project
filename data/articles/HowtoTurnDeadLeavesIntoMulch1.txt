 To start, rake up the leaves in your yard. You want to gather all the leaves together so you can prepare to turn them into mulch.If you have a smaller yard, you may only need one big pile of leaves.
If you have a bigger yard, you may have to make a series of piles to rake up all the leaves.;
, To make mulch, you will need to shred your leaves. There are many different ways you can do this.If you have a leaf shredder or wood chopper, try feeding your leaves through this machine.
If you don't have one of these machines, you can run a lawn mower over your leaves to shred them. You will have to thin your piles out a little so the lawnmower can run over them.
 You need a compost bin for the process of turning leaves into mulch. If you already have a compost bin, you can use that. If you don't, you will need to prepare one.You can purchase a compost bin at a local hardware store. It's important the bin be at least 3 by 3 feet.
You will probably end up with several 12 to 18 inch layers of leaves, so make sure the compost bin you select can accommodate this.

 The cardboard should be right behind the stain. It will prevent the stain from transferring to the back of the garment.
 This will help lift the oil from the fabric.
 You want the stained area to be completely covered. The baking soda will help absorb the WD-40 and the oil.
 Keep scrubbing until you see the baking soda begin to clump up.
 You don't need a lot of dish soap. Just a drop of two will do, depending on the size of the stain.
 At some point, the baking soda will get caught in the bristles of the brush. When this happens, rinse the toothbrush with water, then keep scrubbing until the baking soda is all gone.
 If the garment is machine washable, toss it into the washing machine with the rest of your laundry. If the garment is not machine washable, then wash it in a sink filled with water and some laundry detergent.

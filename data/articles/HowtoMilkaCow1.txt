 Make sure the cow is wearing a halter, and tie the lead end to a sturdy post or other immovable beam. Tie the cow in a low-stress, quiet environment. If cows are anxious or afraid, the milking process will be more difficult and unpleasant for both you and the animal.If you are working on a farm that has a stanchion (a wooden box-like structure used for securing a cow’s head so that it can be milked, vaccinated, or branded), you can effectively secure the cow.
Sophisticated stanchions will have a bar or lever on the side that will gently clamp wooden or metal slats around the cow’s neck and hold it immobile. More rudimentary stanchions may need to be fastened with a crossbeam or piece of wire.;
, When moving near to clean the udder, speak in a low voice and gently pat her side so that she knows where you are. Don’t make any sudden movements. The idea is to let her know where you are. If you surprise her, she may panic and kick you or step on you.

Tying the cow’s tail to her leg will prevent her from swishing you with it. Tail hair does not tie well, and it will come loose after a few minutes.
 During the course of a day, the cow’s teats will become covered in grass, hay, and dirt. Wash the teats before you begin milking to prevent soil—and any bacteria that it may contain—from contaminating the milk.Washing with warm water may help coax or “bring down” the milk.
 Do not milk the cow if her teats are still wet, because the soap and water may drip down into the milk bucket and contaminate the milk.Dry the teats using a clean, soft cotton cloth.


As you dry them, don’t scratch or irritate the teats. They are sensitive, and the cow may jerk or try to kick you if you cause any pain.

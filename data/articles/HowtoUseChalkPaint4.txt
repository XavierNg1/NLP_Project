 Not all paint guns can handle chalk paint because it can be a little thick. Add 2 tablespoons (1 oz) of water to every cup (8 oz) of paint that you use in the paint gun., This is especially necessary if you choose not to water down the paint. Test the gun on a small, out-of-the-way area on your piece of furniture to get used to the pressure., Apply the chalk paint evenly, sweeping your arm back and forth in long, even movements.

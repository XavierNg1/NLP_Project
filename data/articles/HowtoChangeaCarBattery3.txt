 The battery should be located in an accessible part on either side of the car's frame. The battery is a rectangular box with two cables attached to it. Some European cars (some BMW's) have the battery under the matting in the trunk, some vehicles can have the battery located under the rear seat, or some are located inside the fender of the wheel well (some Chrysler's). The latter is often very difficult to remove.
 Locate the positive and the negative terminals of the old car battery. The positive terminal will have a plus sign (and is often red) and the negative terminal will have a minus sign (and is often black).
 Loosen the negative cable clamp with a wrench (Usually 8mm or 10mm) and slide it off of the terminal. If the cables are unmarked, label them so that they don't get mixed up (otherwise you may ruin your car's electric system later on). It is also important that you disconnect the negative terminal socket before the positive terminal socket. Otherwise, you may short circuit the positive terminal to a grounded part of the car.
, Unfasten the battery holder and remove any screws, clamps or bars holding the battery in place. Carefully lift the battery out of the car. Remember that a battery can weigh 30 to 60 pounds, or 13.5 to 27 kilos, so if you have any back problems, get a helping hand.

 Never run a brush through wet or damp hair, since this could cause it to break and lead to frizzing. Instead, gently pull a wide-toothed comb through your hair, starting near the tips and working your way up to the roots.


If you have very curly or kinky hair, you may not need to comb it at all. Combing could cause the individual hairs to separate and frizz. Experiment with your hair to find out what method works best for you.
 If your hair tends to get pretty tangled, you might want to smooth in some leave-in conditioner, gel or oil to help you detangle it with the comb more easily.
 Part your hair where you like it to be parted, then style it as usually. Add hair gel, mousse or spray to create the height, volume and texture you want. Let your hair air dry completely, and youâ€™re good to go.
 You can use a hair dryer to finish towel-dried hair, leaving it glossy and smooth. First apply a heat protectant product to protect your hair from heat as much as possible. Then dry your hair section by section, using a round brush to create a smooth, glossy finish.

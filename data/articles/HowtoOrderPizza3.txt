 If you're a gamer with a serious pepperoni addiction, you can even order a pie straight from the comfort of your couch while you've got Call of Duty: Modern Warfare paused. Go to the app store and search for the Pizza Hut app and download it. You'll be able to use the information you've already pre-loaded into Xbox Live to pre-fill your information and link it to a pre-existing Pizza Hut account, and be able to select a pizza in no time.


If you haven't already created a Pizza Hut account, you might have to start one, following the same series of steps you'd follow to purchase a pizza online.
 Using your controller, you can select between the same sorts of local deals you'd see on the website, or create a custom order the way you'd like it.


You can also use voice commands or Kinect motion gestures to customize your pizza. Welcome to the future, Marty McFly., Make sure your contact information and your payment information are both up to date and get back to killing zombies, draining three-pointers, or fighting the Joker. You still have to get off the couch to answer the door, unfortunately.

 Keep a record of each apartment you visit. Note what features are extra or missing. Take measurements of the rooms and doorways to ensure furniture fits on moving day. Turn on light switches, look inside closets, check water pressure, visit the laundry room, walk the grounds, and ask neighbors what itâ€™s like to live there.
 Who controls the heat? Are appliances included? Is smoking allowed? Are pets allowed? When is the apartment available? Will they paint before you move in?


Also ask about vacancy rates. If an apartment building has a large number of vacant units, chances are the building is not being managed well.
 Make sure that the neighborhood is agreeable by wandering around it. Also visit the area at a variety of times of day. What is a quiet neighborhood early on a Saturday morning may be hectic on a weekday evening.
 Your lease should clarify the rent, terms, and duration of your agreement. Read it carefully and negotiate terms before signing.


If you give a deposit, get a receipt. You want documentation of any and all payments you make, so there is no question about it later.

 In recent versions of Windows, there is a rectangular button in bottom right corner of the taskbar that is “hidden” until you click on it.
 The button will appear opaque once clicked and will minimize all currently open windows.
 If you wish to maximize the previously minimized windows, click the rectangular button again. It will maximize all minimized windows.

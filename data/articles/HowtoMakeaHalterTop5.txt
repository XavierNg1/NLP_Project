Grab the top left corner and the top right corner of the scarf and pull them up towards your neckline. Wrap the corners around each other once or twice., Pull the left corner over your right shoulder. Pull the right corner over your left shoulder. Adjust the top and the straps until it feels comfortable. Tie the straps in a knot behind your neck.

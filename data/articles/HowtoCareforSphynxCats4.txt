The initial kitten vaccinations require two doses to be effective, given from nine weeks of age and given three to four weeks apart.If in doubt about when to vaccinate, phone your local veterinary clinic to be advised of the protocol that they recommend and work to.
Get your cat booster injections once a year.
 Your Sphynx cat should be spayed or neutered. This generally takes place around five to six months old, before your female cat can start getting pregnant.


While you are getting your cat fixed, you can also have an identichip fitted. ID chips are a permanent way of identifying your cat.
 Other preventative health care for your cat includes parasite control and deworming. You want to discuss a flea prevention medicine with your vet. You should also get your cat dewormed every three months.

 Breathe in through your nose for two seconds and purse your lips like you are about to blow out a candle. Breathe out slowly through your pursed lips. You should exhale for two or three times longer than you inhaled.This technique slows down your breathing and keeps your airways open for longer.
 Relax your shoulders and place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly. Breathe in through your nose for two seconds. You should feel your belly rising as you inhale. Gently press your belly as you exhale. Pushing puts pressure on your diaphragm and helps you get air out.Your diaphragm does not work as well when you have COPD.
This technique is more difficult than pursed-lip breathing. Get help from a respiratory therapist or physical therapist when using this technique.
 Any time you feel short of breath, stop what you are doing. Sit down, relax your shoulders, and start doing pursed-lip breathing until you can catch your breath. You can resume your activity once you catch your breath.Continue doing pursed-lip breathing when you resume your activities.

 Many countries size shoes and clothing differently than others. Ask a store clerk what sizes are small, medium or large, to get a good idea what sizes will fit you.
 Unless you are certain something will fit you, or you are buying underwear, make sure you can try it on. Travel clothing needs to breathe and move easily, or it is not worth the purchase.
 You cannot adequately try on most street vendor clothing. There is a good chance it is not well made, if it is being sold for an extremely cheap price.
 Guide books should be able to tell you what the appropriate bartering customs are.
 Cotton is breathable, but easily wrinkled, so it should go under your clothing. Synthetic fabrics are usually wrinkle resistant and flexible.
 Travel can be very tough on clothes, because you are moving more than usual. Buy a shirt or pair of pants as your other pants wear out, or get too dirty to clean in a hotel room.
 Buying clothes while traveling means that you don't have to pack for contingencies.

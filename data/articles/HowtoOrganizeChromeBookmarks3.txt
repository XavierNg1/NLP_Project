 When you download the Chrome app for your phone you will be prompted to log in to your Google or Gmail account. If you do, all of your bookmarks will be transferred to your phone from your computer under a folder labeled “Desktop Bookmarks.”


Logging into Gmail should automatically link the accounts.
If you need to log into Google still, type “Log in to Google” into the search bar and follow the onscreen instructions.
 This brings up your settings and lets you access your bookmarks.
 At the top of the menu are four symbols, a square with an arrow, a star, a refresh circle, and the vertical dots. Click on the star to save the current page as a bookmark.
 This brings up a series of folders for your bookmarks. There should be at least two, Mobile Bookmarks and Desktop Bookmarks. Mobile Bookmarks collects everything you’ve saved on your phone, and Desktop collects everything you saved on your computer. Click on a folder to see your saved links.
 Click the small pen in the right corner and you’ll see an “x” appear above each bookmark. From here you can use your finger to click and drag bookmarks into folders to organize them.
 Place your finger on the bookmark and hold it there for 1-2 seconds. A small menu will pop up allowing you to edit or delete the bookmark, open it, or open it in an incognito browser.


Click anywhere to above the menu to cancel.

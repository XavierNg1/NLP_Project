 Find a soft grassy hill to begin creating your own water slide. The best location is a hill with plenty of flat space to get a running start at the top, as well as more flat space to slow down at the bottom.


Use measuring tape and help from a friend to determine how long the space is that you’ll be using. This will help you to buy the right length of plastic for the slide.
Note that the steeper the hill is, the more material you will need to extend past the hill, where sliders can slow down on a flat surface.
Note that you will also need the slide to be positioned somewhere close enough for access to a garden hose.;
, Based on your measurements, buy a length of heavy plastic sheeting for your slide. Opt for a width of about 6 feet for a good amount of sliding area, and plastic thickness of 6 millimeters for the most durability.Look or ask for plastic sheeting at a hardware store. You can use a heavy-duty contractor drop cloth, a long tarp, or other plastic sheeting available.
It’s best to buy clear or light-colored plastic, as black will absorb more heat and become very hot in the sun.
 Spread out your plastic sheeting over your grassy hill. Get assistance from friends or family to help unroll or unfold and adjust the plastic.


Use sandbags or other heavy objects on the corners or sides of your plastic to help hold it in place, especially if it is windy.
Remember to position your plastic so that there is a flat portion of the slide at the bottom of the hill you set up on. Otherwise, sliders will come to an abrupt and painful stop on the grass after building up speed from sliding on the hill.

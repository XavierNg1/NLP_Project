 Measure out a quarter of your beans and place them into the blender pitcher. Set your blender to the grind or low setting. Put on the lid and pulse the beans in two-second pulses for about 10 seconds. Add the next quarter of beans and repeat. Continue until you have the right quantity of coffee and the right consistency, about a minute.When you're done grinding, wash the blender thoroughly to remove the coffee aroma.
A blender is ideal for grinding coffee in a pinch, but you wonâ€™t get a consistent or fine grind. A blender is great for achieving a coarse grind.
Pulse the beans only in short bursts to prevent the blades from heating up and cooking the beans.;
, Measure your coffee beans and transfer them to the food processor. Grind the beans using five-second pulses for 10 to 20 seconds. Check the consistency of the grind, and continue processing the beans in short spurts until you have the consistency you want.Disassemble and wash the food processor when you're finished, otherwise the coffee smell will linger.
Like a blender, a food processor will only give you a coarse and uneven grind, but the coffee will still be drinkable.
 Place the beans into a tall and narrow container. Insert the blender into the container and cover the top with your hand to prevent the beans from flying out.Blend the beans for 20 to 30 seconds. Check the grind and continue processing in 10-second spurts until you achieve the right grind.


Rinse and wash the immersion blender and container right away to remove the coffee oils and scent.

 Melee, wait half a second, and shoot. AKA two piece.;
,, The less time you are reloading, the more time you have to shoot (RB).


A head shot with sniper is a 1-hitter quitter.
The boom-shot is a devastating weapon, just shoot and watch the blood.
While using melee (the B button) you may get splashed back if you are shot.



The chainsaw is a good weapon, while revving it if you are shot you will recoil, and if someone else is using the chainsaw you can rev it to try to be the last one who revs it is the one who chainsaws the other person. Rev it with the Right Trigger(RT).

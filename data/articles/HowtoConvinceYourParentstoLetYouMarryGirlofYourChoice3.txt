 Unless breaking up is what you want to do, if you ever complain to your family about her personality quirks or actions, they will by nature feel defensive for you and will dislike her. When you bring her up again later in a better mood, they will not have forgotten the injury or emotional wound you had told them about. Until they have established their own solid relationship with her, keep your comments about her positive.
 Parents who have children in inter-cultural relationships (dating outside the culture, tribe, religion, race, economic class, etc.) will already be sensitive to whatever fears they might have about her and the ways she is “ruining” you. Don't feed that bias by bringing her up as an example in your arguments with them.
 Point out common interests or cultural connection—allow them to begin to imagine her as their daughter-in-law by focusing on topics that you know your parents care deeply about and yet also share with your girlfriend.


For example, you could connect her to a hobby one of your parents have: “Did you know, Dad, that she's also into aircraft? She actually studied and got a private license a few years ago.”

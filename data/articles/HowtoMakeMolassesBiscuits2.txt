 Prepare the baking sheet or tray by lining with parchment or baking paper.
 Heat over medium head and stir occasionally to help the butter dissolve.
 Set aside to cool a little.
 Mix well; note that the mixture will be sticky and quite stiff, so stir hard.
 Place onto the baking sheet or tray. Press down flatter with a fork.
 Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden.
 Allow to sit on the baking sheet or tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to finish firming up.

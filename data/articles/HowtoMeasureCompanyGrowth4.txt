 The gross margin is simply the difference between the company's revenue and its cost of goods sold (or cost of services provided). This represents how effectively the company is converting raw materials into finished products. Look for this metric to improve over time as the company streamlines its production process., Net profit, also called net income or simply profit, is the "bottom line" of the company. It measures the company's earnings after all expenses and taxes have been subtracted from revenue. Profits are then used to either pay dividends or are reinvested in the company. Profits, like revenues, are often measured using the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). This allows companies to show their averaged profit growth over time, rather than focusing on individual years.To calculate CAGR for profits, see calculate CAGR.
 Compare staff levels, turnover and performance, and determine whether those areas have shown improvement. Assess whether or not increases in workforce have led to equivalent increases in productivity. This can be applied to any department. For examples, sales productivity is calculated as the company's revenue divided by the number of salespeople., The customer acquisition cost measures how much you have to spend on marketing and sales to earn the business of a new customer. This is found by dividing these costs (sales and marketing) by the number of new customers over a set period of time.


A reduction in this cost is evidence that you are building a recognized brand. It also can show you if you are overspending on sales and marketing (if additional spending in these areas fails to bring a similar increase in new customers).

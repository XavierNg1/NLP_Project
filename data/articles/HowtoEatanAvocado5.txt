 Use one of the methods described in this article to remove the avocado pit and the outer skin.


For avocado soup, you may find it more convenient to merely scoop the avocado flesh from its peel rather than cutting it into cubes or slices first.
 Combine the ingredients in a standard blender or large food processor and blend together until smooth.


Use a medium speed for 1 or 2 minutes. Stir and continue blending, if needed.
If you prefer a more vegan version, you could use coconut milk or soft tofu instead of heavy dairy cream and vegetable broth or water instead of chicken broth.
 Taste the avocado soup. If you would prefer a stronger flavor, you can add more salt or more lime juice.


Add salt 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) at a time.
Add lime juice 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) at a time.
 Transfer the soup into a bowl or dish with a cover. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until the soup becomes cold.


Use a glass or plastic bowl over a metal bowl.






If you do not have a bowl with a cover, cover the top tightly with plastic wrap.
 Pour the soup into espresso cups, custard dishes, or other small bowls and sprinkle with chopped chives. Serve cold.


You could also add a dollop of cream fraiche, sour cream, or mashed avocado.

 Some dent kits will come with a solution for cleaning. However, it's usually just isopropyl alcohol. Rub it in to the area to remove any grime. You're going to be using glue for this method, so the glue has to stick. Finishes and grime will let the glue peel right off.Cleaning it may remove the finish, so you may want to save this method for a last resort.
 You can find these online, at big box stores, or auto parts stores. These tools have small suction cups that you glue on to the dent with a hot glue gun., Heat up your hot glue gun. Pick a suction cup that is a bit bigger than the dent. Add a dab of glue to the cup, and place it on the dent.You can use any hot glue gun for this step, though a high temp gun may work better.
 The suction cup will have a screw coming off the back of it. A bar goes over it, and it has two plates on each side. Once the bar is on, add the knob that screws into the back of the suction cup. Screw it lightly into place. Don't push down too hard right now. Everything's not quite in place., Most of these tools have a way to adjust the two plates that give you leverage for pulling. Put them as close to the middle suction cup as possible. That will keep it from pulling up the metal too much on the outer edges., Now that everything's in place, all you have to do is keep screwing in the knob in the center. This process puts pressure on the suction cup, slowly pulling it out. Eventually, the whole piece will pop right off., This method will eventually lessen the ding. Unfortunately, it's not a quick process. So pull up a chair, and get comfy. You may need to repeat the process as many as ten times to make that ding less noticeable., Plan suction without glue will sometimes pull the dent out of your refrigerator. A simple suction tool is a toilet plunger. Place a (clean!) toilet plunger over the dent, and plunge away. If you're lucky, it might pop out.

 Boiling a wooden, clay, or plastic bowl or chillum could result in deformation or discoloration. Be sure that your bowl is glass before proceeding with this method.
 If the resin or plant matter on your pipe gets stuck on the pot, it could be hard to remove. Choose a pot that you wouldn't mind losing, just to be safe.



You don't want to risk breaking the pipe or bowl by dropping it into the boiling water and accidentally shattering it.
 Leave for 5 to 10 minutes.
 You don't want the water to get increasingly dirty or resinous. Be sure that the pipe or bowl is secure when you discard the old water.
 Allow to stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat the discarding and refilling process as necessary, one or two more times.

Always handle the pipe itself with caution, especially after it has come from boiling water. Glass conducts heat very well, meaning that it's likely to be very hot.
Be careful when you discard old water and refill the pot. To stay on the safe side, temporarily remove the pipe or bowl with tongs and then place it back in the pot when the water has been changed.

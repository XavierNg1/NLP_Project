 For dogs and other pets that can be bathed safely, you will need Dawn dish detergent. Using Dawn is recommended because it works best for killing the fleas where other brands may not, and it's the safest for your pet.;
, Next the only thing you need to do is prepare the warm (not hot!) bath for your pet. Just run enough water, then put him or her in the tub or use a water hose outdoors, if needed.
 Use a removable shower head, cup, or a water hose/spigot to fully soak the pet in water being cautious not to get in the eyes as it may irritate.
 Lather the pet with plenty of the Dawn dish detergent. You will need to spend several minutes scrubbing him or her, more depending on the severity of the fleas. Be gentle while scrubbing but you will need to scrub well to get to the skin where the fleas will hide. Having a pet brush on hand can be helpful when getting deep in the hair.
 When you start to see fleas fall off into the tub, you will need to rinse the pet to get rid of the dead fleas and get to the live ones. Basically, you should rinse and repeat just as you would if you were washing oil out of your own hair.
 Scrub until you see no fleas in the tub when you rinse. This can take a few minutes.
 Keep in mind that fleas will run to the head and face to hide. This means you will probably have to add a tiny drop of detergent and rinse. You can pick them off the face as you see them so you don't get soap and water in the eyes.

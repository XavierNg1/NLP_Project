 Homeless shelters and soup kitchens need lots of help. This can mean doing anything from clerical work like filing papers and answering phones to dealing directly with the children at the shelter. Whether you’re washing dishes, folding clothes, or serving a meal, donating your time at a shelter will positively impact the lives of homeless youth, and enrich your life as well.


Working with homeless children directly usually requires that you be at least 18 years of age and pass a background check. If you’re planning on volunteering at a homeless shelter, be prepared to meet these criteria.
 If you have any legal, secretarial, medical, counseling, plumbing, carpentry, or other occupational skills, put them to use for a shelter or soup kitchen. Volunteer your services at your local shelter or offer to train others.
 Invite a friend or colleague to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter or ask them to participate in a food or clothing drive. They may soon find they have as much of a passion for helping homeless youth as you do!


When recruiting others to donate their time or resources, be respectful of their boundaries. Not everyone is comfortable spending long periods of time at shelters or offering up their professional skills, so don’t demand that they do so right away.

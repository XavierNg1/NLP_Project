 Stir them together with a whisk. Don't worry if the Nutella doesn't dissolve right away.

Use more heavy cream for a thinner sauce, and less heavy cream for a thicker one.;
, As the sauce warms, the Nutella will blend with the heavy cream. It is ready when the color is even and the texture is smooth., Once it reaches room temperature, you can pour it into a jar or container, and store it in the fridge. You can also pour it into a mini pitcher used for pouring sauces and cream., Pour it over your pancakes instead of syrup. You can also use it on top of other breakfast foods, such as toast or waffles. Pair it with strawberries or strawberry jam for the ultimate treat!


Store the sauce in the fridge and use it within 7 days.

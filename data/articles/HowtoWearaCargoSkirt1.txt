Knee-length skirts are universally flattering.
In general, shorter skirts flatter short women who want to make their legs look longer, while longer skirts flatter tall women who may feel self-conscious about their height.
If you have wide thighs and hips, you may want to avoid mini-skirts that end right above the widest part of your leg, since these may make your thighs look larger.;
, Some skirts have deep pockets that you can get a lot of use out of, but other skirts only have pockets that are there for decoration. If you want a cargo skirt for the extra pocket space, gravitate toward styles that are knee-length or longer, since these generally have more practical pockets.
 Most cargo skirts are fairly casual, but some are made from nicer materials and often work with nicer outfits.
 Cargo skirts tend to be stiff and do not often flow well off of the wearer’s curves. As a result, loose, formless tops may end up making you look boxy when pair with a stiff cargo skirt.
 In some sense, a cargo skirt’s pockets are already an embellishment. Adding too many additional accessories may make your look seem cluttered.

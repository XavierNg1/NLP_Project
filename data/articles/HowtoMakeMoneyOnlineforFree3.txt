 It's always best to play to your passions—for example, if you're a wine aficionado, you could start a wine blog and become the next Robert Parker while supporting yourself selling ads on your blog.


Just as in the world of brick-and-mortar, there are entry-level jobs and high-paying careers. You may need to start at entry level and work your way up, or you might be able to start at the top. But don't expect to start at the top unless you've already got a lot of expertise and recognition in your field.
 You may not have the expertise or recognition you need—right now—but if you think ahead, and think big, there's no reason not to get started now, and start building for the future. Here are some online careers that have a lot of traction now, and will likely continue to be career-worthy for some time to come.


Home-based physicians and radiologists. Part of a growing field loosely defined as "telehealth," medical professionals are finding life outside the office is rewarding, both monetarily and in flexibility. Other jobs in this field include registered nurses and medical transcriptionists.
Software engineers. This is one of the original "work at home" professions, and comprises software engineers, computer scientists, system administrators, technical support, database programmers, UX designers, and more.
Creative arts. This broad category includes authors, bloggers, graphics designers, PR specialists, social media experts, and the ever-popular web designer.
 Whatever online career you undertake, there will be successes and failures. Accept this, but do not become complacent.


Learn from your mistakes and use the information you've gathered to change your methods and improve your productivity, quality, or whatever you've found needs attention.
Keep moving forward. As philosophers have long recognized, "perseverance furthers."

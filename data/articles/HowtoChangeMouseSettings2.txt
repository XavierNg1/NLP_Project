, This will open the Mouse settings, where you can adjust various functions of the mouse. The layout will depend on the type of mouse you have connected to your computer.If you have a standard mouse connected, you'll have a single screen for your mouse settings. You can use the sliders to adjust how fast the pointer moves (Tracking), how fast you need to double-click, and the scrolling speed for the wheel.
You can assign functions to each of the mouse buttons. To enable right-clicking, assign the right mouse button to "Secondary Button".
 If you have a Magic Mouse, you'll have two screens when you open the Mouse menu in System Preferences: "Point & Click" and "More Gestures". The "Point & Click" menu allows you to set the secondary click (right-click) function, enable smart zooming, and change the pointer speed (Tracking).
The "More Gestures" allows you to set swipe gestures for your mouse. You can enable swiping between pages, swiping to switch active applications, and opening Mission Control.
 Like the Magic Mouse settings, you'll see a "Point & Click" section and a "More Gestures" section. There will also be a "Scroll & Zoom" section, which handles how the trackpad tracks your fingers to scroll and zoom content.


Enabling natural scroll direction will move the content around in the direction you move your fingers, not just up and down and left and right.
Enabling zooming in and out will allow you to pinch your trackpad like you would an iOS screen.
Smart zooming will automatically zoom into the content you double-tap on.
Enabling rotation allow you to twist two fingers to rotate content.

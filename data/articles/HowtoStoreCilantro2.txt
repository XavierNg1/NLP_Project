 Rinse fresh sprigs of cilantro under cool, running water. Drain the herbs and pat them dry with clean paper towels.


You can drain the cilantro by letting it sit inside a colander for a few minutes or by laying down several layers of clean paper towels and spreading the cilantro out on the paper towels until the excess water naturally drips away.
The cilantro should be fairly dry if you plan to use this method, so you should pat the sprigs dry using paper towels. Do not rub the sprigs dry since doing so can damage the leaves.
 You can freeze whole sprigs of cilantro, but if you want to make the cilantro easier to use after thawing it, you can use a sharp knife to trim the leaves from the stalks.


Alternatively, you could also snip the leaves off using clean kitchen scissors.






The advantageous part of removing the leaves is that you can measure out portions of frozen cilantro more easily when it comes time to thaw and use the herb.
 Lay the cilantro out in a single layer on the baking sheet, making sure that the sprigs or leaves do not touch or overlap much.


If the cilantro overlaps into multiple layers, these layers will stick together, making it harder to separate them when you need to thaw them out.
 Place the baking sheet until the leaves or sprigs are frozen solid.


By tray-freezing the cilantro first, you will freeze each leaf or sprig individually. If you were to freeze the sprigs or leaves in a bunch, the cilantro would stick together in a solid mass.
 Scoop the cilantro into plastic freezer bags. Keep 1/4 cup (60 ml) or otherwise equal amounts of the cilantro in each bag.


Mark each freezer bag with the name of the herb, the date you froze it, and how much the bag contains.
 Keep the cilantro in the freezer for several months this way.


When ready to use, thaw the cilantro on the counter until it drops down to room temperature.

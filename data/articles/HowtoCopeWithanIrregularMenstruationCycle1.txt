 No matter how long, short, or bizarrely timed your periods are, keep track of when they come and go. Use a notebook, an online calendar, or one of the many apps for your phone made for this reason. Periods that seem entirely random might, if you can look back, show some pattern you can use to predict the next one.;
, Since you’re not getting your period every month informing you a baby isn’t on the way, ensure your pregnancy status with other methods. Always practice safe sex, but when in doubt take a pregnancy test four weeks after your last period started. Talk to your gynecologist about the birth control pill or other contraception.


Definitely do NOT use the “timing method” of birth control. This can be a difficult practice to get right for those with regular periods, and with an irregular period your ovulation can be very hard to predict.
 If you don’t know when your period is coming, it’s best always to be ready for it. Make a small survival kit for yourself to keep in your car, your office desk, or your purse. Include panty liners, pads, tampons ranging from light to heavy or your own preferred product, and Ibuprofen or Midol for cramps. Now you’ll be ready for anything!

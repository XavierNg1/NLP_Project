 It's likely that some have already heard of the game, but also also likely that some have not. After you provide the rules, give everyone a chance to think of their "facts".;
, Be sure to be random about the order of your "facts". Also try to recite the facts in the same voice, so you don't give away the lie. Examples:


#1 "My uncle studies beetles and named one after me."
#2 "Over seven summers in high school and college, my father and I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail."
#3 "Two summers ago my family took our vacation to Ohio for a family reunion. There were 237 relatives there.
 The person who gave the facts stays quiet. This step is optional.
 Everyone will know how everyone else has voted.
 They may also explain the circumstances for the other two facts. Everyone else may talk about how they were fooled or figured out which was the lie.
 Give one point to each other player for correctly finding the lie. Scorekeeping is optional.

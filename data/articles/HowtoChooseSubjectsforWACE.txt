 In the English exam, you have to do two unseen analyses, an essay on a text you have studied and a creative writing piece. In the Literature exam, you have to do one unseen analysis and two extended responses on texts you have studied. Apparently they are about the same difficulty, just that they test different things (creativity and ability to analyse a range of texts versus analysing a few texts in depth).;
,, Maths is generally a good choice as many university courses do require at least 2CD maths. 2CD maths gets scaled down quite a lot though, so try to do at least 2CD in Year 11. Chemistry is also a good choice in covering prerequisites though most courses that require chemistry require maths as well.
 As well as being great for travel, your career and even just your everyday life, LOTE also gives you a little boost to your ATAR. Don't let LOTE classes in lower school put you off––by Year 11 and 12 you'll only be in class with people who want to be there, and you will learn at a much better pace so things will be kept interesting.
 If you like maths, doing Maths Specialist is a decent choice as the two courses complement each other well. Ditto with doing a mix of sciences or social sciences. If you aren't totally passionate about any particular field, it might be better to do a mix of subjects so that you don't get sick of doing an overload of maths/science/social sciences day in, day out. Also bear in mind that many Curriculum Council awards require you to do at least two List A and two List B subjects and that there are certain subject combinations that are "banned" (i.e. they can't both count towards your ATAR), like English/Lit and Bio/Human Bio.

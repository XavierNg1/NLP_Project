 Lie down with your arms at your sides with your legs out in front of you. Use a yoga or exercise mat for your comfort.
 Using an exercise or medicine ball can add some extra resistance to your workout and will make it even more challenging. Just place the weight in between your feet, get a firm grip on it, and then begin to lift your legs up until they are perpendicular to the rest of your body. This is the vertical leg lift with an added weight.
 The slower you go, the more you resist gravity and force your muscles to maintain control. This is a great workout for your abdominal muscles, though it can take a bit more effort than regular leg lifts.
 Since these exercises are a bit harder, you should start off by doing fewer of them until you feel ready for more. Then, you can move to doing 3 sets of 10-20 leg lifts with the added weight.
 If you like lifting the ball with your feet, then you can lift up your legs with the ball in them while reaching toward the ball with your arms.









Raise your arms and legs up at the same time, so you can grab the ball in your hands and then move it all the way up behind your head. Then, lift your arms and legs up in the same way again, and shift the weight between your arms and your legs.
Move the weight down to the floor with your feet and raise them up again to transfer the weight to your arms once more. This advanced leg lift is certain to get your abs -- and your arms -- burning.

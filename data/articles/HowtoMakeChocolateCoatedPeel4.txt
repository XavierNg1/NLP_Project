 Alternatively, roll out a silicone mat over the baking sheet.
 It is ready for dipping when it is just warm and has slightly thickened.
 Dip one strip at a time:


Dip into the chocolate while holding the end in the tips of a finger and thumb. Dip right in (you'll get chocolate on your fingers, it's a small sacrifice).
Lift the peel up slightly. Allow surplus chocolate to drip back into the bowl.
 Repeat with each peel strip until all have been dipped. When aligning them on the sheet, keep them separate from each other and not touching.
 The peel will firm up as it dries.


If it's really hot in your kitchen, place in the refrigerator to set.

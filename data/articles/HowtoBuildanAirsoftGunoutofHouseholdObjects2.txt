 By blowgun, we mean one that attaches to an air compressor -- not a blowgun you would use to throw poison darts into your nearest enemy. Screw the adapter in until it's sturdy and tight.


The nozzle of the blowgun (where it would connect to the tube of an air compressor) will twist out counterclockwise.
 It should be about 1" (2.5 cm) below the bulge in the top of the bottle. It should also match the size of the nozzle of the blowgun that you just threaded out.


If you refer the method above, you'll see that a regular pen requires a 5/16" drill bit. Your nozzle is probably just a bit bigger than that.
 This is the trickiest part:


Put the nozzle into the bottle.
With a metal file or other similar, long, thin object, pick up the nozzle.
Place it snugly into the drilled hole, threaded part sticking out.
 Keep the metal file supporting the nozzle so the weight of the blowgun doesn't dislodge it. Be patient as you thread the blowgun onto the nozzle.


Once it's tightened, the blowgun should be sturdy and unmoving. At this point, the soda bottle and blowgun base should be as one.
 It needs to match the size of your brake line. It's better to start off a bit smaller and have to make it bigger -- though you could always easily find another bottle cap.
 Pull the line through so the entire tube is through the cap, bolts and nut on the exposed end.


If available, it's wise to seal the drilled hole on the cap with hot glue. This will also hold the line in place, creating a foolproof vacuum.
 About halfway is ideal.
 Make sure everything is sealed up nice and tight and attach the base of the blowgun to your air compressor.


Alternatively, you can also use a backpack air supply to fuel your gun.
 Your gun is ready to start decimating. Just unscrew the barrel to refill with pellets.

 Many dogs and other animals end up injuring themselves with porcupine encounters two or more times. If your pet has been injured by a porcupine once in your area, it is likely to encounter one again and may provoke it again.
 Porcupines live in small, enclosed spaces. Caves, spaces underneath logs, or rockfalls may contain porcupines. Keep your animal leashed when passing by this type of area, or call it back if it goes to investigate these. If someone encountered porcupines near your house, they may be living underneath a deck, in a crawlspace, or in the corner of a shed.A porcupine's den may be easy to discover if you follow the sound of strange barks, grunts, moans, or screams. These sounds are most common during the autumn mating season., Contrary to myth, porcupines are not aggressive and are not able to throw their quills. As long as you back away slowly, the porcupine should not harm you. Look around as you back up to make sure there are no other porcupines around. While they are usually solitary, you may find mothers with young or multiple porcupines sharing a den in the winter., Porcupines typically sleep during the day, so your animals have little risk of encountering them during that time. Keep your animals indoors or in pens during the night. If you want to spot the porcupines yourself to confirm they are on your property, you may need a flashlight or night vision goggles. Stay well away from the suspected den.
 Besides the possibility of injury, porcupines will eat wood and garden plants, causing major damage.Call Wildlife Control or professional pet removers and have them safely remove the porcupines.


Do not attempt to drive the porcupines away yourself, as you could be seriously injured.

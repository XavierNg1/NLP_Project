 Be sure to use the correct amount of water per the cement mix instructions given by your specific mix label. If there is too much water added, the cement mix will come out too thin, become unmanageable, and not dry properly. If there is not enough water, the mix will become too thick, it will not combine thoroughly, and will become unusable.;
,, If you are working in an area that is does not have power outlets nearby, you can use a generator to run your electric equipment or take the green approach and use a solar powered cement mixer. Allow the mixer to continue mixing until all of the powder is thoroughly mixed with the water and there is no cement mix dust left. Leave the cement mixer on as long as necessary to keep the cement moist and manageable. Because the cement mixer's drum is constantly rotating and the mix is continually moving, it will not able to settle and begin drying leaving it pliable.
, Most cement mixers will tip and turn to the appropriate location in order to do this with ease.

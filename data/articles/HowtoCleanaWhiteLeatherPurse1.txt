 If your bag is pretty clean, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe it down weekly. To remove minor dirt, mix a drop or two of mild soap and 8-12 ounces of warm water together. Lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with the solution and wipe the dirt off the leather., After using the mild soap solution, go back over the surface with a dry microfiber cloth to ensure no water is left standing on the leather's surface. Avoid using soggy paper towels for this. Microfiber is the ideal material because it won’t crumble and wicks away moisture quickly., To avoid damaging the leather, always wipe the bag lightly. Wipe in the same direction as the grain of the leather. Use smooth, uniform strokes. Be sure to wipe the parts you touch the most, such as the handles, strap and clasp. These areas are easily soiled by the natural oils on your hands., Some commonly suggested “home remedies” involve using these substances. Don’t use them. The chemicals in these products can damage the surface, dry out the leather and cause grease stain issues.

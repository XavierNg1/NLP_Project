 Your arch will be built using the beach balls as the arch “walls” and the beach balls to secure and ground the arch.


Spring for a pump to blow up all inflatables. This will make the process go faster and avoid you getting lightheaded!






Consider purchasing balls and tubes in a variety of sizes. You may want to start with larger beach balls and tubes toward the base of the arch and then get smaller toward the top.






Use small sized inner tubes to connect beach balls together. Use a large tube to ground the arch, then add the beach ball and then add a small inner tube.
 Although the arch will most likely stand on its own without gluing it together, you are better off with some sort of adhesive material to ensure it doesn’t topple over in the event it is bumped.
 For example if you want to go extravagant you could purchase sand to surround the arch or create a beach towel “red carpet” going through the arch.

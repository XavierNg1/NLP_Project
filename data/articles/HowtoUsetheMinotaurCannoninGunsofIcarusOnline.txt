 The best two types of ammunition for the Minotaur Cannon, are Heavy clip (Use heavy clip to snip enemies at long ranges) and also Greased Rounds (When the enemy is close, you would use greased, as it has more ammo and more damage).;
, For the Minotaur, it is a support weapon meaning that on its own, it isn't very effective. The combinations that the Minotaur is commonly used in is "Hades, Minotaur, Heavy Flak" and "Hades, Minotaur Light Flak". The two best ships for this setup is the Spire and the Galleon.
 You can defend a point in king of the hill by knocking the enemies back, or you can push them out the way and into a rock. You will need to choose one, Deathmatch would normally be Offensive, and King of the hill and crazy king would be Defensive.
 The further away from the ships center of mass, the more spin. If someone is maybe trying to ram you with Kerosene, you would knock them back, which slows them down, and then spin them as when a pilot is using Kerosene it is very hard to steer. Once they are spun then they are heading off target really fast, and if you can time it perfectly you could even ram them into a wall, destroying their hull armour and them shoot them with the Light/Heavy Flak to finish them off.

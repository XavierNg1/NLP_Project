 Your dog considers your family to be its pack, and your dog likes to eat with its pack. One way you can make your dog feel more included while not giving into begging is to feed your dog its food while everyone else is eating. Plus, it gives your dog a distraction, at least for a little while., If a standard meal isn't distraction enough, you can try a different kind of distraction, such as a food puzzle toy. These toys make your dog work for its food or treats, which keeps it entertained.If your dog still comes up to the table, you can tether it to a heavy piece of furniture in the same room. Just don't leave your dog alone, as it could cause harm to itself with the tether.
 One way to discourage begging is to put your dog in another part of the house. For instance, you can put your dog behind a baby gate away from the table or put it in another part of the house and close the door.Another option is to put the dog in its crate, if you've crate trained your dog.
 While you can feed your dog the occasional "human food" treat (as long as it's a safe food, like bland chicken), never feed the dog from the table. That teaches your dog that it can expect to be fed in the future from the table, encouraging begging. If you want to feed your dog a bit after dinner, take the food over to its bowl to feed the dog.

These are the apps you’ve given access to your Dropbox. Some of them would be familiar, and some would be relatively unknown.
 Review the apps one by one to determine if you are still using them with your Dropbox.
 Once you confirm that you don’t want a certain app to be linked to your Dropbox anymore, remove it by clicking on the cross mark designated for the app.


Confirm by clicking “Uninstall” on the pop-up dialogue box.
 Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you’ve cleaned out all the unnecessary apps on your Dropbox account.

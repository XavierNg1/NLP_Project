 She likes to wear colorful long-sleeved tops and short-sleeved t-shirts on top of it, or sometimes colorful long sleeved tops with a cami.;
, They're normally black, grey or a light blue. She also wears mini skirts with leggings underneath, and she enjoys dresses. Her dresses are cute and colorful and she normally pairs them up with some leggings, tights and converse for a cool tomboyish look.
 In the first season, she stuck to all types of converse, from high tops to low tops and from orange to black. And in second she wears lots of high boots and keeps her wand in them but sometimes sneakers. But in season 3, she switches to boots and heels. Flats are also good. Try for like a hippie- ish feel.
 Her jewelry, her necklaces are usually long, and the earrings she wears often are hoops.
 In season 2, her hair was always curled and sometimes paired with a cute headband. She also got a chin-length bob later in season 2, which she either straightened or curled.
 No heavy eyeliner, a little on the top, some neutral eye shadow, mascara, a little blush, and some pink lip gloss Just the basics.
 She is never doing anything that involves a lot of effort and always complain about doing work. Alex also gets in trouble every now and then. Don't be a bad girl, just pull a prank or use a spell incorrectly here and there.

 Heavy or painful feeling, redness, swelling or tenderness in one of your legs can be a sign of blood clots. Most commonly, the pain will be in your calf or thigh.


Swelling and discomfort in your legs is common in pregnancy, so it doesn't always mean that there's a serious problem. If you're worried you might have a blood clot, talk to your midwife or GP. Blood clots don’t always have symptoms, so it’s important to understand your personal risk.
 This pain may worsen when you walk. You may feel pain in other related areas due to the lack of oxygen to this region.
 If you suspect a blood clot, check for warm skin at the location of the suspected clot.
 Veins on your legs that look larger and swollen more than usual may be a sign of a blood clot.

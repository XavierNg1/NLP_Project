 You can attach these to just about any spot that a bird might want to perch, such as the roof of a house. Buy spikes at the hardware store or garden centers. Attach according to the manufacturer's instructions.A smoother alternative is to use a “Slinky” toy, available from department and toy stores. Spread it out along the handrail of a balcony, with the coils not more than 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) apart. Wire it (or use duct tape) in place every 8⁄12 inch (1.7 cm). The pigeons hate it because it makes the surface uncomfortable for them to land on.;
, Tie the string from one end to another of the area. Place it about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the perching spot. This will prevent them from being able to balance anywhere, so they cannot roost.
 Sheathing made of metal, plywood, or PVC provides a slippery surface that birds can't roost on. Sheathing products, such as BirdSlide™, consist of three sheaths that form right triangles.The base fits securely into flat roosting areas. The surface is a 40- to 60-degree angle that birds can't perch. Place it on eaves, ledges, window sills, and other flat areas where pigeons roost., Never feed pigeons or allow bird feeders to remain on your property. Pigeons have excellent memories when it comes to food sources. They'll constantly return to places where they have human accomplices.You can bend this rule if you're using pigeon birth control, which relies on the flock mentality and long memories for long-term effectiveness., Food sources for pigeons can include grass seed, berries from pyracantha bushes or olive trees, and dog or cat food left outside. Don't constantly put seed on a lawn if the seed isn’t germinating. Eliminating or controlling their access to the source of food will reduce the number of pigeons.

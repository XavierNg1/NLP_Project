 Start with the original equation h = ha + Hhg., If you have no access to a steam table, hg can be expressed as: hg = 2501 kJ/kg + cpw*T.

You must memorize the value 2501 kJ/kg, which is the specific enthalpy of water vapor at 0°C.
Therefore, to get the specific enthalpy at any temperature, you must add the term cpw*T; where cpw = 1.84 kJ/kg°C, which is the specific heat of water vapor at constant pressure; and T is the temperature of air.
 h = cpa*T + H*(2501 kJ/kg + cpw*T). As you can see, you only need T and H from the problem, and memorize the values of cpa, cpw and 2501 kJ/kg to solve any problem., Find the specific enthalpy of moist air at 25°C with 0.02 kg/kg moisture. If your answer is 76.09 kJ/kg or something very close to that, you got the right answer!

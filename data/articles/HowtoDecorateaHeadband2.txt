 To make corker bows, you will need several lengths of corker ribbon, a selection of 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) wooden dowels, some wooden clothes pegs and a needle and thread.
 To start, secure one end of the corker ribbon at the end of a wooden dowel using a wooden clothes peg. Then start wrapping the corker ribbon tightly around the dowel until you reach the end. Secure with another clothes peg.
 Do this for as many pieces of ribbon as you like, then place the ribbon-wrapped dowels on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil and bake in the over for 25 minutes at 275 °F (135 °C). After 25 minutes, take the dowels out of the oven and leave to cool completely.
 When the ribbons have cooled, remove the clothes pegs and gently unwind the corker ribbon from the dowels. The ribbon should form a tight curl which holds its shape. Cut the corker ribbon into three inch pieces and lay them out in a row.
 Take a threaded needle with the knot tied about three inches from the end. Start threading the pieces of corker ribbon onto the needle. Stack the pieces on the needle, don't push them down onto the thread just yet.
 When all of the pieces have been threaded (or there's no more room on the needle) push the bunch of corker ribbon all the way down the thread, until they are sitting on top of the knot. The bring your needle around the back and run it through the corker pieces a second time.
 Grab the loose thread under the knot and bring it to the top of the bow. Use both ends of the thread to make a tight double knot. This will secure the corker bow.Use a hot glue gun to attach the corker bow to the headband.

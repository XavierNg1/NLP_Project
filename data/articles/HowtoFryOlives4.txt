 Combine in the onion, garlic, ham, parsley, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and cayenne pepper in a food processor. Pulse the mixture by turning the processor on and off in intervals of a few seconds. When the filling pureed, creamy, and smooth, transfer it into a pastry bag with a nozzle small enough to fit into an olive’s cavity., Drain and pat dry the olives if they weren’t jarred in olive oil. Pit them if necessary. Using the pastry bag, stuff each olive with the pureed filling., Cover the bottom of a skillet or saucepan with an inch (2 cm) of peanut or canola oil. While you dredge the olives, heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Dredge the olives in the flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs in that order., Divide the olives into at least 2 batches so you don’t crowd the pan. Fry them for about 30 seconds, or until the coating turns golden brown. Drain the olives on a plate or rack lined with paper towel, then transfer them to a platter and serve hot.

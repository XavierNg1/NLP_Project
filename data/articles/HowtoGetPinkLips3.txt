 Choose the shade of pink lipstick you like best, then try to find a lip liner in a closely matching shade., Trace the edge of your natural lip line with the lip liner, using your fingers to blend the color towards the center of the lips. Pay particular attention to the corners of your lips and your cupid's bow.
 Make sure it doesn't go outside of your lips. If you have a shaky hand, you can use a lip brush for more precise application.
 Take a clean tissue, put it between your lips and press your lips together. This removes any excess lipstick.
 This will seal the lipstick, add shine and keep your lips moisturized.

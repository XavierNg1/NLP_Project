 While you don't need condensed milk to make chocolate biscuit cake, many recipes call for it. Adding condensed milk will give your cake a creamy, fudgy texture and allow it to be sliced more easily.
 Golden syrup is similar to honey and will add a gooey sweetness to your chocolate biscuit cake.


Look for golden syrup in the international section of supermarkets, or even large stores like Walmart.
 There are several ways to get creative with your chocolate biscuit cake. The options are virtually endless. Add nuts, raisins, tiny marshmallows, M&Ms, gummy bears, espresso powder, or anything that sounds good.
 Experiment with white chocolate as a frosting, drizzle, or even a main ingredient. You can also try using semi-sweet or milk chocolate to change up the flavor of your cake.


You can even use chocolate with hazelnut, chili pepper, or salt for an interesting spin on this traditional recipe.
 Cover your cake with frosting and a creative drizzle of chocolate. Don't stop there. Dust the top with a sprinkle of powdered sugar or add a dash of whipped cream. Crumble some biscuit crumbs on top and add some chocolate shavings or chips.
 Change the ratio of the biscuits. The more biscuit crumbs you use, the denser your cake will be. Adjust a number of biscuits based on your own preferences or try different ratios to make the perfect cake.


You can also use different kinds of biscuits. Try ginger flavored biscuits for a unique twist.
 Cut your cake into cubes and arrange on a platter like brownies. Wrap cubes in wax paper and give them to friends, family, or take a tray to a classroom, party, or to work.

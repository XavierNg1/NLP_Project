 Taking notes is more than just writing down what the lecturer says, word-for-word. You will need to position yourself to facilitate your note taking. Sit where you know you can hear and see and be sure to have enough table space to write things down. Sitting away from your friends might help, if you are prone to distraction, or you can sit with your friends if you benefit from collaborating on notes.
 As the lecturer talks, outline what they are saying. Mark in your notes when they start a new topic, then note each sub category as it is addressed. Fill in information and details as you have time. Sample outlines can easily be found on the internet, so that you can get a sense of the format.


Each lecture should have its own page or series of pages. This will help keep you organized. Make sure to date and title the pages so that you can find them more easily later on.
 Write down any terms or concepts which are new or unfamiliar to you. These should be written down separately from the rest of your notes, either on the adjoining page or in a separate notebook.


For notes on the sciences, it may be easier to accompany notes on concepts with small illustrations. Copy images used in the lecture or draw what you imagine from your understanding of the information.
Terms are probably best written down dictionary-style, with the word followed by the definition. Ensuring they are not spread randomly through your notes will make it easier to study them later on.
 A key to taking useful lecture notes is to use or develop a system of shorthand. This is where you write down a few letters or symbols which signify much longer words. Reducing the number of characters you write will help you write faster so that you can keep up with the lecturer and have more time to just listen and absorb.


For example, writing & instead of and or w/ instead of with. You can also use abbreviations, either ones you make up for familiar terms or official abbreviations.

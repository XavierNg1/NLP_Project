 Make a fist with your hand. Release your index finger so that it points straight out. Release your thumb so it points straight upward. This is the basic structure of the one-handed gun.;
, Release your little finger from your fist so that it points straight out. With the opposite hand, grab the rubber band and slide it over your little finger at the first knuckle crease toward the top of the finger. Close your finger back into your fist.
 Using your opposite hand, grab the loose end of the rubber band that hangs under your little finger. Stretch the rubber band over the back of your thumb.
 Stretch the loose end of the rubber band past your thumb and let it rest on the tip of your index finger. Place it right in the middle of your fingertip so it doesn't slip off.
 Aim the gun by pointing your index finger toward where you want the rubber band to go. Don't aim it at a person or anything that could be harmed by a flying rubber band.
 Keep your index finger pointing straight forward and your thumb pointing straight upward. Open your little finger from your fist to allow the rubber band to slip off and fly in the direction youâ€™re pointing at.

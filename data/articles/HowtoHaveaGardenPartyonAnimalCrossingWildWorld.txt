 Purchase some various flowers and trees from Tom Nook's Store, and plant them all around the outside of your home. Choose a wide variety of colors and styles, so that way the outside of your home won't look plain.;
, Flowers can really help to beautify a home. You can make the colors of your flowers match your furniture set, or the theme of the party, or you can just pick them randomly.
 You will need at least 2 chairs, one for each of your guests that will come and one for yourself. Up to four people can be in your town at a time, so at most, you will need 3 chairs. 3 for your guests and 1 for yourself. They don't have to be anything fancy, just something that visitors can sit in.
 You can get a birthday cake, fruit, fish, even bugs if you'd like. You need food to feed your guests.
 You want to be able to dance, so you need to pick out appropriate music for it. Caf√© K.K., DJ K.K., K.K. Jazz, Bubblegum K.K., and Disco K.K. are just a few good ones to play. Choose whichever ones you like the best, and put it in your tape deck.
 Once they have come into your town, the party can begin.

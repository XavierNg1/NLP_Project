 You may notice that your dark circles are more obvious on nights when you get little sleep. That’s because a lack of sleep usually makes your skin paler so the darkness under your eyes stands out more. Make an effort to get enough sleep every night to minimize the look of dark circles.Adults typically need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a night.
Teenagers typically need between 8 and 10 hours of sleep a night.
 Certain foods can cause puffiness and bloating that lead to dark circles under the eyes. It’s best to stay away from overly salty foods, alcohol, and carbonated drinks if you want to get rid of your dark circles.Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can help reduce puffiness and bloating too. Aim for about 8 glasses of water a day.
Certain foods also improve blood flow to the skin, which can help reduce dark circles. Try to incorporate foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as walnuts, salmon, soybeans, and spinach, in your diet., When you lie down at night, fluids can accumulate under your eyes and make the area appear darker. By elevating your head slightly as you sleep, you can keep those fluids from building up. Add an extra pillow to your bed to help prop up your head as you sleep., When you apply eye cream or concealer under your eyes, you probably use your finger. But if you apply too much pressure, you’ll increase the amount of friction, which can cause your skin’s pigmentation to dark. Apply products under your eye with your ring finger because it’s the weakest of your fingers so it will be the most gentle.Using your ring finger can also help reduce fine lines and wrinkles under the eyes because you won’t be tugging on the skin as much.

 Try to avoid bringing up the topic when your mom is busy. If she is busy, she is less likely to listen to and hear what you have to say. Instead, give her a heads up by arranging a time to talk. This way your mom knows that you need to talk to her about something important, and she can give you her full attention.You can say, for example, “Hey mom, I need to talk to you about something important. When would be a good time talk?”
People are usually more open after eating a meal, so bringing up the topic after dinner may work as well.
 If you are uncomfortable asking your mom directly, then you can try suggesting the idea of wearing a bra. Arrange a time to go shopping with your mom. When you are approaching the bra department or store in the mall, ask if you two can go in together to check it out. Once you are in the store, ask your mom, “Do you think it is time for me to wear I bra? I kind of feel like it is time.”As you approach the store you could also say, “Mom can we take a look in the bra section? I kind of think it is time for me to start wearing a bra.”

, If you are afraid that your mom will be harsh or overly critical, or you just cannot get over your embarrassment, then try this strategy. Write a note detailing why you think you need a bra. Give her the note when she is not busy. Tell her to read the note, think about it and come talk to you afterwards.Alternatively, you could write the note and then read it to her out loud while you are alone together; for example, while you are both alone in the car or on a walk.

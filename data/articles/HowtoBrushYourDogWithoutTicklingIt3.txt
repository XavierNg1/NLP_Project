 You may need a detangler, depending on factors like the length of your dog's hair and the amount of time since you last brushed your pet. A thick coat full of mats will not be easy to brush, and it may cause the brush to get caught in your dog's coat.Use a spray-on detangler or grooming mist to loosen mats and soften your dog's coat.
You can buy dog detanglers at most pet stores or through an online retailer.
 There are many different types of brushes available for dog grooming. The type you use for your pet will depend on its coat type and how long your dog's fur is.Short, smooth coats (hounds, retrievers) will need a soft or medium brush. Choose a brush with short bristles that are close together.
Short, wiry coats (terriers) do best with a slicker brush or a firm bristled brush. If using a bristle brush, make sure the bristles are short and close together.
Medium and long "flowing" coats (retrievers, spaniels) need either a wire-pin brush or a bristle brush with soft or medium bristles. If using a bristle brush, make sure the bristles are long and more spaced apart.
Thick outer coats with a soft undercoat (sheepdogs, collies, shepherds) will require the use of a firm bristle or wire-pin brush with long, wide-spaced bristles. Use a slicker for tangles and mats.
 When you brush your dog, you'll be pulling off a lot of loose fur and dander. Depending on how clean you want to keep your home, it may be easier to brush your dog outside. If you choose to groom your dog inside, you may want to put down a matt or some towels to make the cleanup easier.

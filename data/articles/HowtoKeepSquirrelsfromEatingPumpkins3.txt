Owl statues can also be placed along the perimeter of your yard or along fences and railings to keep squirrels away in general.
You could also try another statue made to look like another predator, such as a dog or fox. Just make sure that it is a natural predator a squirrel might recognize.
 Place a motion-activated sprinkler or air blaster next to the pumpkin.


A motion-activated sprinkler will shoot a quick spurt of water at the squirrel when it crosses the path of the sensor.
A motion-activated air blaster will shoot a quick blast of air at the squirrel after the critter steps near the sensor.
Neither mechanism has enough force behind it seriously injure the squirrel, but it should startle most of them away.
 If all else fails, compromise with the enemy by placing a more delectable food source on the other side of the yard, away from the pumpkin.


You could scoop out the pumpkin “guts” or cut up a small sugar pumpkin.
You could also spread out birdseed or nuts on the far side of the yard. Peanut butter smeared onto bread crusts, soda crackers, or apple slices can also work.

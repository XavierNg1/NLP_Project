 It saves you money on gas, parking, and insurance. It’s great for the planet and even better for you. Walking might even be quicker than driving as some people overestimate the time they spend driving.Consider moving closer to your work. The money you save by not having a car can help with the possible increase in rent.
 Nothing ruins a walk like a bad blister. Think of how much money you are saving by not driving and treat yourself!


Have your gait analyzed at a running/walking shoe store to determine which shoe is best for you.They will take the time to find the best shoe and the best fit for you.
Buy a flexible shoe. The shoe must be flexible or you might get shin splints. Twist them to see how much they bend.
Buy a shoe with cushioning. You’ll be grateful to have it after a few miles after work.
 There’s no reason to go the same way every day. Change up your route and what you’re doing as you walk.


Take side streets when you can (never compromise your safety) to see other neighborhoods. Talk to people you see outside. Saying hello is a great way to begin to build community.
Change up your entertainment. Listening to music, books, or radio shows can make a long walk go by in a snap.
Use your walk to think about your goals and ambitions. What do you want for yourself? What do you want for your family? What’s going on at work? Exercise clears your head and you’ll see and feel the results in a matter of weeks.
 Planning ahead makes small problems a snap to deal with!


Put moleskin, bandaids, and antiseptic salve in it.

Keep a couple bucks of extra cash on you in case you need some water or to make a phone call.

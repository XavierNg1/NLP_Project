 If you have a newborn baby, you should invest in a rear-facing infant car seat. These seats are designed to be safer for babies that weigh between 22 and 35 pounds.


When sitting in the seat, the baby's head should be at least 1 centimeter (0.4Â in) away from the side of the seat. If not, the car seat is too small.
Once the baby weighs more than 35 pounds (or their head is less than 1cm away from the edge of the seat) you will need to upgrade to a bigger car seat.;
, Convertible car seats are a good option if you plan on using the car seat over a couple of years. They can be converted from a rear-facing seat for small infants (weighing up to 40 pounds) to a front facing seat for older infants and toddlers (weighing up to 70 pounds).


Keep in mind that it's best to keep the seat in the rear-facing position for as long as possible, as it is the safest option for your child.Your child will need to be moved to a bigger seat when the top of their ears is level with the top edge of the seat.
 These car seats are best for children who are over the age of four and weigh at least 40 pounds. They are front-facing and use the car's regular seatbelts to secure the child.


The child has outgrown their booster seat when the headrest is set to its highest level and the child's shoulders are two inches above the opening of the straps.
Once the child has outgrown this booster seat, they should be able to sit in the car independently, without the use of a seat.
 Sometimes it's possible to get a baby seat that can easily be removed from the car and attached to a baby stroller. This is very convenient, as you won't need to remove the child from one seat and strap him or her into another. These types of baby seats and strollers are usually sold in a set.

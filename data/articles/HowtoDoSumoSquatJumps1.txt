 If you've ever seen a sumo wrestler in action, you'll understand the sort of stance you need for sumo squat jumps. Your feet should be wide apart, further than shoulder width. Point your toes out slightly., For a basic sumo squat, you want to bend your knees to lower your body, pushing your hips back. Make sure your back is straight and your core is engaged. Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor.Ideally, you want to lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor. If you can't go this low, go as low as you can with good form.
Make sure your knees aren't pushing forward over your toes and you're not hunching over.
 Once you've mastered the sumo squat, you're ready to add the jump. Lower into a sumo squat. As you raise up from the squat position, propel yourself upward with explosive force., When you come back down from your jump, focus on landing in the perfect sumo squat position with your shins perpendicular to the floor. It may take some practice for you to get your landing right so that you can complete this exercise with good form., Once you've got a handle on the correct for and can successfully land several sumo squat jumps in a row, set a timer for 20 to 30 seconds and try to do as many sumo squat jumps as you can with good form in that interval.Focus on quality over quantity. It's better to do fewer sumo squat jumps with perfect form than to do many of them very quickly, but with sloppy form or without going through the full range of motion for the exercise.
 If you're able to do sumo squat jumps with good form for a full interval, grab a dumbbell or medicine ball to add some resistance to the exercise and increase the difficulty of this exercise.Start with smaller weights and gradually work your way up to heavier ones.

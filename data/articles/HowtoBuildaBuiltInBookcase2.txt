Remove any base molding from the area in the room where you plan to install the bookshelf.
Dry-fit the bookshelf to make sure all your measurements were precise and correct.


Use a stud finder to locate the studs behind the drywall and mark areas where studs are located.
Drill pilot holes through the back corners of the shelves, into wall studs you located..
Screw through the backboard into the studs.

This will give you the securest attachment to the wall.


Once again, fill all screw holes and cover all screw with wood filler.


Decide whether you would like to wood stain your newly installed bookshelf or prime and paint it, likely depending on your decor in the room you chose to install in.
Sand the surfaces down and wipe with a damp cloth to remove surface dust and debris.
Either apply your stain with a brush (removing excess with a rag) or prime followed by at least two healthy coats of paint
Do the same to your cut and ready-to-be-installed shelves.


Insert the pegs and the adjustable shelves to your desired configuration and satisfaction
Enjoy your handmade, completed, built-in bookshelf!

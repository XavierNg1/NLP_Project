 This is the easiest and least expensive approach. Use corrugated wire loom tubing or plastic spiral wrap, which are available from many office supply and other stores.


Some tubing and wrap may not be strong enough to protect cords from persistent pets. PVC piping is a sturdier option, but is also less flexible.
 These metal or plastic conduits are commonly used to add electrical outlets to the outer surface of solid walls, so many styles are available.


Flat wire channels are also available for running cords across bare floors.
Hide wire channels inside baseboards and crown molding. Products are available with channels pre-installed, or if you're handy you can hollow out the channels yourself., If you have small pets with tiny, sharp teeth, this sleeving, which is available in a variety of materials and colors, can protect your cords. These sleeves are often used to prevent electrical cables from causing interference with other electronic devices, so you're more likely to find it at stores that sell electrical and electronic supplies.
 For example, a garden hose can provide flexibility for snaking wires around furniture while still providing protection for your pets. Also consider making a custom charging station using a cardboard box and a few simple tools. Decorate your cables with beads. Plastic crafting beads can provide colorful and stylish protection.

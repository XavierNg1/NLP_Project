 Dips are most easily performed on parallel bars in a gym. However, you can improvise using a very sturdy chair. Stairs or the edge of a bathtub may also work.Make sure the chair is sturdy and stable. If it breaks or moves while doing this exercise, you may be injured.
Do not attempt this on hardwood floors or other smooth surfaces that might allow the chair to slide easily.
 Sit on the edge of your chair or other support. Place the heel of your palm on either side of your seat, with the fingers curved over the edge. Lower yourself until your arms are at a 90 degree angle, then raise yourself up until your arms are straight again.Dips are a great way to work out the inner chest muscles, which are often under-exercised with pushups.
For beginners, you can actually do dips with your hands on the seat and your legs stretched out in front of you and the backs of your heels touching the floor.When beginning dips, be careful with how far you lower yourself. Slowly increase your range until you can lower your torso to a 90-degree bend in the elbow. The elbow should never bend more than 90 degrees, or else a shoulder injury can occur.
 When normal dips become too easy, you will need to increase the weight and stress of the dips. Wearing a backpack is a simple and easy way to do that, and you'll be able to gradually add weight to the backpack to suit your workout needs.
 You can increase the difficulty of dips by changing the position of your feet. One way to do this is to elevate the feet by placing them on a chair. You can also lift one leg off the ground while doing the dips.

 Pay attention to where exits are located, objects and visual obstructions near you, and the people in your immediate area (or a lack of others entirely).Know where the nearest populated environment is to your current location, in case you feel threatened and need to seek a crowd.
Know where the nearest police or fire station is in areas you normally drive through.
Don’t mistake familiarity for security. Even if you are in a parking lot you often drive through or stop in during the day, do not assume it is also a safe place at night.;
, Whether you are walking down the street or to your car, driving around an unfamiliar place, or jogging in a park, it is always better to be with someone you know than alone.If you must go somewhere alone, leave a note for your family or housemates telling them where you are going and at what time.
If you live alone, text a friend or family member letting them know where you will be and when to expect to hear from you next.
 Walk confidently, looking ahead, like you know exactly where you are heading. Never look lost or unsure of what you are doing or where you are going.Don’t ask random people for directions. Go to a business and ask an employee instead.
Always park near a street lamp in lots. This will keep your car illuminated at night and also will be easier to remember where you parked so you aren’t walking aimlessly around the lot or deck looking for your car.
 Do this as soon as you get into your car. Avoid sitting in a parking lot fiddling with the radio, checking your phone, putting on your seatbelt, or anything else you tend to do before you start driving.Always keep your doors locked while driving, especially in urban areas where there are lots of stoplights and intersections., Many times criminals choose their victims by trying out doorknobs or windows in a neighborhood until they find one that is unlocked.

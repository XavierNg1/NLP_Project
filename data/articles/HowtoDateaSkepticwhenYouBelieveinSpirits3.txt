 Do not try to convince them that they are wrong, and don't let them force you to change your beliefs either. It's okay to let them explore and learn about your spiritual ideals, or for you to look at their point of view, but do not force it on them.
 If they refuse to let you believe what you wish without judgment, be assertive and tell them that you are not willing to change.
 You don't have to be the same to get along. The key to having a relationship with someone who holds different beliefs is not to bring them to your side on the matter, but to love and respect each other despite your differences.

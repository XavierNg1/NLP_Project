 Traditional acne medications that you buy in the drugstore should not be used on your baby, unless the doctor tells you otherwise. Don’t buy an acne face wash with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to use on your baby to try to get rid of the acne.These products can damage your baby’s tender new skin.
 Try to leave the acne alone and just use mild baby soap on your baby’s face. Don’t put any lotion or oil on the affected areas. This can irritate the skin and the acne and make it worse. If your baby has acne, you should choose skin products that are gentle. Look for products made specifically for babies with no fragrances, or designed for sensitive skin.
 Though you may think it will help, you should avoid pinching the acne or popping bumps. This can cause more redness and swelling, along with causing your baby pain. A popped or pinched bump can also turn into a sore and lead to infection and scarring.Even if your baby’s acne gets white pus-filled heads on them, don’t pop them. Leave them alone.

 Do this by moving the mouse or pressing the left, right, up and down arrow keys.
 You can do this by left-clicking it or pressing the game-specific hotkey on your keyboard (i.e., T for Age of Empires 3 and all its expansions, and H for Age of Empires 2 and all its expansions).
 You can do this by clicking the Town Bell button (a rectangular icon with a gold bell on it), which will appear on the Town Center’s command panel when you select the building (in the bottom-left corner of the screen in AoE3 and in the bottom-right corner of the screen in AoE2). You can also press the hotkey B to quickly rink the Town Bell (can work in both AoE 2 and 3).


You can send your villagers back to work by ringing the Town Bell again.
Ringing the Town Bell is a strategy best used when the colony is under attack and will immediately command your villagers to stop working and garrison. You can, however, use it at any time.
Ringing the Town Bell will make your villagers garrison inside the nearest building that has garrisoning ability, not just the Town Center. This includes buildings such as Towers and Castles. If your villagers are too far away from a building that has garrisoning ability, they won’t garrison when you ring the Town Bell. You may have to manually garrison them.

 This is true for anyone learning any language. There is no special level you need to attain before developing fluency.;
,


In linguistics, a construction is a fill-in-the-blank phrase which features the use of a target word or expression.
Ex. 1: Yesterday, I went to the _____ . (bank, store, mall, library, doctor)

The student then says each version out loud to become fluent in this phrasing:
Yesterday, I went to the bank.
Yesterday, I went to the store.
Yesterday, I went to the mall.
Yesterday, I went to the library.
Yesterday, I went to the doctor.


Ex. 2. The suffix “ish” in English denotes the idea of “approximately.” As in, “How old is that kid?” – “I don't know. Fifteen-ish?” To practice it, here's a construction you might make:
The movie started at _____-ish. (six, seven, eight, nine)
Again, the student is to say each version out loud:

The movie started at six-ish.
The movie started at seven-ish.
The movie started at eight-ish.
The movie started at nine-ish.


Ex. 3. The expression, “to make money hand over fist” means, “to make a lot of money.” Here's a construction you might use to practice it:

_______ was making money hand over fist. (Starbucks, Google, The guy selling soft drinks, Bill Gates, Apple) Say the phrase with each target word.


Ex 4. Sometimes the construction will require two blanks, instead of just one. For example: The expression “a rip-off” means, “an unfair deal”. This construction will require filling-in two blanks with two target phrases:
_____ for ______ is a rip-off!

$7 … a cup of coffee
$500 ... the new i-Phone
$25 ... a haircut
$40 ... this T-shirt
$20,000 ... a used Camry



, Construction branching is the process of creating a new construction by adding a word or two to the original target. For example, if this is your original construction:I really like _____ . (pizza, dancing, to travel, this TV show, the Beatles):


A possible construction branch might be created from the first target iteration:

I really like ____ pizza. (mom's, this, their, Antonio's, New York)


Or from the second...

I really like ______ dancing. (ballroom, Latin, hip-hop, square)

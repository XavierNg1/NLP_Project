 Don't fret too much over the color as you can change that later. Don't be afraid to use a flooring that looks a little weird, or that tacky cheap carpet, because you can always change the style later.
 Try adding big windows so sims can see your awesome house from the outside. Make sure to add some windows on the side of the house that is facing the road, or else your house might look a little, odd. There are really no big rules for doors. Double doors leading to the bathroom, with the right atmosphere, it looks fine.
 This is the fun part. Overuse create a style, and your house could look amazing. There is really no specific way to decorate the house, just try to decorate it according to the rest of the house.
 This step is optional, but it is good for remembering your house.

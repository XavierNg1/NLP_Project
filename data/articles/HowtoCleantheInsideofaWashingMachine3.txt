 Leaving wet clothes in the machine, even for a few hours, can lead to mold and mildew growth, which affects the smell of your clothes and the functionality of your machine. Transfer wet clothes to the dryer or clothesline immediately after the cycle is complete.
 Closing the door of your washing machine after a cycle is complete traps in the moisture, creating the perfect environment for mold and mildew growth. To prevent this from happening, simply leave the door open so the remaining water can evaporate.
 If your machine has a soap or softener drawer that gets wet during the washing process, take it out to dry when the cycle is complete. Only replace it in the washer when you're sure that it's thoroughly dry.
 Everyday maintenance helps prevent the washing machine from getting too mildewy, but it's still necessary to give it a deep cleaning about once a month. Use one of the methods outline above to keep your machine smelling fresh and working efficiently for years to come.

 Infantry is usually a good choice, as it gets you into the action. Snipers are alright, but their low rate of fire puts them at a disadvantage in terms of kills. Engineers are good on battlefields with a lot of tanks and turrets, plus their shotgun is quite powerful.;
, Most big vehicles are hard to kill, so use them to make yourself practically invulnerable. Speeders are useless for anything other than getting around due to their low power weapons and low armour. Only use them if you can steer.
 If you get a Jedi hero, make sure you use your force powers and jump attacks. Jump attacks have higher power than normal attacks due to their low rate of fire. Go on rampages to keep your hero meter up. Capturing bases is good for longevity as well. Non-Jedi heroes are generally useless, as they will be crushed by the Jedi heroes. The only exception are the Fetts, who can leave the action and snipe from mid air.
 As the old adage goes, 'practice makes perfect'. This is especially true when you want to get good at using a particular infantry class. Sniping requires practice more than the others.
 Although it may seem pointless, it isn't. Once you reach legendary status with a particular award (usually around 60 medals) you will be permanently granted the reward. This upgrades weapons, keeps your vehicles alive, gives you extra health, everything. With all medals at legendary status you'll be able to waste your friends in online play.

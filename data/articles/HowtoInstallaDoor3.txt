 Brackets leave doors hanging very true. They are easy to install with one person and will could your time installing time in half. Brackets will also allow you to easily adjust the door clearances, should you need to.
 This line must be on the hinge side and in the room the door swings into.









Make sure that the vertical line is both straight and level. A straight line that is not level with the bottom of the floor will leave a door that doesn't swing true.
 Using the 1/2” (1.27 cm) screws provided, install brackets beside each hinge, making sure that they're even with the edge of the door frame.









Getting the brackets right next to the hinges is extremely important. The hinges are the pressure points of the door, and improperly installed brackets that are out of line with the hinges will eventually cause the door to fall out of plumb.
 Start 8” (20 cm) down from the top, and then once again 1” (2.5 cm) above the latch hole, and a final bracket 6" to 8” (15 to 20 cm) up from the bottom of the door. The final bracket, if there is one, is recommended for the top, on doors 30” and wider. The door is now ready to insert in the rough opening.
 Never place the door directly on the bottom of the floor.
, Work your way down the hinge side of the door, starting at the top, and making sure to use the same line for each of the three hinge brackets.
 Take care to make sure they are equal. It's easier to unscrew the drywall screws at this point than after the final screws are already embedded in the drywall.
 Keep the clearance between the frame and door equal as you screw the door to the wall with the drywall screws.
 Most trim will have hollowed out backside, which will both allow the brackets to fit underneath and conceal them. If your trim doesn't have a hollowed out backside, you may need to hammer the brackets into the drywall just a little.

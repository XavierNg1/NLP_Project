 To magnetize metal with this method, you just need a strong magnet and a piece of metal with known iron content. Metals without iron will not become magnetic.


A strong magnet, such as neodymium, can easily be purchased online.;
, Every magnet has two poles, a North and a South pole. The North pole is the negative side, while the South pole is the positive side. Some magnets have the poles labeled directly on them.If your magnet is not labeled you can use a pole identifier magnet. This is a magnet that has the poles labeled on it. Place the identifier near your magnet and see which side attaches. Opposite sides attract, so if the magnet attaches to the South pole of the identifier magnet, that side is the North pole.
 With firm pressure, quickly run the magnet across the piece of metal. The act of rubbing the magnet across the metal helps the iron atoms align in one direction. Repeatedly stroking the metal gives the atoms more opportunity to line up.Repeat the stroke towards the negative pole at least ten times. Ten strokes is just a good number to start with. You can do more or less as long as the metal works to your satisfaction as a magnet.
 Tap the metal against a pile of paperclips or try to stick it to your fridge. If the paperclips stick or it stays on the fridge, the metal has been sufficiently magnetized. If the metal does not become magnetized, keep rubbing the magnet in the same direction across the metal.


If you are magnetizing a screwdriver, put it next to a screw to see if it holds it.
 Make sure you rub the magnet in the same direction every time. After ten strokes, check the magnetism again. Repeat until the magnet is strong enough to pick up the paperclips. If you rub in the opposite direction with the North pole this will actually demagnetize the metal.If the metal still does not maintain magnetization, it might not have a high enough iron content. Try this method again with a metal that has a higher iron content.

 Let it air dry completely or use a blow dryer to get your hair nice and dry.
 Again, even if your hair is long, don't use more than a pea-sized amount at a time. You don't want clumps of wax in your hair.
 Start near the roots and lift your hair as you run your fingers through it to create some height and volume. The wax will hold the volume in place as you go.
 Take a piece at a time and separate it from the rest of your hair, then spread wax over it with your fingers. Twist it gently before dropping it back to your head. Separating out a few pieces this way completes the tousled look.

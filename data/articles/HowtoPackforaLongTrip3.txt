 When working this out, always choose the bare minimum. You do not want to be marring your trip with a bunch of unnecessary stuff that you're constantly worried about losing.
 A smartphone or an iPad can do the work of many gadgets at once, making it easier to take less with you. Attach a keyboard to either and you've got your word processor too, all for a lot less weight than a laptop.
 That way, you carry less and have less cords and chargers to remember to repack each time.
 No more carting heavy piles of books around, and you're always assured of a huge reading list, wherever you are.
 If you have a specific diet or medical condition, you might need some specialized food. Try to choose items that bring the most bang for weight, and find out in advance if you can get your specialist dietary needs wherever you're traveling. Use the internet to help you.

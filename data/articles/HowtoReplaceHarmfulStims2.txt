 If you can fill the need with a stim that doesn't cause harm, you will have no need to use the bad stim anymore.


If you put objects in your mouth for oral stimulation, replace it with gum or candy.
If you rip paper to keep your fingers busy, play with your hair or a favorite stim toy instead.
 Consider your own repertoire of stims, and look for lists of stims on the internet. Once you have a list, try out your new stims and see which ones feel helpful to you.


Keep the list somewhere accessible as you begin learning to redirect the harmful stim.
 For example, transitioning from headbanging to bouncing on an exercise ball may be too difficult. Banging your head into a couch cushion or placing a squishy stress ball in your hand first might be more realistic.


Less harmful stims might be a "stepping stone" to completely harmless stims.
If you relapse, you'll have a less harmful stim to use, rather than the most dramatic one.
 Noticing it is crucial to stopping it.


Ask a friend or family member to tell you when they see you doing it.
Use a physical reminder. Wear a hat if you pick at your forehead, and put on icky-tasting clear nail polish if you bite your nails.
 Congratulate yourself each time you notice what you're doing and redirect the energy into a harmless stim. In time, these conscious decisions will turn into a habit, and you will no longer need to think about it.

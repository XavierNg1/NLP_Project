 When it comes to inspiring your kids to develop healthy habits, it starts with you. Cut back on the amount of time you and your spouse watch TV and your kids won’t think it’s quite so unfair when you ask them to follow suit.It may be wise for both parents to sit down together and decide how much screen time is appropriate for the entire family.
Your "screen time" covers all devices, such as phones, tablets, and computers. Make sure you are reducing your time on all these devices to model healthy habits for your kids.
 It’ll look like you’re cheating if you have access to the TV at all times. If you want to really make things fair and square, remove the TV from all bedrooms, yours included. Screens (including tablets and laptops) should only be available in common areas like the kitchen or family room., For many families, TV is like the soundtrack to their lives. If the TV in your home pretty much never gets turned off, start turning it off once your program is over.


Aim to be more intentional about your TV use. Think about which programs you like the most and watch only those. Press the “Power” button afterwards.
The same goes for tablets and smartphones. Power these devices off when you are having family time or whenever you're not intentionally using them.
 The ultimate goal for most parents is to encourage their children to do more positive activities like hobbies or sports. Be a good role model by following your own guidelines. If you expect each child to get involved in some sort of activity, the parents should do the same.

Think about hobbies you used to enjoy when you were younger. You can try needlepoint, gardening, basketball, or painting.

 Extreme heat, cold, and exposure to sunlight can cause sunscreen to degrade. Because of this, you should refrain from leaving sunscreen in your car when spending time outdoors in the sun.When out in the sun for long periods of time, take your sunscreen along with you in a backpack or beach bag. You’ll need to apply sunscreen throughout the day to sustain its sun-blocking properties., Window ledges and sills are often used as storage locations for personal care items, including sunscreen. However, even storage locations near windows will be exposed to greater amounts of heat and light, which will contribute to sunscreen expiration., Although heat from shower steam should have only a moderate effect on sunscreen, over time this can contribute to quicker expiration. Store your sunscreen in cool, dark places, like hallways closets or cabinets., Even if the odor and texture of the sunscreen are normal, after three years have passed it should be thrown away. If you’re ever in doubt, throw away the old bottle and buy a new one, if possible, or make use of sunscreen alternatives.

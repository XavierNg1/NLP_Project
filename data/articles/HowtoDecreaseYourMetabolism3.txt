 Heat loss is a major energy drain, so dress warmly to slow down your metabolism. When you are cold, your body increases the levels of uncoupling protein in your cells. Uncoupling proteins interfere with ATP production, resulting in heat instead of useful energy from the food that you eat.


Levels of thyroid hormone also rise in this situation. This may serve to initiate the production of uncoupling proteins. Thyroid hormone is "the most significant regulator of basal metabolic rate"representing about one-half of the BMR., Move to the warmest area you can find, or build a shelter if you are outdoors.
 Everything that you do burns calories. Even small things like picking up sticks or skipping rocks. After you have been exercising for a while, your metabolism remains elevated for a period of time, even when you are resting.Every mile that you walk burns 100 calories, and that does not account for the increase in metabolism produced by exercise. Try to sleep if possible.
 Your body will expend energy to warm up the water.This is energy that you could be saving for a more life-critical task, such as hunting for food for surveying for escape routes.

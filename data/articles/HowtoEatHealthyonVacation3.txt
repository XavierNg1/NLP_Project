 Whether dining at a fast-food joint or a dine-in restaurant, look for menu items that are on the lighter side. Opt for grilled meats over fried options, load up on veggies, avoid sugary drinks, and beware of heavy dressings and condiments.Wherever your vacation destination, there will always be both healthy and unhealthy menu options. If you’re visiting Italy, opt for grilled chicken and veggies instead of high-carb pasta. If vacationing in New Orleans, order grilled shrimp or fish instead of a fried platter.
Only order healthy options that appeal to you. Otherwise, you’ll feel like you’re depriving yourself and may overeat later because of it.Customize your meal to fit your healthy lifestyle. Ask your server to prepare or dress your meal in a way that is different from what is listed on the menu. For example, order a bun-less burger if you are cutting carbs, or opt for a marinara sauce instead of an Alfredo sauce if you're counting fat or calories., Avoid fried-foods that are labeled as "tempura" or "battered," like tempura shrimp or beer-battered fish. Opt instead for grilled or broiled meats. Additionally, stay away from high-calorie sides that are listed as "loaded" or "cheesy" such as loaded baked potatoes or cheesy mashed potatoes. Instead, order steamed or sautéed veggies., American restaurants have doubled and even triple sized their portion sizes in the last 20 years.Try ordering a “lunch” portion, sharing an entrée, ordering an appetizer as a meal, or asking to have half of the meal “doggy-bagged”., Vacation can often deter your from drinking your recommended daily water intake. However, water is important to keep your body functioning properly, and it can have the added bonus of keeping you full and satisfied to avoid overeating. Keep water in your hotel room, in your car, and in your backpack or purse so you can stay hydrated.

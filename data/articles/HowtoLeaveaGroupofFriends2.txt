 Do not, for instance, tell your friends that you are moving out of state just to avoid them or leave the group. Instead, be open and honest about why you want or need to leave the group of friends.


If it’s easier for you to express yourself in writing, there’s nothing wrong with sending an email or letter to a group of friends (or the ringleader of a group of friends) explaining your grievances., Sometimes the truth hurts. Try to find a way to be honest and respectful at the same time. For instance, if you’re leaving a group of friends because they no longer share your interests or if you find that they are very boring, try a diplomatic approach by explaining to them that, “I just have a hard time relating to you.” Don’t rub the fact that you’re leaving the group in their faces.


Emphasize your own feelings and point of view, and avoid accusatory “you” statements like, “You are very boring.”
Lies will only lead to more lies. It’s best to be honest about your reasons for leaving a group.
Sometimes vague answers work best, since they can be both honest and respectful. For instance, “I’m busy,” or “I’ve been traveling,” may work as explanations for friends who want to know why you aren’t spending as much time with them., Be firm in your decision to leave the group. Don’t give in to group pressure or bullying.


For instance, if someone tries to get you to remain in the group of friends, say, “I’m sorry, I am very busy.” Or “We've had some great times but I need some time apart from the group right now.”
Be calm and graceful when declining invitations to hang out with the group of friends you wish to leave (or have already left).

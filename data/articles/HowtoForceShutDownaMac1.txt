 Usually a single program is causing your computer to freeze. Force quitting it will prevent damage to your other programs, so it's always good to try this first:


Press and hold ⌘ Command + ⇧ Shift + ⌥ Option + Esc to force quit the current program. (The one with its name displayed in the top left corner.)Alternatively, press ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + Esc to open the Force Quit window. Use ↑ and ↓ to select a program and press ⏎ Return to Force Quit it.
If nothing happens within ten seconds, continue to the next step.;
, Hold down Control + ⌥ Option + ⌘ Command + the power button, all at the same time. This tells your computer to quit all applications and restart.You can press the eject key instead of the power button, if your keyboard has one.
Applications with unsaved changes will prompt you to save your work before you can shut down. Try hitting ⏎ Return if the cursor isn't working.
 This will force the shutdown no matter what, even if an application fails to quit. You will lose unsaved changes, and there is a chance that open applications will be damaged.


If you hold it down for 1.5 seconds, then release, a window will open asking whether you want to shut down. (Press ⏎ Return to confirm.) This is a safer way to shut down, but likely will not work if the previous steps failed.

 One of the first ways most people drink their coffee is with cream and sugar. The amount of each varies from person to person. Add a packet or tablespoon of sugar and the cream of your choice.


A popular cream for coffee is half and half. You could also use regular milk, almond milk or soy milk. Avoid powdered coffee creamers, as they can clump when you add them to coffee.You can also swirl a cinnamon stick in your coffee. This will help reduce the bitterness and make the coffee taste sweeter.Adjust the proportions to your liking.
 Lattes are traditionally an espresso drink with milk. This is a popular drink because of its mellow and sweet flavors. A latte consists of one or two shots of espresso mixed with six to eight ounces of steamed milk.In South American countries a popular variation of this is called Cafe con Leche (coffee with milk). This is also recommended since it's coffee, milk, and sugar steamed together. The outcome is a frothy and delicious beverage.
 Some people are simply not fans of hot drinks. If you want to try a normal cup of cold coffee, order an iced coffee or cold press. Add cream and simple syrup to your liking. Almost anything you order at a coffee shop can be put over ice. Many coffee enthusiasts discourage this because it takes away from the flavor. Do what you have to do!


Ask a barista for a recommendation if you’re curious about trying a drink over ice.
 Coffee, like all other types of drinks and drink combinations, can be served frozen. There are different types of frozen coffee drinks like Starbucks’ Frappuccino. This will appeal especially to the lovers of coffee flavored ice cream. This style is served sweet, with whipped cream on top, and sometimes a flavour of your choice infused into the beverage.There are plenty of variations that smaller coffee shops have made to the Frappuccino.

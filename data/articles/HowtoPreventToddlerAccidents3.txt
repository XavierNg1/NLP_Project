 If you live near a street, consider fencing in the front yard to keep your toddler from wandering into the road. Always observe your toddler very closely near roads or driveways, and be prepared to grab them quickly if they try to dart into the street., Even if your toddler can’t communicate very clearly yet, you can still start talking to them about staying safe around traffic. Make a point of talking about safety every time you cross the street, using simple terms.You can say things like:

“Okay, time to cross the street! Remember, always hold Mama’s hand.”
“Let’s look both ways now. Watch out for cars!”
“We never run into the street.”

, Put your toddler in an age-appropriate car seat in the back seat of the car. Make sure your toddler is strapped in at all times when driving, and activate the child safety locks to keep your toddler from opening the car door.

If you’re not sure what kind of car seat to get, or how to install it properly, talk to a Child Passenger Safety Technician.

 Pendants are fairly dramatic as a piece of jewelry. Due to their length and size, they tend to draw a lot of attention. If you're wearing a pendant, be careful about styling it with accessories. Keep other jewelry and accessories minimal.For example, do not wear big, dangly earrings with a pendant necklace. Instead, opt for small bulb earrings.
You can also wear something like a delicate bracelet, a small ring, or a wristwatch.
 People often double up on the necklaces when wearing pendants. Due to the length of a pendant necklace, it can be easy to wear it with other shorter necklaces. For example, pair a pendant necklace with a choker.However, as pendants can often be flashy, you should choose played down necklaces to pair with them. Go for a solid colored choker, for example, instead of one with a lot of jewels and embellishments.
 If you want a busier look, try pairing one pendant with another. You can wear one long pendant and then add a shorter pendant above it.Stick to somewhat minimalistic pendants for this look to avoid looking too showy.

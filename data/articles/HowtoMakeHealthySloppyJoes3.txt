 Pour 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil into a medium-sized pot. Turn the heat on to medium. Dice 1 small onion, 1 red or yellow sweet pepper, and 2 sticks of celery. Add the vegetables to the hot oil and cook them for 5 minutes. Stir in:1 teaspoon of ground cumin
1 teaspoon of chilli powder

, Continue to cook the mixture over medium heat while you add 1 cup (200g) of French lentils, 3 cups (705 ml) of water, 1 28oz (796ml) can of tomato sauce, 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, and 1 teaspoon of Sriracha sauce.Look for low-sodium or no-salt added tomato salt.
 Turn the heat up to high, so the water begins to lightly bubble. Simmer the mixture with the lid off for 30 minutes. Stir the mixture every once in a while, so the vegetables don't stick to the pan. The lentils should soften completely.If too much water evaporates and the lentils aren't covered, add more water so the lentils are submerged.
 Once the lentils are cooked, add 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. You can scoop the vegan sloppy joe mixture onto 6 whole-wheat or sprouted grain buns and serve them with the following toppings:Relish

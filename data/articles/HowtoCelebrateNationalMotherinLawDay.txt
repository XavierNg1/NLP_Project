 Even if you have a contentious relationship with your mother-in-law, showing a little bit of appreciation to her can do wonders for your marriage.;
, Everyone loves a gift that shows some thoughtfulness. If your mother-in-law has a favorite hobby or has expressed an interest or desire for a new blender, think about surprising her with that blender she’s been pining for.
 If your mother-in-law has everything she needs and wants, you can always give her a nice bouquet of her favorite flowers. If she is an avid gardener, choose a potted plant or some special gardening tools.
 Take her out to her favorite restaurant or invite her over for a family dinner. Be sure to prepare her favorite foods.
 If time is a problem, think about giving her a gift certificate to her favorite spa or to a play she’s been wanting to see. If you opt for a gift certificate, make sure it is for something she will enjoy.
 If possible, think about honoring both mothers-in-law with a big family dinner or outing. Get the kids involved in planning a special day for both their grandmothers.

 Foxes are excellent diggers and can tear or squeeze through relatively small holes. Use one of these flooring designs to protect your animals:Wooden floor: use thick wood and place a layer of hardware cloth underneath it.
Dirt floor: Sink a wall of ½" (1.25cm) or smaller wire mesh or hardware cloth 12 in (30cm) deep around the perimeter. Extend the wall horizontally, 8–12 in (20–30cm) outward, so the fox can't dig underneath it.
 Foxes can chew through chicken wire. Cover it with galvanized steel hardware cloth, or mesh with holes no larger than ½" (1.25cm). Check regularly for holes in the walls and floor, and cover these as well. Secure with construction staples.Even a small hole could be torn to make a larger one, or could be the entry point for a smaller predator.


Also cover any weak points in construction, such as the edge of loose boards.
 Foxes can operate a twist catch and other simple locks. Use bolts instead, with a latch to secure them. Ideally, install two or more locks to protect your animals if one breaks or if someone makes a mistake while locking it., If you're protecting birds, give them a perch at the top of the coop to reach in times of danger. This may not stop a fox indefinitely, but it could give you time to respond to a commotion.

Tor is a communication tool that lets people share information with greater security and privacy than on the open Web.Tor won't provide you a list of deep Web sites, but it will let you access any sites that are encrypted using Tor.
Tor is used for many different things. It makes it easier for whistleblowers to share information anonymously. It also makes it easier for individuals to share illegal information.
 Once you've downloaded the Tor installation file, install it as you would other software on your computer.
 You can user the Tor browser to browse the Web as you normally would. Your browser use will be anonymized through the Tor protocol. When you reach a Website anonymized by Tor, you will be able to access it.


Sites may load more slowly, because you're bouncing your Web requests through the Tor protocol.

 If you plan to introduce a new dog in a not neutral area, make sure it follows basic commands - most importantly, “Come here”, which could be vital if you need to remove your dog from a dangerous situation. Employ the correction and reward method, which involves speaking firmly but never becoming verbally or physically aggressive with your dog.

, Giving a dog ample exercise can prevent destructive behaviour, which often arises when a dog has too much energy. Most breeds of dog require between 30-60 minutes of robust exercise a day. To ensure your dog's best behaviour while being introduced in a non-neutral area, bring it out for exercise shortly before., Dogs are very sensitive and responsive to the emotions of people around them, and often reflect them back in their own behaviour. To ensure that a dog is well-behaved while being introduced, keep your feelings in check and remain calm. Be firm and positive, but refrain from intense emotion that will make your dog anxious or over-excited., Minimize territorial behaviour in your dog before introducing a new dog by using "nothing is free" training. A dog's inclination to mark or defend its territory has likely been reinforced over time by way of unearned treats and a sense of entitlement. To curb this, make your dog obey a command before feeding it any meals or giving it treats or toys to play with, reinforcing your role as a provider and leader.

 Kids love to read rhymes. They’re a fun way for kids to feel as if they’re interacting with the text and also help to develop phonemic awareness. When deciding what words to use in your book, pick ones that will lend themselves easily to rhymes such as cat, hat, mat, rat, sat, pat. , Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat uses a total of just 236 words. Using constraints like word limits can boost your creativity and force you to choose your language carefully. Try giving yourself a word limit of around 200-400 words and challenge yourself to pick simple words that lend themselves easily to repetition and rhyme. , Part of what makes reading Dr. Seuss so entertaining is his use of made up words such as glipputy-glup, schloppity-schlopp, sneetches, and wumbus. Made up words are great for kids because they let them see that language can be fun, silly, and creative. Plus, made up words can often be funnier than real words, which helps kids stay engaged with the text.


For a fun exercise, try making up a word starting with every letter of the alphabet. Arkity-ark, blooble, callywickle – don’t worry about them sounding good, just let loose and write!
Made up words also help children develop awareness of the sounds of different letters. Nonsensical words challenge kids to figure out the phonetics of the word with no prior knowledge of the word’s use in common speech.

 Once you are sure that both you and your co-op buddy have finished the prologue, you both need to match your game settings for the connection to establish.


Do this by going to Options on the main menu. The buttons you need to press to navigate the menu will be shown at the lower right corner of the screen. Use those to enter and exit the menus.
 Do this by selecting “Play Game” and then “Campaign.” Then go to “Chapter Select,” and pick a campaign that you want.
 Take note of these settings, as your partner will have to match them to get the game progress registered on his profile.
 Once you’ve selected, press the “OK” button. There will then be a next screen that lets you set System Settings before beginning a game.
 For Playstation, it will be “Playstation Network,” Xbox is “Xbox Live,” and PC will be “Games for Windows or LAN.”


Under Partner Join, set it to “Allow.” Under Location Settings, set it to “Home Region,” and the rest will be set according to your preferences.
 Select “Start Game” once done setting to go to the waiting lobby.
 This should be done by the person joining your game.
 Match the difficulty your host set earlier on the Join Game menu then select “Custom Match.”


Set the Campaign to match the host.
Set Location Settings to “Home Region,” and match the rest with what the host setup earlier.
To be sure, go ahead and select “Search” to look for the match once all settings are matched. You will then be taken to the lobby, where you will see all the games that match your settings.
 You should see the host’s name under “Online ID.” Choose the session, and press the “Join” button. Once connected, you will then be able to play online co-op with the progress counting on your game.

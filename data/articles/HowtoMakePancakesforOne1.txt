 You can also measure out each ingredient as you go if you wish. We recommend the first choice â€” it makes cleanup easier when you're cooking for one since you can just dump the dirty measuring dishes in the sink as you use them.;
, Add the flour, sugar, and baking powder to a mixing bowl along with a pinch of salt. Stir until uniform.
 Add milk, egg, and melted butter to the bowl. Stir until well-combined. The egg may take some light beating to get yellow streaks of yolk to disappear.
 Set a pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Add a generous knob of butter (about one to two tablespoons). Use a spatula to move the butter around and coat the bottom of the pan. Let it melt completely and heat until frothing.
 You should have about enough batter for three medium-sized pancakes. If your pan is big enough, you can cook multiple pancakes in different parts of the pan at once. For smaller pans, try cooking a single pancake at once.
 After about three minutes, use a spatula to lift up the edges of the pancake. If they come away from the pan easily and have a satisfying golden-brown color, you are ready to flip. If they seem mushy and have a pale yellow color, let them cook a little longer.


To flip a pancake, slide a spatula all the way under and lift it away from the hot pan. With a single turning motion of the wrist, flip the pancake over and let the uncooked side hit the hot pan.
Add a little extra butter to the pan as needed to prevent the pancakes from sticking.
 When the second side of each pancake is finished, transfer it out of the pan and onto a clean plate. You should soon have a stack of roughly three fluffy pancakes. You are ready to flavor your pancakes and enjoy. A few recommended toppings are listed below:


Syrup (plain or maple)
Whipped cream
Chopped fruit
Chocolate sauce
Butter
Honey
Peanut butter
Ice cream
Pinch of cinnamon

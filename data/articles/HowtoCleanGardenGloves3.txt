 After you’ve used your gloves, you’ll want to rinse them as quickly as possible to prevent dirt and debris from getting caked on the rubber. If you’re still outside, just run them under the garden hose. Otherwise, rinse them in your sink with cold water.It’s usually easiest to rinse your gloves when you’re still wearing them, which is why it’s convenient to use the garden hose after you’ve finished your work.
 Even after rinsing your gloves, the rubber may still be dirty. To remove any lingering soil and debris, use a basic dish washing liquid to clean them. Apply the detergent to the palm of the glove and carefully work it all over the rubber to get it clean. Use cold water again to rinse.If your rubber gardening gloves have stubborn stains or dirty spots, use a cleaning brush to scrub at those areas.
 It’s important to ensure that your rubber gloves dry completely because they can grow mildew easily. However, you can’t place rubber in a dryer, so you’ll need to leave them to air dry. You can hang them with clothespins to dry, or set them on out on a table or counter to dry flat.Even after cleaning, make sure to store your rubber gardening gloves in a dry location so they don’t mildew.

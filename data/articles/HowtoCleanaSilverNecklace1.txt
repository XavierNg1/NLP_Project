 A microfiber cloth or a jewelry-polishing cloth are ideal for polishing your necklace. These cloths won't scratch your jewelry like paper towels or even tissues can. You want something soft and lint-free for polishing.If you need to get into small areas, try a cotton swab.;
, If your silver necklace is only mildly tarnished, you can start by using a bit of dish soap. In a cup of warm water, add a few drops of the soap. Stir it up, then wet your cloth with the solution to start polishing your necklace., You may think the ideal polishing motion is circular. However, that can actually scratch up your silver. A better idea is to rub back and forth, making sure to go along the grain of the metal, which is less likely to scratch it.With the chain, you may need to gently rub it between two fingers, using the cloth.
Continue to move to clean sections of the cloth, so you're not adding tarnish back on to the necklace.
You can also use a clean soft-bristled toothbrush for detailed areas, though try not to brush too hard.
 In some cases, the person who made the necklace may have let certain parts of the jewelry darken to highlight details. If you have a piece like that, you need to avoid polishing those areas so you don't lose some of the beauty of your piece.

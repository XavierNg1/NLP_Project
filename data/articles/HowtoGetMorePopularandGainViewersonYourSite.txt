 They are great ways to make a free website/blog. You can also get a domain name for a reasonable price. When you make a blog do it on a site you trust.;
, Make it represent what your website is all about. Kind of like when you choose an image for a wikiHow article it represents what your "how to" is about.
 Examples of domain names are .com and .org.
 Good ways to do this are to post it on your Facebook wall or tweet information about your blog to friends. Paying for a Google ad helps gain website popularity.
 You don't know how easily websites you made can be abandoned or forgotten about! Continuing to make new blogs or websites won't get you anywhere.

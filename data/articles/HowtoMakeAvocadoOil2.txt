 Slice the avocados in half around the pit, then do a scooping motion with the knife to separate the two halves of the avocados. Use a spoon to scoop out the fruit of the avocados and set it aside. Dispose of the pit.You can use the fruit of the avocados in guacamole or other recipes!

, Take the avocado skins that you just separated and stack them on top of each other. Then place the stack of avocado skins in an orange press.An orange press is designed to juice oranges and other citrus fruits, but it also does a good job of pressing the oil out of avocado skins.
 Pull down the lever of the orange press until the mallet of the press touches the avocado skins. Then pull down on the lever with as much force as you can. The mallet will press the avocado skins together and squeeze out the oil.The avocado oil should fall into the reservoir under the press.
Consult the instructions on your orange press if you arenâ€™t sure how it works.
 Press the avocado skins several times to extract all the oil. If not all the surface of the skins is being pressed, reposition the skins so that you can press the un-pressed areas., Take the reservoir out from the bottom of the press. You may see bits of avocado fruit or skin floating in the oil. If you see anything aside from the oil in the reservoir, strain the oil by placing a coffee filter inside a fine strainer, then resting the strainer inside a bowl pouring the oil through the strainer into the bowl.The coffee filter will catch any chunks of avocado that may have gotten into the reservoir.
 Keep the strainer over the bowl overnight. This allows the oil that may be sticking to the avocado pieces to slowly filter into the bowl. After it has finished filtering, pour the avocado oil into a small bottle and seal it.

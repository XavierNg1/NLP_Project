 If you have a lot of files that need to be converted from JPG to PNG (or any other image format), downloading a conversion program will save you the most time and busywork. These programs also have the benefit of keeping your files local, so that you don't have to upload them to another server for conversion.


One of the most popular batch conversion programs is Bulk Image Converter, an open-source program available for free from SourceForge. Another popular program is Imagicon, but it is ad-supported.
 Bulk Image Converter loads entire directories for the conversion process. Place the directory somewhere easy to navigate to, such as on the root of your hard drive.
 Load your directory of images into the program. Choose what the original format is. The program will scan for all images of that file type in the directory you selected. Select the format that you want to convert them to (PNG in this case).


You can choose to delete the originals automatically, but this is usually not recommended as errors may occur during the conversion process.
Click the Start button to start the converter. You can watch the progress of the conversion process. in the "Progress" section.
 After the conversion process has been completed, review your images to ensure that the conversion went smoothly. When doing a batch conversion, there is a small chance that errors may occur with certain images. If this is the case, try converting the problem images individually using the first method of this article.

 Avoid using tap water when making a cleaning solution. Tap water often has minerals that can damage the monitor. Instead, use distilled water. Distilled water can be bought at most grocery outlets, or you can make your own.
 The two most popular cleaning agents for homemade solutions are isopropyl alcohol and white vinegar. Choice comes down to personal preference, as both are effective at removing tough grime. Avoid mixing the two though, stick with one or the other.


Do not use any cleaning agent that uses ammonia, such as window cleaners, as this can discolor your monitor.
When using isopropyl alcohol, don’t use more than a 50/50 mix with distilled water. If you’re using vinegar, start with a 50/50 mix and add more vinegar if the solution isn’t strong enough.
Vodka can work as a replacement for isopropyl alcohol.

 Unless you already know the guy you want to dance with and he's led you to the dance floor, you'll have to approach the dance floor on your own first. (If you already have a guy, then you can skip this section). Take a trusted girlfriend or two with you and have a great time dancing, doing your own thing, and going a little crazy.Don't look around like you're desperate for a guy to dance with, even if you've found your target -- instead, let the guys see what a great time you're having and they'll come to you.
Show off your dance moves with your girlfriends. Let the guys see that you can work your body, follow the beat, and have a great time.;
, Once you've found your guy -- and maybe even locked eyes with him from across the room -- you and your girlfriends should start moving closer to him. Make this a natural, gradual move, and wait for him to come closer to you, too. If you lock eyes from across the room for one second and then one inch away from him the next, you won't look cool.


Make your way over to him during the course of a song.
Make sure that your girlfriends follow without crowding the guy.
 At this point, you should lock eyes with the guy, and maybe even give him a cute smile and then look away. Then, move even closer to him and let your body brush up against his, whether you're facing him and touching him with your hands, or turning away form him and occasionally brushing up against him with your desire., Show him what you've got by stepping in front of him so that you lock eyes and know you're going to dance with each other. Spend a minute dancing in front of him, moving to the beat, and then slowly begin to turn so he can start dancing behind you and you can officially begin to grind.

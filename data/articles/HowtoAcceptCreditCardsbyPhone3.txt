 A credit card processing company will require certain information to process credit card purchases without a signature. In most cases, you will need the complete 16-digit credit card number, the name as it appears on the credit card, the expiration date and the billing address associated with the credit card number.Some credit card processing companies will require you to have the 3-digit security code, located on the back of the credit card, for phone transactions.
 Some third-party credit card companies have a call-in number, while others use an online processing center. You may find it more convenient to use online processing. Choose a company that provides 24 hour, seven days a week availability., This may be a verbal or written confirmation. You may need to write down a transaction number for your records.


If you use a third-party provider, you may not have a hardcopy receipt for your records or for the client's. Keep detailed records of the transaction.

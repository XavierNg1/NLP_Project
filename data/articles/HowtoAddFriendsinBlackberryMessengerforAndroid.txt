Invite by Email – BBM will open your phone’s email application and will show you a pre-composed message containing your account details like your PIN. Simply type in your friend’s email address and send the email to invite them.
Invite by SMS – BBM will open your phone’s SMS application and you will have to type in the mobile number of your friend or simply select your phone contacts you wish to receive it.
Invite by NFC – NFC or Near Field Communication is a new technology that allows smartphones to exchange high amounts of data faster. Not all phones have this feature, but most high end phones have this. If you and your friend’s phone has NFC feature, then you can use this method.

, To do this make sure your color swatch is selected as black and click on the paint bucket tool, then click on your layer 2. The image in layer 2 does not show up black on your screen but will change in your layers toolbar.

Then go up to to the Layer menu at the top of your screen and select create clipping mask OR hold down option+command+G.Â tip: notice how layer 1 has become indented in the layers palette with a small arrow pointing down. This is telling us that layer 1 is being clipped by layer 3.
 Select layer 2 and then click on the new layer icon at the bottom of the layer palette.
, To do this, select layer 4 in the layer palette. Then make sure that white is selected as the foreground color(on the left side), then use the same shortcut we did last time to fill the selected area, command+delete.
 To do this, in your layer palette highlight layers 4 and 3. Hold the shift bar down to select both layers.With both selected use the shortcut command+T to rotate the image as you desire. (Hit enter when done rotating.)

, To select all three, again, hold the shift bar down to select more than one layer. With layers 1, 3, and 4 selected hold down command+G to group.
 To do this, select and drag the group down to the new layer icon at the bottom of the layers palette. Notice: group 1 copy.
 This allows us to move the new Polaroid and rotate the image as we please.

 You will need to obtain a fast food dipping sauce container that approximately 2.25 inches x 1.25 inches x 1 inch high. You will also need fun foam (3” x 2”), white card stock paper (10” x 3/16”), acrylic paint, glue, matte sealer, scissors, and a pencil.The fun foam can be any colour as you will be painting it. The paper needs to be card stock as regular paper will ripple when painted. Choose your prefered colour of acrylic paint and a matte sealer as glossy will provide too much shine., Wash the container and dry it completely. Smoothen the lip by trimming any extra plastic. Turn the container upside down and use a pencil to trace the face of the container onto the Fun Foam in order to make the lid. Cut out the lid being mindful not to create any jagged edges. Glue the container’s top to the fun foam.Make sure the glue has completely dried before you trim the edges. Cut the edges to ensure the top is smooth and to avoid any ripples.
 Starting at the short end of the container, wrap the strip of cardstock around the edge and create the lip for the top of the container. Slightly overlap the beginning and end of the cardstock as you continue around the entire edge of the container. Use tweezers or forceps to set the cardstock in place and glue where necessary.Let the glue dry and be mindful to only use a little bit of glue as any excess will create visible drops or marks.
Trim any excess cardstock to create a smooth even line all the way around the container.
 Choose your colour and paint several coats on both the tote and the lid. Dry before applying each coat and aim for at least 3 coats of paint. Once your final coat has dried, apply sealer it give it a plastic finish.Use a fine tipped paint brush or cut an angled piece of foam to apply the paint and sealer. You may also add a label or graphic design to your tote.

 When paper is crumpled, its fibers become damaged and torn. Water can soften these fibers so they lay flat again, reducing the visibility of wrinkles and crease lines.Only use distilled water, as ordinary tap water contains minerals that can make the paper feel crusty or hard.Spray it lightly from at least one foot (0.3 meters) with a spray bottle, or dab gently with a slightly damp towel.



Warning: Water can ruin watercolor, chalk, pastels, and water-soluble inks. If your paper contains these materials, mist extremely lightly on the back side of the paper. Alternatively, press the paper while dry to make it flat, but not remove the wrinkle lines.;
, If the paper is wet, place it between two layers of blotting paper, wool felt, or another materials that absorb water.Paper towels can work, but the textured pattern on the towel may imprint onto the surface of the paper., Place the paper, and absorbent material around it, on a flat, hard surface. Smooth it out with your hands to make sure there are no major folds or crease. Cover the paper completely with a flat, heavy object. A stack of large, heavy books are often used for this purpose.
 The paper should dry into a flat, mostly wrinkle-free surface, but it may take some time to do so. Check on it every day and replace the absorbent material if it feels soaked.


Completely wet paper usually takes three or four days to dry, but a lightly sprayed piece of paper will probably take less than two.

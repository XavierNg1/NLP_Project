 Cut a rectangle around your traced blade to separate it from the main slab. You will need a stiffer hacksaw for thicker steel. This rectangle is what you will grind down to form the profile of the blade.
 Put the rough cut blade into a vise and grind away excess metal. Follow the guidelines to form the profile. Use the grinder to finalize the shape of the blade.
 Gently grind the edge into a slope with the flap wheel. Make sure that the slope does not go past the middle of the blade. Make this slope on each side of the blade. Doing this forms the actual edge of the blade.


Go slowly during this step, as grinding too much can ruin the blade, forcing you to start over.
 Use a drill bit that is the same size as the rivets that you intend to use. Put the holes in the tang. Depending on the size of the blade, you may need a varying number of holes.
 Sand the blade using successively finer grits of sandpaper, up to 220 grit. Be sure to take the time to sand out any scratches. Sand all areas of the blade. This will increase its luster and quality.


Sand in opposite directions each time you change grits.
You can use a file to add ridges to the inside near the handle. Trace a pattern and file the metal away.

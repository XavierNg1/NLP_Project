 This will begin the Apple Watch setup process.









If you've used an Apple Watch before, you'll be given the option to restore from a previous backup.
 Tap either "Left" or "Right" on your iPhone to select the arm you wear the watch on. This will organize the functions to make them easier to access.









Most people will put their watch on their non-dominant hand.
 This isn't required, but you'll need an Apple ID if you want to use features like Apple Pay.
 This is also optional, but again is required for features like Apple Pay. You can setup the passcode on the iPhone during this setup process.


By creating a passcode, you can setup your watch to unlock your iPhone.
 This will install all of the apps that you currently have installed on your iPhone that have Apple Watch versions.


If you tap "Choose Later," only basic information like your mail, messages, and calendar will be synced.
 The time this takes will depend on the number of apps that are being transferred. Keep the iPhone and the Apple Watch next to each other until the sync is complete. You'll hear a chime and the watch will vibrate when the sync is complete.

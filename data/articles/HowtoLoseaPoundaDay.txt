Eat low-calorie foods that fill you up. Your diet should consist primarily of vegetables and lean proteins. Eat lettuce, celery, broccoli, green beans, spinach, and other greens. For protein, eat chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu. Vegetables and proteins fill you up quickly and have very few calories.
Cut out sugar, fat, salt, and most carbohydrates. While a normal diet should contain these things in moderation, you should cut these foods out completely while trying to lose weight quickly.
Don't add salad dressings or cooking sauces to your food, as these are loaded with extra calories. Season your food with pepper, lime, vinegar, or hot sauce.
Cut down on calories by using a cooking spray rather than olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter.

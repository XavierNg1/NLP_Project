 Inviting friends and relatives is one of the complicated tasks that needs to be carried out with core attention. From mailing to in-person invitation, it must be ensured that none is left.The personal concierge takes up the demanding task and promises up-to-the mark performance.
 Besides picking up all the guests from different destinations (home or airport or railway station) to get them to the hotel for them to give a final touch to their appearance (a little blush, lip color & mascara for the ladies and moving tie or galluses to the right place for men) and then dropping them to the venue, concierge service is also extended to drop guests to their choicest destination. You can chose either ordinary taxi services or limousine taxi service for your guests according to your budget.

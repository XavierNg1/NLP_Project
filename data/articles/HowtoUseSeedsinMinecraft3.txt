 Because their menu screens are very similar, the process for using a seed in the Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox One, and PS4 versions of Minecraft is nearly identical. On the start screen, select "Play Game." On the next screen, select "Create New World."



Note: You may notice a few minor discrepancies in these instructions (especially in terms of precise text on buttons) depending on which version of the game you are using. However, they should be more or less correct for all consoles.
 On the world creation screen, select the "More Options" button. Under the "World Options" tab, select the blank text box labeled "Seed for the World Generator." Enter any combination of letters and numbers that you wish. Press start or select "Done" when you're finished.
 Return to the world creation menu (this is the one where you can enter the world's name at the top.) Select the "Create New World" option at the bottom. You will spawn in a new world created from your seed.

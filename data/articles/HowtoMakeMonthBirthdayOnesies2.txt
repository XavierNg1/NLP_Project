 You will create 12 monthly t-shirts for the baby beginning on month one through to month 12.
 You can design a unique template using your graphic design software or go online to find previously created templates.


Use something colorful as your template. Especially if you chose white onesies, youâ€™ll want a pop of color for the t-shirt.

 Under acts such as The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, individuals are protected from discrimination for a mental illness in the workplace. Under these Acts, workplaces are required to provide reasonable accommodations to perform the job for any persons with a disability.Reasonable accommodations may include providing a quiet workplace, reducing hours, or having a job coach.
If you feel you are experiencing discrimination at a workplace, speak up. Know your rights and make sure your employer knows your rights as well.
 Programs like Individual Placement and Support (IPS) helps match people with jobs that explore talent and interests with competitive jobs. IPS helps people with mental illnesses find jobs and maintain employment.Some communities offer services like Clubhouses, which specifically work with individuals with mental illness.
 If you are returning to work after time away, return to work slowly. Understand what options you have and negotiate keeping your well-being in mind. You may not be ready to work full-time initially; instead, gradually build up your hours over several weeks., It’s possible that you may want or need some support at work. Instead of keeping your struggles to yourself, disclose what you feel is necessary or helpful to a manager. Ask a manager to help contribute to your productivity and well-being at work.You may wish to say, “What’s happening outside of work is hard to ignore, even when I’m at work. I want to continue excelling at work, yet am finding it difficult. Can you help me come up with some solutions?”

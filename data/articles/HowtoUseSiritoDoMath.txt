 It's the round button at the bottom of your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch's casing.

, For example, if you want to solve 220 divided by 18, you would say "Solve two hundred twenty divided by eighteen."

If you want to include a decimal point in your equation (e.g., "220.9"), you should say "point" (e.g., "two hundred twenty point nine").
 Depending on how complex your question is, this can take anywhere from a second to several seconds.
 For example, you can solve quadratic equations or factorials by telling Siri to solve for the base equation:

For "x2+3xâˆ’4=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-4=0}", you would say "Solve X squared plus three X minus four equals zero."

For "8!{\displaystyle 8!}", you would say "Solve eight factorial."


, For example, you could say "How many prime numbers are between 1 and 100?"

You could also ask Siri to calculate the tip for a meal by saying "What is a 20 percent tip on a $350 meal?", You might ask "How do you find the circumference of a circle?" to find out the equation used to measure circumference, for example.

Asking about complex equations may lead Siri to link you to an online article about the subject.

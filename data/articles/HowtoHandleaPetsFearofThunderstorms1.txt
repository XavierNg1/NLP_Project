 You can do this by putting on the radio or the television at a volume that isn't too loud, but gently drowns out the thunder. You can also distract your dog by playing a game with them, such as fetch, or handing them a chew which will last a while; I would recommend a Kong.;
, If your dog insists on crawling under the table, let it stay there - don't force it to do something it really doesn't want to. Don't confine your dog to certain areas too. Make it feel comfortable and at home. It is bad if your dog feels like you are not paying enough attention to him/her.
 You can do this by purchasing a CD which is a recording of a storm. Play this at a low volume at first. Reward your dog when they show no sign of fear. Slowly increase the volume of the CD and keep rewarding your dog with treats when they show less sign of fear.
 Your vet can prescribe this. But firstly, you must consider your dog's welfare: Is it worth him/her being drowsy and calm? Or should you stick to your dog being frightened and potentially putting itself or others at risk?

, This will only upset and confuse it even more.
 For example: making it stay in the garden throughout the storm - this is just cruel!

, Through a dog's eyes, when it gets scared of thunder and comes to you or hides, you give it attention - the dog likes this and realises that next time when there is thunder, you'll give it a long cuddle. This will only make it's fear worse.

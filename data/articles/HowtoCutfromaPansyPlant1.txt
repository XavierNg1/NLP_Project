 When cutting from any plant, you should try to use a clean, sharp blade. Sharp blades give a cleaner cut that can help to keep your pansy from becoming infected with a plant disease. If you have hard-stemmed pansies, try to use a sturdy gardening tool, such as a pair of gardening shears.


For weak-stemmed pansies, you can use a pair of sharp scissors to make cuts, as the stems of these types of pansies are easier to cut without damaging the plant.

, To cut pansy flowers, make the cut when the flower head is just opening up. Try to cut your flowers early in the morning when possible, as this is when the flowers will be the freshest. To cut the flower:


Use a sharp blade, as described in the previous step, to cut the stem to about a quarter of an inch above the next leaf set, below the leaf set that you are removing with the stem. A leaf set is a pair of leaves growing along a stem. Many people like to keep at least one leaf set on the stem of their cut flower.
 Pick out a short vase to accommodate the pansiesâ€™ short stems. Fill the vase with clean, cold water. Make sure that the vase is about two-thirds full of the water. Place the cut pansy flowers into the vase.


Change the water in the vase every other day to make your cut pansies last as long as possible.
 Because of the pansies short stems, people do not often think of them as vase flowers, even though they do just fine in a vase. While keeping pansies alive in a vase is covered in the previous step, you can also make beautiful centerpieces with the cut flowers. To do this:


Fill a bowl with cold water. Cut the pansy stems off so that you only have the flower heads (or blooms) left. Float the flower heads in the water.






While flower heads tend to wilt faster than regular cut flowers, they will make a very pretty centerpiece for a couple of days.

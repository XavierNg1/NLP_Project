 Tap the Windows key on your keyboard and type in “groove.” A search should automatically start, and the top result should be the Groove Music app you’re looking for. It may be listed as “Music.” Click this to continue.
 In the new redesign of the Groove Music app, there is a new way to access the Settings. In the lower left-hand corner of the app, you should see a gear icon. Click this to open the Settings menu.


Once the Settings menu is open, you should see a heading near the top that says “Music on this PC.” Under this you should see two options in blue, one of which says “Choose where we look for music.”

, These should be listed inside little gray boxes for each one. In the upper right-hand corner of each one, you should see a little X.
 You may be greeted with a new window asking if you would really like to remove the folder you have selected. If you are sure, go ahead and click the “Remove Folder” button in the lower right-hand corner of the window.


Please note that removing a folder from the Groove Music app does not delete the folder from the PC. It only removes the folder from the app.
The Groove Music app requires at least one folder to search for music in. Therefore, you cannot remove all folders that are in this list. There always needs to be one.

 out of a piece of paper. You can find a template online or you can freehand it.Make the body a little on the chubby side so you have room to attach the wings without drawing away from its size.
 Cut out the foam to match the template. This project looks best if you have about 6 or so bats. They need friends!

, Punch two holes on each wing, close to where the wings would attach to the body. Leave a little space around all sides so the holes don't turn into rips. Also punch a hole at the bottom of the body, to attach a string later (around where a tail would be).


The holes just have to be big enough to put a metal brad through. This is how the wings will flap.
 Since there are two holes on each side, use the one that's closest to the wing tip. Place a paper fastener or a brad through the hole and secure loosely (it's best to use a black fastener or color your gold brad).
 That's why you pierced two holes in each bat initially! You'll probably want at least 10 inches (25 cm) of string (or dental floss), so the string is easy to grab.


This is how you'll manipulate the wings. When you hang your bat up, you can just give the string a tug and away he'll go!

, Thread the ribbon through the bottom hole to hang the bat upside down from your wall or ledge. Tie it in a loop and knot. Then, make red eyes with sequins. Googly eyes work, too!

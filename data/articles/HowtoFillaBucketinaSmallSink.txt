 Also find a dustpan; the dustpan must have a curved, hollow and high-sided handle with a hole at the end. This is because it will act like a pipe, to funnel the water to the bucket.
 It must be aligned directly under the dustpan handle.

If you have a stool to place the bucket on, this may make it easier as it will raise the bucket up from the ground, but the lip of the bucket must still come under the sink top, to allow the water to flow in easily.
 Have the handle facing outward, over the bucket., The water will run down from the sink and into the bucket via the hole in the end. Adjust if needed; keep a careful eye on the stream of water to ensure it's not ending up on the floor.

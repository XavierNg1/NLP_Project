 Slip on your one-piece bottoms one foot at a time, and pull the suit up to your waist. Make sure the towel around your waist is secure and covering you while you do this.
 Underneath your towel, your one-piece should be bunched up at your waist. From underneath the towel, pull the top part of the suit up your torso to the bottom of your bust.
 Pull your arms through your shirtsleeves. One at a time, slip your arms through the bathing suit straps and pull them over your shoulders. Then put your arms back through your shirtsleeves.
 While your shirt is still on and the towel is around your waist, adjust your one-piece to make sure the parts are in the correct position. Once everything is positioned correctly, remove your towel from around your waist and take off your shirt.

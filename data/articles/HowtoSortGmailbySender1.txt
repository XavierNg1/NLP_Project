 Log into your Gmail account, if necessary, and navigate to your Inbox. It should be the first screen that appears once you log into your Gmail account.


If you're on another page of your Gmail account, click on the “Inbox” option along the left side panel to return to the Inbox itself.;
, This strategy works best if you want to see all the mail from someone who recently sent a message. Find a message from the sender you wish to sort by. Position your cursor over the sender's name leave it there until a small box appears with options.


This box should state the sender's name and e-mail address. It should also include additional options, including "Add to circles," "Contact info," "Emails," "Invite to chat," and "Email this contact."

, Move your cursor to the “Emails” option and click on it once with your left mouse button. This will bring up all mail sent by the person you are hovering over.The mail you've sent to this person should appear as well. Remember, Gmail doesn't let you sort emails by default, so this is the quickest way to get to all mail from one person.

 If you are still in the process of ordering your invitations and save the date cards, an easy way to add gold is to choose a gold a font. Talk to your printer about what gold ink or gold leaf options are available for your invites.If gold text is expensive, or if you simply want to make a statement using gold lettering, pick an important word or phrase to gild. For example, opt to put the bride and groom’s names in gold, or the phrase “Save the date” on the save the date card.;
, If you’ve already ordered your invitations, you can still add gold to your invitations by placing contact paper on the back. Cut gold contact paper slightly larger than the size of your invitation, place the paper on the back of your invite, and cut the paper down to fit the edges of the invitation.Gold contact paper is readily available at many craft stores, as well as home improvement stores and online.
Make sure to smooth out any air bubbles in the contact paper using a blunt edge like a credit card or business card.
 You can easily pick up gold envelopes from a craft store or paper goods store, often for a reasonable price. You can use gold envelopes for your invitations, save the date cards, and/or return envelopes for your RSVP cards.Check paper stores immediately after wedding season, sometime in late September or early October, as well as after the holidays to find sales and value deals on goods such as envelopes.

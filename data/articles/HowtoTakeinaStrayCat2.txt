 Once you bring the stray cat home, get some supplies. All you need is a food and water bowl, a scratching post and litter box (and litter material).
 Choose a safe, small area that can be closed off. Choose a place that has nothing precarious that could fall on the cat and avoid any rooms with too many hiding spots, or you may never find the cat again.
 The cat will come out and eat it when it is good and ready.
 When your cat gets braver, it will start to associate your voice with good things. In time, the cat will not hide anymore but will likely be curious about you and come forth a little more each time.
 Being a stray, you cannot be sure what your cat has been exposed to in the past, so regular checkups are important.

 Kids and teens need anywhere from 8\ to 10 hours of sleep every night. This likely means that you need to go to bed earlier. During this time in your life, you are undergoing a period of intellectual, emotional, and physical growth. This requires a lot of energy and the extra rest allows you to wake up refreshed and ready to meet a new day!To ensure that you are getting enough sleep, try making a sleep journal to track your sleep.
 This allows your body to find its natural 24-hour circadian rhythm for going to sleep and waking up. This rhythm is based on the amount of light and darkness you experience during the day. It determines when you go to sleep and wake up each day. Consistency will make your sleep more restful.You can still sleep in slightly on the weekends, but try not to adjust your sleep schedule by more than two hours. If you stay up too late or sleep in until noon on weekends, your body will not be able to easily adjust on Monday, making you tired and unproductive., Perhaps you have trouble sleeping because you have a lot on your mind. Deal with your worry and stress before you get into bed by writing a journal. This can be a great way to relax and unwind before bed..


For example, you could write a reflection about the day, jot down creative ideas, or write about how you are feeling.
You can also make a list of everything you need to do the next day so that you will not lose sleep worrying about forgetting anything.
 Rather than playing video games or watching TV right before bed, try engaging in a relaxing activity. This will help you transition into a more relaxed state. Once this behaviour has become habit, your body will associate it with sleep.For example, try an activity that calms you, such as breathing exercises, reading, yoga, or listening to quiet music.
Avoid taking part in overly stimulating activities such as listening to loud music or watching a horror movie.

;
, An effective way of doing this is by grabbing and throwing your opponent offstage with throws that have good knockback, such as Mario's back throw.
 If the meteor smash is an aerial move, jump towards your opponent to intercept them, and then use the meteor smash. If the meteor smash is a ground attack, position yourself close to the edge and then wait until the opponent is close to grabbing the ledge or on the ledge (depending on the range of the meteor smash) and then use it.

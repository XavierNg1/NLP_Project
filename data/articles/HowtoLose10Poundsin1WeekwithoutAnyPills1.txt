 When you set a goal, it's important to know how to go about achieving that goal. Before you start counting calories, know exactly how many you need to stick to in order to lose ten pounds in one week.


One pound is 3,500 calories. You have seven days to lose ten of those.
3,500 x 10 = 35,000 calories to be lost.
35,000 / 7 = 5,000 lost per day.

Note that it is likely physically impossible for you to cut out 5,000 calories per day. That is over 2 times what the average male is recommended to eat in a day. Even a morbidly obese person may not be able to lose that.
Luckily, it's not just diet that controls calories: exercise does as well. In this rapid and intense diet, both are needed. However, this ability will be compromised if you are severely cutting food intake.;
, Being obligated to face what you're eating is going to keep you conscious of what you decide to put into your body. Keep a journal and write down every single thing you eat and drink for this week.


Make yourself accountable. Show your journal at the end of every day to a friend, family member, or trainer. Knowing you have to face another person's judgment might give you the extrinsic motivation you couldn't give yourself. If they're willing, have them keep a daily log of their diet with you.
You don't have to just log your food! Log your exercise, too! That way you'll see your combined efforts and be totally wowed.
 Sometimes its hard to be so strict on ourselves when we're going through something alone. After all, does the world end if you eat that candy bar? No. Grab a friend and let them help you on your quest.


Make every social activity active. Get your family and friends cooking instead of going out. When your community is supporting you and not showering you in temptations, success will come a lot easier.

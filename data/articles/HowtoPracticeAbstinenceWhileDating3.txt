 It will not always be easy to practice abstinence while dating. Take the time to remind yourself why you are practicing abstinence and to encourage yourself to keep it up.Tell yourself, “I’m abstinent for a good reason. Even when it’s hard, I know that I can practice abstinence while I’m dating.”
Make a list of reasons why you are practicing abstinence and keep it somewhere you can see as a reminder.
 It also gives you and your date time to calm down a bit.


Go to the bathroom and splash some water on your face. Look in the mirror and remind yourself that you can be abstinent and you are.
Even just moving a few inches away from your date can give you enough of a break to stop things from going too far.
 Sharing your challenges and successes with a close family member or friend can help you stick to your decision to practice abstinence.They can encourage you when it is difficult and celebrate with you when you handle a situation well.


For example, you could talk to your best friend about how to handle going on a date to see a movie with lots of sex scenes.
Or, you might share with your mom how you dealt with your date’s friends pressuring you guys to have sex.
There may even be support groups in your community for people that are practicing abstinence.
 It will be much easier to practice abstinence while dating if you aren’t under the influence of anything that could impair your judgment. Avoiding drugs and alcohol will make it easier for you to avoid situations that could make it hard for you to remain abstinent.

 You should start with a gentle cleanser. Use a toner afterwards and finally a moisturiser. Do this twice a day.
 Once a week use a facial mask and exfoliate

, Skin means the rest of your body as well. Always exfoliate your skin with a sugar scrub in the shower. Afterwards use a body butter and your skin should feel super soft.
 If it's summer get a nice tan. You can do it the traditional way, lay in the sun, or use a spray tan. NEVER use a tanning bed as it can cause skin cancer. If you do decide to lay in the sun then use a sunscreen with a SPF of at least 30 to protect yourself.

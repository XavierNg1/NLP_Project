 You'll want to keep the makeup look minimal on most of your face. Simply correct any splotches or pimples and use a light foundation to ensure your facial tone is even. Taylor Swift is known for her fresh faced look.
 Pop stars put most of the emphasis on their eyes and mouths, so bright blush can be distracting. If you do want to use a little blush to contour your cheeks, choose a nude or very light shade and apply it lightly.


You'll also want to skip any bronzer, as this can overemphasize your cheeks.
 You have a couple of color options for your lip makeup. Some pop stars favor a simple bold red lipstick, which can make your lips look larger and give them pop. Or you can choose a bubblegum pink lip gloss, which can give your lips a shiny appeal.
 Pick a metallic or rich color to highlight the crease of your eyelids. Avoid completely covering your eyelids with a very bright color; the emphasis should be on large lashes and creative eyeliner. Lorde usually downplays eye shadow in favor of edgy eyeliner.
 Consider using liquid eyeliner in black or another color to create a bold shape. Be sure to go over your upper and lower lash line and create a shape at the end of your eye. Cat eyes are a pop star style which Katy Perry and Lady Gaga have featured.
 Apply at least two coats of mascara to your eyelashes and brush them out. You may also want to apply fake eyelashes in order to really highlight your eyes.
 Don't worry about really styling your brows into a unique shape. Instead, simply use an eyebrow pencil and fill in your brows so that they are uniform. Stick to a minimal arch and instead keep your brows pretty straight. Beyonce always has thick full eyebrows with a subtle arch.

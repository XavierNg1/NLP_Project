 This trick involves large numbers, so a calculator that has plenty of space will come in handy. Tell him that you'll be reading his mind, so he should keep everything on the paper and calculator hidden from you.


This trick also requires some quick thinking on your part. It's nothing harder than addition, but you'll need to be fast and error-free.
 These can be any whole numbers, but they must be consecutive. (There can be no whole numbers between them.)


For example, your volunteer could pick 19, 20, and 21.
If the calculator only has room to display eight digits, the numbers must all be between 1 and 21. If it only has room to display six digits, make it 1 to 9.
 After he finds the answer on the calculator, have him write it down on the piece of paper.


In our example, 19 x 20 x 21 = 7980.
 Next, the person you're "mind reading" secretly picks three more consecutive numbers. He multiplies them together and writes them down next to his first answer.


Let's say he picks 12, 13, 14. He multiplies 12 x 13 x 14 = 2184.
 Now the volunteer multiplies his two answers together and writes down the result.



7980 x 2184 = 17428320.
 Explain that you only have enough power to read one of the digits from his mind. Ask him to pick one secret digit in the number, then write down the other digits after shuffling them in any order.


For example, if he picks 4 as the secret digit, he could shuffle the rest of the digits as 2287013.
 Remind him that he must keep one digit secret. Have him read the other digits slowly and clearly while you add them in your head.


For example, he would read "2... 2... 8... 7... 0... 1... 3." You add these together as he goes, getting a total of 23.
 All of the digits in his answer, including the secret one, will add up to a multiple of 9. Once you know this, there are two ways to find the secret digit. Here they are, using our example:


The non-secret digits add up to 23, and you know the next multiple of 9 is 27. Think 27 - 23 = 4, so the last digit must be 4.
If you're not sure what the next multiple of 9 is, add the digits in your sum and repeat. For example, 23 â†’ 2 + 3 = 5. Now the next multiple of 9 is 9, and 9 - 5 = 4.
 If you add the digits he spoke out loud and you already have a multiple of 9, there are two possibilities. Either the secret digit is 0, or the secret digit is 9. Make a guess at one of them. If you get it wrong, make a joke ("I knew I should have studied harder in telepathy school"), then guess again with the second possibility.
 Any three consecutive numbers includes a multiple of 3, so the product of the trio will also be a multiple of 3. Since you repeat this and multiply the two answers together, you are finding the product of two multiples of three. This product is always a multiple of 9 (since 3 x 3 = 9). All multiples of 9 have the property described above, where all of their digits sum to another multiple of 9.

 Your Boston terrier has a third eyelid that sits on the inner corner of the eye. Normally, you don't pay it much attention since you don't really see it. But, if a gland on the third eyelid pops forward, you'll see a large round red swelling mass (like a cherry) in the inner corner of your dog's eye.The job of the third eye is to travel across the cornea to protect it. The third eye also has a gland that makes tear fluid do lubricate the eye.
 Realize that cherry eye usually doesn't cause your dog any pain. But, if you think your dog is bothered by it or you're unsure whether or not he actually has cherry eye or a different eye problem, see the vet.Veterinarians are unsure what causes cherry eye, but it's thought that the connective tissue around the gland weakens. This can cause the gland to pop forward.
 Surgery is really the only way to remove cherry eye, although it's purely a cosmetic decision. The veterinary surgeon will tuck the gland in the correct position and stitch it in place. Your dog will be under anesthesia and won't feel any pain. Be aware that the gland may pop out again requiring surgery again.If you're unsure about surgery, the vet may offer to try steroid ointments. If these don't work, you may choose the surgery.

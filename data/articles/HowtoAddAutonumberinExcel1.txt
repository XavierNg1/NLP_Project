 This method explains how to make each cell in a column display its corresponding row number.This is a good method to use if rows are frequently added and removed in your worksheet.


To create a basic row of consecutive numbers (or other data, such as days of the week or months of the year), see Filling a Column with Continous Numbers.;
, If the cell is not A1, use the correct cell number.


For example, if you are typing in cell B5, type =ROW(B5) instead.
 The cell will now display its row number. If you typed =ROW(A1), the cell will say 1. If you typed =ROW(B5), the cell will read 5.To start with 1 no matter which row you want to begin your series of numbers, count the number of rows above your current cell, then subtract that number from your formula.
For example, if you entered =ROW(B5) and want the cell to display a 1, edit the formula to say =ROW(B5)-4, as B1 is back 4 rows from B5.,, This box is called the Fill Handle. When the mouse cursor is directly above the Fill Handle, the cursor will change to a crosshair symbol.


If you don’t see the Fill Handle, navigate to File > Options > Advanced and place a check next to “Enable fill handle and cell drag-and-drop.”

, The cells in the column will now display their corresponding row numbers.


If you delete a row included in this series, the cells numbers will automatically correct themselves based on their new row numbers.

 One way to build an acts of kindness habit is to make it real for you. This means you shouldn’t say things just to act kind if you don’t mean them. Instead, be truthful when you speak kind words and perform kind acts.For example, when you tell someone, “Congratulations on the promotion,” don’t feel resentment towards them. Actually feel happy that they got the job. If you tell someone, “Have a nice day,” mean it.
 Your mindset is important when adopting a kindness habit. If you think negative thoughts, you will be sad and down. If you think positive thoughts, you will be more cheerful and more inclined to be kind to people. Try to stay positive, even on bad days.Sometimes, doing something kind for another person can lift your spirits. If you are feeling negative, smile at someone. Compliment someone or tell them you appreciate them. Hold the door for a stranger. These things can help breed positivity.
If you feel negative and getting into a positive mindset seems too difficult, try to lift yourself up to feeling neutral — neither negative nor positive. Try to view things from an objective, slightly removed viewpoint, without emotion or judgement. Once you've reached a place of neutrality, try thinking about the positive things in your life to lift you up even further.
 Part of the basis of an acts of kindness habit is spreading kindness to everyone, not just a certain few people. You may only act kind to people you know or those around you, but this is not a full acts of kindness habit. A acts of kindness habit encompasses everyone.For example, don’t just spread kindness to co-workers you know. Instead, be random and spread kindness to everyone, even those you’re not close with. Be kind to strangers you meet, like your barista and cashier at the grocery store.

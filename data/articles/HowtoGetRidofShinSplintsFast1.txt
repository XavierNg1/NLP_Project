 Stop running or training for a few days. The continuation of your routine will make symptoms worse, so take it as a sign that you need some rest. Shin splints are caused by straining and overworking the muscles and tendons in your legs.
A few days of rest will be necessary to begin to reduce pain and strain.
Avoid straining your legs even during regular activity.;
, Choose ice over heat whenever treating shin splints.Ice will reduce pain and swelling associated with shin splints.
Don't apply ice or cold packs directly to the skin.
Put a towel around ice or ice packs before using.
 These devices help increase circulation in the area and speed recovery.Compression bandages can help to reduce swelling and add additional support to an injured area.
Don't wrap your bandage too tightly. While compression can help reduce swelling, a wrap or bandage that is too tight can cut off circulation to the tissue.
If you feel numbness or tingling in the area below the wrap, loosen it.
 Sit or lay down with your legs above your heart.Try to elevate your shins any time you apply ice.
Any time you are sitting for a longer period, it can help to elevate your shins.
Keeping your shin above your heart, especially while lying down, can help to reduce swelling and inflammation.

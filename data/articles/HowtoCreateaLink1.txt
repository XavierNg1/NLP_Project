 Links are created using a simple HTML tag when editing the code of your website. First, however, you should create the content that will be placed inside the tag. This can be text, an image, or another HTML element, though the example used here is text.;
, Hyperlinks are indicated using a simple tag, closed with the corresponding tag. These tags won't be functional if used without any attributes, but you can add those soon.


For example, your link might currently look like this: Click here to visit my new page.
 The "href" attribute tells the browser where to direct the user once the link is clicked. It is followed by an equals sign, which is followed by the destination web address in quotations.


Continuing with the example above, your link might now look like this: Click here to visit my new page.
Note that if the link's destination is an external website, you must include the entire URL (which likely begins with "http"). If only the page name is specified, as above, the directory of the current page will be used as the parent directory.

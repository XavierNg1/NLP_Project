 Well constructed sentences impart information more clearly than using slang or vague meanings. When you use grammar properly, it is easier for the listener to grasp your meaning without having to struggle.


While slang may be the "in" thing for your clique, family or group, avoid using it with people outside that circle of intimates. Slang rarely travels well.
 Be assertive, not aggressive or manipulative. This means stating clearly and firmly what your needs, interests and preferences are without overriding the interests or needs of the listener. If you are aggressive or manipulative, this places the listener on the defensive and isn't a nice way to engage in a discussion.


Do not directly blame the listener's personal traits. If the listener has done a poor job of something, state how the job was done poorly rather than calling the person sloppy, lazy or thoughtless.

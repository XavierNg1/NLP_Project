 If you're not covering the edges of the wall with painter's tape, you'll want to use an angled brush to cut in along the edges of the ceiling, where the trim meets the wall. Cover the entire corner of the ceiling before working inward.
 You paint while the cut in line is still wet to prevent a clear line from forming between the edge and the center of the ceiling Dip your roller into the paint tray and coat evenly, making sure that excess paint has been driven from the roller.


Using zigzagging lines, cover the ceiling lightly with paint. While zigzagging with your roller, create "W" or "V" shapes without ever removing the roller from the surface of the ceiling.
Never lay too much pressure on your roller, it may cause uneven textures to blot along your ceiling.
 When you're done with a sections, blend it with the previous section. Don't worry too much about creating a uniform look just yet; you'll blend everything together beautifully in the next step.
 This will help even out the paint and create a firm visual appeal. If you've applied a primer coat, you shouldn't need to apply a second coat of paint.
 Contrary to a flat ceiling, vaulted ceilings can be painted like a wall. Start in a corner of the ceiling and work your way down to the wall in straight-lines, with each consecutive line slightly overlapping the one before. Be smooth and consistent with all of your strokes.

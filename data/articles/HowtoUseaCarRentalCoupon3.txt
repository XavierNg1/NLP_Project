 You usually find free day coupons for compact to full size cars, for weekly or weekend rentals. To calculate the value of the free day you would take your base rate (before taxes) and divide it by the number of rental days. This gives you an average daily rate. This amount would be taken off at the end of the rental (taxes and fees are calculated first!).
 When booking online, the value of a money off or free day coupon will not be calculated into your total price. The coupon's value will be taken off by the counter at the end of the rental, assuming you met the terms and conditions for that coupon.

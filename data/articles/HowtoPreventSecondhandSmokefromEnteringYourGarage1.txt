 You will usually find cracks in the corners of the bottom of the garage door when it's closed, as well as a rectangular hole somewhere else along the wall with nothing but wire closing it - that hole is for ventilation, to get "fresh" air from outside.;
, Put one large piece of plywood over it, and nail that right outside of the hole where the wall touches the board. Only do this if the hole faces the direction you think the some is coming from.
 Get some rubber patches and put them in any large gaps in the bottom corners. Staple, melt, glue or even just tape them to the rubber cushion above the gap.
 While this won't remove any of the chemicals or gases found in car exhaust and tobacco smoke or raise the oxygen content, it will certainly make it color and smells will be less noticeable.
 Open it a few minutes before going in the garage, so that it gets some cool air from inside your house.

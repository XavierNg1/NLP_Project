 Pay attention to the light available to you and raise the ISO number as needed. Each camera has different options, so the exact setting will vary. Things that affect the lighting are being indoors or outdoors and how much sun is shining. When shooting at night, a setting of 1600 is good.ISO is important for indoor sports too as the lighting is not always high enough. You won’t need to set the ISO as high as night shoots, but higher than sunny day shoots.
You may need to change the setting at different points during the sports event if the lighting changes. Evening games that go into the night will pose particularly obvious lighting changes.
 Setting your aperture to one of the lowest possible numbers means that it will open wider. This allows more light in, which is helpful for most sports shots. A wide aperture also tends to blur things in the distant background, which sharpens the focus on what you’re shooting.Test this setting before the game starts to see how low you can go and still get quality shots.
 Sports photography seeks to capture quick movements in a still frame, so a faster shutter speed helps you get a crisp shot. 1/500 of a second is fast enough for most sports, but experiment with the highest speed your camera allows. Many cameras have a 1/1000 of a second speed.Remember that the shutter is only open for a fraction of a second, so it can’t let in much light. This is why increased ISO and aperture settings are helpful.
 High speed action means a great shot may pass before your lens in the time it takes to press a button. Burst mode takes 4-6 pictures with each click, so you increase your chance of catching the perfect shot.Keep in mind that this setting means your camera automatically takes extra pictures, so you have to wait until it’s done.
This will also fill your memory card up faster, so you may run out of space earlier. Plan ahead and have a second memory card, or a larger capacity memory card.

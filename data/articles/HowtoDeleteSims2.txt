 In the Sims 3, you'll need to resort to cheats to delete your Sim. These cheats has a chance to cause bugs, and in the worst case scenario it can permanently ruin your save file. Back up your game before you begin:Find the folder Documents (or My Documents) → Electronic arts → The Sims 3 → Saves.
Create a copy of the Saves folder by right-clicking it and choosing Copy, or by selecting the folder and using command+C.
Past the copy to your Desktop or inside another folder by right-clicking the screen and selecting Paste, or by selecting the folder and pressing command+V.
 Open the cheat console with Ctrl + Shift button|C}}. Type TestingCheatsEnabled true and hit Enter.


If you're using Vista, you may need to hold down the Windows key as well to open the cheat console.
 Hold down Shift and click on the Sim. Select Object, then Delete. That Sim should permanently disappear., If your Sim is acting buggy (such as getting stuck in one location, or falling partway through the floor), you can use a different command to reset it. Open the cheat console again and type resetSim followed by a space and the Sim's full name. For example, if the Sim Joira Johnson is stuck, type "resetSim Joira Johnson".Hit Enter.This will cancel all the Sim's wishes and moodlets.
 If the reset command doesn't work, use this workaround:


Enter moveObjects on in the cheat console.
Enter Buy mode and pick up your Sim to delete it.
Open the options menu (... in the lower left corner), then select Edit Town.Click the icon that shows two houses. This is the Change Active Household option.Switch to any other household. Play for a couple minutes, then switch back to your bugged family. The "deleted" Sim should reappear near the sidewalk.
 Open the cheat console and enter TestingCheatsEnabled false. This will prevent you from accidentally introducing bugs or deleting objects.

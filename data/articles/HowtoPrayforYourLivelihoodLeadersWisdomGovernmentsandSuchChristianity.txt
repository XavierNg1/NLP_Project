 Be careful of what you stand for, actually do and what you cause. Be generous to God and your fellow man, and:"6 ...he who sows generously will also reap bountifully/generously. 7 Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed;", Yet, we are held to some of the consequences of our behavior -- this means simply "cause and effect", so be careful of what you cause:



"God is not mocked whatever a man 'sows' that shall he also 'reap'." (Galatians 6:7), Not only believing but doing is part of effectual prayer:



"...the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much"(James 5:16)is a promise in the Bible.
 Accept God's plan, allowing God to love others through you, putting away malice (meanness, ill will), picking up your cross daily and following Christ on your "pathway", which is set before you to walk.
, Expect God to honor your prayers and His Word.

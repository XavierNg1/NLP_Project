 Do this when you begin to administer the supplements during the first week. This way you can monitor the effects of the supplements on your catâ€™s health. After the first week, discuss any positive or negative outcomes you observed on your cat's health with your veterinarian.You may also want to break the tablets in half if you feed your cat less than the recommended amount of food for the dosage. For example, if the instructions tell you to give your cat one tablet for every two cups of food, but you only feed your cat one cup of food, then break the tablet in half to adjust the dosing.
 Some products require you to give your cat the tablet before its meal, while others require you to give it after. Just make sure to administer the tablet per the instructions on the bottle.If the instructions do not specify when to give your cat the tablet, then it is safe to give it either before or after its meal.
 Do this if your cat will not take the tablet by itself. A pill pocket is similar to a treat. However, a pill pocket has a small space for you to place the tablet inside. Place the tablet inside the pill pocket and give your cat the "treat" before or after its meal per the instructions on the bottle.

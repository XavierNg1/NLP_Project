 This tree of abilities is based heavily on dealing damage...and boy, is it a lot of damage. You will be passing out the hurt like candy on Halloween with this skill tree. These abilities will make for a great offensive character, making you a useful damage dealer for your group. , This tree is mainly about getting you out of sight, so that you can attack from range and stay out of the way. Many of the skills are about turning invisible, but this isn't as great a boon as it sounds. While invisible, you'll be unable to regenerate magicka. The higher level abilities in this tree do let you deal more damage, though. , This tree is about taking health, speed and power from your enemy and giving it to yourself. For any Nightblade regardless of play style, it will make sense to have at least a few of these skills, in order to protect the fairly minimal amount of health associated with this class.

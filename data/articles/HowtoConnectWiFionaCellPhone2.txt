 This will bring down the notification shade with a list of quick options.


On some phones (such as Nexus models) you may need to tap the profile icon in the upper right to bring up the quick options.
 This will bring up a list of available networks.


On some models, you may need to tap and hold the Wi-Fi button.
If your Wi-Fi is toggled off, tapping this button will automatically turn it on.
 If the network has public access and is not password protected, your phone will connect to the network and you are finished.


Password protected networks are indicated by a lock icon.
If you do not see any available networks, then you may not be in range of any and will have to relocate to connect to one.
Tap Other Network to manually enter an network name (SSID) if the network is hidden or you do not see it listed.
 If the network is protected a window will appear with a text field to enter the password.
 This button is in the lower right corner of the password window. If the password is correct you will be connected to the network.


If the password is incorrect you will receive an authentication error and will need to re-enter the password or try a different network.

 When planting a scented camellia garden, consider the usual important factors with making the most of scented plants. Locate the camellias where their scent will have an impact - near bedroom windows, around outdoor-eating areas, in relaxation areas of the garden etc. Scented varieties may be more delicate than other varieties, so providing good shelter is an important aspect. In all cases, camellias must be sheltered from wind, intense sun and frost exposure. Neutral or acidic soil is best and be sure to keep camellias well-drained.

 Don’t react impulsively to things that your mom says that might make you angry or sad. Take a moment to pause and think about what you want to say before you respond. Consider how your words are going to make your mom feel.Take a deep breath.
Ask yourself if what you want to say is really worth saying.
 Don’t just hear what your mom is saying to you, actually listen to her. In order to actively listen you must stop thinking about what you want to say. Focus all of your attention on your mom when she is talking to you.Get rid of any distractions like your cell phone.
Make eye contact and face your body towards your mom.
Don’t interrupt.
 Honesty is the key to a trusting relationship between you and your mom. If you are consistently caught in lies, there is a good chance that your mom will never believe you, even when you are telling the truth. The truth may upset her, but it is still best to tell her before she finds out from someone else.For example, if your mom asks you how your grades are, be honest with her. If you keep telling her that you have straight A’s and then she receives a report card with a couple of D’s, she is not going to be happy.

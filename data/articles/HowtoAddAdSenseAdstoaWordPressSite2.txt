 This method of adding AdSense to WordPress site is by using widgets, which are built-in apps for your website where you can display code and menus and things. They also let you post HTML, so you can place an AdSense ad in a WordPress widget.
 You must do so in a separate tab on your browser. In AdSense, click “My Ads” at the top-left of the page.
 To do it, click “New ad unit,” and design your ad in the dialog box that appears.
, It is located on the left-hand menu of the dashboard. Hover over “Appearance,” and click “Widgets” in the drop-down.
 Drag it and drop it in the appropriate active widget area.
 Doing so will display text above the ad. You may leave the title blank if you’d like.
 Paste it in the text area of your “Text” widget. Now click on the “Save” button, and you’ve done it. Your AdSense ad has just been added to a WordPress site.

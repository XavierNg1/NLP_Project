 If you only want to skip a few periods, say that you have a dentist or doctor's appointment, or that you need to miss school for a family commitment. Usually, you won't want to try to fake a parent's voice — the office isn't stupid — so it's usually best to come up with someone else to cover for you.


Older siblings and cousins might be up for calling you out of school, likewise friendly neighbors or a sibling of one of your friends. Make sure they keep the conversation brief and non-specific.;
, It's best if you can actually have a real appointment or reason to miss school. You might consider telling your parent the orthodontist scheduled you an appointment when you really haven't got one, or that they need to call you out for an appointment with your coach to go over plays for the weekend's game. A call from your parents will seem more real, even if the appointment isn't.
 When you're making a fake appointment, it's best if you can keep it as vague and non-specific as you can to avoid causing suspicion. If you get your brother to call you in and say, "He's got a doctor's appointment this morning and he's not going to be able to make it in today," the office will be unlikely to question it.

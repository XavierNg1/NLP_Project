 You might end up painting something you're proud of; don't let acidic paper slowly destroy it.

Whiteness of the paper can significantly affect the look of your finished painting. Some artists like a very bright white paper; others prefer a softer off-white. Some manufacturers (such as Arches and Fabriano) offer bright white papers for those who prefer it.

Cleanliness is important when working with watercolors. There are people who can't go through the paper section of an art supply store without getting their dirty paws all over the paper. Not only are fingerprints and dirt impossible to get off paper, but the oils in people's fingerprints can mess up your painting. Buy the paper that's still sealed, or is on the bottom of the stack, and always check to make sure it's clean before buying it.

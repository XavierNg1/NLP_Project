If you can't find a standard sewer standpipe cap to fit, use a generic rubber cap and secure it with a hose clamp.
 Be sure to place the downspout inside the elbow and not around the outside of the elbow or the downspout will leak. Use pliers to bend the end of the downspout as needed to get a tight fit.



You can also use a plastic downspout extension of the same size.

 Cut the extension to the desired length using a hacksaw.

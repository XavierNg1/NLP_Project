 Place the butter in a large saucepan and set it over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt completely.To help the butter melt faster, cut it into six to eight chunks before tossing it into the saucepan.
Rotate the saucepan as needed to spread the butter evenly across the bottom.;
, Sprinkle the flour evenly over the melted butter, then quickly and continually whisk the two ingredients together.


Add the flour gradually to prevent any of it from burning or clumping together.
After combining all of the flour and butter, continue whisking for another 1 or 2 minutes. Prolonged exposure to heat should "cook out" the raw flour taste and give the resulting gravy better flavor.
 Pour the broth or stock into the saucepan, whisking well and continually after each addition.Use chicken or turkey broth to create a gravy for poultry dishes, or beef broth to create a classic beef gravy. For a generic brown gravy, consider using two parts beef broth and one part chicken broth.
Continue cooking the gravy until the mixture bubbles. Once it bubbles, it should also thicken to the right consistency.
 Sprinkle the gravy with black pepper and chopped parsley, if desired. Mix well to combine.


Adjust the amount of each seasoning to taste.
Since canned broth is usually quite salty, extra salt usually isn't needed. You can add some to the gravy if desired, however.
 Remove the pan from the stove and serve the gravy while it's still hot.


If you aren't ready to serve it yet but plan to do so soon, keep the pan on the stove over very low heat until the rest of the meal is ready. Stir the gravy occasionally.
If you won't be ready to use the gravy soon, pour it into an airtight container and refrigerate it. Simmer it on the stove until heated through prior to serving.

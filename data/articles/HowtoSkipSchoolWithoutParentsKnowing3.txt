 As the evening goes on, start to sneeze every so often. Blow your nose a lot in a place where your parents can hear you. If you start faking the symptoms of sickness the night before, your parents are less likely to question you when you say you’re sick in the morning.Sickness comes in various forms, with many different symptoms. Decide on a few to use, such as an upset stomach, sneezing, or nausea, but don’t go overboard with too many symptoms.
If your parents are very cautious, it may not be a good idea to pretend to be sick. They may get so worried that they rush you to the doctor immediately. If they know you lied about being sick, your punishment might be worse.
Lying to your parents about being sick is worse than skipping school and will break their trust in you.
 As soon as you wake up, go straight to the bathroom. Make noises as if you are sitting on the toilet and not feeling good at all. Pour some water in the toilet to simulate the proper sounds.Be sure to flush the toilet at least two or three times to enhance the effect.
 Heat up some tea and hold the thermometer against the outside of the mug until it heats up to 101℉ or 102℉ (38℃). Be sure not to let the thermometer read 104℉ (40℃) or more, as this causes alarm and may get you taken to the doctor. Be sure to add other fever symptoms like making yourself sweat a little and saying you feel cold.The combination of the fever reading on the thermometer, visible sweat on your forehead, and saying you are cold should be enough to convince your parent that you’re feverish without raising too much concern.

 This is usually indicated by the diode schematic symbol (—▷|—). This mode will allow the multimeter to send some current through the diode, making it easier to test.


You can still test the diode without the Diode setting. Set the meter to the the resistance (Ω) function.
 Connect the positive lead to the one end of the diode, and the negative end to the other. You should see a reading on the meter's display.If your meter has a Diode mode, you will see voltage displayed on the meter if the meter is connected positive-to-positive and negative-to-negative. If its the wrong way, nothing will be displayed.
If you meter does not have a Diode mode, you will see very low resistance if the meter is connected positive-to-positive and negative-to-negative. If its the wrong way, you will see very high resistance, sometimes express as "OL".
 An LED is a light-emitting diode. Turn the multimeter to the Diode setting. Place the positive lead on one of the pins, and the negative lead on the other. If the LED lights up, the positive lead is touching the positive pin (the anode), and the negative lead is touching the negative pin (the cathode). If it doesn't light up, the leads are touching the opposite pins.

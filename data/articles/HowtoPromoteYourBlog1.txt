 Twitter is one of the more acceptable places to broadcast all of your blog posts, as it is designed for quick posts with links. Tweeting new posts is an easy task at face value, but you’ll need to spend some time planning it out. This is especially important as your global audience grows.;
, Avoid just writing “New blog!” and linking to your blog. The majority of users will not click on these links, because they don’t speak to them at all. Cover an aspect of your post in the lead-in; if you’re writing about fashion tips, write something like “Wondering what to wear to the club tonight? <link to blog>”. Keep it short and sweet, but make sure that you are directing readers to your content.


Write the lead-in as a question to the reader. “Need to lose a few pounds before swimsuit season?”
Offer advice and create the feeling that the reader needs your wisdom. “10 tips for managing your money.”
Write a fact from your post that will wow the reader. “30 million people can’t be wrong!”

, As your audience grows, you will find that readers are coming to your blog from all different time zones. Your blog tweets can be easily lost when someone checks their Twitter 8 hours after you post. Use a social media management tool such as HootSuite to plan out a schedule of tweets.


Try to post when your readers will be most active. Try to post the blog in the morning, and then support it with tweets later in the day. These tweets will bring in new users who are just getting on the internet for the first time that day.
When tweeting the same article out again, use a different lead-in to keep your tweets from become canned and spammy.
 Use Twitter for more than linking your blog. If your followers only ever see blog posts in your Twitter feed, they will grow fatigued of the links. Add insights and respond to other Twitter users throughout the day.

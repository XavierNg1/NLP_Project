;
, Start with one of the main branches and the main twigs.Make sure that you draw the tree big.
 this is where detail matters Add shadows and lines to make your work more realistic.
 Remember that smaller twigs branch off of larger ones and even smaller twigs branch off those.
 Drawing them individually is nearly impossible and boring, but be sure to make each one unique. Nothing in nature is exactly like anything else of the same kind.
 It could be worth a million dollars someday.

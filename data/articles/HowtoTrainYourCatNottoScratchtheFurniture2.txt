 If you see your cat in the act of scratching on your furniture, stop her immediately and scold her. Clap your hands suddenly or spray her with water. Then, physically remove her from the area.Pick her up and move her to her scratching post. This will help her associate her urge to scratch with the post.
Unless you catch her in the act, scolding won't help. She won't know what you're talking about.
 Cats, like dogs and like people, thrive on positive reinforcement for good behavior. Instead of punishing your cat for scratching the furniture, reward her for scratching the post. You can offer any reward that you know she likes. Many cats respond well to the following:


Praise. Cats love your attention more than anything. Scratch her ears, tell her what a good girl she is, and use a sweet, affectionate tone of voice.
A cat treat. Offer her a favorite treat as a thank-you for scratching the post.
Catnip. This can be rubbed into the scratching post or used as a reward for after she has scratched there.
 Most cats and kittens are annoyed by yelling, but it doesn't do much to deter their bad behavior.


Yelling only teaches your cat to avoid you because you are unpredictable and maybe even dangerous.

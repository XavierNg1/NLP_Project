 If your controller came with a driver disc, insert it before plugging the controller in. Installing the drivers first may help with any errors that Windows may encounter while setting up the controller. Not all controllers come with a disc, and Windows should be able to install the drivers for these controllers automatically.

Refer to your controller's manual for specific installation instructions. Some controllers may have special instructions that you'll need to follow.
 Windows 8 will install the generic USB controller drivers if you didn't install any in the previous step. This should all happen automatically., Open the Start screen and type "joy.cpl." Select "joy.cpl" from the list of search results.
 This will allow you to test the controller and assign its buttons to various commands. Click the "Calibrate" button to test all of its functions. You can now use your generic USB controller in games that support it.

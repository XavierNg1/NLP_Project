 Once you’ve reached the next set of locked levels, you cannot proceed without getting the required tickets. You can get these by asking friends to help you. All you need are three tickets from three friends.


Tap the “Ask friends” button when faced with locked levels, and then select from the list of friends.
Tap the “Send” button once done to send the requests.
You don’t have to limit your requests to just three friends, you can send to as many as you want. This will likely get you the needed tickets faster.
 After you’ve sent your requests, you can view how many tickets you’ve received and from whom by tapping the train icon, which serves as the gate for the next levels.
 Once all the tickets have been received, the next levels will be unlocked and you will be brought to the next one. Keep on playing.


Repeat the steps to unlocking levels when you’ve reached the next locked gate.

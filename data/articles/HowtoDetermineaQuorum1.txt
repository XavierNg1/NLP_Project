 A simple majority is the best way to determine a quorum if you donâ€™t have a certain number already listed in the by-laws. Find out the total membership of your organization, and then divide that number in such a way as to have one number greater than the other by one.


For example, if you have a board of eight members, a majority would be five, while the minority would be three. Therefore, in this example you would need five people to have a quorum.;
, In law, a quorum would more specifically need to be composed of those who are capable of making decisions for the organization.If your organization has members who are not in decision-making roles, you will need to find a majority of decision-making members only.


An organization that has only one decision-making member can still have a quorum, but in this case they are a quorum of one., If your organization has a rule that determines a quorum as something other than a majority and that rule is taken out of the by-laws, quorum is determined by a majority. Majority determines quorum until a new by-law is accepted.

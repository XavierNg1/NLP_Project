 This is "your" group of girls, your best friends that you tell everything to and gossip with. To form your clique, chat around with some people, and once you find somebody you really like, talk them up a lot until you tend to hang around each other. Continuously do this, but remember, your clique should start with no more than about four girls, including you.
 Take note of the word leader here, because while Regina is the boss that tells everyone what to do, that probably won't slide in real life unless you want people to be afraid of you. However, be the one that's followed. Have your clique come with you everywhere, even just to dump your tray. They're part of you, and just imagine your arms not following you to the trash bin!

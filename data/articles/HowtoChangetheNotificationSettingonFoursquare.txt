 On the Notifications page, you can view all the alerts you previously received. Tap the Gear icon on the upper right and this will take you to the Notification’s Settings page.
 Select which notifications you want to get and how you want to get it. You can be notified either by the phone’s system alert or by receiving an email notification. There are also three categories of notifications here:


Happening Nearby – You’ll get notified whenever one of your friends check in.
Social – Any social activity that happens, from friend requests to getting ousted as a mayor, or a friend mentions you in one of his check in, you’ll get an alert.
Reminders and Alerts – Receive an alert for any new tips or new version releases of Foursquare.

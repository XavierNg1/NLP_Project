 Keep the tip of the cigarette pointed upwards so stray ash doesn’t fall down. Ensure the grip is light but firm, allowing the cigarette to stay in place without crushing the filter. , Have the cigarette hover over the center of the ashtray with a roughly 45 degree angle between cigarette and ashtray surface. Don’t point the lit end of the cigarette downward until you’re directly over the ashtray, ensuring the ash falls directly in.
 Put the lit end of the cigarette in the center of the ashtray, and roll it between your fingers without actually moving it back and forth. The cigarette will naturally rest on the unburnt tobacco on the cigarette tip when it makes contact with the ashtray. By rolling the cigarette you brush off the majority of the loose ash, as well as making a smooth, symmetrical, and sophisticated cigarette.

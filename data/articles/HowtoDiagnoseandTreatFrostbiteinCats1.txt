 If your cat is playing outside and starts whining, shivering or behaving anxiously, it is a sign of hypothermia and possible frostbite. Hypothermia often occurs alongside frostbite and is a life threatening condition, so you should familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypothermia.

If you notice any shivering or discomfort, move your cat to a warm, indoor environment.;
, Once your cat has been taken to a warm environment, you may notice symptoms of frostbite on their nose, tail, paws, scrotum or other sensitive areas with less fur. Symptoms may take a few days to appear, so keep an eye on your cat for at least a week after the prolonged exposure to cold or wind. Look for the following symptoms:

Pain and swelling
Discoloration of the skin
Blisters on the feet
Peeling of your cat’s skin
Skin ulcers
Brittle skin, when touched
Pain when your cat is touched
Swelling
Black or deadened skin

, Once your cat has warmed up, the blood flow should start to return to your cat’s extremities, resulting in red skin. If the skin turns gray, blue or black instead of red, it is a sign of more severe frostbite. In this case, your veterinarian may have to remove the impacted tissue.

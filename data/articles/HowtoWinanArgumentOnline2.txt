 Online arguments often don’t take long to turn ugly. The apparent anonymity of the web can prompt people to write things that they would never say to somebody in the flesh. Try to avoid getting involved by staying polite and civil. Don’t rise to personal abuse. Any possibility of a reasoned argument swiftly disappears once people start writing personal abuse about people they have never met.


Some research has suggested that people tend to respond more to one negative remark than a series of positive ones.
Don’t get sucked into this kind of argument. It’s one that nobody wins., If you get involved in an argument online, you should pay attention to the person you are arguing with. If there is little real discussion, and the person is just making contrary statements, there may just be trolling the website looking to irritate people. Don’t waste your time with it, there is little chance of a positive outcome.It might be easier said than done, by the best way to deal with trolls is just to ignore them.
If you show that you can be drawn into an argument, you may receive more unwanted attention from trolls., Even if you are not being trolled, internet arguments can often be fairly pointless exercises where nobody is prepared to interrogate their own positions or open their minds to other ideas. If you find the argument isn’t going anywhere, you shouldn’t feel like stepping away constitutes a defeat.


Online arguments might be “won” by the person with the most time to spend replying to comments.
Don’t feel obliged to reply to everything to try and outlast your opposition.
It’s not often that somebody in an online argument will admit defeat, so don’t worry about it.

 For the explanation given below, the focus will be on a semi-log graph, using a standard scale for the x-axis and a log scale for the y-axis. However, you may wish to reverse these, depending on how you want the data to appear. Reversing the axes has the effect of shifting the graph by ninety degrees and may make the data more easily interpreted in one direction or the other. Additionally, you may wish to use a log scale to spread out certain data values and make their details more visible., The x-axis is the independent variable. The independent variable is the one that you generally control in a measurement or experiment. The independent variable is not affected by the other variable in the study. Some examples of independent variables may be such things as:Date

Time

Age

Medication given


, You will use a logarithmic scale to graph data that changes extremely quickly. A standard graph is useful for data that grows or decreases at a linear rate. A logarithmic graph is for data that changes at an exponential rate. Samples of such data might be:

Population growth rates

Product consumption rates

Compounding interest


, Review your data and decide how to mark the y-axis. If your data measures numbers only within, for example, the millions and billions, you probably do not need to have your graph begin at 0. You could label the lowest cycle on the graph as 106{\displaystyle 10^{6}}. Subsequent cycles would be 107,108,109{\displaystyle 10^{7},10^{8},10^{9}} and so on.
 To graph the first (or any) data point, you begin by finding its position along the x-axis. This may be an incremental scale, such as a regular number line that counts 1, 2, 3, and so on. It may be a scale of labels that you assign, such as dates or months of the year when you take certain measurements.
 You need to find the corresponding position along the y-axis for the data that you wish to plot. Recall that, since you are working with a logarithmic scale, the major markings are powers of 10, and the minor scale markings in between represent the subdivisions. For example, between 106{\displaystyle 10^{6}} (one million) and 107{\displaystyle 10^{7}} (ten million), the lines represent divisions of 1,000,000â€™s.For example, the number 4,000,000 would be graphed at the fourth minor scale mark above 106{\displaystyle 10^{6}}. Even though, on a standard linear scale, 4,000,000 is less than halfway between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000, because of the logarithmic scale, it actually appears slightly more than halfway.

You should note that the higher intervals, closer to the upper limit, become squeezed together. This is due to the mathematical nature of the logarithmic scale.
 Continue repeating the previous steps for all the data that you need to graph. For each data point, first locate its position along the x-axis, and then find its corresponding location along the logarithmic scale of the y-axis.

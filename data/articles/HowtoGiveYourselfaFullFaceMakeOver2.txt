, These will help firm and tone the skin on your face.


Mud treatment: Use a salon created or commercially prepare mud treatment.

Apply to clean, dry skin, being careful to avoid your eyes and mouth.
Allow to work as directed on package, but generally for a minimum of 30 minutes, up to 2 hours.
Rinse face thoroughly to remove all of the mud, pat dry with a clean towel.


Botanical treatment: Use a salon or commercial product as above, or create your own, using succulent plants like cucumbers, melon, and aloe plant, in equal parts, processed in a blender and strained through a wire mesh colander to remove any seeds, plant peels, or other solids.

Apply an even coat of your botanical mixture, and allow to dry.
Leave in place 30 minutes. You should feel your skin "tightening up" as the drying occurs, but as the oils are absorbed from your face, it is also moisturized from the plant fluids.
Microdermabrasion: Buy a do it yourself kit from a reputable retailer, and follow instructions.
,, SPF is important also!

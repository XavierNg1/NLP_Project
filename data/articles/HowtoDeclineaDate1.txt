 Be polite about it, but be equally clear that you aren't going to go on a date with this person. Don't beat around the bush. If you're sure, then be sure. Say exactly what you mean.If you feel bad, say, "I'm sorry, but I don't want to go on a date with you," or "I'm sorry, but I'm not interested." Make yourself absolutely clear. You don't need to apologize for not being interested, but it might make the words go over more easily.
If you wan to make a quick excuse, then say, "I already have plans," or "I have a boy/girlfriend." Be careful: if you lie, then you might be found out. If you don't make it clear that you aren't interested, then the person might ask you out again.
If the person has asked you out disrespectfully, then you don't need to make any bones about saying no. Just say, "no," or "I'm not interested.";
, You don't want this person to believe that he/she has a "chance" with you. If you leave things open, then you may need to decline another date down the line. Make a clean break so that this person can deal with his/her feelings and move on with life.Make sure to actually say the word "no." You might also say, "I don't want to go on a date with you," or "I'm not interested." Be as explicit as possible.
 If a person won't leave you alone, then do not hesitate to ask for help. Call a friend or a family member to come help you get out of the situation.


In extreme cases, if you feel very unsafe, then you may need to call the police or get a restraining order. Only do this if someone is threatening you or making you feel otherwise violated.

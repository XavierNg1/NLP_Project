 Towel it dry so that it is still damp, but not dripping wet. If you wish to add straightening serum at this point, use your fingers to smooth it into your hair. Brush your hair so that it is as straight as possible when you begin to roll it.
 Run a brush through it. Place a roller under the tips of the hair and roll your hair around it. When you have rolled the section of hair all the way to your scalp, secure the roller with a pin or clip.









Repeat this process until all of your hair has been sectioned and rolled.
Use a uniform rolling technique to ensure that the hair falls straight when you remove the rollers.
 As with other straightening techniques, it's important that your hair get completely dry to finish the straightening process. Either let your hair air dry in the rollers or use a hair dryer on a low setting to dry it.
 Unclip the rollers and let your hair fall free. It should be smooth, glossy and straight.

 If you feel like a staple is jammed, don’t try to dislodge it by pulling the trigger again. In some models, internal safeties will prevent a jammed gun from firing. After releasing the trigger, unplug corded staple guns. If the gun has a switch, turn it off. If it’s battery powered, remove the battery pack., You’ll usually find a small lever at the bottom of the magazine. This is the release lever. Pull on the lever, and the magazine should unclip. You’ll then be able to pull on the magazine until it’s clear of the staple gun., Some jams are caused by staples failing to properly leave the magazine. They might be partially crushed by the other staples in the clip. Other times, the staple will have partially left the magazine and will be stuck in the opening. Use a flat-head screwdriver to coax the staple out of the magazine, gently prodding it out. Follow up with a pair of pliers to pull the staple loose.

Be gentle when trying to remove staples from the magazine or you’ll risk causing damage to it., You might find a jam here if a staple leaves the magazine but stays stuck before leaving the nose. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to reach the jam and pinch the staple to remove it. Be careful not to damage the staple gun as you do this.

In many models you’ll be able to reach this kind of jam simply by removing the magazine. In others, you may need to disassemble part of the gun. Check the owner’s manual to determine if that’s the case.

 You can get Key Fragments by hunting Guild Eidolon spawn during certain times. Every day, the Guild summons different kinds of Eidolons that players can kill. All who inflict damage on the boss will be given a reward, or if you're using a support character, being in a party will give you the same chance.

To get inside a Guild Hall, you need to be in a high level Guild.
Remember, every Eidolon gives buffs or added damage depending on the job class of their owner.
 On every map, there are a couple of mini-bosses you can kill. Upon killing them, you will be able to pick up an urn to be brought back to the town. Trade it with the guard for a bounty box. Each box may contain Eidolon Key Fragments at random, but the chances are quite slim.


To hunt a mini-boss, just check your map and look for any mini-boss icon, indicating its location.
Take note that mini-bosses spawn at different times but in the same place.
 Skandia can be entered when you reach level 50. Access portal for this dungeon is in Cacaktara map. Eidolons randomly appear in this dungeon. Defeating appeared eidolons can drop eidolons fragments or keys sometimes. Whenever you clear Skandia, you will be rewarded with Loyalty Points.


Loyalty Points can be used to buy Eidolon key fragments in Item Mall although they're quite expensive, ranging from 500 to 2,600 Loyalty Points per key fragment, depending on the Eidolon's level.
In this dungeon, random Eidolon may spawn. You can kill Eidolon spawns for randomly dropped Eidolon Keys and Fragments; however, Eidolons spawning in Skandia is rare.

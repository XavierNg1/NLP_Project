 Save the document as an Excel workbook in a file location that you can easily find later.


You want to save the original as an excel file to have a master copy on-hand.
 Click the "Save as Type" drop down and select the file format that your database program can translate.


For example, some programs use the CSV (comma separated values) format, while web-based applications might use XML. Consult the manual for your database program to determine the correct format.

 Do not be shy and don`t look away.
 Let him see you looking at him.

When you look directly at someone, or talking to someone, let your eyes be deep. Let your emotion burn through them. Be penetrating. When you shift your gaze, do so slightly slower than normal, with your eyelashes slowly following your gaze slightly.
When you speak, move your eyebrows slightly, not overly as that can seem too animated. Smile intriguingly. Let your lips linger open for a second after you finish speaking, parted just enough to notice.

 The worst thing that could happen to even the fastest runner is when he or she suddenly feels less confident, is stressed out, gets out of control, etc. As well as jogging and stretching daily, sleeping well, and eating good food, try exercising your mental aspects by meditating, viewing appropriate media, socializing more, etc.;
, Treat others the way you want to be treated.
 See how to position your body in the Tips section below.
 Swing your arms hard, directly forward and back, enough to give yourself momentum. Move your legs fast and far apart. If you look towards the audience/onlookers or anyone behind you, you will lose your focus on what's ahead of you.
 You may accidentally get hit by anyone that may be behind you, or you would injure your legs from "braking" too fast. Gradually slow down once you pass the finish line, from a run, to a jog, and finally to a walk.

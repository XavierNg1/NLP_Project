 Selling on eBay doesn't always mean selling your own stuff or even buying the products at all. Many sellers make a business of selling on consignment and keeping a portion of the sale price. This can be done from home or with a brick and mortar store. Another option is to become an eBay trading assistant and do consignment work directly for eBay.

 A wholesaler buys products in bulk at a low rate and earns money by reselling that product to buyers at a higher rate. While many wholesalers have their own website, others run businesses directly through Amazon or other online retailers. Consider the market for your product, potential earnings, and inventory storage before deciding to become a wholesaler. See How to Buy Wholesale for more information on how to get started.


Sell products through drop shipping. This process is essentially a simplified version of wholesaling, but instead of taking control of the inventory yourself, you simply sell the products and allow a third party to fulfill your order for you. That is, when your item is purchased from the online retailer where you've registered it (eBay, Amazon, etc.), the manufacturer takes care of shipping your product to the buyer. This reduces the risks of leftover inventory and complicated logistics that are common in wholesaling.

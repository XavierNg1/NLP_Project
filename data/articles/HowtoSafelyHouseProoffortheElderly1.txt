 If possible, create zero-stair entries to the home.This will make it easier for an elderly person to enter and exit the house and reduce the risk of falling.


This can often be accomplished by adding a ramp to entrances that might already have stairs.;
, If you can, install doorways that are 36 inches wide. This allows for greater maneuverability, especially with a walker or wheelchair., Railings should be placed on both sides of all staircases, and should be strong enough to support a person's full body weight.Ideally, these railings should extend beyond the top and bottom steps.
Adding pieces of reflective stripping to each stair can also improve visibility.If necessary and possible, you may wish to install a stair lift to make it easier for seniors ascend and descend.

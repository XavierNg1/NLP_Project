 In this version, Goriyas appear exclusively inside dungeons. They are the dungeon counterpart of Moblins of the Overworld. Equip yourself with a shield to protect you from boomerangs the Goriyas may fling at you.;
, Once you see a Goriya, slowly approach it with your shield in front of you. These monsters just randomly throw boomerangs in different directions instead of aiming one at you so getting closer to them won’t be too hard.
 Once you get close enough, hack at the Goriya with your sword to kill it.


There are two types of Goriyas in this version, with their toughness as the only difference. The first one is the red Goriya, which takes around one slash to kill; while the other one is the blue Goriya, which takes about two or three slashes of your sword to defeat.
 If you don’t want to get close to a Goriya to kill it, you can use long-range weapons to defeat them.


Equip your bow and arrow, and shoot at the direction where the Goriya is walking. A single arrow can kill a red Goriya while blue ones may take up to three.
Throw a bomb close to where a Goriya is and wait for it to detonate. A bomb can kill a red Goriya in one explosion while blue ones can take up to two.

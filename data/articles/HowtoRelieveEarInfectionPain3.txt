 An adult or older child should be able to identify if she has an ear infection. An infant cannot, so you will have to look for symptoms. The symptoms of an ear infection include:Tugging or pulling at the ear (this may be the only sign in some infants)
Ear pain, especially when lying down
Irritability, crying, and fussiness
Difficulty sleeping
Hearing loss
Fever of 100oF or higher
Loss of appetite
Drainage from the ear
Dizziness or a feeling that the room is spinning
Warmth, redness, or pain around the ear
Swelling or itching

, Ear infections cannot be caught from another person. However, certain conditions can lead to ear infections. Be alert for ear infections if you or your child encounter any of the following conditions:Allergies, colds, or sinus infections
Cold climates
Changes in altitude or climate
Pacifier or sippy cup use, or drinking a bottle while lying down
Exposure to smoke
Family history of ear infections

, Most ear infections can be treated at home. However, some ear infections are severe and need to be taken care of by a doctor. Call your doctor if any of the following apply:Fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
Severe pain
Severe pain that suddenly stops. This may indicate a ruptured eardrum.

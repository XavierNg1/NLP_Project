 Once one woodpecker drills holes in your home, more will be drawn to the area. Insects may crawl into the holes and infest your house, exacerbating the problem.

Use putty to fill the woodpecker holes as soon as you find them.
Paint over the putty when it dries with polyurethane or oil-based paints, which deter insects from using your home as a nesting site. Fewer insects means fewer woodpeckers.
 Secure hardware cloth, plastic netting or bird netting to the damaged areas of your home. This will prevent the woodpeckers from doing more damage to the area.

, The federal migratory bird act protects woodpeckers, but a professional can safely trap and release the woodpecker in a better location.

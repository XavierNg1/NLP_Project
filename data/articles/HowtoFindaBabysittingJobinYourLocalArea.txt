 Think about the positives and the negatives. For example, are you ready for caring for small children who need a lot of interaction? Do you like small children? Are you capable of preparing food for children? Also consider how much you want to charge per hour.;
, If you have some relatives living locally, ask them if they need any babysitting. You can also ask friends if they know anyone in your local area who needs a babysitter.


This is a good way to start out because you find people through people you trust. Trust builds trust, allowing you to feel safer when learning the ropes of babysitting.
 You can post an ad in the newspaper, online or as flyers. If you do make sure you ad your first name, phone number, and suitable reasons as to why people should hire you as their babysitter.


Make it clear that you are providing services locally only.
Hang your flyer around the local area. Perhaps ask if you can hang it up in a store or building.
Ask your parents to check the ad first if you're under 16. They will let you know if you've included suitable information. Be careful about providing too much information, as you must keep safe. For example, don't give out your age or last name until you actually meet with potential clients.
 Make sure the people you are babysitting for are good people in a safe neighborhood. If you're under 16, interview them with a parent or older sibling accompanying you.

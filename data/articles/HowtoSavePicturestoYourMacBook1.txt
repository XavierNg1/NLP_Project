 Open the message, document, or web page that contains the photo you'd like to save on your MacBook.


Not all web pages permit images to be saved or downloaded.;
, Using your trackpad or mouse, move the cursor over the picture you want to save.
 Doing so opens a pop-up menu.


If your mouse has a right-click function, you can also right-click on the image to invoke the pop-up menu.
Yet another option is to activate "Secondary Click" in the "Trackpad" menu of System Preferences. Once enabled, a two-finger click will also bring up the menu.
 It's near the bottom of the menu.


Click on Save Image to "Downloads" to automatically save it to your Mac's "Downloads" folder.
Click on Copy Image to save it to your clipboard so you can paste in a document.
Click on Use Image as Desktop Picture to make it your Mac's wallpaper.
 Type a name for the photo you'd like to save in the text field at the top of the dialog box.
 Using the "Where:" drop-down menu at the bottom of the dialog box, locate and click on the folder in which you'd like to save the image.
 It's in the lower-right corner of the dialog box. The picture will be saved to your MacBook in the folder you specified.

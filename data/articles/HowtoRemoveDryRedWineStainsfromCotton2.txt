 This step will moisten the dry stain so that it's more likely to come out. You don't need to take long â€“ just enough to thoroughly wet the fabric.
 The cotton should be damp, but not dripping. Be gentle, and try not to stretch or tear the material.
 Squeeze the juice directly from a lemon, or use a pre-bottled lemon juice product. Soak the stain thoroughly, so that the acidity begins to act upon the wine.
 As the lemon soaks into the fabric, shake salt onto the area. Use your fingers to massage the salt and lemon into the stain. Work the salt in from the front and the back of the stained area for more dramatic effect.Standard table salt is fine, but any salt will do. You may even be able to use coarse sand and other gritty materials to scrub the stain.
 Rinse the back of the stain in cold water from a faucet. Wring the fabric out with your hands, and massage it, paying special attention to the stained area. Do not stretch or tear the material, but don't be afraid to vigorously rub the stain. When the stain is nearly gone, wrap the garment in a clean towel to wring out most of the moisture.


Always rinse from the back side of a stain. Wash it out of the fabric, not through it!

, Squeeze more lemon juice directly onto the stain, in a concentrated dose. Lay the cotton out in the sun. Use a flat surface, if possible, so that the fabric does not stretch as it dries. The acidic lemon and the UV rays of the sun make for a natural, fabric-safe improvised bleach.

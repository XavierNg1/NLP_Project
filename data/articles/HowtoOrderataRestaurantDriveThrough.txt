 Naturally, before you even start to order your food, you've got to know which restaurant to go to.
 If you've been at the restaurant before, you'll likely remember the food available there, and know beforehand what food you like and dislike.

If this is your first time going to the restaurant, go inside the restaurant and order there. While it's less convenient, it's a lot easier deciding what you'd like than if you went through the drive through.
 Simply tell the worker what you want and the quantities of each item. You'll be told how much you need to pay (at the window).

Speak clearly. Don't mumble, as they won't understand you. You want them to be sure you want the grilled chicken sandwich and not the buffalo chicken wings.
Don't be afraid to give specific directions on how to make the food, either. If you don't like onions in your burger, or you want an extra ketchup with your fries, say so. They can't magically predict that that's how you like it, so be sure to tell them your preferences.
 You will pay and receive your order there. At some restaurants, you pick up your food at a different window. Some restaurants might make you pay after getting your food., Either way, have some cash or a credit card on hand, so that when it's time to pay, all you have to do is hand it over and be done with it.,

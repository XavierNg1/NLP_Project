 MLA format doesn't require that you use a title. Therefore, unless your teacher requests a title page, you can just center your title on the first page of your paper and begin your text below.If you're doing your title this way, make sure to include your name, your teacher's name, your course, and the date. Double space the title and the information you just entered on the upper left-hand side.You'll also have a header on the page on the right side that includes your last name and the page number on the same line., Again, you want to start about 1/3 of the way down the page. Type the title of your paper in. Put it all on one line, even if it has a subtitle separated by a semi-colon. If it's too long to fit on one line, divide it at the semi-colon. Use title capitalization, meaning you only capitalize important words.
 Skip down a line (leaving a line blank), and write "by." Underneath that, write your name.


If there are two writers, separate the names with the word "and."
If there are more than two writers, separate the names with commas, placing the word "and" in between the last two names.
 You will have three lines at the bottom, and the bottom line should be just above the margin. On the top line, write you class name and section. Below that, include your professor's name. Under that, write out the date.
 Highlight the text on the page. Under the paragraph grouping, click the button to center the text.
 Your title page, just like the rest of your paper, should have 1-inch margins all around. You should also use a readable font, such as Times New Roman, in 12-point size.

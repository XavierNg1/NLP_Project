 If you don't have the right toothpaste to buff out the scratches, you may be able to use lip balm to fill them in instead. First, remove any excess dirt and grime by rinsing the disc off with running water.
 Use a lip balm without any colors, flavors, or glitter. You can also use a petroleum jelly like Vaseline., Run the lip balm up and down the length of the scratch. Do this several times so that a fair amount of lip balm is applied.


Repeat for any additional scratches on the disc.
 After applying several layers to the scratch, use a soft cloth to buff the balm in small circular motions. Continue buffing until all excess wax has been removed. You should notice that the scratches are much less visible than before., After you've buffed out all of the excess lip balm, you can try using the disc again. Make sure all of the excess balm has been removed before inserting the disc into your console.

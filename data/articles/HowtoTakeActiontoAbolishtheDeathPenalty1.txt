 First, you need to be sure to educate yourself on the issue. Learn as much as you can on the topic of the death penalty, and then share your research with others. After you are confident that you fully understand the issue, and you can speak clearly about it and defend your ideals, it is time to begin spreading your opinion. Start with a small circle of friends, family, or coworkers. Talk about the topic openly and try to gain support for your opinion. As you discuss the topic more, you will find which people want to support and join you as you take the matter to a broader stage.


Realize that the death penalty can be a divisive topic, with many people taking strong opinions on one side or the other. If you meet someone with an opposite viewpoint, keep your conversation civil. You can hold to your convictions, and focus the conversation on factual matters. By discussing facts, rather than opinions, you can keep the conversation informational rather than confrontational.;
, Seek out civic organizations or groups that share your view on the topic of the death penalty. Join with them, or see if you can attend a meeting sometime and speak on the issue. To find groups that would be interested in a discussion or presentation on the topic, try the following:


search online for "death penalty speakers" to find discussion groups or lecture series on the topic
network with friends and colleagues
contact a local college or university to see if a student group on human rights would be interested in hosting a speaker
contact local civic organizations like Kiwanis or the Rotary Club
Reach out to religious groups (e.g., churches, pastors, priests, rabbis)

, You can either send letters to established print media, such as local newspapers or other regional publications, or you can post your own information online. The Internet provides a very broad opportunity to reach out to people and share your views.

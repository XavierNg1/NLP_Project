 Stretch for at least 10 minutes each day â€“ you can do this in one large chunk, or in several separate sections.Stretch after a physical activity like dancing or running. The more flexible you are, the easier it will be to put your legs behind your head.


Start the first day with a 10-second front lunge on both feet. Put one foot out and kneel with your back leg out. Push your hips forward, switch legs, and repeat.
Do a 10-second butterfly stretch. Sit on the floor or ground and bring both of your feet together. Then, pull your feet towards your body, and bring your head as close to your toes as possible.
Perform a 20-second star-watching stretch. Kneel with your rear off of your feet. Reach upward and backward, and try to touch your toes. Push your torso up and look at the ceiling or sky. Increase your time 5 seconds everyday.;
, You don't strictly need to be able to do the splits to put your legs behind your head, but it can be a good way to increase your flexibility.
 Don't try anything too drastic until your body is flexible and used to contorting. If you try to overextend, you may injure yourself, which will delay your progress even further.
 Maintain a healthy diet and try to stay away from junk foods. Try eating salads and raw foods, and stay away from unnecessary carbohydrates.
 Yoga will help relax your body while stretching. If you can't go to a class, try looking up yoga routines that you can do at home.

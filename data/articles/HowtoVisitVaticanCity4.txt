 The following are some things you will want to find:


Visit the Grottoes. This is where some royals and former popes are buried. You will need to line up near the entrance to enter this lower level of the Basilica to see it.
View Michelangelo's Pieta. This statue of Mary with the baby Jesus is one of his best loved works. It sits behind bullet proof glass and there is usually a large crowd. You may have to wait for others to leave to get a good look, especially in the crowded summer months.
You can sign up for free tours of the Basilica from the Vatican Tourist Office.
 To the right of the entrance of the Basilica and past the Holy Door, you can climb the 320 steps to the top for 6 Euros. You can also pay 7 Euros to take the elevator.


Going to the top of the Basilica gives you an amazing view of Rome. For people in fairly good shape, climbing the stairs is well worth the effort it takes.

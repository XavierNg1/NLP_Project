 Having a heavy stomach after lunch or dinner can cause you to feel drowsy as your body focuses in digesting food rather than concentrating on listening.

Have a light meal for dinner if you have evening classes. You can always eat something more substantial after class. A sandwich, a bowl of salad or a soup and roll are some good choices before an evening class.;
, This can be done by active participation in the class exercises and discussions. Have speaking notes in dot point form to help you keep involved in any discussion sessions., It will be easier to hear the tutor, see the lecture slides or board notes and it feels more involved than hiding away at the back of the class or lecture theater., These will distract you. If you're trying to text a mate, email a friend or earn gems in a game, you won't be paying attention to class. Which means you'll miss things that you have to catch up on later rather than hearing them right then., Note-taking is a great way to stay focused and alert as you are thinking in motion about what points to take down, listening and digesting at the same time. As an added bonus, you get some useful notes at the end of class.

If it's easier, you can record a lecture or class but remember, that's just one more thing you'll have to attend to later, listening to it again.
 It's easier to make it through a busy day when you've had sufficient sleep each night.

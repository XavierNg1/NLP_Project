 It doesn't matter if it's at an arcade or at home. Try a soft pad for beginners, because the arrows connect easier.;
, Usually, songs don't start with a hard section. Some, like Delta 32, do. Be ready for those. If it's easy, just keep going.
 Listen for the words, or when the background changes. Look at the arrows. Some parts can be tricky, such as U, D, U, R, D, U, D, L, U, D, U, R. Don't worry, everyone misses those sometimes.


You can use Training Mode to isolate just a few bars of a song and practice that.



If you're missing it because it's going too fast, open the Options menu when you're choosing a song (how to do this will depend on your game: hold down Select, choose it from the difficulty menu or hold down X/O), and make it go slower. It should be much easier.
If you're missing it because you're falling, try standing in a different position.
If the steps seem too complicated for you to read, use a speed mod. This will spread the arrows apart and make reading easier. You would be surprised how much easier this can make some songs.
If the arrows seem to have nothing to do with the song, play with your eyes instead. Keep the music ON, but watch carefully for the arrows. You will quickly figure out exactly what beats the song arrows are following. This happens often with trance songs that have complex synth parts in the background. The answer is not always obvious.
If you still can't hear what rhythm you're supposed to be stepping to, check to make sure you have the right sound settings. If your TV is older you might have to set your game to Mono sound to hear the entire song.
 If you have your right foot on the Right arrow, and the left foot on the Down arrow, you'll probably not be ready. Try to keep facing the screen, and don't worry about having your feet on the pads the whole time. Stepping off of them sometimes helps.

 It's easiest to imagine a five petaled flower shape for this; the "petals" will actually serve as the leaves that you find atop a real strawberry.
 This will sit on top of the dark green felt, in the center.
 Then place the green felt in the center of the dark felt. Sew the leaves in place using a single large green cross stitch in the circle felt. This allows the green leaves to flap up, as they do on a real strawberry.


If desired, you can trim the edges of the strawberry leaves to make them appear a little more raggedy, as in nature. This is optional.
 The felt strawberry can now be displayed, used on another craft project or placed in a basket or box for a gift.

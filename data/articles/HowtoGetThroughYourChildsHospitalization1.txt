 Honesty is the best policy when it comes to talking to kids about a hospital stay. Decide how much is appropriate to share with them without increasing their anxiety. If you are unsure, ask to speak with a social worker or child life educator on staff.

Use minimally-threatening terms they can understand. For instance, you might say, “When you went to the doctor, they noticed a lump in your tummy. We had to bring you here so the doctors and nurses can look after you and make the lump go away.”;
, Children are naturally curious, and their imaginations may run wild if you don’t fill them in. Let your child know that they are welcome to ask you any questions they may have. If they have questions, do your best to answer them as honestly as you can.For instance, you might say, “I know that is a lot to take in. Let me know if you have any questions, or if you’re worried about anything. I’m happy to listen, if you are.” Discuss their worries or fears about the hospitalization by listening and offering reassurances.
If your child asks a question and you don’t know the answer, tell them you’ll find out. It’s okay to not have all the answers.
 Avoid explaining the procedures by saying they won’t hurt. For example, it would be cruel to tell a child that it won’t hurt for the nurse to draw blood. Instead, give your child a job to do, such as “Hold very still for me, okay?” This helps them feel in control and takes their focus away from any discomfort., Your child may become anxious if they wake up and find you gone, or come back to any empty room after testing. If you need to leave the hospital, be sure to tell them (and their nurse) that you’re leaving and give them an estimate of when you might return.

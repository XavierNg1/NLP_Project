 Nothing's worse that realizing you have to write an essay or do a report on something you have not been paying attention to. This will help you avoid getting lectured by the instructor for slacking off.;
, If your teacher is outright hinting that there will be a project or seems not to be giving out assignments often, there may be an upcoming large test or quiz.
 If you have any questions, ask the teacher! They'll be impressed by your initiative and wouldn't deny a student knowledge. That's their job. If a teacher is absolutely unavailable, ask a friend who knows what they're doing, or try to email the teacher; it actually works most of the time.
 If you try to do the whole project at once the day it's due, you'll be rushed and tempted to do a worse job just because you want to get it over with. If it's due in over a month, just work a little bit a day on it. If it's due in a week, then maybe set up a time every night to complete a major part of it. Design the schedule in a way that allows time for any activities you can't cancel, like other academic things, and make it so you have at least a bit of downtime-- the other teachers may still be giving you tests, and you have to be able to study. Do your other homework before you start work on the project, unless it's urgent.
 As you go along, make a checklist of things you have done and still need to do. This helps you map out what you are about to complete or what you have completed so far.
 It can be tempting to invite your pals over for a movie night or spend a day at the mall, but afterwards, you're going to feel pretty bad that you didn't work on the assignment. If they're your real friends, when you tell them about your project, they'll understand and give you a break.
 If that is impossible because you must wake early/go to bed late, try to take naps when you can.
 Turn it in the next day with a smile!

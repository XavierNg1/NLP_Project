 If you can't afford Photoshop but still want access to more features than Paint, you can use the free GIMP image editing program.
 This will be located in your list of tools, typically on the left side of the screen.
 When you create a text box, this will make a new layer. This is the biggest benefit to using an image editing program, as you can make changes to the text layer without affecting the original image.
 Before you start adjusting the formatting, type out the text you want to add so that you can see how it looks as you make changes.
 You'll want a font that makes the text easy to read. Calibri and Arial make for good standard fonts, while Impact is the font most typically used for memes.


Make sure to adjust the size of the font to meet your needs.
You can change the size of the text box if your text doesn't fit after making changes.
 You can pick from the color options or define a custom color. Make sure that the color contrasts well with the background. Choosing the wrong color can make it very difficult for the reader to discern the text.
 Once you've added your text, you can use the other image manipulation tools to make changes to it.


For example, you can use the Rotate tool to rotate your text on top of the image.
The Transform tools will allow you to bend and shape the text to match your intended effect.
Image editing programs give you more control over the color of your text as well, such as letting you use a gradient from the start to the end of the text.
You can adjust the transparency of the text, which can give the final product a more professional look.
 Most image editors will save the image as a project file unless you export it as an image. This will allow you to set your format and quality settings. Click "File" â†’ "Export As" to start the export process.

 To beat the heat, invest in an air conditioner and set it up in your living space. You may get a cheaper, portable model that you can set up in a room as needed. Or you may invest in a permanent air conditioner that cools your home. Weigh the costs against your ability to be comfortable in your home, especially if you live in a climate that often gets hot or warm.If you find air conditioners too noisy and expensive, you can try getting an air cooler instead. An air cooler works by drawing air through water. However, air coolers can be less effective than an air conditioner, especially in humid climates.;
, Floor fans and desk fans can be a good, cheap option for staying cool indoors. Set up floor fans in rooms you use often. Have desk fans in spots where you plan to sit and relax for long periods of time. You can also use handheld fans to stay cool when you move or walk around.If you find being indoors really hot and uncomfortable, try putting a bucket of ice in front of the fan. This will then blow cool air into the space and make it easier for you to cool down.
 Draw the shutters or blinds and keep them closed throughout the day to block out the sunlight. This can help to keep the temperatures in your home lower and more comfortable. Then, open the windows at night to let in cooler air.Get in the habit of keeping your shutters or blinds closed during the day and opening the windows at night so your home stays cool and comfortable.

 A boo boo bunny is a cute way to help a small child's bruise heal quickly. It involves folding a washcloth a certain way so it takes on the appearance of a rabbit, which will already cheer the child up before they use it.
 Towels are water-absorbent. Line a beach bag or fabric lunch bag. Line potholders or oven mitts.
 Use two layers of towels and secure the bag with double stitching. Make handles that reach around the bottom of the bag. Make the bag in any size or shape that's needed. Make two totes - one for each shoulder. Carry kindling or tools.
 Shred towels to stuff a pillow, cushion, bean bag chair, outdoor cushion, or a big cushion for the dog.
 Old towels can help keep heating bills down by keeping out the cold.

 Auditions are usually blocked out in ten-to-fifteen minutes segments scheduled back-to-back. If you’re late for your audition, there might not be space to fit you in.Showing up early will also give you time to relax and mentally prepare for your audition.
 The way your dress for your audition can be as important as how you actually perform your speech. Dress is an integral part of a performance as it reinforces the subject-matter of your speech.Remember: this is a performance. If you’re performing a comedy piece involving a used car salesman, you need to look the part. For example, you might wear a cheap, ill-fitting suit. If you’ll be going head-to-head with another student in a Congressional Debate, wear professional attire such as a dark dress or a tie and jacket.
 People often speak more quickly when they are nervous. Force yourself to slow down and maintain the same pace you used when you were practicing your speech., The goal of your speech is to engage your audience and get them interested in your topic. Making eye contact with the audience—in this case of an audition, the coach and possibly a few others—is one of the best ways to keep them focused on your topic without losing interest during your speech.Don’t look at just one person throughout your speech. Instead, maintain eye contact for three-to-five seconds with one person, then make eye contact with another person.
 Even though you’ve practiced your speech dozens of times and the topic is familiar to you, your audience is hearing if for the first time. Having high energy throughout your speech will engage the audience and make them feel like the topic is important and interesting., If you get stuck and forget a line from your speech or an argument you meant to make, don’t panic. Pause for a moment, take a deep breathe, and move on with your speech. It’s better to skip a line or a point than to linger on it and draw attention to your mistake.

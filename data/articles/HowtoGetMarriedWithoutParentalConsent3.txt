, To obtain emancipation by court order, you must follow the legal procedure in your state. See How to Get Emancipated as a Teen. If you can afford one or one will represent you pro bono, an attorney would be very beneficial. Though the process will vary between states, some common components of the process include:The petition. The petition is your request to the court. It says why you meet the requirements of the law to become emancipated and asks the court to grant you an order declaring you emancipated.
Service on the parents. In most states, you must notify your parents of this petition. Get a summons or citation from the clerk and have it served by the sheriff or other designated officer according to state law. If serving the parents is likely to cause a dangerous situation for the child, a judge can waive this requirement.
Hearing. The court will schedule a hearing to gather facts and evidence, hearing from the child, the parents, and any witnesses. The court will then make its decision and issue the appropriate order.

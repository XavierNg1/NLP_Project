 If you'd like a larger cloud, hot glue one or two smaller paper lanterns to a larger one., Pick off a large, cotton candy-sized lump of polyester stuffing. Draw a swirl of hot glue, then press the stuffing against the lantern.Work quickly. Hot glue sets up fast.
 Alternate between large, small, and medium-sized clumps. Be sure to cover the top and bottom of the lanterns as well.
 This time, apply the hot glue directly onto the lantern, then quickly press the stuffing into the glue. If you glued multiple lanterns together, be sure to fill the seams between the lanterns., Gently pull on the polyester tufts until the cloud is fluffy. Make some of the tufts larger than others. This will make your cloud look more cloud-like and less like cotton candy., For something quick and easy, tuck a battery-operated LED light into the lantern.Alternatively, you can fill the lantern with white string lights. If you use the icicle kind, you can even pull the strands out through the bottom of the cloud to make it look like rain.Make sure that the lights doesn't generate too much heat and never leave them unattended., Dig through the the fluff until you find the top hanging wire of your lantern. Tie some fishing line to it. If you attached multiple lanterns together, be sure to tie some fishing line to each one. Cover the gap at the top of the lantern back up when you are done., Insert some hooks into the ceiling. Tie small loops into the end of your fishing line. Slip the loops over the hooks. You will need one hook per lantern. This means that if your cloud is made from three lanterns, you will need three hooks.

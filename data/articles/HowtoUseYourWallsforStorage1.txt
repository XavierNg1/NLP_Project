 Buy a basic towel bar and metal S-hooks at a hardware or big-box store. Follow the towel bar instructions to attach it to a kitchen wall with available space. Hang the S-hooks from the bar. Hang pots and pans from the S-hooks.The benefit here is that you’ll free up cabinet space and the cookware is easier to reach.
It’s best to screw the towel bar into wall studs whenever possible. Since cookware weighs more than a towel, you’ll need the extra support.;
, Buy a sturdy magnetic knife strip from a department store or hardware store. Hang it on the wall over the counter where you are most likely to use the knives.The benefit of this is that by moving the knives to the wall, you free up the counter space that the knife block was using.
It also saves a bit of time grabbing a knife from the wall rather than from the knife block.
 Go to the hardware store and buy a rectangular piece of pegboard, as well as some hooks that are designed for pegboard use. Pegboards come in many sizes, so choose what suits your wall space best. Hang cooking utensils or other kitchen items for quick access.You’ll also need a minimum of four screws to secure the board to the wall at the corners.
 Buy a ½ inch (1.3cm) wooden plank, some mason jars, screws, and circular pipe clamps. Use screws to attach the pipe clamps to the board. Slide the mason jars into the ring clamps and tighten the clamps. Hang the board on the wall over your counter.Use the jars to store utensils, spices, change, batteries, toothpicks or almost anything that fits in the jars.
Be sure to screw the board into wall studs so it’s secure.

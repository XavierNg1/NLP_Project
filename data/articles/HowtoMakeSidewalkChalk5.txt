 Mix the two together until there are no streaks.
 Try to fill each bag about one third of the way with the mixture., Use a different color for each bag. The more drops you add, the brighter your color will be.


You can also use liquid watercolor paints. This will make the chalk easier to clean up in the end.
 You can do this by jiggling the bag or by massaging it. You should be left with a very thick liquid. There should be no clumps or streaks of color.


When closing the bag, try to leave as little air as possible inside it.
 Some people like to add the baking soda directly into the plastic bags, while others find that making little bombs first is easier. To make a baking soda bomb, do the following:


Cut a paper towel into fourths; you'll end up with four, smaller squares.
Drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of baking soda in the center of each square.
Fold the paper towel around it to create a little bundle. Don't wrap the towel so tightly that the bundle can't easily open on its own.
 Open each bag wide enough to slip the baking soda inside. Seal it quickly. Once again, make sure that there is as little air left in the bag.


If you made baking soda bombs, simply drop one bomb into each bag.
If you did not make a baking soda bomb, simply add 1 tablespoon of baking soda into each bag.
The bag must be completely sealed. If there are any holes or leaks, the air will escape through the gap rather than building up inside the bag.
 Step back quickly or you will get sprayed by the exploding chalk. The baking soda will react with the vinegar, causing the bag to expand. Eventually, the bag will pop or burst open, spraying the liquid chalk across the sidewalk.

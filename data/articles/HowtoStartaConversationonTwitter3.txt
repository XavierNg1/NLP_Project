 Starting a direct conversation can be done on both the Twitter app or the Twitter website. Launch the app by tapping the Twitter icon on your home screen or app drawer, or open a new browser tab and visit the Twitter website.
 Enter your Twitter handle and password into the given fields and tap/click “Sign in” to access your account.


The desktop version will feature your login text fields on the top right side of the page.
 For smartphone users, the Twitter app’s post box is at the bottom, a text box that says, “What’s happening.” If you are using the desktop website, you can find the Twitter post box at the top of the screen, next to your profile picture.
 You can do this by typing @ followed by the Twitter handle of the person you are trying to talk to.
 Once you have their name in, type the message you want them to see to start the conversation.
 This will send the Tweet to your feed and make it so that the person can see the tweet and respond. Just wait for them to answer you, and that is all there is to it. You have started a conversation with Twitter.

 iTunes won’t allow you to switch countries or regions with an active Match subscription, which stores all of your music in iCloud. Cancel your subscription or wait for it to expire and then switch countries. To cancel iTunes Match,


Open iTunes and click on the App Store link at the top of the toolbar
Click Sign in and enter your Apple ID username and password
Click on Store → View My Account
Find the "iTunes in the Cloud" section and click "Turn Off Auto-Renew" next to iTunes Match., If you have a season pass or multi-pass, you’ll need to complete them in order to switch countries. You must either complete the pass by watching the episodes associated with the pass or wait for the pass to expire.
 Wait at least 30 days without renewing a rental and you should be able to switch accounts.
 Unfortunately, you need to use up all credit on your store balance before you switch accounts. If you have less money than you could use to buy something, add a credit card to your account; then purchase something slightly above the amount for which you have credit. The credit will be used up and the remaining amount will be charged to your credit card. Without existing credit, you should be able to switch accounts.
 Wait several hours for the refund to be applied to your account, then try switching again. It usually only takes a matter of hours for the refund to be issued.
 If you're having trouble switching countries because you can't remember your Apple ID or password, click here.
 If you've tried every other trick in the book and still can't get things to work, try updating iTunes to the newest version.

 Some types of straw are too delicate to wash, even by hand. Most straw hats are made from sturdier types of straw, however, which makes a gentle hand-washing possible. Check the manufacturer's tag. Baku and shantung straw is likely to be sturdy.If you are unable to find out what type of straw the hat is made from, gently bend the rim of the hat. If it resists or begins to draw back to its original shape slightly, it might be durable enough. If it bends easily or starts to fray, it is too delicate.
 Ropes, ribbons, buttons, or other elements are often held onto a straw hat with small pieces of crafting wire. Wire can be easily unwound so that the decorations are simple to remove. If the decorations are held on by thread, however, you do not need to remove them. You are more likely to damage them when trying to sew them back on rather than while cleaning.
 For light cleaning that can't be done with a brush, use a damp washcloth. Carefully dab the hat directly, sweeping away grime from its surface. Do not allow the straw to become damp itself., If simple water isn't working to clean your hat, you can use hydrogen peroxide as a gentle cleaner. Fill a spray bottle, half with hydrogen peroxide and half with water.


Spray the solution onto a soft cloth. Carefully wipe down the entire hat with the cloth.
For especially stubborn stains, spray the solution directly onto the hat and wipe it off with a washcloth. Avoid soaking the straw, as this may cause it to warp and shrink.

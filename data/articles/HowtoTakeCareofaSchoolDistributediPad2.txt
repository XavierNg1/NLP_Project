 It is absolutely not recommended that you use water when cleaning your iPad. You need to use a smooth surface rag and clean all the oily spots or any dirt.
 Using a stylus can prevent oily spots, and it is naturally better for the iPad than using your fingers.
 Even though it may not be in water, the steam can carry water particles into the outlets of your iPad, causing your iPad to act unnaturally.
 This can cause problems with the functioning.
 You could easily lose control and drop your iPad, which would easily break the glass.

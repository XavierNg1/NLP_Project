 In addition to helping you identify old coins, many coin catalogs list values for the coins they display. You will need to consult as current a catalog as you can find, as the values will change from year to year.


A good reference for U.S. coins is R.S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins," popularly known as the "Red Book" for its cover.
A good reference for world coins is Krause's Standard Catalog of World Coins.
 Certain numismatists (coin collectors) have been formally trained in how to evaluate coins to determine their conditions and values. You can find these appraisers by contacting a local coin dealer, using the directories of the Professional Numismatist's Guild or the Professional Currency Dealer Association, or using the websites of the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) or the International Society of Appraisers (ISA).


Familiarize yourself with the terms an appraisers' group uses for its membership. The ISA divides its membership into members, who are credentialed appraisers, and associate members, who are not. Members are further subdivided by their level of training and experience, with certified members ranking higher than accredited members.
You can expect to pay a fee for an appraiser's services.

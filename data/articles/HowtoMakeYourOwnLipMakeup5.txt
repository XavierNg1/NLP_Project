 Take the lid off, and roll it up until it won't let you roll anymore. Cut or push the chapstick out of the container, and get as much as you can out. Put it in a microwave-safe bowl.
 Stir it, and once it's liquid, get ready to put color in.
 Mix it in as best you can, but if it's lumpy, you can heat it a little more.


You can use several things for color:
Kool Aid or drink mixtures
Natural food powders
Colored food oils (such as cherry oil)
Crushed rose petals
A little bit of another lip gloss or lipstick.
Â You can use old lip balm containers, plastic jewelry boxes, pretty much anything that is clean, food-safe and easy to store. Put in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes or let it harden at room temperature. Wait until it's hardened until applying.

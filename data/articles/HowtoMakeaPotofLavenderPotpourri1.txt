 When the lavender is grown, you will be able to cut some of the flowering heads off for turning into potpourri. After cutting, lay the flowering heads on the table.;
, Holding the tip of the head, push your fingers down and scatter the little seeds into the old bowl.
 When you have enough seeds, put the bowl to one side.
 Take the lavender seeds and scatter them around the bowl.
, Enjoy the lovely, relaxing scent of lavender.

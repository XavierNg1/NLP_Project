 Your partner can be a good gauge for how much you talk about your relationship. Find out if your partner is uncomfortable with how much you talk about the relationship and how much information you share. If they want you to hold back more, you probably are sharing too much.If your partner is a private person, talking about the relationship with people can make them uncomfortable. They may think that anything you say about the relationship is talking too much about it.
 If you talk too much about your relationship, you should talk with your partner about it. Together, set boundaries about what is acceptable to talk about and how much is acceptable.Tell your partner, “I think I have been talking too much about our relationship. I want to set boundaries about what we feel comfortable sharing and how often we feel comfortable talking about our relationship.”

, Even if you are sharing with your closest friends, telling them something that your partner told you in confidence is not right. This is considered talking too much about your relationship because you are sharing things that should remain private between you and your partner.Trust is key to your relationship. By telling others things that were told to you in private, you are violating your partner’s trust.

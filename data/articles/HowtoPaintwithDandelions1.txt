 Go for a walk in the park, your garden or in a field and look for healthy specimens. Pick them with lots of stem left intact.


Choose even sizes or a variety of sizes, depending on what you want to achieve with your artwork or craft project.;
, This will keep them together and prevents them from being crushed by being held.
 Yogurt or pudding bottles are ideal containers for squirting paint into, as they have wide openings to let your hand in easily.


Choose paints that will work on the medium you're pressing the flower heads onto, for example, glass paint if working with jars, paper paint if working with paper, etc.
 You may need to snip the stem down a little to be able to hold it comfortably.
 Don't immerse it completely––just aim for a light paint coating as evenly as possible across the flower heard.
 This might be paper, a book, a jar, etc. Don't press too hard or too long, or the image will smudge and not be recognizable. Lift gently but quickly and leave the flower impression in place.
 Either use the same flower and color or use different flowers with different colors/sizes. You'll need to use a new flower after a few presses, as the flower won't remain strong and the paint will clog the fine details quickly.
 Done!

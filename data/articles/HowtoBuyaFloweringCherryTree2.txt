 Discuss your planting scheme with the professionals at the nursery or garden center prior to shopping there. Once you decide to buy, have the salesperson help you pick a healthy tree.
 Try websites such as arborday.org or naturehills.com, which offer a variety of plants and trees available for shipping with guarantees of quality. Reputable online nurseries will provide descriptions and growing conditions for the plants and trees, and should also provide detailed shipping information and prices.

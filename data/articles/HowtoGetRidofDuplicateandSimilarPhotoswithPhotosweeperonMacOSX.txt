 Drag&drop a folder to the Browser to find photos inside. Drag another folder if need.;
,


Ð¡lick the "Media Browser" on the toolbar to show the Media Browser window. By default, your library from the "Pictures" folder is shown. If you have a library at other place you need to add your library to this window by pressing the "+" button and choosing your iPhoto library in the standard open panel. The Media Browser displays a library content including photos, albums and events.
Select photos in the Media Libraries window and drag & drop them to the Browser or just press the "up arrow" button. You can drag a whole library, an event or an album as well as photos. The browser must show them with a green ribbon and an iPhoto's icon on each.
 Better to use the "Duplicates Only" method to find duplicate photos (identical photos). To find similar photos, the "Time+Bitmap" method is recommended.



Results mode displays all found duplicates (including "masters") in groups and you need to decide which photos to mark for removal and which to keep (usually you need to keep one photo for each group). You can do it either automatically by pressing the Auto Mark at the toolbar or manually by selecting each photo and pressing Enter for a photo you don't like. As result, photos are marked.
When you press the Auto Mark button on the toolbar, photos in each group except one (a master) are marked according to rules defined in the Preferences window. For instance, if you have 4 photos in one group, 3 will be marked for removal and 1 will be kept. The "Auto Mark" rules determine which one photo in each group is kept. By default, the "Auto Mark" rules are configured to keep the largest photo.
 Click the "Show Marked" at the toolbar to get into Marked mode. Marked mode displays marked photos only. Select all photos and click the "Move to Trash" button. After removal, photos are in the system Trash for files and in the iPhoto's Trash for items from iPhoto.

 But first create a style that uses only single space lines, I call mine "appellate brief cover par style." To do this, go to "Format," then scroll down to styles and formatting. This time click the first icon for paragraph styles. Then right click, chose "new," and create a style for your cover page. Go through the same process to create styles for the footnotes, body, ect. You can create a new style for each or just modify an existing paragraph style.

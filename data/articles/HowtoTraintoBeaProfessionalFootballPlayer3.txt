 You will need to be very dedicated if you've set your sights on turning professional. This means keeping fit, eating the right foods and always getting enough sleep. You must train daily but be sure not to train too hard and tear a muscle as this can set you back far. When you feel your muscles starting to burn, do some stretches and take a break. Whatever position you play, you need to stretch your muscles, arms and legs a lot. Here are some stretches.
 Find a route in your local area. This could be a park that you can run through/around or just a few streets/blocks near your house. Where you go doesn't quite matter but be sure to run everyday and try to run faster and further each day. The key to football is small bursts of speed. To practice this, jog for a few meters and then sprint for the same amount of time. Go back to jogging and then sprinting, etc. Try not to stop.

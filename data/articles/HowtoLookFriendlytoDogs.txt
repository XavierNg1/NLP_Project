 If you are riding a bike or scooter, slow down because dogs are often scared of wheels. If you are running and talking loudly to your friends, stop running and walk at a slow pace. Stop any talking or shouting around dogs.;
, Not too close but just close enough that he can catch your scent. If the dog is interested, let it come to you. Avoid dogs that don't have people around them. Always ask the owner before petting the dog. Remember to follow everything in the first step. Ask the owner about the dog, like name, age, etc.
 This looks less scary to dogs, mainly smaller dogs. If it is a bigger down, slightly crouch down. If it is a smaller toy dog, bend down to your knees, a few feet away from the dog.
 Let the dog smell your hand before petting it. If you run over and squeal and gush and make a big deal, that isn't very fun to the dog, as much fun as it is to you.
 Don't give it a rowdy push or something mean to the dog. Stroke his/her head gently.
 If the dog is growling and baring his/her teeth, it is a definite sign to back off!. A lot of smaller breeds may growl or hide behind his/her owner.

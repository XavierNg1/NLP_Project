 Slice open your sub and spread your amount of tomato sauce inside, spreading gently with a spoon.;
, Grate your preferred cheese over the layer of sauce and make sure that it tops neatly.
 At the moment, it'll be a plain cheese pizza sub, but nothing's wrong with adding some pizazz. Feel free to choose your favorite toppings from pineapple slices to olives, use different toppings you enjoy adding.
 Turn your grill on to all the way high and have it preheat.
 Place your raw pizza sub on a baking tray and place it in the grill with the door slightly left open, if possible.

Leaving the door a bit open will help you check on the subs occasionally and avoid having it burn.
 Remove the pizza sub out when the bread has fully crisped and the cheese has melted, usually about five minutes. Serve and enjoy!

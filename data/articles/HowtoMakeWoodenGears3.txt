 Use your wooden shank as a handle for the larger gear. If you don’t have a smooth shank you can use any piece of spare wood available to you. Position the shank on the outer part of the gear without overlapping into the gears, and then attach it using wood glue. Add a small wood screw to ensure a secure connection.
 Connect the gears to a contraption like a box joint in order to test them properly. If you don’t have a contraption already built, you can create your own test contraption. The key is for the smaller gear to be positioned vertically and the larger gear to be at a 90 degree angle. You can create stands out of spare wood that attach to the gears at their center point.
 Ensure that there isn’t any place where the gears seem to struggle. Take note of any location where there seems to be a resistance with a pencil.









If your teeth are of unequal size, you'll have to remove some material from the groove between the teeth.Use your wood filer to file away any resistance you experience as the gears turn.

 It is easier to attach the paper to the back and sides of the diorama than to draw inside it. Cut out the background shape just inside the line so that it will fit inside easily.
 Cut them out and lay them aside.
 You may choose to draw geographic features, coral, seaweed or tidal lines. For extra definition, draw these features on colored construction paper and glue them onto the background.
 Use craft glue and smooth it into a thin layer with a popsicle stick. Press it gently into the inside of your box or tin and smooth it with your fingers.
 Your choices will depend upon what scene you are depicting. The following are some popular ocean diorama ideas:


Use green pipe cleaners for seaweed and pink or red pipe cleaners for coral. You can twist the pipe cleaners gently to indicate swaying seaweed in a tide or to form coral shapes. Curl the pipe cleaner slightly on the end, as though trying to make a stand for it. Then, use a layer of craft glue to affix the cleaner to the bottom of the diorama.
Gather rocks from a river bed or garden to use in a rocky ocean scene. Wash the rocks with soap and water, to help them stick to your surface better. After they are dry, put a layer of craft glue on the bottom of the rock and stick it inside your diorama. You can stack rocks, if you want.
Find small sea shells to glue on the diorama floor. You can collect tiny shells at a beach, or you may be able to find a small number of shells at a craft store in the beading section.
Put a layer of glue over the remaining floor of your diorama, using a paint brush. Drop layers of sand into the bottom to cover the glue. Shake off the remaining sand outside.

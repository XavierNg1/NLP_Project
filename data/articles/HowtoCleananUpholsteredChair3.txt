 Check your chair’s label to be sure that steaming it won’t shrink the fabric or otherwise ruin it. If the cleaning code on the chair’s label says that it cannot be cleaned with water or water-based solutions, avoid steaming it. Consult with a furniture cleaning professional if you’re not sure.
 Rub the steam cleaner over your chair in a grid to cover the entire piece. Spend extra time on any heavily soiled sections. Use the scrub brush or microfiber pad attachments on any hard to clean areas. Brush away the dirt that the steam loosened.


Steam cleaners can be rented at most hardware stores.
 Clean a small spot using an iron that has steaming capability. Fill your iron with water. Set it for the heat that is most appropriate for the fabric you are cleaning. For example, use a lower heat setting for delicate fabrics made of synthetic materials or silk, and use higher heat for cotton. Put the iron over the spot and hit the steam button. Brush away any debris loosened by the steam.

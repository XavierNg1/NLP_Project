 One of the most important steps to take towards keeping a clean, organized purse is frequently checking for and discarding half eaten snacks, gum wrappers, and expired coupons. It’s easy to let scraps of trash build up in your purse, but try to throw them away more regularly., Even after you’ve gone through your purse and thrown out any trash, the inside lining of your purse may be dirty. Use a small, gentle vacuum to suck out the particles of food and dirt that may have collected in the bottom.
 By keeping potentially messy items in separate pouches, you can easily find items and also avoid stains.You could have a pouch for snacks, writing utensils, makeup, and more.
 Try not to keep items in your purse that you only need from time to time. If you don’t use it nearly every day, it doesn’t belong in your purse. If you must have it, try to have the smallest, lightest bottle or container of it.


For instance, you don’t need a full-sized bottle of perfume in your purse.
 As soon as you leave a store or restaurant, don’t just throw your change and receipts loosely into your purse. Having specific locations within your purse to keep these items is essential to staying organized.

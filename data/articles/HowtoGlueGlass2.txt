 You could decorate a glass jar with fabric or paper cutouts, or make a 3D mosaic by placing ceramic or glass tiles over a flower vase. Each combination of two materials can only be bonded by specific glues.


Browse your hardware store or art supply store and read the glue labels to see which one is suitable for the materials you chose.
A glue that dries clear is preferable for most art projects.
 A few simple steps will quicken the decorating process and ensure that the glass bonds strongly.









Wash the glass thoroughly with soap and water.
Dry the glass with a clean paper towel.
Empty some glue into a plastic container. This will make it easy to apply with a paintbrush, and cause it to dry slightly for a useful tacky consistency.
 Cover any areas you intend to decorate. Wipe off any excess blobs and wait for it to dry.








The setting time for the glue varies depending on the type of glue used. In most cases 5-10 minutes should be enough.
 Once the first coat has dried, adding a small amount of glue to an area will make it wet and tacky, preventing your decorations from slipping.









Wait another 5-10 minutes for this to take effect.
 If they slide off, wait for the glue to dry a little more and try again.









Apply, wait, and decorate each area in turn. Feel free to apply glue to a new area while you're still decorating the previous one.
 Let dry.
 Let dry for 15 minutes.
 Allow the glue to stand 24 hours before handling the object roughly, then enjoy your new decoration!

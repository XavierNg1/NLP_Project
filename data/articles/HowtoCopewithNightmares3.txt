 Recall your nightmare while you are awake and write it down as if it were a story. Try to capture the narrative of the nightmare and any details you feel are relevant.Don't be afraid to recall your nightmare. Remember why you are revisiting it.
Be as honest and accurate as you can in your recollection.
 Take charge of your nightmare and rewrite any part of it you want. The main idea here is to transform the negative aspects of your nightmare into positive aspects. By restructuring your nightmare, you eliminate the original mental cause of the nightmare. Try changing the following aspects:


Change the ending to a positive one.
Change the overall theme.
Change the story line to take the dream to a better place.
Change any details you would like.
 Actively imagine the nightmare during the day, this time with the changes you have made. Rehearsing your nightmare in this way will help tell your mind that the positive new narrative you have crafted is to replace the old nightmare.Do this for at least once a day, for a few minutes.
Repetition of this re-imagining can help the effect.

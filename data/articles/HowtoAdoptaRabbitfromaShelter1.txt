 Your local animal shelter is the best place to start looking. Do a google search or visit the Petfinder website to find an animal shelter near you.Shelters typically receive a lot of rabbits a few weeks after Easter.This is an ideal time to find a rabbit to adopt.


It is unlikely, but if the shelter does not have any rabbits, ask them to put you on the waiting list so you can be notified.;
, If you are unable to adopt from a shelter, a rabbit rescue group is a good alternative. Many rescue groups are affiliated with local animal shelters. Like shelters, rescue groups take very good care of the rabbits until they can find a home for them. Visit the House Rabbit Society webpage to find a rescue group in your area.If you adopt through a rescue group, find out as much information about the organization as possible. Ask some questions such as:What is their adoption policy?
How do they decide which rabbits are adoptable and which rabbits are not?
How do they care for the animals?
Do they offer any post-adoption services?
Rabbits that are found by rescue groups may be living in a foster home with a volunteer.
 Once you have found a shelter, go and look around. Pay attention to how the rabbits are housed. The rabbits should be indoors and in a cat room or in a separate room for small animals. Each cage should have:A litterbox
Hay
Food and water
Rug
Toys
A card that details the rabbit's personality
If the rabbits are not housed in a good environment, consider adopting from a different shelter.
 Adoption policies will vary at each shelter. It is important that you understand and are comfortable with the policy before you begin the adoption process. Some questions you may ask include:


What is the adoption fee?
What is included in the adoption fee (e.g. medical exam, spay and neutering, etc.)?
What paperwork is required?
Are there any post-adoption services?
How long is the adoption process?

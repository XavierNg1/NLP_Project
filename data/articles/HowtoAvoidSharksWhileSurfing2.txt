 Instead of surfing alone, surf with a buddy or a group of people. Sharks target individuals and are less likely to approach a group..


Surfing with a friend increases the chances of your survival, in the unlikely even a shark attack occurs. Most shark attack fatalities are due to not getting help fast enough. A friend who can get you out of the water and notify the lifeguard could save your life., Sharks can't see colors, but they can see contrast (like a black and white swimming suit).Shiny objects may catch the light and resemble fish scales. Remove all jewelry before entering the water and stick to wetsuits and swimsuits in solid, bland colors.Yellow, orange, white, and flesh-colored suits should be avoided.If you have a high-contrast tan (areas of your exposed skin are very dark, while other areas are very white), wear a suit that covers those white areas, so you appear uniform in color., If you get injured while surfing and start to bleed, get out of the water. A little blood in the water can attract sharks from up to 1/3 of a mile away.Some experts also recommend women take a break from surfing during menstruation. Though it is unlikely sharks associate the blood discharged during menstruation with feeding, the other fluids in the discharge may arouse a shark's curiosity

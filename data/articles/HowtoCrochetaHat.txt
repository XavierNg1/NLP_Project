 Whether you're making this for an adult or a child will greatly change your yarn needs and crocheting tactics. Measure the circumference of the recipient's head. If that's not an option, follow these general guidelines:
3 - 6 mos: circumference = 13-14" (33 - 36 cm); hat height = 6.5 - 7" (15 - 18 cm)
6 - 12 mos: circumference = 16 -19" (40 - 48 cm); hat height = 7.5" (18 cm)
Toddler: circumference = 18 - 20" (46 - 48 cm); hat height = 8" (20 cm)
Child: 19 - 20 1/2" (48 - 51 cm); hat height = 8.5" (22 cm)
Teens: 20 1/2 - 22" (53 - 56 cm); hat height = 9 - 10" (25 cm)
Adult woman: 21.5 - 22.5" (55 - 60 cm); hat height = 11" (28 cm)
Adult man: 23 - 24" (58 - 61 cm); hat height = 11 - 11.5" (28 - 30 cm)
The circumference of the hat should be a bit smaller than the circumference of the head. About 1 inch (2.5 cm) will do. The ones listed are general head circumferences, not hat circumferences.;
, To crochet a hat, you'll need one skein of yarn, a crochet hook, a plastic tapestry needle, and a pair of scissors. All of these items can be purchased at your local craft store.
 This simply means to join two ends of a chain and work in a circle. To get started, chain 4. Then join together with a slip stitch to form a circle.
 Then mark the beginning of the row. Where your hook is now is the "beginning" of your new row and where it will end when you've completed your next circle.
 Join together with a slip stitch.
 On the next row, do 1 single crochet in the first stitch, then 2 in the next stitch. Repeat this step until you've achieved the width you want. Keep increasing your rounds until the circle you've created covers the top of the head.
 Repeat this step for as many rows as you'd like. Do fewer rows if you'd only like the hat to reach the top of the ears; do more if you want the ears covered.
 If you do choose to do this, simply increase your stitches again for a few more rows, by putting 1 single crochet in the first stitch, 2 in the next, and so on for as many rows as you like. Doing this to a only a few rows will make the end of the hat roll up a bit; doing it to several will create a floppier effect. Then tie off.
 With the tapestry needle, weave the tail back into the stitches of the hat.

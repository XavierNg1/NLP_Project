 Once your baby is awake, you need to try to keep her awake so that you can feed her. Laugh at her, talk to her, and look her in the eyes to keep her attention on you.


You can also try tickling her.
 When you tuck her up against your body, your warmth and heartbeat can lull your baby back to sleep.


Instead, hold her with one arm and hold her head with your other hand, keeping her a small distance away from your body heat.
 When you see that your baby is starting to lose interest and fall back to sleep, try to move her to your other breast. This movement will help to keep her awake and engaged.


You can also try removing your nipple from your babyâ€™s mouth. Moving to release your nipple will help to wake your baby up. It will also help to remind her that she is still hungry. You can also try dropping a little milk on her mouth.
 Make a movement like you are going to burp your baby. This movement will help to wake her up, while also helping her to burp. Once she has burped, settle her back down on to your other breast.
 Changes in the pressure of the milk your baby is receiving can help to keep her awake. You can change how much milk your baby gets by massaging your breast and squeezing the area around your nipple.


However, do not give your baby too much milk, as she could choke.

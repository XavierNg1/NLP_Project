 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, You'll find this in the fifth group of options in the Settings menu. On older devices, tap "Mail, Contacts, Calendar" instead.
, There are three types of alerts, each with individual alert time settings.


Birthdays - These are birthdays that are added to your calendar from your iPhone's contact details.
Events - These are events that you've created and added to your calendar that take place at a specific time.
All-Day Events - These are events that you've created that are set to take the entire day, or that don't have a specific time.
 When selecting times for birthdays and all-day events, you can choose to be notified on the day of at 9 AM, or on one of the days leading up. When selecting times for regular events, you can choose between minutes, hours, days, or a week before the event.


A checkmark will appear next to the time that you select.
Each type of alert uses its own schedule, so changing one will not affect the other two.
You can still change the alert time for individual events when you are creating them.
 This switch can be found on the Default Alert Times menu, and is used to inform you when you need to leave based on your location and traffic conditions. This feature only works if your events have locations.


This feature is enabled by default.

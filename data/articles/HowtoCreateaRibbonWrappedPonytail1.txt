 Slip a hair tie that matches your hair color onto your wrist. Use your hands a brush to gather your hair back into a low ponytail. Try to get it as smooth and sleek as possible.






;
, Use your other hand to slip the hair tie off and wrap it around the base of your ponytail. Depending on the thickness of you hair, you'll probably need to wrap it two to three times.
 The longer the ribbon is, the further down your ponytail it will be able to go. The wrapped ponytail that appears on the runway is covered three-fourths of the way by ribbon. You can make yours shorter than that.








Plan on cutting the ribbon about four times the length of your ponytail.
You can use a ribbon that matches your hair color or a bright, interesting color.
For something more chic, try suede or velvet.
 Find the center of the ribbon, and place it under the ponytail, right over the elastic. Pull both ends up towards the ceiling until they are equal length.
 Bring the left ribbon over the top of the ponytail so that it covers the elastic. Pull the right ribbon over the left ribbon, forming a cross. Gently tug on both ribbons to tighten the hold.
 Bring the ribbons under the ponytail and cross them, just like you did on the top. Try to get them as close to where the ribbon is as possible, so that there is no gap.
 Keep the ribbons nice and tight so that they bind your hair and no gaps are visible. For a neater finish, cross the same ribbon over first each time; don't switch up the order. You can keep going until you run out of ribbon, or until your ponytail is covered as far as you'd like. The traditional ribbon-wrapped ponytail is covered three-fourths of the way, but you can cover less than that.
 Tie the ribbons together in a tight, double-knot. Trim off any excess ribbon, if necessary.

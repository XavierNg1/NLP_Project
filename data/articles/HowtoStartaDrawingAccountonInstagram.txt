 All you need is an easy to remember username, password, and email. You can use your facebook to register if you'd like. You can also upload your profile picture if you'd like but you can do that later on.;
, Once you're registered, you can start uploading your drawings.
 I cannot stress this enough. It is vital that you add a watermark to each of your drawings so that no one can take it and claim it as theirs. You may use a font app like "Phonto" or you may hand-write it on your artwork. Make sure your instagram username is big enough that it can be easily read and so that it cannot be cropped off of the drawing.
 How can you spread your talent if you don't have any followers to see your posts?

, Remember, Instagram and most social media is about creating a community with people whom you share like interests. Don't be one of the people who spams, instead leave honest comments like 'great job!' and many people will check out your account without the spammy message of "I'm a new account, please check out my drawings of (things that you drew)" . You can even ask big accounts if they're willing to give you a shoutout if you make them a fansign: a drawing of their username in a creative way. You can also direct message them with a piece of your artwork and ask if they could debut it to a larger audience. Remember, even if you're turned down, keep trying!

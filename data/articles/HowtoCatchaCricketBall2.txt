 Be familiar with where you are standing, whether you are near the boundary or fielding in slip or gully. This will help in avoiding fallout with another player.


Don't rush over every ball that goes high. Make an effort only for those which are either over you or in no-man's land.
 You must react within seconds . If you receive a catch over your chest take a step or two back and catch the ball.
 It is essential for a fielder to keep eye contact with the ball. Keep your eyes on the ball until it passes you else it would result in a dropped catch.
 Make the cup with your hands and let the ball rest on your palm.
 Practice taking the catch over and over, whilst concentrating on using perfect form for each catch. Soon the catches will become second nature.

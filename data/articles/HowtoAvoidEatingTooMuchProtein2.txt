 If you have found that you have too much protein in your diet, you need to make some changes. You can reduce the protein in your diet back to a normal level, by filling that space alternative healthy foods. Instead of grabbing for that protein bar, snack on a piece of fruit.You can try:


1 medium apple – 0.5 grams protein.
1 cup grapes – 0.6 grams protein.
1 cup blueberries – 1.1 grams protein.
1 medium banana – 1.3 grams protein.
1 kiwi – 0.8 grams protein.
1 cup cantaloupe – 1.3 grams protein.
 Vegetables should take up the most room on your plate. Veggies are full of vitamins and mineral that are essential to a healthy diet. Choose a smaller serving of protein, and fill that space with health-supportive vegetables.Toss mixed veggies in olive oil and roast them in the oven – 2 grams protein per ½ cup.
Choose a green salad for lunch – average 5 grams protein per bowl.
Snack on raw veggies, like carrots, celery, or chopped bell pepper – 3 grams protein per 2 cups.
 Although some modern weight loss fads may have said differently, complex carbohydrates are your friend. Whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Plus, they give you energy!Try eating brown rice (5 grams protein per cup) or quinoa (13.1 grams protein per cup) with meals.
Grab a rice cake for a quick snack (1 gram protein per rice cake).
If you eat pasta or bread, choose whole grain options (7 grams of protein per 1 cup cooked pasta).
 The final ingredient in a healthy balanced diet is the inclusion of healthy fats. That’s right: not all fat is bad for you. Healthy fats build your brain and help your body run. Oils contain very little protein.Some good healthy fat choices include:


Oils – coconut, olive.
Nuts and nut butters – almonds, peanut butter.
Hummus.
Avocado.

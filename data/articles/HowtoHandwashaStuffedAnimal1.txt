 A garbage bag will keep you from spilling while you clean. If you don’t have a bag, you can apply the baking soda directly to the animal..;
, You want about ½ cup of baking soda for an average-sized stuffed animal.If your stuffed animal is bigger or smaller, you can adjust the amount of baking soda appropriately.
 This will agitate the baking soda and allow it to penetrate the stuffed animal.
 This will give the baking soda time to interact with the dirt and clean it off.
 You can use several methods for this:


Shake off the baking soda,
Brush the baking soda with your hand,
Use a cloth to remove the baking soda from the stuffed animal,
Use a handheld vacuum cleaner if you really want to be thorough.

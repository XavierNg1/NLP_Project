 Your glasses shouldn’t be the main focus of your look; they should add to your look. Otherwise your glasses can look costumey instead of fashionable. Your eyeglasses shouldn’t look like an afterthought, though; they are a purposeful accessory that should add interest to your appearance.Try choosing your glasses in steps. Start out with frames that aren’t overly dramatic. As you become accustomed to wearing your frames with confidence, you can slowly move up to bolder styles that still feel complimentary to your personality and style., Small, dainty earrings will add polish to your look. Avoid long, bulky, and dangly earrings. Your glasses are a fashion accessory and you don’t want your earrings to compete with them. Consider the color of your frames when selecting your jewelry.For example, try round or square stud earrings that give off a nice sparkle.
Eyeglasses with black frames can go with any color of jewelry. If your frames are tortoise or brown, consider wearing gold jewelry, If your frames are clear, silver, or a cool tone like blue or green, opt for silver metals and jewelry with stones.
 Consider taking your glasses with you when you visit your hair stylist for a cut or style, so that you can make sure it will compliment your frames. As a rule of thumb, think in opposites: if you have soft frames, go with a bold hairstyle, and vice versa. If you have wide frames, avoid hairstyles with a lot of volume on the sides – go for height on top instead. If your frames are large, avoid long, low-volume hairstyles. Try layered styles with volume on the sides. For small frames, don’t wear your hair in a style that will box in your facial features.If you have bangs that touch the top of your frames, make sure to maintain the right length of your bangs by getting them trimmed every three weeks.Avoid wearing large, floppy, overwhelming hats with glasses, unless you’re wearing sunglasses and going to the beach.

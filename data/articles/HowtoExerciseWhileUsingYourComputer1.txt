 Check the Ergonomic Guide at ergo.human.cornell.edu/ergoguide.html to see how your desk compares to the recommended set up. Updating your positioning to be ergonomically correct may be even more important than exercising at your desk in the long run, because you can prevent back pain, eye strain and repetitive stress injuries.


The most commonly ignored ergonomic rules include placing your monitor at eye level, sitting at a slightly reclined angle with your feet flat on the floor, placing your keyboard flat and using lumbar support. Also important is taking micro breaks where you frequently stand and walk around in order to relax your eyes and stretch your muscles.

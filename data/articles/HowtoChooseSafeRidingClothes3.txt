 Don't wear jeans with lots of zippers or attachments (such as chains, lots of buttons, etc.), as these can get caught on tack and cause accidents.
 Jeans should be slightly looser, in order to allow you to move freely when you ride. Jodhpurs and breeches are generally designed to stretch, or otherwise cut to allow for free movement. These should fit more closely, for both looks and comfort.

 Shadowboxing is a term for practicing without an opponent. This exercise can increase your speed and improve your form. To shadowbox properly, imagine your opponent standing in front of you. Next, imagine the different types of attacks they may use on you. React to these attacks with the same speed and force you would use on a real opponent.Begin your workout from a fighting stance. Everything you do needs to start from that position.
Once you get good at shadowboxing increase your workout by shadowboxing while holding weights. This will improve your arm strength and speed.
 If you have a favorite fighter watch their movements during their fights. Take notes on what they do and try to mirror your actions to theirs. Record the fights so you can watch them over and over. After a few viewings, stand up while you watch and try to mimic their movements as they move.


Make sure you’re watching the right kind of martial arts tournament for your goals. For example, wrestling is a great form of fighting but isn’t necessarily helpful for beginners trying to learn self-defense.
Pay attention to the different fighting stances that professional fighters use. If you notice something useful, incorporate it into your own fighting stance.
 There are many kinds of self-defense classes that you can take. For example, you could take a martial arts class such as Karate or Taekwondo. All martial art forms have different fighting stances. For example, the most popular Taekwondo fighting stance involves holding your open hands in front of your face to protect your head.However, all of these fighting stances have something in common: positioning your feet slightly apart and centering your body for strength and balance.


If you’re not interested in the strict tenants of a martial arts class consider taking a less structured course such as kickboxing or boxing. These courses are great ways to learn powerful self-defense techniques quickly.

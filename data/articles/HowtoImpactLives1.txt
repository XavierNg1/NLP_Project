 Decide why this is important to you.;
, Make a list of all the ways you can think of that you would be able to help without other people. Some to add:


Change your search engine. Instead of putting millions in Google's pocket, change it to one like benelab.org. They donate 100% of the profits to charity.
Spend more time playing online games like freerice.com that help people AND are fun instead of the ones that are just fun.
 Try a bunch of them until you find one you like that you want to do for a while.
 There are plenty of places that would love to have your help. Hospitals, soup kitchens, etc.
 There are so many different ways to fundraise and organizations to donate to, there could be a whole article on that.
 Take some classes through the Red Cross. You never know what you will need.
 Tell other people about the great ways you have found to help so they can start doing them and telling others.

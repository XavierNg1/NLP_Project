 Oral antiseptic gels may help relieve gum pain. Many of these gels contain a local anesthetic that can relieve the pain. You can also try baby teething gels, such as Orajel, or a gel that contains benzocaine.Use these gels sparingly and never use over the recommended dose.
Refrain from using benzocaine in young children without a doctor’s guidance.
These gels are not antimicrobial and won’t affect any infection.
Using an alcohol-free mouthwash may also soothe your gums.
 If you have gum pain, try over-the-counter pain medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (like Advil).Follow your dentist's instructions with how often to take the pain medicine. If you are not under a dentist's care, read the directions of the medication carefully. Avoid taking more than the recommended dosage each day.
If you still feel pain after two to three days, contact your dentist.
Don't dissolve an aspirin or other pain reliever on the painful gum area.
 If you have serious gum problems, or an infection or abscessed tooth, your doctor may prescribe medication to help treat the pain along with the underlying condition.


Your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics or prescription strength gels, which are a mixture of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory substances and also vitamins such as vitamin A. See your doctor to determine the best treatment.

 Swig a mouthful of mouthwash, if you please, and gargle to refresh your throat. The ritual of washing out your morning breath may help swing your mind back into the bustle of the day, and you may feel more ready to resume your day once you've rid your mouth of its "fuzzy" feeling. If you don't have access to a toothbrush, chew some mint gum.
 Depending on where you napped, you may feel stiff and sore. Try stretching our all your muscles to loosen up and relax. Go for a run, if you have time, to get your heart pumping and put your brain into action mode.


Try dynamic stretches like lunges and high-knees. Try jumping jacks and squats. The faster you move, the more quickly your blood will get flowing.
 Fix your hair, get dressed (or smooth out your clothing), and reapply your makeup if necessary. If you are going back to work or venturing back out into the world, you may need to put a few minutes into restoring your appearance.
 Don't go back to sit wherever you were napping. There's a good chance that you will fall back asleep.
 Listen carefully to pick up the thread of the lecture, and try to get back into the flow of the discussion. Try to remember what you were doing before you fell asleep. Don't jerk your head up suddenly, unless you love attention – instead, slowly lift your head up and blink a lot so your eyes can get used to the light.
 You should feel awake and fully alert within about 30 minutes. Drink water and caffeine, eat an energy-laden snack, and try to stay active – you will gradually recover from the nap the longer you're awake.

 A pillowcase is porous and won’t do any damage to your bear’s fur.


Make sure that the case is tied securely so the bear doesn’t fall out in the wash cycle.
 Use a mild detergent and cold water.


Treat the bear carefully, as using a rough cycle can cause damages.
Fur quality and stitching may be compromised if hot water or harsh detergents are used.
Wash on gentle, delicate, or hand-wash setting. Anything else might be too hard on the bear., Brush the bear’s fur after removing it from the washer, to prevent clumps or mats.


You may also use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process.It is not advisable to dry your bear in the dryer.

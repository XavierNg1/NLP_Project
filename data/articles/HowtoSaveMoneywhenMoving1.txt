 Garage or yard sales are excellent ways of getting money from possessions you might otherwise throw away. Make a large sign advertising your garage sale and post it on the shoulder of a nearby, high traffic road or intersection.


On your garage sale signs, be sure to include the date(s) and time(s) of your sale, along with the kinds of items being sold.
You might want to make several signs, each with a big arrow to direct those who are interested.;
, Classified ads are especially useful for getting rid of heavy, high cost items, like tools and exercise equipment. By connecting directly with an interested buyer, you can often make back a significant amount of the item's original cost.Many local newspapers have affordable classified ads, but digital classifieds, like Craigslist or eBay Classifieds, will likely reach more people., Make sure your friends and family know that you're moving. You may have something that they want or need that you were planning on throwing away or donating.


If you notice your friends or family waffling over whether or not they'll buy something, you may want to sweeten the deal by offering a discount.
 Moving heavy, bulky items, like some fixtures, furniture, and appliances, can end up costing you more money than these items are worth. In these cases, you might be able to sell these items to your home's next owner and leave them behind.

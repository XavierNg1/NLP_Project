 Use a ladle to pour over the tops of your chicken, putting generous dollops on every breast. This sauce will keep the chicken moist and flavorful as it cooks.
 You can use shredded, or you can cut rounds off of a log of fresh cheese. Be generous, and be sure to put as much as you can on top of the chicken so that it melts on top.
 A thermometer inserted into the chicken needs to read 165 degrees F to ensure that the meat is fully cooked. If the cheese is burning, but the meat still isn't done, cover it all with aluminum foil and cook for another 2-3 minutes. The foil should protect the cheese from any scalding direct heat., Save about a 1/2 cup of the pasta water before draining it out. Be sure to add the butter and olive oil when done -- the mixture of oils helps the sauce stick to the pasta. Furthermore, the starchy pasta water helps the sauce bond to the starchy pasta as well, so be sure to save this extra moisture., The chicken, baked into it's gooey, cheese, tomato-y pan, could use a fresh dash of your warm sauce, perfectly melding it with your pasta. Don't forget a dash of freshly grated Parmesan for a decadent final dish.

 They don't want you to fail in life, and at the end of the day have your best interests at heart, because they care about you. No parent wants to see their child on the street. Whatever they advise you, listen to it, and see if it is relevant to what you want to do in life. Think to yourself; will this make me happy?;
, Even though they may advise you to a specific career, at the end of the day they aren't living your life. This is YOUR life, not theirs. You will not be with your parents forever.
 Show them that you really care about your chosen career and want to pursue it. Or, if you don't have a set career in mind and want to further your education, or go travelling, or want to see where life takes you, tell them this too. Be clear, confident and stand your ground. Maintain control over your life.
 If you have no desire to work in the field that they want you to, make it clear to your parents. Don't waste your time chasing your parents dreams.
, In the end, it is really your decision to make. Make a list of your interests and work out all the possibilities. Your decision may change, but that is natural. It's just nervousness. However, if you think that you could really do better in another field, then by all means, go for it!

, Parents have a hard time letting go of their children so by seeing that you are making an informed decision and have factored in their advice, they will be more likely to accept your decisions.

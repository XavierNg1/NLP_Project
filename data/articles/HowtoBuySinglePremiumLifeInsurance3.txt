 This means that all of the interest, dividends and capital gains earned by your investment accumulate tax free.You only pay tax on these earnings if you surrender or take a loan against the account.Because you are not paying taxes each year on the returns on your investment, your account grows more quickly., The beneficiaries you name on your account will receive your death benefit income-tax free. Also, they will not have to go through the delay and expense of probate.Probate is the legal process of reviewing the validity and authenticity of a will. It also refers to the process of administering the estate of a person who has died without a will.Although no income tax will be paid, your heirs may have to pay an estate tax on the death benefit., An annuity is another retirement investment that you can purchase from an insurance company. Like an SPL policy, you pay a lump sum premium in the beginning. You can also choose from different investment options, such as fixed, indexed or variable interest rates. Also, like an SPL, the return on your investment grows tax-deferred.With an annuity, you receive regular disbursements during retirement. These disbursements are subject to income tax.If you die young, your family is not able to recover the remaining payments from your annuity. Rather, the company keeps your money and uses it to pay current disbursements to other customers.

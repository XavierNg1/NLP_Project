 A used condom still poses the risk of pregnancy and illness. Don't spill everywhere. You don't want to spend twenty minutes cleaning up, much less eighteen years raising a child.


Remove the condom so that fluids do not spill. If you're not careful, removing a condom will make a big mess, and possibly increase the risk of unwanted pregnancy or infection. Pay attention to what you're doing to avoid mishaps.
For a male condom, remove with the tip pointed down. If you pull off just by the ring of the condom, it can come off inside-out. Pull from the tip, and gently ease the ring off.Condoms with a reservoir tip are specially designed to help retain fluids at the tip of the condom, and they may help during this process.
For a female condom, squeeze and twist the outer ring, so that the fluids do no leak out. Pull the condom out gently. The inner ring of the female condom should help to hold any fluids in.Beyond this initial removal, the process for disposing of both male and female condoms is the same.;
, The same way you tie off a balloon, you should tie off a condom. Make a loop near the opening, and pull the ring of the condom opening through this loop in order to seal it off. This will help to limit odor as well as spillage.
 Put the condom in a piece of tissue or a paper towel. This will help keep your hand clean, as well as keep it from being unsightly in the trash. It will also help to deter bugs.
 There is no better place to put a condom than in the garbage.Everywhere else is likely to cause problems. Save yourself the trouble; put it in the trash.
 For the comfort of guests or those with whom you share living spaces, take the trash out. If you leave a used condom sitting around, it can begin to smell. A used condom can also be quite unpleasant to see unexpectedly. So for discretion's sake, empty out the garbage bin.

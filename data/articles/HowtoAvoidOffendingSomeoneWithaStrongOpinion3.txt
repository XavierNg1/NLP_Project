 It's tempting to monopolize the conversation when you feel passionately about a topic. Instead of giving into that urge, try just listening instead. In fact, you might notice when you feel strongly about a subject you don't listen to the other person at all; you are actually just formulating what you will say as soon as the other person pauses for a breath.Commit to understanding the other's point of view.


Try listening with the intent to be able to fully and fairly explain the other person's views. this may help you pay attention to what he or she means to convey.
 It is perfectly acceptable to ask challenging questions of someone who shares an opinion than your own, but understand the intent is to better understand their position, and not to win an argument. The goal of conversation should be to share ideas and experience; it shouldn't be about winning.


Encourage others to ask you challenging questions as well. This will help clarify your belief for yourself, as well as others.
 Your way may not be the wrong way, but it probably isn't the only way either. Be open to exploring other possibilities, or at least to the possibility you may both be wrong.To really get in the sprint of this, you can try switching sides and expressing each other's opinion. This will give you a better understand of both parties' beliefs.

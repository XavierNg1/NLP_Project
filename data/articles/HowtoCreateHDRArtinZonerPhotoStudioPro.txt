 To do this, you need to:


Select the subject.
Take your photograph.
Without changing your position or stance, change the exposure. This can be done by changing the speed or the aperture.

What this accomplishes is changing your image and also, there will be a small amount of movement. This is what you actually want.




You can do this with 2 or more photographs. However, the more images, the less '3D' it will be. Don't let this stop you though. As long as the images align, try them out.;
, You want to be sure they have the same approximate position.
, Zoner will be aligning the photos. If it can't be done, (they are too different), the program will tell you. Click Next.
 This is where the magic happens.
 The image is saved in a TIF format. This is a lossless format and will help preserve the look of your image.

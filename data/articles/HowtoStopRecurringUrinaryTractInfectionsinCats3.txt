 The minerals contained in your cat’s food interact with your cat’s body chemistry, and produce crystals that are expelled in your cat’s urine. If your cat’s urine is alkaline, sharp, needle-like crystals can form (these are called struvites) which can cut your cat’s bladder and make it prone to infection.


Eliminating crystals involves manipulating the pH of your cat’s urine, and avoiding foods rich in the minerals that are causing the urine to become alkaline. Prescription urinary health diets such as Hills CD, or Purina UR act in a number of ways to promote optimum urinary health. Part of their action is to reduce the likelihood of crystals forming in the urine by containing less of the minerals that cause these crystals, including phosphate and magnesium., If enough crystals form in your cat’s urine, they can form stones in your cat’s bladder. These stones rattle around inside the bladder and can damage the lining, which can make the bladder more prone to UTIs.


Treatment: Some bladder stones (struvite) are treated by manipulating the pH of the urine, as described in the previous step. However, other stones, like those made of oxalate and urate, or harder to get rid of and may need to be removed surgically.
 Abnormalities in the structure of the bladder such as polyps and cancer, disturb the normal ability of the bladder to heal and protect itself, making it more prone to UTIs.


Treatment: While bladder polyps can be surgically removed, bladder cancer is often inoperable. This is because it develops in a part of the bladder where the ureters drain urine from the kidney into the bladder. Removing the cancerous portion can cause irreparable damage to the ureters. Bladder cancer is best treated with drugs such a Meloxicam. This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has a mild inhibitory effect on the growth of bladder cancers.

 Rubbing alcohol (a.k.a. isopropyl alcohol) is probably the most effective product for removing permanent marker from skin.


Dip a cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol and then hold it on the skin for a few seconds. Once you’ve done this, wipe and repeat until the mark is gone – do not rub, as this can irritate the skin.
Rubbing alcohol is available at the pharmacy/drugstore -- look for a 90% solution or higher.;

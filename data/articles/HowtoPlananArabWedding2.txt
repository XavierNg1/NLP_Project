 The music entertainment usually consists of two parts. A live, Middle Eastern, cultural band performs the initial music, with huge drums and instruments. The live performance welcomes the bride and groom into the huge hall and as soon as they make their rounds around the hall, the guests join into a cultural dance as the first celebration. The second part consists of a DJ who then takes requests from the guests and plays the music preferred by the bride and groom.
 In the beginning of the ceremony, live belly and debke dancers open up with a performance as the anticipation to see the bride and groom walk in builds up.
 It consists of a long line of people holding hands and swaying and stomping their feet according to the pace of the music. In some weddings, the men and women perform these dances separately, it other weddings, the men and women dabke together.

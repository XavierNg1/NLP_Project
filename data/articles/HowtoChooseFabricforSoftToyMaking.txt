 Cotton is a very versatile fabric that comes in a wide range of colours and patterns. It is easily washable, which is great for keeping toys clean and its softness and non-scratchy texture make it pleasant to handle. In terms of the weight of cotton, consider using:


Lightweight cotton for doll clothing and small nursery and stroller toys
Heavyweight cotton for large toys and dolls
Cotton yarn for knitted or crocheted toys is excellent too;
, It can be less easy to sew and care needs to be taken if the backing is knitted as this can stretch out of shape with handling. It is also more expensive than simple fabrics like cotton.
 Felt is a very common fabric for home sewn toys. It is easy to work with and is soft to touch. It moulds easily, stretches to fit shapes that you want and as it has no grain or nap, there is no problem matching pieces or having the nap ride up the wrong way. Felt does not fray either, which makes it an enduring fabric. The only disadvantage is that it is not washable but spot stains can be treated with a damp cloth to lightly sponge the area.
 It is soft and very washable. Toys made from towelling can even be taken into the bath and dried again.
 Velvet might be a wonderful fabric for toys of old but it is very difficult to work with to create a whole soft toy from - it is easy to get the nap going the wrong way and the fabric frays easily, making it very hard to work with and to piece together. It doesn't wash easily either. However, it can make great clothes such as dresses or jackets, especially for dolls or toys that will be more on display rather than played with. Definitely for the experienced sewer.

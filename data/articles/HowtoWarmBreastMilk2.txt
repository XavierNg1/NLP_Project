 If you are warming breast milk straight from a frozen state, begin by holding the container of frozen breast milk under cool running water.The water should be just slightly cooler than room temperature.
Using cool water for this initial stage is recommended because it brings the temperature of the breast milk up more gradually. If you immediately jumped to hot water, you could cause hot spots to form along the outside while the inside remained frozen. Moreover, you could also accidentally destroy more of the valuable enzymes contained in the breast milk.
Only use cool water until you feel that the breast milk has thawed. Looking into the container, you should only see liquid and no floating chunks of frozen breast milk. Gently shake the container to feel for hidden chunks of frozen milk.
 Slowly increase the temperature of the running water after the milk is thawed.


Increase the water from cool to room temperature, from room temperature to warm, and from warm to hot. Bringing the temperature up slowly destroys fewer enzymes in the milk and heats it more evenly.
Stop before the water begins to steam. You do not want to make the breast milk so hot that it burns your baby's sensitive mouth.
Note that chilled breast milk is perfectly safe for your baby to drink, but if you have a fussy eater, you may need to warm it to room temperature to make it seem more appetizing., If you thawed the milk in the refrigerator or only had it stored in the refrigerator to start with, skip the cool water stage and place the container of breast milk directly under warm running water.


Gradually increase the temperature of the water from warm to hot, stopping before the water begins to steam.
 Make sure that the breast milk is evenly warmed by gently swirling the container or bottle, thereby swirling the milk around.


You could also even out the temperature by stirring the breast milk with a spoon or coffee stirrer.

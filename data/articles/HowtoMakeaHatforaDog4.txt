, Using the attached image as a guide, draw a template that suits the size of your dog.
 Cut out the visor.
 You might like to write the dog's name or draw a cartoon of something your dog likes, such as a toy or food.


You can also cover the visor in contact to protect it from light rain/sprinklers/puddle splashes, etc.
 You may need to take the elastic under or over the ears, depending on the breed––do a little experimenting. If in doubt, always add more elastic than needed, as you can create a knot to shorten it.
 Trim off any excess elastic.

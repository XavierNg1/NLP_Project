 If the accident happened in sight of pedestrians, a shop, or other drivers, ask them to stay on the scene until the police arrive so that they can provide statements. If possible, get their name and phone number.
 After the police officer has finished taking statements and completing the report, you should get the other driver’s information. Make your information freely available as well; people might think you’re at fault if you try to hide anything. The following information should be exchanged:


Full name, address, contact information
Driver's license numbers
License plate number
Insurance company and policy number
Make, model and color of the vehicle, Write down any information you receive from the police officer and the other driver. Take pictures of the scene with your phone.You’ll want to get pictures of the location itself, including stop signs, traffic lights, and other elements you think might have played into the accident. The insurance company will ask many questions, and you can use these pictures as a reference. Make sure to get pictures of the damage to the vehicle as well.

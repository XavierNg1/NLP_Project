 The recommended frequency of your showers depends on your type of hair and your level of activity. If your hair feels mushy or it splits while wet, you may be washing it too often.


Even thin, fine, straight hair can suffer from too much washing. If you wash your hair daily, try washing every other day instead.
Skipping shampoo can make hair loss worse. Conditioner-only washing can work for some people, but not every single time you wash your hair.;
, Frequent heat styling, dying, or bleaching can damage your hair. At most, heat style at low heat once every few days. Dye or bleach rarely.


Even everyday hair products may cause damage. Do without them for a week to see if your hair condition improves. If it does, try different products or reduce the amount you rely on them.
 Avoid hard brushes or unnecessary brushing. Too many hair clips or hairpins can also cause breakage.


Your hair is more vulnerable when wet. Wait until your hair dries before brushing or combing.
Wooden combs may cause less damage than plastic ones.
 Massage your scalp in small circles with the tip of your fingers for about five minutes every day. For better results, try it with your head upside down.


Do not use your fingernails. This can irritate your skin and loosen your roots.
 Satin pillowcases or another soft material may reduce nocturnal tearing.
 Stress can increase hair loss, along with many other medical problems. Try meditation, counseling, or exercise to reduce your stress levels. Address sources of stress in your life in your personal relationships, workload, and living situation.

Some people find improvements when they add eggs, yogurt, flax seed, salmon, walnuts, oysters, sweet potatoes, lentils, Greek yogurt, strawberries, or poultry to their diet. Others take supplements of iron, zinc, B-vitamins, and/or vitamin E.

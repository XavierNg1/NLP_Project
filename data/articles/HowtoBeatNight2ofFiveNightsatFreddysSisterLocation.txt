, To stay safe, you must simply hold the sheet in place with the cursor. It is best to click and hold to keep it in place, as clicking and dragging is ineffective. Failing to do this will result in a jump scare and a Game Over.
 After you have prevented the sheet from opening twice, you will be told to report to Ballora Gallery.
 Listen for Ballora's music playing, as the loudness of the music indicates her proximity.
 You can move quickly as long as you stop moving when Ballora's music grows louder. Moving while Ballora's music has grown too loud will result in a jumpscare, causing a Game Over.
 Your task isÂ to restart the systems, using a monitor. You have the ability to play audio to drive Freddy away when he gets near.


Opening the monitor will cause Freddy to approach, restarting a system even more so.
 If Freddy reaches you while the monitor is up, he will jumpscare you and cause a Game Over.

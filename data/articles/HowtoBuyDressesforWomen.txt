 If a woman has attractive legs, then choose a dress that shows them off. If her arms are toned or she has an attractive neckline, then select a dress that accentuates these physical assets. Just be careful not to highlight a feature to an extreme. For example, if a woman has a large chest, don't accentuate them so that they are the only focus on her body. In this case, opt for a v neck dress that highlights her chest, but guides the viewer's eyes to her face.;
, Just as a dress can highlight a woman's striking features, it can hide the unattractive features. Long dresses hide large calves or unattractive legs. Baby doll dresses hide large wastes and stomachs. An A-line dress can disguise large hips. Oftentimes, when you select a dress that hides 1 feature, you can balance it out by highlighting another.
 Long dresses shorten a woman, whereas a dress that stops above the knee, showing off the legs, lengthens a woman. Additionally, a solid colored dress helps lengthen a woman more than a dress with a design or pattern.
 The right dress should hide and highlight features on a woman so that her figure is well balanced. Use all the features of a dress, such as color, material, shape, length and design, to create a balanced look overall.
 Younger women can afford to wear dresses that are shorter and tighter. For an older woman, select a dress that is no shorter than knee length. Opt for simple styles for older women, rather than styles boasting bows, ruffles and frills; these elements would be more suited to younger women.
 Dark skin and hair are best dressed in lighter, more colorful dresses. Blondes and pale skin look better in darker colors, blacks and browns.
 A serious woman is best suited to a conservative style dress. Whereas, a relaxed, casual character will appreciate a dress that is brightly colored or has fun elements, such as jewels and ribbons.

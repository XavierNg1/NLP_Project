 While this might sound obvious, smiling at your crush when you see him is one of the easiest ways to show that you like him.
 Not looking at your crush when talking with him can make you appear nervous or awkward, or worse, can make it seem like you don’t care about what he is saying.


While you’ll want to maintain eye contact throughout most of your conversation, be sure to look away occasionally. Staring unflinchingly into your crush’s eyes for too long can come off as a bit strange and make him feel uncomfortable.
 Standing and sitting near your crush is a clear indication that he is someone you would like to be around.


Be mindful of personal space. Standing near your crush doesn’t necessarily mean touching him or standing shoulder-to-shoulder. If your crush seems uncomfortable with how close you’re getting, give him some space immediately.

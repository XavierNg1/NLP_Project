 Your life may feel hectic, but one good way to get active and exercise with a newborn is to schedule it. By making fitness a priority in your life, you will be more likely to stick with it. Figure out when you can schedule 10 to 30 minutes of exercise in your day and stick to it.For example, you may be able to do a 30 minute workout in the morning or be able to schedule 15 minute HIIT cardio and strength training sessions in the morning and afternoon.
 Get your partner, family, or friend to watch the baby for 30 to 60 minutes so you can exercise. This gives you some time for yourself and also some time to exercise. You can exercise in the house, go to the gym, or work out outside.You can do a workout video, go for a walk or run around the neighborhood, or do some strength training or a class at the gym.
You can get up early and work out before you partner goes to work.
 If you have gone back to work, you can schedule some exercise time at some point in your work day. Take a walk during your lunch hour or do a short 30 minute cardio workout.If possible, try to leave your house an hour earlier than usual and go to the gym or go for an early morning walk.
 When you start exercising after your baby is born, make sure to make realistic goals. No matter what your fitness level before you got pregnant, your life is different now, and you'll want to spend time with your baby while also resuming career and other responsibilities. One of the best ways to ensure that you successfully exercise is to set realistic goals.For example, you may not want to set a goal of running two to three miles three times a week. Instead, you may set a goal of walking or jogging for half an hour four times a week.

 This is an electrostatic process where plastic/epoxy powder is deposited in a very thin layer all over the surface and then baked on. The advantages of powder coating are flexibility, a very wide range of colors and textures, and the ability of the powder to adhere into small voids and cracks on the surface with out drips or runs.
 These are chemical formulations made to cause surface changes and coloration to metal. Some are used hot, while others are applied cold, there are many to choose from and they also allow you to highlight your project while maintaining a natural finish. Often waxes are applied afterwards to provide a final seal.
 Marine varnish is another way to put a final coat on your metalwork. Varnish has the advantage of being easy and forgiving to apply, however your work will have an obvious "clear coated" look that is not always desirable. Varnish is very easy to touch up later and to redo as maintenance at a later date without changing the overall finish.
 For painting small areas or writing on your metal, nail polish sticks very well and looks great. It comes in every shade imaginable, though, red hues are more widely available.

 This is done by clicking the "use" button while aiming at the furnace. The preset button for this is the right mouse button.


You'll obviously need to craft a furnace first, if you haven't done already.;
, You'll need to carefully determine which kind of fuel you need, as each kind of fuel smelts/cooks a different amount of items. While one bucket of lava can process 100 items, charcoal can only process 8, and saplings only half an item (so you'll need two to process one item). For a complete list of fuels and how much items they can process, check out this table

, You can burn wood to make charcoal, smelt iron ore into iron ingots, or cook food so it replenishes more hunger.
 The furnace will keep working until it's either run out of items to process or fuel.


Note that sleeping in a bed will not speed up or skip the furnace.

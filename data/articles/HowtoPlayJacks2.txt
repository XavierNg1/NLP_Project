 Throw them directly in front of you, and try to scatter them evenly, not too close together and not too far apart.
 Throw it straight up, and give it enough height to give you time to pick up your jacks, but not so high that it veers off beyond your reach.
 Scoop the jack into your hand before the ball bounces.
 The ball can only bounce one time - if you let it bounce more than once, your turn is over.
 Use the same hand that you used to pick up the jack.









The jack must stay in your hand while you grab the ball.
Once you've grabbed the ball, transfer the jack to your left hand. Continue transferring your collected jacks into your left hand.
 Keep scooping the jacks one at a time. This first round is called "onesies."








, Scatter the jacks again, and this time pick up two jacks each time. This is called the "twosies" round. Next, pick up three each round, then four, then five, and on to ten.
 Your turn ends and goes to the next player counterclockwise to you once you foul. There are a number of different ways to foul, including:









Missing the ball, or letting it bounce more than once.
Failing to pick up the correct number of jacks.
Picking up the wrong number of jacks.
Dropping a jack that you've picked up.
Accidentally moving a jack from its placement on the ground (this is called "tipping"). , If your turn is reached again, start from where you were before your foul.
 The winner can either be the first person to complete "tensies" or the first person to complete "tensies" and then work their way back down to "onesies."

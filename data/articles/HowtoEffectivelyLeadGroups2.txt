 Before the group arrives in the meeting spot, arrange the chairs and tables so discussion is easier in the group. Put the chairs in a circle or around one table, with just enough chairs for everyone in the group. This will encourage eye contact and make talking in the group easier.You can also put any materials for the group meeting on the table or by the door within reach. This way, the material is available for the group and the meeting can begin smoothly.
 To ensure the group discussion goes smoothly, establish ground rules at the outset. Make it clear that the group discussion is a place where everyone has the space to speak. Note that interrupting someone or talking over someone is not okay in group discussions. Encourage everyone in the group to respond in kind to one another, with respect.


You may create ground rules for the discussion and print them out as a hand out for the group members at the first group meeting. Or you may state them at the first meeting so everyone is aware of the rules for discussion.
 To facilitate discussion in a group, it is always best to ask open ended questions. Pose questions to the group that are thoughtful and open. Prompt the group with questions that can have more than a yes or no answer. Keep the questions short and clear so they are easy to understand.For example, rather than ask someone, “Is that how you felt about the presentation?” you may ask, “How did you feel about the presentation?”

, As the facilitator, it is your job to pay attention to who talks a lot in the group and who talks occasionally or not at all. Encourage group members who do not talk often to speak up when they want to. Make sure there is space in the discussion for them.For example, you may try asking someone who does not talk often a prompting question to encourage them to contribute to the discussion. Or you may say, “Let’s hear from individuals who have not spoken yet. Thoughts?” to encourage others to speak.

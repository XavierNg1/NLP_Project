 This is one of the things essential to her 80s look. In series 1 she also wears a lot of off-the-shoulder tops, including one off-the-shoulder dress. In series 2, the look is far more based around button-up tops and slouchy jumpers (which she teams up with the jacket for her CID look, but makes the jumpers go solo for her home look). Also in series 2 Alex's tops begin to sport more patterns, like the sailor striped top (shown in the introduction) and the patterned top in the finale of episode 8.
 This means that your bottoms should consist of tight/skinny jeans, leggings and jeggings. Alex does occasionally wear a skirt to work, but this does not happen as often as the skinny denim look!

, Unfortunately that dress doesn't seem to be something that's readily available from anywhere, but it's the concept that counts - a short red dress with the stockings, red heels and the fluffy coat. (Obviously you need to find an occasion where it's suitable to wear this sort of thing, i.e. wouldn't recommend it for a formal dinner party.) Alex wears a couple of other dresses through the course of the two series as well - these include an off-the-shoulder dress in series 1 and the golden dress in series 2.
 She also is famous for her heels that tend to feature more on the going-out style list, but she sometimes wears them during work-time and CID.
 Her main accessories though are the beads she wears around her neck and the large earrings, usually studs or loops. One distinctive outfit involved her wearing a belt - in series 2 episode 8, her final outfit that she wears before going 'back' to somewhere, she used a red belt that went well with the top she was wearing (that was a very oriental look - cream and red top, red belt, red fan earrings etc.).

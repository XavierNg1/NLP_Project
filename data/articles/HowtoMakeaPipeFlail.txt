 Get your metal pipe nipple, 550 paracord, lighter, electrical tape, and scissors and organize them in the area where you will be working.;
, With your scissors, cut out a length of at least 8 feet from your 550 paracord.
 Make both of the cut ends meet evenly. You should now have a large loop formed.
, Pull each end down over the length of the pipe. It should resemble a sort of cascading appearance.
 Then weave them around you loop and pull tight. You should now have a frame that tightly encloses the pipe.
 Continue to weave down the loop until you have a woven strap that runs 6 inches down. Be sure to leave 2 inches unwoven as this will be the finger loop

, With your scissors, cut off any excess paracord and then singe the cut ends with your lighter. You have now completed your pipe flail. To use, insert your pinky and ring finger through the loop and swing or twirl.
 Here are examples of what pipe flails look like. The strap of the first one is braided instead of woven and the second example is woven instead of braided

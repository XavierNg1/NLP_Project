 You can use plain chocolate ice cream, or you can use a fancier kind with chocolate or caramel swirled into it. This will create the base of your milkshake.
 You can use any type of milk you want: non-fat, 2%, or whole. For a thicker milkshake, use Â½ (120 milliliters) of milk instead.
 Try to use the smooth, creamy kind and not the chunky kind. It will be much easier to blend and give you a smoother drink in the end.
 This will make your milkshake nice and thick. If you'd like a thinner milkshake, use only 3 to 4 ice cubes instead. Consider using ice cubes made from frozen milk instead of frozen water; this way, you won't have to worry about your milkshake getting too watered down.
 Keep blending until all the ice has broken up and all of the ingredients have been mixed together. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks or swirls. If your blender is not blending evenly, pause it, and use a rubber spatula to scrape down any unmixed milkshake back down towards the bottom.
 For a fancier touch, you can garnish each milkshake with a swirl of chocolate sauce or a sprinkle of chocolate shavings.

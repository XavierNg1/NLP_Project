 Making a sudden loud noise can startle someone and give them the chills. Slam some books on a table or the ground, scream, clap loudly, or make another loud sound to induce the chills in someone.For example, while your friend is quietly reading, blow a whistle.
 Hide in the closet, behind the door, or in a dark room. When the person enters the area, jump out and scream. This will most likely scare them and give them the chills., You can either create your own scary story, or personalize an existing scary story for the target person. If you decide to create a story, make sure the plot is believable and relatable to the person. Let them know from the beginning that the story is real, and tell the story in a low, husky voice.You can personalize an existing scary story by switching out minor details to make the story seem more real. For example, make the setting the same city where your friend grew up, or develop a protagonist that is similar to the person you are telling the story to.
 Like scary stories, scary movies can also give people the chills. Put on a horror movie or a psychological thriller, turn the lights down (or off), and watch your friend get the chills.Some examples of scary movies you and your friend can watch are The Ring, The Bad Seed, Psycho, Paranormal Activity, The Shining, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and The Blair Witch Project, to name a few.

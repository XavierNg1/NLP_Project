 If you garden, newspaper can make healthy compost.Shred your newspaper into thin strips and combine it with other carbon-rich compostable materials such as leaves or grass.


Fill your compost bin with with the shredded newspaper and carbon-rich materials, alternating layers with nitrogen-rich compostable materials (such as coffee grounds and vegetable food scraps).You cannot use newspaper bundles as compost. Without shredding it, the compost will not receive enough oxygen and will mold.
 Make a small newspaper cup to start seeds for your garden. Place the cup with the seedling directly in the ground, and the newspaper will degrade on its own.


To fold a paper cup, cut a section of newspaper into a square, then fold the square diagonally. Fold one corner from the center of the opposite side, then repeat this with the other corner. Fold the top flaps down to create an opening for your cup, and place your seeds inside for planting.
 If your local sanitation company offers recycling options, sort your newspapers into the paper recycling bin.


If your sanitation company does not offer recycling, take your old newspapers to a recycling center.Contact your local waste management center to learn what they do or don't take.

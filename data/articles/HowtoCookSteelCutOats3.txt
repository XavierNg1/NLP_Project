 If you don't grease your pan first, you'll have a mighty tough time extracting the oats from the slow-cooker in the morning.
 Optional: Place the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, and/or nuts in the crock pot or slow-cooker along with the oats, salt, milk, and water.,, Let the oatmeal cook overnight.
 Spoon into bowls and stir in the toppings of your choice. In order to avoid overcooking the oats, try these tips and tricks before you cook your first batch of overnight oats:


Try the same recipe in your crock pot or slow-cooker during the day, not overnight. Keep an eye on the oats and begin checking for doneness after 5 hours. This way, you'll learn how long it takes to cook oats using your hardware. If you have a slow-cooker with a clear top, you can eyeball the oats. If you have to open the pot in order to check for doneness, know that this will add approximately 30 minutes to your cooking time.
Plug your crock pot or slow-cooker into an on/off light timer if you don't have a programmable slow-cooker. Set the on/off timer to the time it usually takes you to cook your overnight oats, and you have a life-hacked programmable slow-cooker.

 If you’ve worn your hair down in a simple daytime style, you can make it look more polished for evening by adding a headband. Opt for a satin style that adds some elegance to your look with minimal effort. Brush your hair to ensure that it’s free of tangles, and slide the headband into place.You can opt for a satin headband that matches your outfit, or choose one in a neutral color, such as black, gray, or white.
In addition to a satin headband, you can take your hairstyle from day to night by adding a headband with rhinestones, beads, decorative flowers, or bows. Even a headband in a metallic finish, such as gold or silver, can dress up your hair for the evening.
 If you wear your hair down during the day and want to keep the simple style for a night out, adding a few rhinestone hair pins or a decorative comb to your hair can dress up your look. Use a couple of pins or a comb to pull back a small section of hair on the side of your head. You can pin back the hair on one side or both, depending on the look you prefer.In addition to a rhinestone pins or combs, you can also use a flowered style. Use the accessories to push the hair back behind your ear on one side to mimic the look of having a flower tucked behind your ear.
You can also use rhinestone hair pins to dress up an updo. Use them to pin up a bun, French twist, or other style.
 If you’ve worn your hair in an updo or a half up, half down style during the day, you can make your look more evening appropriate by adding embellished clips. Replace the hair elastic securing your ponytail with a beaded clip, or switch a simple tortoise shell clip that’s holding the top section of your hair back with a rhinestone version.

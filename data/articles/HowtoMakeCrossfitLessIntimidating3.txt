 Even if you're somewhat interested in CrossFit, part of your intimidation may come from the fact that you've read articles about the dangers of participation, the pain, and the freak injuries CrossFitters experience.You can find websites online designed for CrossFitters, and you also can find information on the websites and social media pages of CrossFit gyms. Talk to people locally who do CrossFit and get recommendations from them for where you can go for more information.
When you're first learning about CrossFit, you typically will see videos and images of athletes performing amazing feats of strength and endurance. You may think that those feats are well beyond your capabilities, or that you need to be more in shape before you can even start CrossFit. Looking at real images and videos from regular gyms, and talking to actual CrossFitters, can help you overcome that intimidating image.
 You won't be going in on your first day and doing the same things the most experienced athletes can do. Gradually, over time, you will improve your fitness in a supportive and accepting environment.Keep in mind that any type of vigorous exercise is potentially dangerous if not done properly. Because of the intense focus on form and technique, injuries are no more common in CrossFit than in any other similarly vigorous activity.
Your CrossFit coaches won't allow you to progress to the next level unless they feel your form and technique are correct. Listen to them and be patient. Understand that it will take time to reach the level where you want to be.
 One of the easiest ways to make CrossFit less intimidating is to start with someone else. Get involved with someone you know who also is interested in CrossFit and is at a fitness level similar to you.


If you have a friend who's already involved in CrossFit, going with them can also make it less intimidating. However, make sure you evaluate the gym for your own purposes â€“ don't go to a gym that makes you feel intimidated or uncomfortable just because your friend is a member there.
Even if you and an experienced friend don't go to the same gym, they still can answer your questions and help you become more familiar with the CrossFit world. Remember that familiarity is the key to erasing intimidation.
 One of the most important parts of CrossFit training is to avoid trying to do too much too fast. Scale your workouts to suit your fitness level and set small goals that can be reached at each session and you'll find steady improvement in your fitness.As you progress in CrossFit, you'll find that other aspects of your lifestyle will also come into play. Most CrossFit gyms have other supports, such as nutrition guidance and skills clinics, to help you in those areas.
Work with the coaches at your gym to set milestones to celebrate as you progress through training. The process will become less and less intimidating as you start to see results and find yourself meeting and exceeding your goals and expectations.
 The first week or so of CrossFit typically will be difficult and challenging. To overcome your intimidation, you should be willing to give it a little more time and allow it to become a part of your regular routine.It can take you as long as a month to become comfortable with the movements and start to feel like you know what you're doing. The simple act of showing up for a month will give you more confidence and make the process and the environment seem less intimidating.
If after a month you've decided that CrossFit isn't for you, at least you'll be able to make an informed decision at that point, and won't have to wonder whether you missed out on something because you were too scared to give it a shot.

 To find out how many numbers are in each group, divide the number of numbers by 2. In this instance, since the series is 1 to 100, you would calculate 100÷2=50{\displaystyle 100\div 2=50}.So, the first group will have 50 numbers (1-50).

The second group will also have 50 numbers (51-100).
 Write the numbers in a row, beginning with 1 and ending with 50.
 Write these numbers in a row under the first group. Begin so that 100 lines up under 1, 99 lines up under 2, etc.
 This means you will calculate 1+100=101{\displaystyle 1+100=101}, 2+99=101{\displaystyle 2+99=101}. etc. You don’t actually have to add up all the sets of numbers, because you should see that each set adds up to 101., To find the sum of consecutive numbers 1 to 100, you multiply the number of sets (50) by the sum of each set (101): 101(50)=5050.{\displaystyle 101(50)=5050.} So, the sum of consecutive number 1 through 100 is 5,050.

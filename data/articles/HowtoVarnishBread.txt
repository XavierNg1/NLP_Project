 Place in a basket or other open container and leave in a dry area for one to two weeks. The bread is ready for varnishing when it has dried rock hard.;
, This will prevent varnish from staining the surface and makes it easy to collect up any crumbs.
 Use a suitably sized paintbrush (if painting) or use direct from the spray can. Apply the first coat to the bread. Allow to dry for at least 6 hours, or longer if required by the instructions accompanying the varnish.
 Allow to dry for at least 6 hours (or more) between each varnish.
 You can decorate using ribbons, straw, dried flowers etc. The bread looks best placed in rustic items, such as basket ware or old containers. Place on display.

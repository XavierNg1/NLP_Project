 A mechanical explosion takes place without the need for a chemical reaction. In this case, the pressure inside of a container builds due to the physical properties its fluid (liquid or gas) contents and the environment that the container is exposed to. When the pressure exceeds what the container can hold, the container is broken and the fluid inside expands rapidly, causing an explosion.A tire blowing out is an example of a mechanical explosion.
 In the case of mechanical explosion, the strength of the container will play a significant role in the strength of the explosion. Typically, the more pressure that the container can hold, the larger the explosion will be when it fails. Also, the condition of the container will affect how easily it will fail. A damaged container will fail faster than one in good condition. Other properties of the container can change how quickly the pressure will build in a given situation.For example, a container that conducts heat readily will allow a fluid to expand faster than one that insulates the fluid.
Keeping with the example of a blown tire, a worn out tire is much more likely to have a blowout than a new tire.
 Aside from the containerâ€™s properties, the properties of the fluid itself will affect whether or not an explosion happens. First off, the amount of fluid present in the container is an important factor. Another important factor is the temperature of the fluid inside, and how much energy it takes to increase that temperature.If the fluid only fills 50% of the container, it has plenty of room to expand. In contrast, a container that is 90% full leaves little room for expansion.
Pressure is directly related to temperature. The as the temperature of a fluid increases (and the volume remains the same) the pressure will also increase.

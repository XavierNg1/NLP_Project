 Each carrier (Verizon, AT&T, etc) has a specific email gateway that you will have to go through in order to email a text message. If you don't know the person's carrier off the top of your head, you can enter their 10 digit phone number into a carrier lookup system such as CarrierLookup or FoneFinder.

, Although you can technically include a subject, doing so will take away from the body of your text, as most text messages have a 160-character limit.

Texts that exceed the character limit will be broken up into multiple messages. While your emails will be free, the recipient will be charged per message (unless they have unlimited texting).
Upload an image or short video to the email if you wish to send it as an MMS.
 Click on the send button as you normally would for sending an email. The recipient should receive the text in about 30 seconds, and will see it on their phone as a normal text conversation. They will be able to respond to you as they would to any other text.

, When you receive a reply, it will be sent to the account from which you originally emailed the text. However, unlike a normal text or email message, it will be received as a text file attached to a blank message. Click to open the attachment, or save it to your desktop and open it with a text reader or word processor.

 After the initial eating frenzy in early spring, the number of cutworm larvae and the extent of the damage from them generally decrease.


Consider planting a perennial flower garden. Plant it around the outside of your vegetable garden as a form of cutworm prevention. Unlike weeds and tall grasses, the flowers die off in the fall when the adults are looking for places to lay eggs.
Till the soil in the spring before planting to expose and kill larvae that wintered over in the soil.
 Remove weeds from your garden and from the areas around your garden to cut back on places where moths can lay eggs. This also removes some food that keeps cutworms alive. Keep the grass around the garden cut short.
 Remove all plant debris from the garden after harvest to discourage adult moths from laying eggs. Till the soil again in the fall to expose larvae and decrease the number that survive winter hibernation.


If you can, consider allowing chickens to graze in your garden after tilling. They will eat any cutworms present in the soil.
 Keeping your yard animal-friendly is a great way to control cutworms, since birds and many other animals love to eat them. Encourage the following animals to enjoy cutworms in your garden:


Toads
Moles
Fireflies
Blackbirds
Meadowlarks

 To make an arsenal of water balloons, you'll need a pack of balloons. There are many different types of balloons. Some even have different prints that are interesting when inflated. Find something that says "water grenades" or says on the package, use for water balloons.These balloons are smaller than normal balloons.;
, Attach the opening of the balloon to either a hose or a sink's faucet. Fill it with water so that the balloon stretches to about 4in x 3in. Another good way to measure how much water to use is to use your palm to measure. You don't want to exceed filling the balloon beyond the size of your fist, or the balloon could pop.
 Pinch the opening of the balloon with one hand, and slightly stretch the excess. You want to create enough slack to tie a firm knot. Loop the stretched neck of the balloon around a finger that is pinching the balloon. Then fit the end of the balloon through the loop your finger created.


If this is your first time tying a balloon's knot, it might take a few tries.
Use pliers to loop the balloon around to avoid pruned fingers., Once you've gotten the hang of creating a water balloon, you can replicate this process as much as you want. Create enough bombs to have a fun time with your pals. You can never create too many water bombs!


Store your water balloons in a container with water to avoid popping.

 Fill a large stockpot with cold water and place it on the stove. Add the potatoes, turn the heat to medium, and bring the potatoes to a boil. Continue cooking until soft, about 25 to 30 minutes.


When the potatoes are soft, strain out the water and return the potatoes to the stockpot. Partially mash them with a fork or potato masher.
To change the recipe up from time to time, swap out the potatoes and replace them with 3 ½ cups cooked rice.
 While the potatoes are still hot, add the oats or wheat bran and cover with a lid. Let stand for at least 10 minutes to help soften the oats.


You can also substitute up to 2 cups of cooked vegetables for some or all of the oats.
 Heat a large frying pan or skillet over medium heat. When it’s hot, add the meat. Leave it alone for two minutes, and then spread it around with a spatula.When there’s no more pink on the one side, flip the meat over. When the pink has cooked out from that side as well, break the meat up into small pieces with the spatula.
Continue cooking until there’s no pink left anywhere on the meat.
Some meat, like beef, will brown when it’s cooked. Other meats, like chicken or pork, will go white when they’re cooked.
 Stir in the oil and eggshell powder as well. Stir to combine. Allow to cool to room temperature, and store leftovers in the fridge or freezer.

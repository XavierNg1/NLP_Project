 You have to learn about a lot of different subjects and skills to do this. Here are some of them:


Combat: You should know either a basic martial art or a way to defend yourself. Consider taking a self-defense class. A warrior always knows hand-to-hand combat. Try thinking about taking a Krav Maga Class. Krav Maga is an Israeli Martial Art that incorporates tons of stuff in. You can learn more by doing a search on Google or Yahoo.
Disguise: Sure, warriors charge all the time, but sometimes, warriors also know stealth & disguise. We will talk about stealth later. For basic camouflage, try to blend in either with the crowd or with the environment. Wear what everybody else is wearing.
Stealth: Learn how to walk silently by having a friend help you. Have him stand in the middle of the room with his eyes closed as you try to sneak by him. As soon as you become proficient at this, try to sneak up on animals that have more sensitive hearing.;
, You have to be physically fit and healthy at the same time. To get that impression of a warrior, weight-lift. A lot. Also be sure to run at least 3–5 miles (4.8–8.0 km) a day. You never know when you'll have to chase somebody through a crowded city street. And on that note try to learn basic parkour, and always remember to start out slow and work your way up.
 If you want to be a warrior you'll have practice hard and plan on improving your strategies. Learn new techniques to develop your combating skills.
 Look at workouts online and a 7 minute workout app is brill. Press-ups and sit ups will do though, You'll have to last till the end even if you are not strong. You should concentrate only on your training and thus only can you improve.
 Eat a Warrior Breakfast including, eggs, ham, vegetables, milk or orange juice, and any other healthy stuff you can find around your kitchen. For lunch, eat some grilled meat or a deli sandwich with some potatoes and an apple or banana for desert. The key here is to eat healthy.

 The doctor can perform several treatments to remove skin cells.


Your doctor may use microdermabrasion, which uses a mechanical device to remove skins cells. These may include salt crystals or wire brushes.
Your doctor may also suggest chemical peels. These peels use stronger acids that are useful when treating acne. They are not for use with all skin types.

 But don't stress out if you don't accomplish everything just the way you planned. Remain flexible and try different approaches to your goals. Remember, sometimes life happens, and you may not have time for everything. Just be productive in the time you have.
 No negative thoughts. If you have negative thoughts, do not write them down. Find someone you can vent negative thoughts to -- pretending to be happy all the time will do no good for you in the long run.
 Go out and do activities to find what you like and then pursue the one or two that strike your fancy. If you do three of them that will be too stressful.
 This would be a good place to write things. But remember, no negative thoughts.
 Try classics such as Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Montaigne, Proust, or Tolstoy. If you are not fond of those, try the newspaper, a fantasy novel, bibliography, or mystery. There's something for everyone- check out your local library to test the waters.
 Unreasonable goals are harder and will probably just lead to disappointment.

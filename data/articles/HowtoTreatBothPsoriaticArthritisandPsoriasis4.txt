 Red, inflamed skin is the most obvious and common symptom of psoriasis. These patches may appear anywhere on the body and vary in size and shape. The red color can vary from a brighter red to a dull pinkish-white., The red patches caused by psoriasis are often covered by a rougher whitish or grayish layer of skin not unlike a scab. This second layer of raised skin is often referred to as a “silvery sheen” or “silvery scales.” This rough, scaly skin might flake off when rubbed or touched.If your psoriasis is on the scalp, this white, dead layer of skin might appear similar to dandruff.
 If you have psoriasis, you might have vertically-oriented striping or discoloration of the nails. You’ll probably also experience pitting of the nails – small holes or indentations in the surface of the normally smooth nail. The nails could become thick and rough. In extreme cases, your nail might become detached from the nail bed.These nail deformities could occur with your fingernails or toenails.
 As you might imagine, cracked, rough, scaly skin is also incredibly irritating. If your skin feels itchy and irritated as well as raised and inflamed, you almost definitely have psoriasis; however, no matter how irritated it is, do not pick or scrape your skin. This will only cause bleeding and further irritation.

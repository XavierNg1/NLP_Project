 Set the oven to 220 °C (428 °F) before beginning the biscuits.;
, In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, rosemary, and the raisins. Combine well, either with a spoon or by hand.
 Add cold butter and with your hands and combine it well with all the ingredients until the mix resembles the consistency of wet sand.
 Pour 2/3 of the milk into the mixture and continue to mix with your hands until the dough becomes uniform. Be careful not to over-mix or the biscuits will be come tough and stringy instead of light and flaky.


Dough should be slightly tacky to touch but not too dry. If too dry, add a bit more of the milk.
 Sprinkle a little flour on the working surface. Lay out dough, sprinkle a little more flour on top and with a rolling pin, roll it out to about a one centimetre thickness. Be sure not to work the dough too much.


Now, using a small drinking glass or cookie cutter, cut circles of dough until no more circles can be cut.
, After ten to fifteen minutes, take the biscuits from the oven. They should have a golden brown complexion. The biscuits are best served hot and go well with butter, marmalade, or jam. If you want a taste of the savoury, serve with ham or cheese.

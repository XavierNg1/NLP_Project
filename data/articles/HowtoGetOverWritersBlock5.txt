 This works best if you're in a quiet place where you feel no judgment.
 For example, "The flying turtle ate the talking pineapple, even though he knew it was the unicorn's best friend." You can generate several crazy sentences and pick the best one, if you're really in the groove. Don't judge yourself or hold back. Just write whatever comes to mind.
 Repeat this until you have a list of three or more ideas.
 Make it as crazy as possible. If you are typically a sensible and serious person, you should take a break and attempt to write the most boring story ever. Once you've found at least 5-6 "good" crazy sentences, you should have something to work with. Read them over. They'll make you laugh, feel more loose, and feel less restrained about always writing the most perfect sentence in the world.
 Use that one sentence as the opening of a short story, or even a short short story. Don't let it hold you back. Maybe even just pick one or two phrases or words from that sentence, and use them for inspiration. Keep writing until you feel relaxed and like you have something to work with!

, Okay, so maybe all of your sentences were too crazy or ridiculous to work with. That's okay. Let the process itself inspire you and make see that it's easy to let loose and generate crazy sentences once in a while -- it's not about achieving perfection! After this exercise, you can just start trying to get back into the same writing you were doing before, while feeling more confident about your ability to be creative!

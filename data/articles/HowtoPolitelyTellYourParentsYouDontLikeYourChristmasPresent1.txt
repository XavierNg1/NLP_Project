 This seems obvious, but you don't know whether you will like it until you have seen it!;
, Your parents have obviously tried hard, so you must be grateful of that. Say something like "thank you mum and dad, I know you tried hard"

, Saying "I hate my stupid present" won't get the best results. You may be thinking that, but say something like "I'm ever so sorry, but I don't play The Sims anymore" or "sorry mum, but Evanescence isn't my thing". Be mature and make sure you apologise, or at least sound apologetic.
 Some parents might apologise and offer to exchange it in the store for you, whilst others might be upset, offended, or they might not understand. If they apologise and offer to exchange it, thank them and decide whether to accept their offer (or be really mature and say that you can exchange it yourself). If they are upset or offended, apologise again and tell them that you know they tried hard, and either leave it there or politely ask if you can exchange it (it might be better to have this conversation later if they are really upset or angry). If they don't understand, say clearly "I'm sorry but I don't like my present".
 It might be a good idea to write a Christmas list next year so they know what to get you.

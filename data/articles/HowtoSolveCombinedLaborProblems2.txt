 Use this method if the problem represents one person (or thing) completing a job and another person (or thing) undoing the job the other person is doing. A typical problem involves pipes filling and draining a pool.For example, the problem might ask, “If a hose can fill a pool 6 hours, and an open drain can empty it in 2 hours, how long will it take the open drain to empty the pool with the hose on?”


, Look at the problem carefully to determine which individual this is. If the goal is to empty something, the individual doing the draining is completing the job. The hourly rate is is represented by creating a fraction, where the total number hours it takes to complete the job is the denominator (bottom number), and 1 is the numerator (top number).For example, if a drain can empty a pool in 2 hours, and you need to calculate how long it takes to empty the pool, then the drain is completing the job. Its hourly rate is 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}; that is, each hour it empties12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} of the pool.
 Remember that the total number of hours it takes to undo the job will be in the denominator, and 1 will be in the numerator.For example, if the hose can fill a pool in 3 hours, but the goal is to empty the pool, then the hose is undoing the job. If the hose fills the pool in 6 hours, Its hourly rate is 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}; that is, each hour it fills 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}} of the pool. 


, This will be 1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{t}}}, where t{\displaystyle t} equals the amount of time it takes them to complete the job while working against each other., Because they are working against each other, their combined hourly rate will equal the difference between their individual hourly rates.This is the hourly rate of the individual completing the job minus the hourly rate of the individual undoing the job.

For example, if a drain empties 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} of a pool in 1 hour, a hose fills 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}} of a pool in 1 hour, and together they empty 1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{t}}} of a pool in 1 hour, the equation will be:12−16=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}.
 You will need to find the least common denominator. For complete instructions on how to subtract fractions, you can read the article Subtract Fractions.

For example, 6 is the least common denominator of 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} and 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, thus:12−16=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}36−16=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{6}}-{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}26=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}


,, This will give you the number of hours it takes for the individuals to complete the job while working against each other.

For example, if a hose fills a pool in 6 hours, and a drain empties the pool in 2 hours to, working against each other, the pool will drain in 62{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{2}}} hours, or 3{\displaystyle 3} hours.

 On your Verizon mobile phone, open your phoneâ€™s keypad (either on-screen or physically), and dial the #646 (#MIN) code on the call screen.
 Afterwards, wait for the voice recording on the other end of the line to state the details of your current usage and your remaining number of minutes.
 After a few seconds, you will receive a text message containing the same information you heard from the voice recording to serve as your reference.

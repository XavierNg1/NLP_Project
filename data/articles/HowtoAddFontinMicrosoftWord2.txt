 There are tons of sites that host font files that you can download for free (for home use). OS X supports both OTF and TTF font formats, which are two of the most common. Many fonts will come packed into a ZIP file. Some of the more popular font sites include:


dafont.com
fontspace.com
fontsquirrel.com
1001freefonts.com

, Some fonts will come packed in a ZIP file, especially if there are multiple versions. Double-click the ZIP file to open it and then drag the fonts inside onto your desktop or into another folder.
 This will open the font into a preview window, where you can see how it looks in various sizes.
 You will now be able to select it in any program that allows you to change fonts., You'll be able to find it in the Fonts menu. The fonts are listed alphabetically.
 Word for Mac does not allow you to embed fonts into Word documents like the Windows version does.

This will prevent anyone from editing it, but will also preserve your custom fonts.


In the Save As menu, select "PDF as the file type to save the document as a PDF.

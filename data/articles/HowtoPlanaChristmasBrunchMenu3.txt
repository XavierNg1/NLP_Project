 Since you're planning a daytime meal, try using bright colors instead of darker ones, such as bright red and white with touches of green here and there. Don't be afraid to add a little sparkle with some silver or gold tones., One way to de-stress your morning is to lay everything out on your table the night before. Put out the plates, juice glasses, mugs, silverware, and napkins. That way, you know you have enough for everyone coming.If you have a cat that likes to investigate your table, try closing the room off or placing everything out but the juice glasses and covering the whole thing with a clean tablecloth.
 While the smell of breakfast cooking may be enough good smells to last through brunch, it doesn't hurt to make your home smell more like Christmas. Try lighting a Christmas-themed candle, or make a pot of boiling potpourri by throwing orange slices, water, and spices into a pot that you boil on the stove., To help complete the perfect atmosphere, try adding in some quiet Christmas music in the background. It will help keep a happy mood going when the conversation lags. However, you don't want it too loud, as it will drown out conversation.

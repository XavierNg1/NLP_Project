 You can use most international credit cards with a US Netflix account, as long as they are Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. You cannot use virtual credit cards like Entropay.


Some pre-paid Visa cards may work, but support seems to be limited.
You'll need to be logged in using a proxy service or geo-unblocker.
 Netflix only asks for your zip code when adding a credit card, and will only use it to verify that the card is being added from the US. Netflix will not compare the zip code you provide to the zip code of your card's billing address.


If you have a four-digit post code, try adding a 0 to the beginning or end of it. You can verify that it will work by checking the USPS website.
If you can't figure out a working code, 90210 works for many people.
If you want, you can create a code in a state that doesn't have sales tax, which will save you a little money each month.
 Submit your updated payment information. If your payment method is declined, try a new postal code.
 There's a very good chance that your bank will put a hold on your payment to Netflix every month unless you set this up as a safe transaction. Call your bank and inform them that you approved this overseas transaction.

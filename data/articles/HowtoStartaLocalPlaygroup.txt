 Should it be a neighborhood playgroup, or one that includes only a certain section of your town?;
, Will the playgroup be a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly gathering?

, Also, will older siblings be welcome?

, It is important that you have at least one other person to help out - even though parents are in - especially before things kick off nicely. They should be able to deputize in your absence.
 Include the first few meeting times and places, along with your contact name, phone number and email address. Have rip-tabs with information placed at the bottom of the flyer for parents to take with them.
 Keep it simple, as parents won't want to share too much information until they know you more personally. Create a list of "Dos and Do Nots", along with consequences. These might include hitting and biting, snack and allergy guidelines, pet policies, and so forth.
 Distribute your flyers to local pediatrician offices, grocery stores, dentists, and more. Most small businesses that are child-related will be willing to have your flyer up. Answer any inquiries promptly. This lets the parents know that you are sincere and keeps their interest level up.
 Create an online group (via Google groups, Yahoo groups, or bigtent.com) to help communicate play date locations/time/assignments. Or take advantage of online group sites that allow playgroups to coordinate the activities and events and sends out automatic reminders.

 This is the official github page for Powershell.
 You must be running OSX 10.11 or newer.
 This is the rocket icon in the bottom dock.
 You can also find the Terminal in "Applications > Utilities".
 A blank terminal window will appear.
 A powershell prompt will appear with “PS” displayed. This means that powershell is running and you can use the Terminal to enter cmdlets.

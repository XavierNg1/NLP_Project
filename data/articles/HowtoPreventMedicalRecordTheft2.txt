 Every person should get a copy of their medical file, whether they have been a victim of medical identity theft or not. Get a copy of your medical file for every member in your family, including your children.A copy of your medical file provides a “baseline” of your true medical history. Once you fall victim to fraud, it can be difficult for your provider to reconstruct your true medical history. For this reason, you should get a copy of the file as soon as possible.
Your medical office can charge you for the copies. If you have online access to your records, then you can take snapshots.
 You should protect your medical insurance card just as you would your Social Security card. Although you want the card with you in an emergency, you can photocopy the card and carry the photocopy around with you. Make sure to blacken out the last four digits of the card.In an emergency, any medical provider can call your insurer to find the full number.
If you have a doctor’s appointment, then you can take the real card with you to the doctor’s office.
 You can protect your medical information by refusing to share it over the phone or online. Never share with someone who calls you, even if they are offering a deal for free medicine in exchange for your medical information.


If you are sharing medical information online, then make sure you are using a secure connection. Look in the status bar and make sure the address begins with “https”—the “s” stands for secure., You should lock up your medical records in a secure place, such as in a home safe. Records include physician statements, prescription drug information, and insurance policy information or forms. Once you no longer need these records, remember to shred them before throwing them out.Also remove the label from any medicine bottle before disposing it. You don’t want anyone pulling information off the bottle.

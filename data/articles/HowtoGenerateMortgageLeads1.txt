 Business cards are a necessity, as well as flyers and mailers advertising your mortgage loan office's strongest loan products. You'll also want to prepare a short stock statement outlining your mortgage loan benefits and rates that you can use. Be prepared with these materials before you reach out to your network.


Don't be pushy. Try hard not to become the overbearing salesperson who just uses people for their leads. Invest in people, and they will invest in you. Showing a genuine appreciation for people's problems, concerns, and desires will go a long way in the mortgage loan business.;
, Who says that business can't start at home? For many mortgage brokers, it does. Make a list of all the people that you come into regular or semi-regular contact with. Reach out to them by sending a letter (your stock statement will do) detailing general mortgage loan benefits, as well as your competitive rates.


Keep track of who you send your letter to and occasionally remind them about your services by sending out reminder postcards and mailings. Your persistence will pay off.
 Let them know that a referral is the biggest compliment that they can pay. If their referrals end up being clients, follow up with thank-you notes or emails. Your clients will get satisfaction knowing that took time out to appreciate their kindness.
 Joining your son or daughter's PTA, the local Habitat for Humanity, or simply becoming a more active member of your congregation will generate leads by exposing you to more members of the community.

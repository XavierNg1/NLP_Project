 Fill a pot with water and place it on your stovetop. Turn the heat on high until the water comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer., Grip your garment firmly, so you donâ€™t drop it in the water. Waft the area with the water stain through the steam created by the boiling water. It is not necessary to continue steaming your garment for more than a minute.Be careful not to burn yourself or the garment with the steam. Moving the fabric back and forth through the steam will help you avoid burns.

 Cover your chicken in plastic wrap. Use a small mallet (metal or wood) and gently pound the chicken. Make sure that each piece is about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. This will allow you to cook your meat evenly, and ensure that your chicken is tender., Obtain a medium sized bowl and pour in warm (not hot) water. Mix in a pinch of salt. Put each of your pieces of chicken in the brine for 30 minutes. This will allow your chicken to soak in moisture and be more juicy when you eat it., While your chicken is soaking in the brine, make a marinade. A good combination is olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs, garlic, and lemon zest. You can also use sesame/soy sauce, or barbecue sauce. When the chicken is done in the brine, place the chicken in a plastic bag. Pour the marinade in with the chicken and close the bag.Press down against the bag with your fingers to get the marinade up close and personal with the marinade.
Place the marinade bags into the fridge and let them sit for four hours.
 If you decide not to do a marinade, you can use some simple ingredients to season your meat. Simply sprinkle salt, pepper, and garlic powder over the chicken thighs. Press the spices in with your fingers. These will help lock in moisture and make your meat more tender., If your grill hasn't been used in a while, or has been used way too often, it is wise to clean it down. Soap and water usually work fine. When you get done washing, spread some olive oil over the grate in order to keep your chicken from sticking., Generally, you should grill chicken between 375 to 450° Fahrenheit (190 to 230°C). However, some suggest you set your grill up to 550° Fahrenheit (290°C). For precaution's sake, set your grill lower, and cook a tad bit longer., Place the chicken onto the grill. Make sure they are equidistant from one another so they cook evenly. Cook the chicken two to three minutes on both sides. You should see grill marks (dark lines) if the chicken is cooking properly.

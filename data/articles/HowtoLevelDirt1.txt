Dirt is a natural resource composed of decomposed rock that has been changed over time by environmental influences.
It may contain soils blown onto it from a distance by the winds, chemicals brought to your area by waters that have disappeared long ago, and organic material from plant, animal, and insect life.
Dirt generally includes water, oxygen, silicate, aluminum, and iron, but these elements occur in different proportions that influence the soil's color and texture.;

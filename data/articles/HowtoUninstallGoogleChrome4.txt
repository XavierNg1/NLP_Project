 This gear-shaped app is in the App Drawer.
 It's near the bottom of the page.


On some Androids, this option will instead say Applications or Application manager.
 It's the red, yellow, green, and blue sphere-shaped app.
 This option is below the "Google Chrome" heading at the top of the screen. Tapping it will uninstall Chrome from your Android device.

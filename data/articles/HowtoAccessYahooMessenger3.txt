 Open the App Store (for iOS) or the Google Play Store (for Android) and search for Yahoo Messenger. Tap the “Install” button to download it to your mobile device.
 Look for the app and tap on it. It has an app icon of a yellow smiley on a purple background.
 Enter your Yahoo ID and password into the fields provided, and click on “Sign In” button.
 Tap on the gears button on the bottom toolbar to bring out the Settings screen. The first section is for “Availability.” Once the Availability menu options, select from “Available,” “Busy,” or “Invisible” to set your online status.


If you want to log in and have your friends know you’re available to chat and talk, click on “Available.” Your friends will know your status by the yellow dot in front of your name.
If you want to log in, but do not necessarily want to be disturbed, click on “Busy.” Your friends will see you online, but they will know you’re busy by the red dot in front of your name.
If you want to log in, but would like to hide from your friends, click on “Invisible.” Your friends will not know you’re online. You can pick and choose which friends you want to talk to, without risking others knowing you’re online. Your name will appear as if you’re offline, with the gray dot in front of it.
 You can now start sending messages to your friends and chatting with them. Tap on the name of your friend from your contact list below, and type in your message in the chat box that appears.

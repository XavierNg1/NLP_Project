 If the server has done all in his or her power to serve the papers directly to the respondent and has been unable to do so, your server can hand those papers over to a party that can legally accept them on the respondent's behalf.A competent adult, age 18 or older, who lives at home with the respondent can usually accept the papers. Similarly, an adult who appears to be in charge at the respondent's workplace or an adult who seems to be in charge where the person receives mail can usually accept the papers, as well.
 When passing the court papers to a substitute, your server must leave that substitute with specific instructions regarding what the papers are and what needs to be done with them.


Make sure that the substitute knows that he or she is receiving court papers for a specific individual. The respondent must be named, and the substitute must be told to deliver the papers to the respondent.
Get the substitute'sÂ name when you leave the papers. If the substitute refuses to provide a name, write down a thorough physical description of the substitute.
 When you serve papers by substitution, you must also mail another copy of all court papers by first-class mail. Address the package to the respondent. You need to send the papers to the same address the server left the papers at.
 Afterward, the server must fill out the "Proof of Service" form as usual. In addition to this form, a "Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service)" form must also be filled out by the server.


Get both forms from the server after he or she fills them out. File them both together at the courthouse on or before your court date.
Provide a postal receipt with your forms indicating that you sent a second copy of the papers through the mail.

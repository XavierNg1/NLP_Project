 If you are interested in adding sequins to your outfit, but don’t want to draw too much attention, try wearing a sequined handbag.

For example, pair a classic black dress with a bright sequined clutch for your next cocktail party or new years bash.;
, You don’t need to wear a bold article of clothing to incorporate sequins into your outfit. A great way to add some pizzazz and fun to your style as you age, is by accessorizing with bold pieces. For example, you could pull off sequined heels, or a dazzlingly sequined brooch. This is a great way to insert your own individuality into your outfits without feeling like you are overdoing it., Sequins are a great way to draw the eyes and as a result they can be used to cover up problem areas.

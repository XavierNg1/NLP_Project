 Insert the tail of a comb into the braid approximately ¼ from the tip. Slowly pull the tail down through the braid to separate the ends. Continue this process up the length of the braid until you reach the roots. Apply additional detangler as needed.

 Once the braid is removed, coat the ends of your locks with detangler. Gently comb through the ends with a wide toothed comb, pick, or your fingers. Gradually work your way up the length of your hair to the roots.

Infants and toddlers are constantly learning about the world around them by means of their senses. That's why they like toys that they can touch, squeeze, poke, smell, see and hear. They find bright colors and fun noises entertaining. In addition, toddlers enjoy toys that can be opened, pulled, pushed, stacked or poured.
Preschool children have a lot of energy and use their playtime to learn new skills. They enjoy painting, drawing and making things. They also like to use their imagination to play dress-up, make up stories, or pretend with their toys.
Older children like more realistic toys that are recognizable from the "real world." Think of children's jewelry or fashion, TV or movie-related products, or music. Sports also become very important at this age and many children will focus on a game or favorite physical activity.;

 Try to coordinate the toys with your child's interests. For example, if she loves horses, you can give her a toy horse to play with, and later, when she's ready for her first riding lesson, you can give her a riding cap, crop and boots.
 Sit down with your child so you can play with her new toy together. This will teach your child that her toy and her world is interesting.

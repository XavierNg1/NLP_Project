 The leads are round or flat wires extending from the bottom of the transistor. They may be labeled on some transistors or you may be able to determine which lead is the base by studying the circuit diagram.
, Read the display on the multimeter and note whether the resistance is high or low.
 The display should give the same reading as when you touched the probe to the emitter.
, Compare the reading on the multimeter's display to the readings you got previously.


If the previous readings were both high and the current readings are both low, the transistor is good.
If the previous readings were both low and the current readings are both high, the transistor is good.
If both readings you receive with the red probe are not the same, both readings with the black probe are not the same, or the readings don't change when switching probes, the transistor is bad.

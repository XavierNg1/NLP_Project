 Look for berries that have white, fuzzy mold and toss them out. The mold can be found around the stem area. You will also want to discard any berries that are too soft or wilted looking; they are too ripe and will rot quickly. Sorting the bad berries from the good ones will prevent mold from spreading., Most of the stems should have fallen off on their own, but it would be a good idea to go through the berries again and pick off any remaining stems. They won't harm you if you eat them, but they will taste bitter.
 In general, you should not wash berries until you are ready to eat them.Washing them too soon can lead to mold. Washing them with vinegar water, however, can kill mold spores and prevent from mold growing in the first place.Put the berries into a colander or strainer, and dunk them into a bowl filled with the vinegar water. Shake colander or strainer, then pull it out. Rinse the berries using cool water; this will get rid of any vinegar flavor.
 Any moisture left on the berries will cause them to mold too soon, so you will need to make sure that they are completely dry before storing them. There are a few ways in which you can dry the berries:


Line the inside of a salad spinner with a few paper towels and put the berries inside. Spin them for a few seconds until there is no more moisture.
Spread them out on a tray and let them air dry. Use a fan to speed up the process.

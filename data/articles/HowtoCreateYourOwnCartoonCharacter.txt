 If you're making a comic or an animated cartoon then figure out what role your character plays.;
, Shy, evil, nice, or not just one personality. A character can be evil and bold, or quiet and mean.
 You can't create a character that's completely perfect, or completely bad. A character could be nice, yet a bit selfish.
 Is it a guy or girl? How old are they? Remember, cartoons are exaggerated. You know, big eyes, or big ears if it's an animal? Big nose? What color is their hair/fur? If you want an animal, what species? Draw your character out.

 Pack it down nice and firm and place your surfboard on it. Step on to the board leading your back foot, trim the board and hold the correct surfing stance with the surfboard balanced on the sandcastle.
 Remember your surfing style and always keep your head up, looking forward, back straight and knees bent.
 The following is an explanation of how it can work.
 (The frontside for a natural foot surfer is to the right and for a goofy foot surfer is to the left.).
 Immediately after changing the angle, you should shift your weight to the front leg as to accelerate the board and keep surfing the wave. But now you would be cutting across the wave in a new direction.
 Remember your wave catching skills, jump or step up cleanly to your feet and start to trim the surfboard and surf the wave towards the beach.;
, When you feel you have control of the surfboard and are comfortably surfing the wave, shift your weight to the back leg, rotate your upper body, shove your hips and attempt to change the angle the surfboard is facing, transfer your weight on to the front leg and accelerate across the wave in the new direction and continue to trim the board.
 This will allow you to continue surfing and you could attempt another change of angle on the same wave.

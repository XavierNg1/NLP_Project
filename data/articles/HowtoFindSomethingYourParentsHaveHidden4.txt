 No matter how careful you are, you won’t be able to make the present look pristine and untouched. Follow a few of these steps if you're uncertain about whether you should mess with something or not:


Removing tape will likely tear the wrapping paper, leaving evidence. Don't mess with the tape.
Wrapping paper is difficult to put back precisely. Trying to rewrap an item is sure to fail, because parents have years of experience wrapping presents to make them look better.
Bows are a definite stop sign. Once a bow is unwrapped or curled the wrong way, they can be so delicate that you can't put them back together.
 Make sure to put everything back where you found it. If you looked under a pile of books or something, don't just pile the books on the floor and leave them there. Your parents will know you've been snooping.


Make sure you know the order of items, not just the positioning. Your parents may have things alphabetically organized or put in some other order.
Pay attention to folds and creases, especially in clothing. They'll know you've been in their stuff if the folds are different than the norm.
Clean off smudges from glass items. Use your shirt or a paper towel to remove any incriminating evidence if you happened to have touched glass and left a visible fingerprint.
 Make sure they don't see this page! If they see this page, it doesn’t matter how well you covered your tracks. They’ll know your intent and won’t trust you. If your parents find out you've been snooping around, they may even dedicate time into finding a better hiding spot.
Log off the computer. Leave no evidence you were on it.
Turn the computer off. If the computer was off to begin with, you want to make sure and power it down.

,,, This song is very basic and uses down strums only. After learning all of the four basic power chords, you have to learn the sections. Blitzkrieg Bop only has two sections, a verse and a chorus. Listen to the song to see how the music changes during these parts.


The verse. The verse is played by down strumming the first power chord eight times, switching and playing the second power chord three times then sliding up to play the fourth power chord five times. Repeat this pattern three times. On the fourth time, you play the pattern slightly differently. You down strum the first power chord four times, switch to the second power chord and hit it four times and then switch back to the first power chord and hit it eight times. You should start to hear the verse. Make small adjustments to the timing if necessary.
The chorus. The chorus is played by down strumming the fourth power chord sixteen times then sliding down to the first power chord (two frets down) and hitting it eight times. Switch to the second power chord and hit it three times then switch back to the first power chord and hit it five times. On the second time round, hit the fourth power chord sixteen times, slide down to the first power chord and hit it eight times, switch to the second power chord and hit it three times then slide up the the third power chord (two frets up) and hit it five times.

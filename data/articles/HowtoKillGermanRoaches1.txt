, Bait stations consist of a plastic housing that contains poison. Cockroaches enter through small holes in the housing to retrieve the bait. Make sure to place the bait stations against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas like your kitchen and bathroom.Place bait stations behind the refrigerator, microwave, oven, toasters, toilet, and other major appliances in your kitchen and bathroom. Also place them underneath your dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, and hot water heater.
Identify high traffic areas by looking for roach droppings. Roach droppings resemble ground black pepper.
 Sticky traps contain pheromones that will attract the roaches. Upon entering the trap, the roaches will become stuck in it and suffocate. Also place these traps against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas.Place sticky traps in the same areas you place bait stations.
Do not spray sticky traps and bait stations with insecticides or cleaning products. These will contaminate the baits. If the bait is contaminated, then the roaches will not enter.

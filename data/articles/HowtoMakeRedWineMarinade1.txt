 Red wine and rosemary are earthy flavors that work well with pork, roasts, and chicken meals. If you don't have fresh rosemary, you can substitute dried rosemary. Just use one tablespoon instead of two. For the rosemary red wine marinade, measure and mix together:⅓ cup (80 ml) of dry red wine
½ cup (120 ml) of red-wine vinegar
2 tablespoons of chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon of salt
½ teaspoon of freshly ground pepper;
, Soy sauce adds depth of flavor to a red wine marinade which makes it great for chicken or pork dishes. You can use reduced-sodium soy sauce if you're watching your sodium intake. Measure out and mix together these marinade ingredients into a bowl:1 cup (240 ml) of soy sauce
1 cup (240 ml) of red wine (like merlot or cabernet sauvignon)
1 cup (240 ml) of red wine vinegar
1 small diced shallot
2 finely minced cloves of garlic

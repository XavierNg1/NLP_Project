 If you’re dealing with a non-venomous snake, the simplest removal method is to let the snake leave your property on its own. Outdoor snakes pose no serious problem, and will wander off on their own time. However, if you have children or pets, keep them away from the snake. Even nonvenomous snakes can have painful bites.








If you frequently notice snakes near your house, your concern should be preventative maintenance rather than individual snake removal.
 If you see a nonvenomous snake hanging out near your house and you’d like it to go somewhere else, sometimes all it needs is a little nudge to be on its way. Use a garden hose to lightly spray the snake until it moves away from your house and out of your yard.








Garter snakes and other snakes that you know not to be dangerous are fine candidates for this removal method.
 If you find a snake in your pool, you can safely lift it out using a pool skimmer or other kind of meshed net.Small, nonvenomous snakes can also be plucked from the patio or grass with a pool skimmer. Try not to grip them too tightly, so you don’t damage their ribs.









Take the snake to the back of your yard or to a nearby wooded area and set them free.
 Outdoor snake traps are usually plastic boxes baited with a substance or aroma that lures snakes inside. Once snakes enter the trap, the shape of the box prevents them from getting out. Set them around your property in areas where you’ve seen snakes spending time.When you trap a snake, drive it to a wooded area and set it free.

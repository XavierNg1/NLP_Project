 Place the ball between the index finger and middle finger of your dominant hand. Make sure the seam of the ball runs perpendicular to your fingers. Place your thumb along the seam. Bend your ring finger and move your middle finger to the top of the ball. Place your ring finger on the opposite side of your index finger so that the ball is resting in these three fingers. Put your pinky alongside your ring finger., Raise your dominant arm straight up over your head. Turn your elbow outward, keeping it straight. If you're using your right hand, twist your forearm towards the left. Turn it to the right if you're left-handed., Make sure your palm is open and relaxed. Turn it upward, towards the sky or ceiling. Then, turn the back of your hand towards the batter so that it's perpendicular to the ground., Do this with the opposite foot of your bowling side. (For example, if you're bowling with your right hand, you'll step forward with your left foot.) Make sure this foot is flat on the ground. Keep the leg on your bowling side behind you with your toe pointed. This foot should be aligned directly behind the other., Face the batter as you do this. Tilt towards the opposite of your dominant side. Allow your bowling arm and foot/leg positions to guide you into this position., Position your wrist 180 degrees from the ground. As you do this, make sure the seam of the ball faces fine leg. Use your ring finger to turn the ball counterclockwise and bowl it toward the batter.

 Preheat the oven at 350℉ (160℃). Prepare the baking tray with foil and lightly grease it with cooking spray. Place the marinated chicken onto the baking tray. Take care to leave the leftover marinade in the bowl. Place the tray in the oven and bake for 15 minutes., Remove the chicken from the oven and flip the pieces over with a fork or tongs. Once flipped, lightly brush some oil to the top of the chicken pieces.
 The tray will still be hot, so use caution when placing it back in the oven.
 Slice the largest piece of chicken to verify that it is thoroughly cooked. The chicken should no longer be pink in the middle. Serve the chicken tandoor with garnished coriander leaves and naan (an Indian flatbread).

 Locate the app on your iPhone and tap on it. The app logo has a picture of a periscope on cyan background.
 If you’ve used the app before, you won’t need to log in again; otherwise, log in by tapping “Log into Twitter.”


You will be brought to your main dashboard screen. The list of people you are following that are live and that have recently broadcasted will be shown.
 At the top of the list is a magnifying glass button. Tap on it, and a search field will appear on the header.
 A list of people matching your search will be displayed. Scroll through it.
 When you find the person you’re looking for, you can follow him or her so that you can easily find their videos later. Tap the button with a plus sign right beside his or her name. The button will be changed to a solid check, indicating that you’re now following him or her, and all his or her videos will be displayed on your dashboard.

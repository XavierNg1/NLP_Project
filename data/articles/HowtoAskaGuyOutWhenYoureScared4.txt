 If he agrees to go on a date with you, either let him choose what you eat or what you do or give some options. This will ensure that you both have a fun time on the date. Or you might let him choose dinner and you choose the movie., Leave your phone in your bag or in your pocket so that you can fully focus on your date. Pay him a compliment or two while you are out. Have some fun and don’t forget to be yourself.
 Don’t continue to ask him out or badger him with questions about why he won’t go. Instead say “Okay then, that’s cool” and tell him you’ll see him later.Don’t get upset or worked up in front of him. If you feel that you might cry, go be alone in the restroom or call a friend.
 If he tells you that he doesn’t want to go out with you or that he is already dating someone, don’t fret. Take a few days to get over the rejection and then focus your sights on someone new. Or, you never know, someone might be about to ask you out as well.

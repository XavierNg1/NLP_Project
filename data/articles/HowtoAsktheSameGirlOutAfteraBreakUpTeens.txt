 Even though it may make you sad, remember that if she doesn't like you after the breakup, you won't get hurt again (unless you go out and break up again). This way, if she does like you, it will come as a surprise when you find out. Don't let her see it surprises you though.;
, If you were friends before you went out, try to get back to that stage.
 This will show that you still care about her. Worry and hurt with her.
 Don't let her know why, let her wonder. Don't talk about this over the phone, through text messaging, or over the internet. It has to be direct, face-to-face communication.
 Walk up and down a hallway or anything. Make sure that you are alone, so that it is quiet and easy to hear her.
 Say something like, "I'm sure you know that I still like you (even if you know this isn't true), and that I had a great time going out. I was wondering if we could go out again sometime. If you'd like, we could completely restart, or we could continue where we left off. What do you think? Will you give me another chance?" You could also add things like "I know I messed up the first time we went out," or "I'm really sorry for what I did."

, If you went out, you should know at least a little of how she thinks. Prepare for her to give you questions back or to talk about the reason you broke up. If it was your fault, make sure she knows how sorry you are.
 Try not to remind her in any way about it, because she may get to thinking about it and worry again.

 Dry the steak well with paper towels, then brush a light layer of vegetable oil over it. Rub in spices, cover loosely, and let sit for an hour.;
, Whether you use charcoal (preferred) or gas, set your grill to use 2-zone cooking: one side very hot (about 450°F/230°C), one side medium (about 250°F/120°C).
 Place the tri-tip on the cool side of the grill, with the thickest part of the steak facing the hot side of the grill, and cook with the lid closed. Turn the steak occasionally, about every 20 minutes, until it reaches 110° (43°C) in the center of the thickest part. This will take about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the thickness of your steak and the temperature of your grill.
 Once the temperature reaches 110° (43°C), move the steak to the hot side of the grill, and sear it for about 5 minutes per side.
 Remove the steak from the grill, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. This will help the steak retain the juices better.
 Cut the steak in half, and note the grain: if the muscle is long strands, rotate the steak 90° and slice the rest across the grain in about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch 5 to 10mm) slices.
 Serve with garlic bread, grilled potatoes or fries, green salad, and a zinfandel or cabaret sauvignon.

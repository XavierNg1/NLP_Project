 If you're already logged into Facebook, doing so will open your News Feed.


If you aren't logged into Facebook, type in your email address (or phone number) and password and click Log In in the top right corner of the screen.
 It's directly to the right of the search bar below your chat sidebar.
 Your Facebook chat bar should disappear from the left side of the screen, which will remove all "Active Now" green dots and the pertaining names.


Clicking the Chat bar in the bottom right corner of your Facebook window will bring back the sidebar.

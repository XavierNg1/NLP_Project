 Each packet contains about 1 tablespoon of gelatin. This is enough to set 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water.If you cannot find powdered gelatin, you can use gelatin sheets instead. To learn how to use those, click here.;
, You will be adding 1 Â½ more cups (337.5 milliliters) of water into the bowl later, so make sure that it is big enough. Do not use hot or warm water for this step., Try to sprinkle the gelatin as evenly as possible over the water; any clumps will prevent the gelatin from absorbing the water. After a few minutes, the gelatin will start to expand. This step is known as "blooming." If a recipe asks you to "bloom" gelatin, this is what it means.It will take about 5 to 10 minutes for the gelatin to finish blooming.
 Pour the water into a saucepan, and place the saucepan on the stove. Heat the water over medium heat until it begins to simmer.
 Do not use boiling water, as this will ruin the gelatin.
 You can use a spoon, fork, or whisk. Lift the spoon out of the gelatin from time to time to see if the powder has melted. If you see any specks or granules on the spoon, keep stirring until you don't see anymore granules.
 You can use shaped molds, cups, or small bowls. You may want to lightly grease the inside of each mold with a flavorless oil; this will make it easier to remove later on.
 Once the gelatin is firm, you can either take it out of the mold, or serve it in the cups or bowls.

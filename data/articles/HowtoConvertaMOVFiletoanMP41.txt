 This is a free program that can convert virtually any media format into any other format. It is available for both Windows and Mac. You can download it from macroplant.com/adapter/.


During installation, check the "Download and install FFmpeg" box. This is required for video conversion. FFmpeg will be installed separately after Adapter finishes.
You shouldn't have to worry about adware if you downloaded from Macroplant.;
, It may take a few moments to start for the first time.
 You can also click "Browse" in Adapter and navigate to your MOV file's location.
 You can find this at the bottom of the Adapter window.
 This will set the converter to the MP4 setting.
 Generally you can leave these at their default. Some users may want to make adjustments:


The "Directory" section allows you to change the destination directory for the converted file. You can also give it a file name.
The "Video" section allows you to adjust the encoder options. The default settings will preserve the original quality.
The "Resolution" section allows you to change the output resolution. Change the "Quality" setting to "High" or "Very High" to preserve the original quality. A higher-quality encoding will result in a larger file size.
The "Audio" section allows you to change the audio encoder settings. Leave these set to "Source" for the best results.
The "Trim" section lets you set the start and end time to remove excess footage.
The "Layers" section allows you to overlay text and images. Click the "Add New Layer" button.
 The length of time this takes will vary from file to file.

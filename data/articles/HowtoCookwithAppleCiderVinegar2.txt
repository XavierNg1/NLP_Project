 With a knife and cutting board, dice up two cloves of garlic. Make sure that you chop the garlic very finely. You do not want large chunks of garlic in your dressing.For a less intense flavor, you might consider using shallots.
 In a medium-sized bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Then whisk them together. Make sure that you combine the oil and vinegar thoroughly. Taste the dressing and add more salt and pepper if needed., Lightly pour some of the dressing on your leafy salad. This dressing pairs well with most leafy greens, particularly kale or arugula. In addition, apple slices and fresh walnuts also go well with the dressing., After whisking everything together, let the marinade sit for about thirty minutes, stirring occasionally. Once it is set, add your meats and veggies and let it marinate for a few hours. You can leave it all in the same bowl that you mixed it in and simply cover it up, or you can place the meat, veggies, and marinade in a large freezer bag. Finally, cook the meat and veggies.

With marinades, you can substitute apple cider vinegar for wine or balsamic vinegar. It balances out the savory flavors of the meats and vegetables with a hint of tang and sweetness.
 If you want to add some extra flavor to your marinade, consider including some additional ingredients. These can be things like Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, onion flakes, or garlic powder. Particularly with chicken and pork, these ingredients will make the meat more flavorful.

 Electric vacuums run off of your home’s AC power to generate powerful suction. Make sure the vacuum is plugged into a nearby electrical outlet, or that the battery is fully charged. If your vacuum has a separate power switch, leave it in the “off” position for now.


Check for a light display that indicates that your vacuum is connected and charged.;
, Most pore vacuums come with a variety of attachments that are designed to be used on different types of blemishes. Examine the blackhead you’re attempting to remove to choose an attachment that will get the job done. Snap the nozzle into place on the front end of the vacuum and make sure that it’s secure.Choose smaller attachments for single, pin-sized spots and larger attachments for big clogs and troublesome clusters.
Your electric vacuum may come with a one-size-fits-all nozzle. The opening of this nozzle will be large enough to cover the blackhead and a small portion of the area around it.
 Position the vacuum over the blackhead so that it’s completely enclosed by the nozzle. Try to hold the vacuum perpendicularly so that the nozzle is flush with the skin. This will help form a secure seal, making the suction more effective.For best results, suction one blackhead at a time.
You might have to move the vacuum around a bit when working around the contours of the nose, cheeks and chin to find the best angle.
 Switch on the vacuum. You should feel a gentle tugging sensation as the suction begins to pull at your skin. After a few seconds, the steady suction will loosen and pull out the compacted dirt and oil that’s clogging the pore. Repeat as many times as needed until you’ve eliminated the worst of the blackheads.After extracting the biggest part of the blackhead, run the vacuum lightly over the surrounding skin to suck out any other small clogs and potential trouble spots.
Follow the cleaning instructions included with your blackhead vacuum to sanitize the unit after each use.

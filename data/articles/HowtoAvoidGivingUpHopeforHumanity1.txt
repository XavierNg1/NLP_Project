 The older gentleman who still holds the door for ladies. The homeless person who sacrifices a small part of the only meal he will have that day to feed a dog. The person who returned that lost wallet rather than just pocketing the cash. All around you there are incidences of people doing brave, compassionate, selfless acts. Look for them.;
, But, the world is not defined by such strict binaries. The truth is, there are bad people with good qualities just as there are good people with bad qualities. Humanity as a whole is the same. All people have redeeming qualities. As one saying puts it, there isn’t a person you wouldn’t love if you read his story.


Take a moment to identify the redeeming qualities in the people you know. Maybe your mom nags at you nonstop, but she is one of the kindest and giving people you know. Sure, your boss can be just plain rude, but he is also a fierce leader and will protect his own at all costs. If you are honest with yourself, you will even find that you, too, have good and not-so-good qualities.
 Reach out to a friend, coworker, or mentor and ask that person to share a story with you about human goodness. Undoubtedly, these people will have many stories to tell. Then, spread the good by sharing these testimonies with others who seem to need inspiration.


One website called See the Good posts stories that people share that have been uplifting or inspiring.You can quickly find a host of other online sources that share the amazing, redeeming qualities of human beings that will restore your faith in humanity.
 It’s sad, but true: bad news will have traveled around the world before good news has even pulled up its pants. You can actively interfere with the spread of bad news, or, at least, not allow the bad to take away from the good.


For example, when you walk in on a group gossiping, deter the negativity by sharing something positive about the person or people being discussed.

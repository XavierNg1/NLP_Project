 Don't ever think of what you're going to say while the person is talking! This is rude, and they'll know that you weren't really listening and that you think more highly of your own opinion than of theirs. And that may hurt their feelings. While this isn't about speaking nicely per se, it is an important part of holding a decent and thoughtful conversation with other people.


Show more interest in the other person than in yourself and you will have a captive audience for the things that you do want to get across.

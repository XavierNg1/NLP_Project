 Your shift may be ending or someone else could do the job better. For whatever reason for a hand off, getting the job done is more important than individual egos. Your team's client doesn't care who does it, just that it gets done.
 You know all those emails you've received in the past six months that tinker with how the team works, explain how to use certain tools and outline priorities? The person who just joined your team didn't receive them because they weren't here. Make sure they learn about recent team issues and resolutions.
 If you know a better way of doing things then share it with others. If someone else knows a better way, learn it. And don't restrict feedback to criticism. Give out some praise for a job well done. We'd all like the feedback to come from the boss, but by sharing feedback yourselves, you offload some work from your boss.
 Fiefdoms lead to turf wars - conflicts over which team has what responsibility. They drain productivity from the company. Classic symptoms of fiefdoms are "providing a feed" to another group (instead of access to live corporate data) and being told "not to talk to someone" outside the team.

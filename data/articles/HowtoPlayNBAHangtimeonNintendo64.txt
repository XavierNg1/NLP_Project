 It is best to create a player because eventually he or she will improve.;
,, It's best to pick players that are good for your team. Try to get ones that will help give your team offense or defense. Don't go with only shooters or only defenders.
 This game requires you to use only 3 buttons on the controller. The buttons are A, down C, and right C.
 It's easiest to make shots while holding down the A button while shooting. Right C is pass.
 Right C is to swat the ball from a player. A and right C are to push the player, knocking him to the ground and sometimes making him lose the ball. A and down C are to jump high for a rebound. You can stop an opposing player's dunk by pushing the player as he is going for the dunk.

 You don't have to stick to the same kaomoji that everybody creates. Come up with new ones using any character you can!;
, It's possible to create some basic kaomoiji with any keyboard - a common classic is the ^_^ face. Many keyboards across different languages have the same symbols, so take advantage of what you can in order to create kaomoiji.
 If you have a Japanese keyboard installed on your phone or computer, you can make more kaomoji. The Japanese keyboard has more characters, so it will help to make your kaomoiji look more expressive. Look for examples on the internet.
 You can also use a kaomoji application that you can download for free on an app store. After you download, open it. Many application simply copy the kaomoji onto your clipboard, and you can paste it into texts or documents.

 Buying a horse requires a considerable amount of coin, at least at the beginning of the game. If you have been increasing your Speech skill, it may not be as expensive, but it is still going to cost you.


You can buy horses in stables outside all major cities.;
, Stealing a horse can be easier, depending on when and where you do it. If you steal a horse out in the wilds, the people you steal from will have a much harder time tracking you down than if you do it near a city.


To steal a horse, just mount any horse you find.
 Some stable owners will allow you to borrow horses once you befriend them. Try the following stables:


Riften stables—you can borrow a horse by winning a brawl with Hofgrir, or by erasing Shadr’s debt with Sapphire.
Katla’s Farm in Solitude. If you help Katla harvest her crops, she’ll allow you to borrow a horse.
 Walk up to the horse. Interact with it and you will climb up on its back.
 Move the horse the same way you would if you were walking. The directional buttons and putting on speed are the same for a horse as they are for your character

, Unsheathe your weapon if you want to fight on horseback. You cannot use magic when you are riding a horse. You can choose which side to come at your enemy and then strike accordingly.


You can also make your horse rear up on its back legs.
 To do this, use the interact button (the same one used to mount the horse).

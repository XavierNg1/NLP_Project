 You may need to do a little self-assessment to determine why you are in a bad mood.Identifying the source of your mood gives you the opportunity to address the problem. Sometimes the answer may be an easy fix (like you feel hungry or lonely), but you may find that there is a bigger reason behind your mood that has no “quick fix.”


If you find that the cause of your bad mood is a bigger problem that you do not feel equipped to deal with, find a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and make long-term changes to your outlook on life.
 Many people find themselves in a bad mood when they are overwhelmed with a long list of items to do for work or daily life.Getting some items done, even if they just put a small dent in your long list, may make you feel better. Evaluate your list and see if there are one or two items that could be completed quickly. Crossing off these items can make you feel better and may give you the momentum to tackle a larger item.
 Reflect on your day or your week and think about (or better yet, write down) the good things that happened. Focusing on the positive aspects of your life and acknowledging your gratitude for the gifts of people and things in your life can make you feel happier.

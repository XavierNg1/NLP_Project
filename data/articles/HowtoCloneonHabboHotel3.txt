Create another account, using a different email. From this, put your username with banned, muted, or hacked next to it so people know it is you.
Create another character, if you are banned or muted from a room, go on another account. However, you may not be liked by the owner/someone with rights, so be wary with choosing your name.
Complain about the mute/hack/ban to Habbo Customer Support to see if you can get the account unmuted/unhacked/unbanned.

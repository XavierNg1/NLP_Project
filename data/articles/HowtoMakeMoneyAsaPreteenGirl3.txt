 Usually you can't get a job at Cracker Barrel, but at some of your local cafes and restaurants, you can send a letter or talk to the manager about doing small things for a small price. This means if you go to a cafe, you can sweep and clean tables or wash a few dishes.
 You can tend to the plants, water them, and prune them. You can maybe do this at a local plant shop, where you know the owners of the business. Get your parents to talk to the owners.
 You can also just work for your parents. It will not be awkward, and you might have fun!

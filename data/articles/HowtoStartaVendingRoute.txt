 The places you put your machines will determine which vending machines you need to purchase. You should know:


Whether your machines will be inside or outside;
The type of products people at the location would be interested in vending; and
Approximately how many people will use your machines.;
, Guesstimate the size of the equipment you need by assuming a daily average of one vend, per machine, per person. Multiply that figure by the number of days between service visit intervals.



Search vending machine suppliers and find machines that meet your criteria. Take notes on the machine's manufacturer name, product capacity, price, and other pertinent information.
You can search for used vending equipment online, but check local classifieds to find machines for sale in your area. Buying locally saves you the cost of freight shipping and usually allows you to see the product in person before you make a commitment to buy.
When choosing between new and used machines, remember that used equipment often requires more maintenance and repair. Unless you can do the work yourself, you may need to pay a vending machine repair company more frequently.
 The best way to do this is to personally visit places where you think you would like to vend.


To save time and streamline your efforts, try calling businesses first and ask if they already have vending service. If they do, ask if they are happy with their current vending company.
You can also hire a vending locator company to locate accounts for you.
 When installing your machine at a new account, fill it to capacity. Pay attention to product expiration dates and avoid buying in quantities so large that product is likely to expire before it sells.
 Fill the machines with product, then do a few test vends to be sure everything is in working order. Check back with your account in a week to see how much product they consumed and adjust your service intervals accordingly.

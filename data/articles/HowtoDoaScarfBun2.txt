 Use a brush to neatly comb back your hair. Gather it into a ponytail and secure it with an elastic either at the top of your head for a top knot or the back of your head for a regular bun. Wrap the end of the pony around the base, and pin it in place with bobby pins.You can also leave your hair down if you prefer.
 For a front of the head bun, you should use a large rectangular scarf. Carefully fold the scarf lengthwise into a thin band that’s approximately 3-inches (8-cm) wide.If you prefer, you can fold the scarf smaller than 3-inches (8-cm).
 Once the scarf is folded into a band, wind it around your head with the ends meeting at the front of your head. Tie the ends into a knot right at your hairline.








You don’t have to worry too much about the placement of the scarf at this point. You’ll be able to adjust it later.
 With the scarf tied into a knot, gather the two ends at your hairline together. Gently twist the ends over one another to create a single, long strand from the scarf.
 After you’ve created the single strand, hold the end of it with one hand and the knot with the other. Slowly begin to wind the twist around itself and the knot in a circular motion to create a swirled shape that’s similar to a cinnamon roll.








Continue to twist the scarf into the bun shape until you have no fabric left.
 Once you’ve wound up all of the scarf into the bun, take the end and push it under the knot. You can tuck the excess fabric anywhere under the knot where it fits and will stay secure.








It’s important to make sure that the end is securely tucked under the knot in the scarf. If it’s not, the bun may start to unravel.
 After you’ve secured the scarf bun, you can play with the placement of the bun. Keep it in the center of your hairline or move it to one side or the other for a more playful look.

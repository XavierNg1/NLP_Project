 You can't enable or disable JavaScript in Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 Home or Starter editions., This will search your computer for the Edit Group Policy program., It should be at the top of the Start window., To do so:

Double-click User Configuration.
Double-click Administrative Templates.
Double-click Windows Components.
Double-click Microsoft Edge.
 Doing so opens a window with JavaScript options., This will enable JavaScript in your browser.

If Enabled already has a check next to it, JavaScript is enabled in Edge.
 It's at the bottom of the window. Doing so will save your settings and apply JavaScript to Edge, though you may need to restart the Edge browser before these changes show up.

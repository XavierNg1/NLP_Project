 People might not really enjoy your company, but such is the burden of acting. Motor-mouth syndrome commonly besets those using high-energy drugs like cocaine, as the thoughts spill out so fast the user can't get them up fast enough. It doesn't matter what you're saying, just keep talking.
 Tap your fingers and feet. Get up and move around every few minutes. Let your eyes dart back and forth across the room uncontrollably. You want to feel like there is an enormous reserve of energy inside of you that is bursting at the seams, powering you like the energizer bunny.


Many cocaine users even report that they breath faster than normal.
 If you're faking drug inhalation, then you'll be scratching at your nose and wiping away excess snot for the majority of the night.
 When all of your energy comes from drugs, you can quickly go from restless to agitated. You might snap easily, be prone to anger, or just start acting uncomfortable and squirmy. This is often showcased by extreme mood swings, which become more noticeable with higher doses and longer highs., Uppers don't tend to last long, instead sapping the user of all their energy and leaving them far, far more depressed than when they began. Cocaine, for reference, usually only lasts about 20 minutes.Sleepiness, irritability, and lethargy are common in the crashing phase.

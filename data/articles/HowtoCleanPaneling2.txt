 To both clean and oil your wood you can use 1 cup (240 ml) olive oil mixed with 1/4 cup (60 ml) white vinegar. Combine these ingredients into a spray bottle. Light shake the bottle to mix the oil and vinegar, and then screw on the spray cap.You should be able to purchase wood oil specifically designed for unfinished paneling at your local hardware or home-supply store.
Be careful when cleaning unfinished paneling. The unprotected wood can easily absorb water, grease, and other liquids, and can quickly become warped or distorted.
 Always test any solutions on a small area first before trying to clean a large section of your paneling. Using a clean cloth, wipe the solution on a small, inconspicuous area and let sit. Check the test area after a few minutes to make sure there is no damage before continuing., Make sure that the cloth is damp but not wet; if itâ€™s wet, you risk causing water damage to your unfinished wood. Then, gently rub the oil/vinegar mixture into the wood. Work the oil into the wood by rubbing small sections at a time, working from the bottom to the top.Make sure to rub the oil in along the direction of the grain. This will allow the wood time to absorb the oil and will maintain the beauty of your unfinished wood paneling.
 If the unfinished wood paneling is still dry after applying a first layer of oil, then another coat may be necessary. Let the first application sit for a few minutes before reapplying the vinegar and oil solution.

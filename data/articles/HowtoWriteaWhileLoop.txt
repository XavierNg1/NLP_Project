 Open up the program and get to the portion of code where the while loop is needed.;
, Many times, a while loop uses a variable for definition. For instance, if your variable "x" will be the value that determines how long the loop lasts, it's important that you define "x" as a whole number or similar data type.
 The syntax is different in various computer languages. The while command usually includes the words "do while," along with other minimal code.
 Everything that needs to be continued must come between the "do while" command and a separate "else" command that will cause the program to skip ahead if the while condition is not true.
 This command comes in many different syntax structures, but the idea is the same: the loop will not continue if the condition referenced by "while" is no longer valid. For example, if the command is "do while x > 4" the else command will trigger changes when the variable "x" becomes greater than 4.
 Part of writing an effective while loop involves anticipating how your code function will act. This kind of prediction can be the difference between a smoothly functioning piece of code and a failed attempt.
 Each computer programming language has its own syntax, which is the way that the code words are structured for use and understood. The idea behind a while loop can be great, but if the words are out of place or misused in any way, the result will not work.


Run through each line of code and consider what happens when. A while loop can become excessively broad or global within a program. Looking at each line of code helps the programmer to dial back into the most basic elements and uses of the while loop.
 The run time is often the place where developers catch any last glitches. If your while loop is written well, your program will work as you want it to at run time.


Watch for typos. Any typing errors can cause the code to crash or to not work. Scan the code and catch any errors.

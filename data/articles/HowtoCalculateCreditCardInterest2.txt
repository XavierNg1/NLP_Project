 A default/penalty rate is higher than the rate you got when you signed up for your card. It's triggered when you violate the penalty terms in your contract. Examples of violations might include exceeding your balance limit or consistently making late payments.
 You may be able to find a standard default/penalty APR somewhere in your statement or contract. It's more likely, though, that the bank will send you a letter telling you that it's changing your rate. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or CARD Act, requires banks to give 45 days' notice before adjusting your interest rate.Your bank will explain your new rate in the letter.


For example, you may have had an original APR of 20 percent. However, you missed two straight payments — 60 days. You received a letter saying the credit card company was raising your rate to a default/penalty rate of 35 percent.
 Divide your new rate by the number of days in the year, 365. In our example, you would complete the following equation: 35 ÷ 365 = 0.0958. This is the interest you’re paying on a daily basis.
 Because the number of days in a month can vary, make sure you’re using the right number for the month in question. Since January has 31 days, you would multiply 0.0958 x 31 to get 2.97. Your interest in January would be 2.97 percent of your balance.
 Remember to convert the percentage to a decimal. In our example, 2.97 percent becomes 0.0297.


If you have a balance of $1,000 at the end of January, you pay $1,000 x 0.0297, or $29.70 in interest.

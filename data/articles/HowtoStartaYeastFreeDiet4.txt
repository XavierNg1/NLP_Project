 Some people think of breakfast as something they grab as they run out the door, while others believe it is the most important meal of the day, and has to have enough calories to get the day started. Recognize your own tendencies and interests, and make meals that are right for you.Consider these options when making Breakfast:


One piece of fruit.
Porridge â€“ oats or rice cereal.
Yeast-free bread or rice cakes.
Egg with avocado and tomato.
Cottage cheese.
 Do you need to bring food with you to work? Are you cooking for two (or more) at home? Some people like to eat small amounts and just snack a lot, while others want to have a nice big plate of food at dusk. Get to know what you really want to eat. Consider these options for lunch or dinner:


Lentil soup.
Any meat with plenty of vegetables.
Vegetable stir fry with brown rice.
Cold chicken with cottage cheese.
Potato salad.
Hummus sandwich on pita bread.
Avocado sandwich on sourdough bread.
 You will start to use certain ideas regularly, and have a selection of go-to dishes, as everyone tends to on any diet (one they are watching or not), but it is always worth keeping a few possibilities nearby to mix things up now and then.


You can do a search for yeast-free meals to look for new recipes, as there are always new ideas being posted and talked about online. Sometimes you will simply be reminded of ingredients you haven't thought to use in a long time - and the same stir-fry can be a whole different meal whether you center it around bok-choy and carrots or brussels sprouts and kale.
You can also just look up a few of your favorite ingredients, and modify the results a little if it's necessary. Remember that you can usually replace regular milk with soy milk, or vinegar with lemon juice, so long as the recipe is simple.

 Forklifts vary in brand, size and purpose. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.


How much weight does the forklift need to lift? Always purchase a lift that can handle at least the heaviest load, even if you rarely lift that much weight.
What is the maximum height the load will be lifted? Forklifts vary in how high they can lift a load. Again, think in terms of at least your maximum height.
Will the forklift be used outdoors or indoors? Engine forklifts are typically used outdoors and electric lifts are used indoors.;
, Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.


Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in.
Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale.
Local businesses that recently purchased a new forklift may be selling the used model directly.



Ask the seller how many hours the lift has been used. Most machines have an hour counter that keeps track of its running time. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts.
Look over the maintenance records. Has the forklift been maintained and serviced on a regular schedule? Check to see if any parts have been replaced during the service.
Inquire about the factory warranty. If it is expired or soon will expire, it may be possible to pay a fee to extend the warranty. Equipment with a warranty is your safest purchase.
Have a qualified forklift operator view and test-drive the lift.
Ask a mechanic to check the forklift for potential problems that you have identified or might have overlooked. Add the cost of needed repairs into the selling price when making comparisons.

 The script, or screenplay, outlines all of the elements (audio, visual, behavior, and dialogue) that are required to tell a story through movies or TV.


A script is almost never the work of a single person. Instead, it will go through revisions and rewrites, and ultimately will be interpreted by the producers, directors, and actors.
Movies and TV are visual mediums. This means that you will need to write your script in a way that encompasses the visual and auditory aspects of the story. Focus on writing pictures and sounds.
 Find movie scripts online and decide what you like (and don’t like) about them. Get a feel for how the action is portrayed, dialogue is written, and characters are developed.
 Assuming you already have an idea you want to write about, sketch out all the necessary plot details, relationships, and personality traits that will guide your story. Which elements are the most integral to your concept? How do your characters interact and why? What’s your larger point? Are there any plot holes? Write notes addressing these points in any format you see fit.

 Snipe the exposed body of the enemy rather than the vehicle itself. When done correctly the vehicle's protection is moot.(This is an extremely difficult skill to master and should be practiced thoroughly first in order not to waste ammo)

, In Halo, the sniper has a cross hair whether you zoom in or not, which makes it much easier to point blank someone with the sniper rifle. However, this is still a tough skill to master and possibly remains outside the realm of 'sniping'. However good snipers in Halo can utilize the sniper rifle's potential whether in close range or at a distance.

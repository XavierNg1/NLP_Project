 Elliptical trainers provide a low impact workout that is gentle on the joints, so this might be a good choice if you suffer from chronic hip pain.Just make sure that when you use the machine, you set it to a low resistance.


If the machine has an incline option, then set the incline to a low level as well.
You can also try using the machine with your hands on the moving handles and on the stationary handles to see which works better for you.
 Treadmills allow you to walk at a comfortable pace and on a level surface, which is better for hip pain. You can even find treadmills that have joint-friendly surfaces. Some other things to consider when looking at treadmills include:Safety features, such as side rails and an emergency stop button.
A strong motor to prolong the life of the machine.
A belt that is wide and long enough for your stride.
 Some people find that recumbent bikes provide a more comfortable position than standard stationary bikes, especially for those with hip pain. The back on a recumbent bike supports you, so you may find it easier to use than a standard stationary bike. Some other things to consider when looking at recumbent bikes include:A comfortable, cushioned seat that you can adjust to suit your needs.
Adjustable resistance settings.
 As long as you use your core muscles to propel your body, a rowing machine can be a safe and effective exercise for people with hip pain. Look for a machine that uses air or fluid to create resistance and avoid machines that use weights to create resistance. Weight driven machines may lead to jerky movements and this may be harder on your joints.Also, make sure that you start with the lowest level of resistance on the machine and work up as your fitness level increases.

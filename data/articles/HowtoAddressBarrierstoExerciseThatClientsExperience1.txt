 Time-friendly exercise options include:


Breaking workouts down into 10-minute bursts spaced throughout the day.
Helping her find "hidden" workout opportunities, like holding walking meetings at work instead of sitting, or walking the kids to school instead of driving them.
Remind her that doing short workouts throughout the day, or working out early, both leaves her energized and accomplished and eliminates the "no time, no energy" excuse later in the day.;

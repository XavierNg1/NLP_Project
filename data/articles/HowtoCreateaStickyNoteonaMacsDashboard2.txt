 One of the most useful features of the Stickies desktop app is the ability to create a new sticky note from any highlighted text. This is great for creating a note from a website, email, calendar entry, or any other piece of text. This shortcut will create a new sticky note on your desktop from the text that you have selected. You can also select images and links, and these will be copied to the sticky note as well.If this doesn't work, click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. Open the Keyboard section and click the Shortcuts tab. Select the Services category and then find "Make New Sticky Note." Check the box to enable this keyboard shortcut.Note that desktop sticky notes are separate from the Dashboard sticky notes.
 You don't have to use the keyboard shortcut to create sticky notes. Opening the Stickies app in your Applications folder will allow you to create new notes and adjust your sticky note properties.
 With the sticky note highlighted, this shortcut will force the sticky note to stay in front of your other windows. You can also enable this from the Note menu.
 This will let you see anything that is underneath the note, and is useful when used with the previous shortcut. You can also enable this from the Note menu.
 You can resize desktop sticky notes to be any size. If the text in the note doesn't fit inside, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through it.
 Sticky notes don't need to be just text. You can drag media files into the sticky note, and they will appear with playback controls. This includes video and audio files. You can also add PDF files to sticky notes.

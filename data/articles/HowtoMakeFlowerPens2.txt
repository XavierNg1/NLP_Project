 You'll want one green roll of duct tape for the stem and another color of your choice for the petals. Duct tape comes in a variety of colours so you can get as creative as you want when making your flower.
 You can use your pen to measure the length of the duct tape that you will be using. Use a sharpie to mark the edge of your pen cap to ensure your pen can still close. Place your pen vertically against a piece of duct tape and line up the edge of the tape with the line you just marked. Cut the tape so it measures from the top of your pen to the line you marked with your sharpie. Roll the tape on the pen.You may also wrap around the pen to create a pattern to the top.
 Whether you want all pink or an assortment of petals, design your finished flower to ensure you keep the pattern you want. You can find a larger variety of duct tape colors at an art supply store relative to a hardware store.
 Cut a piece of duct tape so it’s length is about a third or less of the length of your pen. Fold the top of the piece of duct tape so that it makes a triangle. Roll your pen with the extra tape at the bottom of the triangle so that the petal sticks to your pen with the top pointing out.You may also cut the top of the duct tape into a triangle rather than fold it in.
 Continue to cut or fold small triangle shapes with a little extra tape at the bottom, and stick them onto the top of the pen. Make sure that all the petals are pointing out to the top and you’re following the design you have laid out. Build up your flower buds petal by petal until your pen looks like a real flower!

 Fill a saucepan about ¼ or ⅓ full with water. Bring to a simmer. Place a second pan or a glass bowl on top of the saucepan, making sure it is stable and does not touch the water.;
, Pour the chocolate chips into the bowl. Heat until melted, stirring occasionally. Stir in peppermint oil to taste, typically about ¼ tsp (1.25mL). Remove from heat.


You can use any type of chocolate, but larger chunks may require special tempering.
Alternatively, replace both ingredients with mint-flavored chocolate chips, "bits," or "melts."
You can replace the oil with 1 tsp (5mL) peppermint extract, but this tends to have a weaker flavor.
 You can bake your own thin, crisp chocolate cookies, using the recipe below. For a quicker thin mint, just use one of these storebought options:


Graham crackers (chocolate graham crackers match the color of thin mints)
Unsalted snack crackers (Ritz crackers)
Chocolate sandwich cookies (Oreos) with the filling removed

, Ideally, use a pair of kitchen tongs to avoid breaking the cookies. Gently dip the cookie or cracker into the melted chocolate, submerge it, and pull it out again.


If you don't have any tongs, you can spoon the chocolate directly onto the cookies.
 Transfer the cookies onto a wire rack, with wax paper or foil underneath to catch the drips. Let cool for about four hours in the refrigerator, until the chocolate coating hardens.

 Add 1 cup (125 g) of raw, unsalted cashews, ¼ cup (59 ml) of water, 1 tablespoon (25 g) of finely chopped green chile, 1 ½ teaspoons (1 ½ g) of minced ginger, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of lemon juice, and ¾ teaspoon (4 g) of sea salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it has a thick, rustic texture, which should take approximately 5 seconds.You can add more of the green chile, ginger, lemon juice, and sea salt if you prefer. Taste the mixture and decide if you want to add more seasoning.;
, The mixture may be too thick after you first mix it to work well as a dip. If you want a thinner consistency, mix in more water using the food processor. It’s best to add just a tablespoon (15 ml) or so at a time so you don’t thin it too much.If you want to turn the dip into a salad dressing, continue adding water until it has a thin enough consistency to pour over your favorite salad.
 Once the dip reaches your desired consistency, add 2 tablespoons (6 g) of finely chopped cilantro and use a spoon to carefully mix in it in. Next, spoon the dip into a bowl and serve.The dip pairs well with vegetables sticks, crackers, or chips. You can also use it as a sandwich spread.

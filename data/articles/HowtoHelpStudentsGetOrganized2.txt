 Do not, however, reward specific students with bonus points for being neat. This is academic favoritism and can be interpreted as very unfair.



For example, do a 'notebook check' once or twice a week. If a student has obviously made an effort, give them a star to put on their chart. Once they have reached a certain number, have them pick something out of a prize box. Or, if the whole class is organized a few times in a row, throw a little party or have a day where they can wear their pajamas to school; something fun like that.

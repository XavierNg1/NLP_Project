 There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and it may take months or years for a friend to process their grief.;
, The grieving process may be a roller coaster ride of emotions- 1 day your friend may not have the will power to get out of bed, and the next day, they may be yelling, screaming or even laughing.
 Sometimes, bereaved individuals feel isolated and alone. You don't have to have all the answers. In fact, sometimes just listening or providing a hug will support a grieving friend.

 The first of these five languages is to speak words of admiration, that is, to compliment your loved ones, to praise them, to provide affection through spoken words.Tell your loved ones that they look nice or that you enjoy their company.
Compliment their cooking.
Thank them for straightening up while you were out.
 Quality time is any time you are giving your loved one complete, undivided attention. Spend your quality time doing simple things that won’t be a source of distraction.Visit a museum.
Hold a family game night.
Build an outdoor fire and roast marshmallows.
 Another way for you to express your devotion is by giving gifts. Remember, the mere act of presenting your loved one with a thoughtful token is an expression of devotion. It is not necessary for you to shower them with expensive things. Think of something small, perhaps even handmade, that your loved one would enjoy.Knit a scarf.
Print out a picture of you together and put it in a frame.
Buy the nice pair of running shoes they have been looking it.
 The scope of the act doesn’t matter as much as the intention.This could be something simple, like taking out the trash.
This could also be something more complicated, like building a bookshelf.
 Finally, a fifth way to express your devotion to a loved one is through physical touch. If the loved one in question is a romantic partner, this may mean sex, snuggling, or kissing, But even if you are cultivating devotion for a child, parent, or friend, physical touch in the form of hugs, hand holding, or just being in close physical proximity can show devotion and strengthen bonds.

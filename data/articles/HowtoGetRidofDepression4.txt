 Use a journal to keep track of patterns that may affect your mood, energy, health, and sleep. Journaling can also help you process your emotions and gain insight into why certain things make you feel the way you do.There are people who teach journaling, books about journaling, and even websites to keep online journals if you require more structure.
 Try to get into the habit of writing every day, even if it’s just for a few minutes. Some days you may feel like writing more, while on other days you may have less energy or inspiration. Writing does get easier as you write more frequently, so stick with it to see how it can help., Make it easy to write at a moment’s notice by carrying a journal or notepad and pen with you all the time. Alternately, consider using a simple note-taking application on a phone, tablet computer or other device that you often have with you.
 Just let the words flow and don’t worry if they don’t make much sense. Don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or style; and don’t worry about what other people might think.
 You can keep your journal private if you want to. You can also share some things with family, friends or a therapist if you think it might be helpful. You can also start a public tell-all blog. It is up to you and your comfort level how you use your journal.

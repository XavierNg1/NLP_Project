 You could make a Superhero story! These are very popular, and can be fun to make because you get to decide the costume and powers of the Hero! You could also do a teen story about a teen going through some rough changes in life. Or you could do something fan-inspired, like create your own Harry Potter story, but with you in the leading role!;
, If you are doing the book/comic with a friend then you should decide who will be the author and who will draw and color. You can also do both, changing roles at times. If you are doing it on your own, though, you have got a bit of work to do!

, Now you need to discuss the name of the book and the front cover. The illustrator will now draw the cover, including the title and your names and a date!

, At this point you will be on the first page of the book. You need to discuss what the first page is about. The writer will start first by writing the first bit, then the picture is drawn by the illustrator. Do this for every page and section of the book/comic until you feel that it's finished! Don't forget to write a very short summary on the back of the book, explaining what happens in your story.

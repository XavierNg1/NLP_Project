 Perhaps the biggest factor to consider is if the person in question suffers from depression or anxiety related to their orthorexia.


Does the person have increased anxiety or panic attacks if they can’t get the food they need or want?
Does the person talk about food in a nervous and constant manner?
Does the person become depressed or despondent if they can’t get the food they want or need?
Does the person lose control mentally if they lose control of their diet? People with normal dietary restrictions, like vegans or people who are lactose intolerant, are able to keep mental control if they don’t have access to food that meets their needs., Orthorexia has the potential to severely damage people’s relationships. This is because people with orthorexia may be overly zealous about their diet and may want to recruit other people to their way of life.


People with orthorexia may tend to argue with people who don’t have dietary habits like their own.
People with orthorexia will often denigrate other people’s eating habits.
In some cases children might be harmed by a parent insisting that the child eat a very restricted "healthy" diet.Orthorexia will often lead people to avoid dining with longtime friends because the friends don’t share their food choices. A way to tell if someone has orthorexia as opposed to just being picky, vegan, or having other food requirements, is to suggest restaurants that offer options that are friendly toward their dietary needs. If the person still declines, they might have orthorexia., Another indicator of orthorexia is if a person’s food choices negatively impact other people in their life — especially during holidays.


Does the person require or demand other people prepare dishes made of specific ingredients?
Does the person avoid family gatherings and meals because they disagree with other people’s food choices?
Does the person insult or is otherwise rude to family members because of the food they prepare for a family gathering?

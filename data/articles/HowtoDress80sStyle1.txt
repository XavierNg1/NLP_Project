 In the 1980s, it was almost impossible to find a jacket, blouse or dress without shoulder pads -- and even if you could, you would probably put them in yourself, perhaps layering one set on top of the other! Shoulder pads give you a boxy, square-shouldered silhouette, which is perfect for making a statement in business attire or evening wear., Over-sized tops were everywhere in the 80s. Try a massive, off-the-shoulder sweatshirt, a giant t-shirt worn over leggings, or a brightly-colored sweater cinched in at the waist with a gaudy belt. Over-sized tops are also really easy to get.â€”Just buy a top that's several sizes too big, or shop in the men's section!, Stirrup pants were one of the more unfortunate 80s trends. Usually made from a stretchy fabric, these pants had an elastic "stirrup" that hooked around the underside of the foot, pulling the pants down and creating an unflattering, triangle-shaped leg. However, if you really want to commit to 80s fashion, these are the way to go!

, The mini skirt came to the forefront of fashion in the 80s and has never really left. Look for skintight skirts in materials like denim, PVC and cotton and pair them with an over-sized, off the shoulder t-shirt (tucked into the skirt) and some legwarmers for true 80s fashion cred.
 Jelly shoes were an 80s staple. Made from PVC and available in a wide variety of styles and colors (some were even glitter-infused), jelly shoes are the perfect accompaniment to any 80s outfit. This cheap and cheerful footwear has been making a comeback in recent years, so you you shouldn't have any trouble finding them.

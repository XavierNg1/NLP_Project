 All motorcycle batteries should be checked at least once per month.;
, The terminals should be cleaned to prevent corrosion which can cause problems starting the bike.  Cleaning regularly prevents the buildup of dirt and sediments.
 Loose connectors can mean the bike will not start or it will start only intermittently. They should also be checked after minor accidents or spills.
 Regular maintenance also entails looking out for leaks or checking if they are wet. Sometimes water can get inside the casing and cause the metal connectors to rust. Leakage can indicate problems so it should be dealt with immediately. 

, The water level should be checked at least once every other week. Use the minimum and maximum markers etched inside the cells as a guide. Distilled water is recommended simply because it has no impurities in it. It therefore means that batteries do not need to work as hard to perform and they last longer as a result. 

, Motorcycle batteries should be charged once per week. Allowing them to be completely exhausted will only shorten their life and impact their performance. While they can be jump-started like car batteries, it is always better to just take care of them so this will be unnecessary.

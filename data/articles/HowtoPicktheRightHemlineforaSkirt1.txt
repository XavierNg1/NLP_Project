 Mini skirts show more skin, creating the illusion of a longer leg. If you have a height of 5'4" (about 163 centimeters) or less, a skirt that falls out somewhere between your mid-thigh and knee will provide your legs with the greatest amount of length.;
, Skirts that drag down to your calf or ankle can overwhelm your lower half with too much fabric, making you look short and frumpy as a result. If you do opt for a longer skirt, go for a fitted style that hugs your legs instead of a full, flowing style.
 Midi skirts fall out at the mid-calf and may divide the length of your legs in a way that also shortens the appearance. If you do not need to worry about this shortening effect, however, a midi skirt may make a nice option.
 Long gypsy skirts can look especially elegant on taller women, since the extra fabric compliments their figure rather than overwhelming it. Stick with a hemline that stops just above your ankles. Showing the thinnest part of your ankles keeps your legs looking lean and slender.
 Knee-length skirts are virtually universally flattering. They prevent short women from looking any shorter and show off an appropriate, flattering amount of skin on average and tall women.

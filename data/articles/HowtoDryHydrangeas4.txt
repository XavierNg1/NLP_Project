 Pressing flowers preserves the color and shape of the petals, but the shape of the hydrangea blossom itself will be flattened.


Cut the hydrangea blossoms in half to preserve and flatten their round shape.
Cut individual flowers and plan to arrange them in the shape of a hydrangea blossom after they're dried.
 A press is made with two pieces of plywood that are tightened with screws and wing nuts. Remove the top piece of plywood and lay a piece of cardboard followed by two sheets of parchment or pressing paper on the bottom piece of plywood.


The cardboard and parchment paper should be cut a few inches smaller than the bottom of the press.
The bottom sheet of parchment paper is called the "blotter." It absorbs moisture from the drying flower and is switched out every few days. The top sheet of parchment paper anchors the flowers during the drying process.
 Arrange them so that no petals or folded or crushed, unless you are trying to create a windblown effect.


A little layering is fine, but don't build too many layers of petals, or they won't dry out correctly.
If you wish, add other foliage like leaves, ferns and other flowers.
 Cover the flowers with a sheet of parchment paper, a second "blotter" sheet, a piece of cardboard, and the top piece of the flower press. Screw the plywood pieces together and tighten them with the wing nuts.
 Set the press in a dry place in your home and let the drying process begin.


Open the press and change out the blotter sheets every few days. Discard the old sheets and replace them with fresh ones.
After a week or two, the flowers should be completely dry. Remove them from the press.
 They are now ready to use in craft projects such as cards or jewelry. Pressed flowers also look beautiful mounted on a card and framed.

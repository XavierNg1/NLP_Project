 Sometimes unusual items will be perfect for your personal look.


For the crafty person, making your own jewelry is the perfect way to show off your unique taste.
Wearing Grandmaâ€™s old cardigan or brooch may not seem unique, but few people wear older accessories like these anymore. And bonus, older items are generally of great, lasting quality.
 Pick a type of item to wear with every outfit that will make people think of you.


Maybe you always wear a ring on your pinky, or a scarf around your handbag. Just choose an accessory that you like and run with it.
Try giving yourself a manicure to have totally unique nails. Blue nails with purple polka dots? Clear polish on top of natural nails? Why not?
Glasses are a great way to customize your style. Try some cute frames like a vintage cat-eye shape, or frameless lenses. You can also experiment with different types of sunglasses.
 A smile is your most natural, unique accessory.


Nobody else has your unique smile, and it is a totally free, attention-grabbing accessory!
Remember to have fun when choosing your unique style. A smile lifts your mood, and anything will look good on you if you are happy and confident.

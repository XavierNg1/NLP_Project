 Because of the size of termite colonies, the use of soil termiticide might only have a limited impact on the overall population.Baiting subterranean termites has become an increasingly popular way to tackle an infestation, and can also contribute to longer term deterrence and protection. Baits are slow-acting insecticides which are consumed and then brought back to the colony where the chemicals spreads out across the wider termite population.


Some baits use Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) which are very effective at decreasing and destroying whole colonies.
IGRs have low toxicity to humans and pets, but often the most effective ones are only available to professionals., You can set up a few traps to try to see if you have a colony of subterranean termites nearby. If you place a piece of untreated wood into the plastic bait traps, and push these down into the ground around the outside of your house, at approximately 10 feet intervals, you can flush out any termites close-by. , You should check these traps regularly, every month or few months is good. If you remove the trap from the soil and there are live termites in it you should place some toxic bait into the trap and return it to the soil. Hopefully, the termites which have come for the untreated wood will now take the poisoned bait back to the colony, where the chemicals will spread across the population., The traps you place outside the periphery of your house will not have any impact on subterranean termites that have already dug into your houseâ€™s structure. There are some above-ground bait stations that are available. These are designed to work in largely the same way as the one pushed into the soil outside.You can attach these to an area where there is termite activity such as a mud tube, or some damaged woodwork.
Be sure to read the label of whatever you use, as some baiting systems will be designed to work on their own, others with liquid spot-treatment.

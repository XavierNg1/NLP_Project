 Birth control pills work by either keeping eggs from leaving the ovaries or making cervical mucus thicker which keeps sperm from travelling to the eggs. There are several different brands your health care provider can recommend one that is best for your health and sexual activity.


Discuss side effects and risks associated with any birth control you are prescribed. For example, women over 35 who smoke are more susceptible to blood clots when they take birth control pills.
Birth control pills require you to diligently take the medication at the same time, every day. A missed dose could potentially increase the likelihood of pregnancies if sex is engaged in the period it is missed.
 The birth control shot, or Depo-Provera, is an injection of synthetic hormones that protects you from pregnancy. You will need to get a shot every 12 weeks.


Depo-Provera releases a hormone called progestin which prevents the body from releasing eggs into the uterus and thickening the cervix mucus wall to prevent sperm from travelling.
Always discuss health risks and side effects whenever you decide to take birth control.
 Dubbed as the Morning-After Pill, emergency contraceptives work by preventing eggs from being released from the ovary for longer than usual. This ensures that any rogue sperm dies off or is expelled from your body. It can take up to 6 days for someone to become pregnant. Emergency contraception cannot be used as a regular way to prevent pregnancy.


Purchase emergency contraception in pill form over the counter at a pharmacy. If you are 17 years or older, you can get it without a prescription at your local walk-in clinic.
Take the pill as directed. Some contraceptives come in a 1 pill dose, and others have 2 pills.

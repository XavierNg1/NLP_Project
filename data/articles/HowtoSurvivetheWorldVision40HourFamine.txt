 If you are 12 years or under you can do the 8-hour famine, but not the 40. It is suggested that if you have any health conditions you don't participate. Choose to give up something else, like furniture or technology, instead.
Sign up to do it, either on the website or with a group leader.;
, I would suggest keeping the money in a zip lock bag or similar to avoid losing it. Write each donation in your little 40 hour famine booklet you would have received when you signed up.
If you want to, organize with your other friends who are also participating to have a sleepover that weekend. It may help to take your mind off your hunger.

Visit the 40 hour famine website and read the health and safety guidelines. Know what you should and should not do during the famine.
, Eat foods that are going to keep you full for longer. Eat slowly, take your time.

Get plenty of sleep, as you will feel lethargic and tired from lack of food.
Suck on 1 barley sugar every 4 hours
It is suggested that you don't do any activity that is too strenuous during the famine.
Distract yourself with books and movies.

Don't eat a massive meal and overstuff yourself. Start off small (think a sandwich, piece of fruit, small bowel of pasta) and gradually work yourself back into your normal eating patterns.
Count up how much money you raised. You can still continue to collect donations after the famine is finished.
Put all your raised money in a small zip lock bag and hand it to your group leader or send it through the appropriate channels.

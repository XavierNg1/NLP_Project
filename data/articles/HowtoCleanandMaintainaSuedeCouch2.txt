 This will allow you to collect all the crumbs, papers and other bits and pieces that have fallen through the cracks.
 Vacuuming will also help eliminate any dust or pet dander that has accumulated and that cannot be seen by the human eye.
 Be sure to check the underside of the cushions for any debris that may have remained.
 Some couches have matching cushions. That is, they are the exact same size and shape. If this is the case, it is a good idea to rotate the cushions to even out the wear.
 Brushing removes dust, which accumulates and causes a couch to look dull. Use a suede napping brush or cloth, which can be purchased at shoe stores that also specialize in cleaning and repair.


Keep a suede cleaning cloth nearby. Use this to rub down the couch now and then to help keep the nap in good shape.
This can be done even while you're watching TV, so it's useful to keep the cloth near the remotes.
Terry cloth towels can be also be used.
Rubbing and brushing are especially important if you allow pets to sit on the couch.

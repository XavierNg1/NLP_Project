A person who is lying will be worried about silence, and as such will try to fill it with questions, or different topics. This could lead to peculiar questions, that seem out of character for the person.
The person may simply reconstruct any question you ask them into a question. For example; Questioner: "Did you see my black dog, Jimmy?" The liar will most likely respond with something like: "No, I did not see your black dog, Jimmy."
Does the person speak in a monotone? If so they may be preoccupied with keeping up the lie, and as such will be to busy to focus on tone, and dynamics in the voice.
Sentences may be confusing, grammatically incorrect, or simply just wrong, because the person is focusing on topic rather than pronunciation and grammar.
A good indicator of a liar is to monitor if they use pronouns. To see if the person is holding a deception, try to change the topic suddenly. The liar may suddenly show happiness, or relief at the fact that the topic has been changed away from the deception.

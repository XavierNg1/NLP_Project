 Would your animal's body structure look like a normal cat? Maybe a squirrel? Use this animal body type to make a base for your design. Try sketching it out on a piece of paper. Use a reference image to get the anatomy correctly.;
, Let's say you chose a housecat as your body base, but you want to have a shorter tail, or more rounded ears. Try taking traits from other animals you like! Make it unique, or else it'll just look like a normal, existing animal.
 It can have complicated markings, or simple markings. Choose a good color scheme. You can choose to make it natural, or have bright colors. Will all of these animals have the same markings but different colors? Do they all have certain general markings? Remember to specify things like these.
 Berries, fruit, fish, nuts, rodents, and small birds are common foods. Maybe this animal eats only one type of food, like the koala. This should help determine where the animal will live.
 Where would this animal live, and where would it make its den? The animal's diet will also play a part in this - if your animal eats fish, they'll need to live near ponds, lakes, or oceans. What regions of the world would this animal live in? Climate? These are all important factors.
 You can either come up with your own name, or, if you made a mix of animals, merge their Latin names together. For creating your own name from scratch, try taking random words that fit your animal (like "brown", "grey", "fur", etc.) in another language and switching around the letters a bit to make a good name. Or, you can just try making random letter combinations until you find something with a good ring to it!

 These programs assign a terrestrial phone number to the satellite number. Then, the recipient of the call takes the charges, usually part of a monthly plan.


The most common of these plans are Iridium’s 1+Access service and Inmarsat’s SatCollect service., Many satellite phone users register a number that corresponds with the country where their family or company is based.
 It will go through on your end as if you are dialing a local number. If the collect phone number is still in a foreign country, you will need to dial your exit code and then the nine-digit number.

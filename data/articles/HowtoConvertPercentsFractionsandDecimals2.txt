 Unless otherwise noted, in a percent, the decimal point comes at the end of the last number. For example, envision that 75% actually looks like 75.0%. Moving the decimal point two places to the left converts the percent to a decimal. This is the same thing as dividing the number by 100. Examples:75% converts to .75
3.1% converts to .031
0.5% converts to 0.005

, Writing a number as a fraction of 100 is simply another way to write a perce. The number of the percent becomes the numerator of the fraction and 100 becomes the denominator. Simplify the fraction to its lowest form.


Example: 36% turns to 36/100.
To simplify, look for the highest number that goes into 36 and 100. In this case, that would be 4.
Determine how many times 4 goes into 36 and 100. When you simplify, the answer would be 9/25.
To check that you’ve converted correctly, divide 9 by 25 (0.36) and multiply by 100 (36%). This number should equal your original percent.
 Once the percent has been converted to a decimal or fraction, the % sign is no longer appropriate. Remember, percent just means per one hundred, so if you forget to remove the percent sign after converting, your answer will be off by one hundred.

 If you don't feel like measuring out every single amount, use a simple bar count where the number of seconds indicates "parts." Since the martini is three parts vodka and one part each apple schnapps and Cointreau, you could count out six seconds of vodka, then two of the other liquors for a simple ratio.


You can use any amount of liquid, as long as this 3-1-1 ratio stays consistent.
If you want a little extra flavor, squeeze in a touch of fresh lemon juice.;
, Shake for at least 5 seconds. The longer you shake, the colder the drink will get, but this may also start to water it down a bit. Most bartenders shake for 5-15 seconds.
 You can either freeze the glass ahead of time or fill it with ice water for 2-4 minutes before serving. Dump out the water, quickly dry, and pour into the chilled glass.The long stem of the martini glass is so your fingers don't have to touch much of the glass, keeping it cool.
 Note, however, that most martinis do not have ice in them. A cube of ice takes off some of the alcoholic bite of the drink but keeping it cool and slightly watering it down as it melts., Hook the slice on the rim of the glass, or simply drop it right in the drink to soak in the alcohol. Serve immediately, while still cold.

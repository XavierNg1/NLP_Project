 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Place 1 cup (140 g) of cubed butternut squash and 4 cloves of whole unpeeled garlic on a baking sheet. Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over the squash. Use a spoon to toss the squash and garlic evenly. Roast the squash for 15 to 20 minutes.Once the squash is tender, remove the pan from the oven and let it cool about 5 minutes or until the squash is easier to handle.
 Scoop the roasted squash into a food processor or blender. Squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skin and add that as well. You should also put the remaining hummus ingredients into the processor. You'll need:4 cloves of minced garlic
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice
1 15-ounce (425 g) can chickpeas, lightly rinsed and drained
1/3 cup (80 g) of tahini
3 to 4 tablespoons (45-60 ml) of olive oil
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of pepper
1/2 cup (30 g) of fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin

, Cover the blender or food processor with the lid and blend it until the dip is completely smooth. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. If the dip seems too thick to blend, add a drizzle of olive oil or a few tablespoons of water to thin it out.If you'd like a chunkier dip, just pulse the food processor or blender. This will keep some pieces of chickpeas intact.
 Taste a little of the dip and add more spices or seasonings according to your taste. Serve the dip while it's at room temperature. Or if you prefer a cold dip, refrigerate the dip for 3 to 4 hours. This will also make the dip creamier and thicker. Garnish the dip with 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika and serve it.You can store the leftover squash in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days.

 Unless you're on your last pair of pjs, pajama day doesn't mean that you have to wear what you slept in the night before! Consider the pros and cons of your pajamas as you decide what to wear. The pjs you slept in may zip up in the back, but wearing ones with a front zipper will make PE changes and bathroom breaks easier. Pay similar attention to pattern and fabric: if you feel self conscious, try to avoid wearing childish patterns; if it is a hot day, stay away from fleece. Just make sure to clear the pjs you intend to wear with your parents first.
 Just because you aren't changing out of your pajamas before you go to school doesn't mean you should skip the other parts of your morning routine. Make sure you brush your teeth and shower if you do that in the morning. Don't wear pajamas you've been wearing for multiple days either., Aside from normal school supplies and homework, many schools allow you to bring blankets and stuffed animals on pajama day. If you are wearing slippers to school make sure you have sneakers for PE. If you're self-conscious, bringing and wearing a robe over your pajamas can make them look like pajama pants from a distance., If you are wearing back zip pajamas, don't forget to ask the nurse for a note for when you need to use the bathroom before class starts., You can rock pretty much anything as long as you wear it with confidence. Pajama day is all about comfort, it is not a fashion show. If someone starts to poke fun, you can remind them of that. Remember, at the end of the day, pajama days are only a few days out of a very long school year.

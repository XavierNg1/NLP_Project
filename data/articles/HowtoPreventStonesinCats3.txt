 Cats that have an inability to urinate or are straining to urinate may have stones. Additional symptoms include painful urination, the presence of blood in urine, and urinating in places other than the litter box, if that is not your cat's normal behavior.If your cat is having a hard time urinating, you should take it to be seen by a vet immediately. This is a life-threatening problem that requires immediate veterinary intervention.
 Ignoring the signs of stones can cause your cat a great deal of discomfort. If left untreated, obstructions can block the flow of urine, which can become toxic, or grow so large that the bladder bursts. If you are unsure whether your cat has an infected or blocked urinary tract or stones, it is always best to have them examined by your veterinarian to make sure.The veterinarian should perform diagnostic tests on your cat, such as X-rays, ultrasounds, blood tests to check for toxins and elevated white blood cell counts (a sign of infection), and palpation.
 While all cats and dogs can get stones, some breeds of cats are more susceptible than others. If your cat has had a stone in the past, it is more likely to get one again. Keep an eye out for the symptoms and get regular veterinary checkups, so that you can get veterinary treatment quickly if the condition appears again.If your cat has had stones in the past, periodic urinalysis or ultrasound examination may be helpful. This can help you to detect stones early and will allow you to make adjustments to your cat's diet or ongoing treatment.

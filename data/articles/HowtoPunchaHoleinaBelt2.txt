 Use a ruler to measure the spacing between the hole, then measure the same distance past the last hole. Use a marker to dot the belt over the area you plan on punching out.


If your top priority is a comfortable fit, instead wear the belt and pull it to a comfortable position, then mark the belt where the strap tongue touches it.
 Use heavy objects to weigh down each end of the belt, with the location where the hole will be punched on top of a block of wood or other hard, flat surface.
 If you have one, an electric drill can be used to drill a hole through the belt, as long as you're careful. Use these tips to keep the hole tidy:








Insert drill bits by hand into the existing holes. Select one that fits smoothly but tightly into the hole.
Use a brad-pointed drill bit if available. If using a smooth drill bit, create a small depression for it to stand in, using a sharp knife or nail.
Drill in short bursts especially when starting the hole.
Make sure to put something, that you don't mind damaging, that doesn't move around behind the belt, that is thick enough, for when the drill bit goes through.
You can also opt to snipping the other end, once it has penetrated the outer layer a bit, instead of drilling a perfect hole.
 The tool designed for this purpose is called an awl, but any sharp, metal stick or even a Phillips-head screwdriver will work fairly well. Push the awl into the leather, then tap it repeatedly with a mallet or hammer. This method takes longer than the others, and you might end up with a messy hole.









A nail will make a smoother hole through a thin belt, but if you're looking to save time, a screw can be turned through the leather, using its threads to tear through faster.
Again, be careful of scratching the surface beneath. (Follow the precautions in the previous step.)

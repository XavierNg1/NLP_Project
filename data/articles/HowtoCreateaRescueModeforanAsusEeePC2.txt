Use the cursor keys to move down to the first entry (paragraph) for "Normal Boot". Place the cursor on the first line of this section.

Move the cursor down below this section to the next blank line. Paste our previously copied text by using:






For the third line of this new entry, starting with "kernel" (ie: kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.21.4-eeepc quiet rw vga=785 irqpoll root=/dev/sda1), add a space and then XANDROSBOOTDEBUG=y at the end of this line. For example:kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.21.4-eeepc-2GB quiet rw vga=785 irqpoll root=/dev/sda1 XANDROSBOOTDEBUG=y.
To do this, press





to switch vi into insert mode, move the cursor to this location, and insert text. To remove text, use

Save your file by pressing















. To exit vi without saving, press















.
 Do this by pressing

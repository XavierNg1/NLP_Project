Llamas are naturally territorial and tend to be wary of dogs.
Llamas make good guardian animals for goats, sheep, alpacas, miniature donkeys and horses, and sometimes even standard-size horses or cows in need of protection from coyotes, wild dogs, and the occasional single domestic dog.
Some guard llamas bond with the herd and consider the members its charges. A llama will herd the flock away from danger and stand guard when a herd member is giving birth or is ill or injured.
Other llamas remain present but detached from the herd, living among the livestock harmoniously but independently. These llamas protect the territory rather than the herd members.



Ask to see female llamas that are at least 1-1/2 years old and not pregnant.
Intact male llamas have been known to injure livestock in heat trying to mate with them. Unfortunately, gelded male llamas also sometimes retain their desire to mate, so male llamas should not be trusted as livestock guardian animals.
 Not all female llamas have what it takes to be a good livestock guardian. Llamas that tend to do well have the following characteristics:


Demonstrate respect for humans.
Accept halters and leads.
Allow you to examine and groom their body and feet.
Appear alert and confident.

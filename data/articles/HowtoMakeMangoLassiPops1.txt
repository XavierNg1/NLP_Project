 That will total up to twenty four pieces of mango. Drop all pieces into blender.
 You're only using two tablespoons of sugar since the four mangoes contain sweet flavor. Afterwards, blend until it becomes a thick fluid., Before blending, add 1/3 cup of milk right into the blender. Once again, blend until there are no chunks of anything left in the blender. You have now made mango lassi., Place the cover of your molder on top. Just know that if you are using a kulfi molder, then the lid is the stick to your pop. Place into freezer for about 8 hours., That should make it easier for you to just slide the pop out of the molder and enjoy! This makes four to five pops.

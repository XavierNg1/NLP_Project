 In order to change the standard date format for any new Excel sheet, you will need to change the overarching date format for you computer. First, click the Start button. The next step will depend on which operating system you are using:If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 8: Open the Control Panel. Then, click "Clock, Language, and Region." Alternately, in Windows 8, open the Settings folder and select "Time & language".
If you are using Windows XP: Open the Control Panel. Then, click "Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options.";
, Again, the navigational steps vary from operating system to operating system.


If you are using Windows 8: In the Clock, Language, and Region folder, select "Change date, time, or number formats" from beneath the "Region" heading.
If you are using Windows Vista: Open the Regional and Language Options dialog box. Then, select the Formats tab.
If you are using Windows XP: Open the Regional and Language Options dialog box. Then, select the Regional Options tab.
 If you are using Windows 8: Make sure that the Formats tab is open. If you are using Windows Vista: Click Customize this format. If you are using Windows XP: Click Customize., You will have options for the short date and the long date. The short date refers to the abbreviated version: e.g. 6/12/2015. The long date refers to the wordier form: e.g. December 31, 1999. The formats that you select here will be standardized across all Windows applications, including Excel. Click "OK" to apply your choices.

 If you drop your device in water, take out fast. If you let it soak for more than just five seconds, it may cause serious and unfixable damage to your device.
 This is to avoid possible short circuits.
 Wipe off excess water from the body of the phone then use a hair blow dryer to blow off any water that might be left in the gaps or holes of your device. Do this for a couple of minutes to make sure that any moisture on the outside is gone.


If you don’t have a hair blow dryer, you can leave the iPhone in front of an electric fan for a few minutes.
 Desiccants, just like the ones you find inside shoe boxes, are silica gel beads that are used to prevent moisture damage. Just like rice, it’s cheap and will only cost you less than $3 for a hundred grams. You can purchase desiccants online from shopping sites like eBay or from your local hardware store.
 Make sure that your iPhone is completely covered with desiccants, then seal it well with a string or its zip lock. Place the bag on a safe shelf away from food or the reach of children. Desiccants are toxic and can be poisonous if swallowed, so use it with caution.
 Desiccants will take time before they absorb all the moisture from your iPhone. Leave the iPhone in the bag for at least two days to make sure that your iPhone’s all dry.
 After two days, get your iPhone from the bag and turn press the power/lock button to turn it on. You’ll find that it is now working like nothing happened. Always remember that the sooner you can completely dry your iPhone after dropping it in water, the higher the chance of saving it from water damage.

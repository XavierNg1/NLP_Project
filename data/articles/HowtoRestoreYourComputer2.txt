 Mac has several different recovery options, but in order to perform a restore, you must have previously configured a Time Capsule backup. Otherwise, your options are limited to repairing the hard disk or formatting and reinstalling a fresh copy of OS X.
 Connect an external hard drive to your Mac that is equal or greater in size to your Mac’s internal hard drive. If you have never set up a Time Capsule before, OS X will ask if you want to configure the newly connected drive as one. Select Use as Backup Disk.


Select “Encrypt backup Disk” if you want to add password protection to your backup file.
 You can schedule automatic backups and specify specific files in the Options menu.
 Reboot the Mac and hold down the Command key + R while the system boots up. This will open the OS X Recovery Tool. From here you can pick your recovery option. Select Restore From Time Machine Backup to load your latest disk image from the external drive.


If you have multiple backups stored on the Time Capsule, you will be given a list to choose from. Pick one from before you started having issues with the computer.
Unlike System Restore in Windows, you can use a Time Capsule backup to retrieve files that were deleted in the past, as long as you have a backup from when the file existed.
 If you don’t have a Time Capsule backup, then the only way to restore OS X is by formatting and reinstalling. You can do this from the OS X Recovery Tool. Press Command+R while rebooting the Mac. Select Reinstall Mac OS X.


Note: You will need to be connected to the internet in order to successfully reinstall your copy of Mac OS X without the disc.
Reinstalling the operating system will delete all of your saved data, programs, and settings.

Applying pipe thread sealant around the gas line connection on the burner.
Attach the gas supply line to the burner.
Fasten the connection tightly using a wrench.
 Place the burner in the desired position inside the firebox. Then use a masonry bit to drill holes in the firebox brick. This will make it possible to secure the burner into place with the masonry screws. Finish the installation by screwing the masonry screws into place.
 If your gas log set came with a grate, install the grate over the burners.
 Once your burner and grate are in place, turn on the gas supply to check for leaks. Spray a water and soap mixture along the gas line to check for leaks. Any leaks will be evident by the bubbles created at the leak site. If leaks are found, take necessary steps to either tighten connections or replace faulty hoses.
 Installation of the gas logs will vary by brand and model, so be sure to reference your installation manual for specific directions. In general, the logs will only fit in the correct configuration. Place each log over the intended pin until all logs are in place.
 If your gas log kit came with accessories, such as ash covered coals and rock wool, spread them around to give the set a realistic touch.
 Youâ€™re done. Turn on your gas fireplace and enjoy the beautiful, hassle-free warmth of your gas burning fireplace.

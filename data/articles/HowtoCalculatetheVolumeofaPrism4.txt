 The formula is: V = x height of the prism. You should use the first part of this formula to find the area of the trapezoidal base of the prism before you move forward., To do this, simply plug the two bases and the height of the trapezoidal base into the formula.


Let's say base 1 = 8 cm, base 2 = 6 cm, and height = 10 cm.
Ex: 1/2 x (6 + 8) x 10 = 1/2 x 14 cm x 10 cm = 70 cm2.
 Let's say the height of the trapezoidal prism is 12 cm.
 To calculate the volume of the trapezoidal prism, just multiply the area of the base times the height.


70 cm2 x 12 cm = 840 cm3.
 The final answer is 840 cm3

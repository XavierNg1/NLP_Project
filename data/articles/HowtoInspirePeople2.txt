 The best way to inspire your staff to work harder or push through a rough period is to lead by example. Take on more work than you have to and help them with their own work when you can. An active manager who works right alongside them is more inspiring than one who just sits behind a desk.
 Make sure that their needs are met. Show them that you care about their personal well-being. When they do something that's worthy of recognizing, recognize it. Promote them when they deserve it. All of this makes them want to do more for you because they know that you're going to fight for them.
 Get them invested in the work that they do. Make them proud of the product they make or the service they offer. If they take pride in what they do, they'll be much more likely to work hard and strive for perfection.
 When you promise them something or give them an incentive, you have to make good on that promise. Failing to meet expectations will only make them wary of your future promises and they'll be unlikely to take incentives seriously any more.

 In order for the eyeshadow to truly “highlight,” you have to use a shade that is lighter than what you would typically use on your face. Skip eyeshadows that are similar to your foundation shade and go for something that is two shades lighter than your natural skin tone.If you are naturally very pale and can’t find a shade noticeably lighter than your skin tone, opt for the lightest shade you can find with a pearlescent finish.
If you have a naturally dark skin tone, avoid the icy shades and choose warmer hues, like rose gold or bronze.;
, Opt for pearly pink or frosty champagne shades if you have cool undertones.For warmer undertones, avoid the frosty eyeshadows, since these can give your skin a grayish pallor. Instead, opt for shades that have a little peach or golden shimmer in them. If you have neutral undertones, you can go either way – try both options out to determine what works best for you.
 Eyeshadows come in a wide range shimmery shades, so experimenting with them as highlighters can be particularly fun. A muted pearlescent finish can create a subtle glow, while something with a little more glitter can create a high impact sparkle well-suited for a night out.









In general, you still want a product that’s two shades lighter than your skin tone, but experiment with the amount of shimmer you use to create different effects.

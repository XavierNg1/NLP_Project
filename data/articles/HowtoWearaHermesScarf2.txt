 Fold your scarf using the bias fold method. Then, wrap it around your neck once and tie it into a big, loose knot. The tails of the knot should be relatively short.


If you want to add a little more pizazz to your knot, you can tie your scarf into a bow at the end. Tie it into a big bow underneath one ear.
 Start with the bias fold. Then tie a big, loose knot in the center of the scarf. Tie two knots a few inches to either side of the big knot. These should be tighter, highlighting the larger knot. Tie the ends behind your neck in a small double knot.You can tuck the ends of your double knot into the knot itself, to make this look more simple and elegant.
 Feed the remaining corners under the knot, so that their tails come under the knot on opposite sides. Pull the tails apart gently, and then flip the scarf over. The resulting knot in the front of the scarf will be the “flower”. Tie the tails behind your neck.


Keep the “flower” underneath an ear rather than right under your chin.
 Start with a bias fold. Then tie a knot three to five inches from the end on one side of the fold. Pull the other end through the knot in any place you can, and adjust the tails as you see fit.


You can place this over your neck to tie it, or tie it on a flat surface and pull your head through once it is tied.

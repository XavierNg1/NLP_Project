 Add 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of coconut oil, ¼ teaspoon (1.75 g) of honey, and 2 teaspoons (8 g) of sugar to a small bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they form a thick, grainy paste.Organic virgin coconut oil works best for the scrub.
It’s often easier to mix the sugar in with the coconut oil and honey if you use a fork instead of a spoon.
 Once the coconut oil mixture is fully blended, mix in 3 to 4 drops of peppermint essential oil. Stir well with the fork to ensure that the peppermint oil is mixed throughout the scrub.If you don’t have peppermint essential oil, you can substitute peppermint extract.
 When the scrub is completely mixed, spoon it into a container that holds at least 1 ounce (28 g). To use the scrub, massage a small amount over your lips in a circular motion for approximately 30 seconds and lick it off when you’re done.To maximize the benefits of the scrub, follow up with a moisturizing lip balm.

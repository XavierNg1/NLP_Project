 It should be about 1.5m by 0.75m. A large, lightweight scarf works best. The bigger the material you use, the larger the turban will be, so choose accordingly. Also, thinner materials will be easier to handle.;
, First, fold your scarf until it's about two to three inches thick. Center it at the nape of your neck. Pull the ends toward your temples. Cross the ends over each other on your forehead and make a knot.Make sure the fabric only goes around the sides of your head, and doesn't cover the top of your head. This is the primary difference, appearance-wise, between a half and a full turban.
 Pull the ends tight and wrap them around the sides of your head to where the fabric is in the back. Tie a knot at the nape of your neck. If there is too much excess fabric, you can tuck it underneath the knot where it starts to wrap around the sides of your head.

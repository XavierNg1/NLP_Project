Collect 12 pieces of watermelon candy, and place the candy in the jar you’re going to use to soak the candy with vodka.This method can be used with other flavors of candy too.


Pour the vodka into the jar, covering the candy, and fill until it is close to the top, but still sealable. The vodka will start breaking down the candy instantly. Let the vodka sit for about 8 to 12 hours.You might want to shake the jars to try and dissolve the candy faster, but this doesn’t really dissolve the candy faster.


Put your jar in the refrigerator or freezer, and let it chill until you are ready to serve it.

At first, the flavor of the vodka will taste just like the watermelon candy you used, and then the vodka taste will come through.
These can be served as shooters, or used for flavored martinis.

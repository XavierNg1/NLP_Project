 This is a common and inexpensive trap available at most hardware stores. The trap will be a box with glue on the bottom. The box will have bait and lure the snake into the box where the glue will prevent it from leaving. For bait you can use frozen mice available at pet stores or common eggs from the grocery store. Make sure to check the glue trap regularly. The snake will still be alive and immobile and after a few days could run the risk of dying of starvation.
Choose a trap big enough for the snake you want to catch. If the trap is too small, the snake still may be able to get away, dragging the glue trap along. This will also likely kill the snake.
Use a vegetable or olive oil to remove the snake from the glue trap. Pour olive or vegetable oil on the snake in an area you want it released. This will remove the stickiness of the glue and allow the snake to slither away unharmed.
 You can do this using a plastic bottle, such as an empty two-liter, bait, and scissors. Clean the bottle so there are no smells that would scare a snake away. Cut a small hole, big enough for the snake to enter, in the bottle. Once the snake feeds on the bait it will be too large to leave back through the same hole it entered through.
 Wired traps used for catching minnows are great. Put some eggs in the trap to lure the snake in. They will be able to find their way in but will be unable to get out once they eat the eggs.

 Though your child may want to keep the lights in their room blazing out of fear of the monsters, this will likely affect their quality of sleep and will not help them face their worries. Purchase some lower wattage lights so that they can keep lights on that will not be overly bright. You can also consider purchasing a night light or keeping a small lamp on by their bed.You may also want to work with your child to get comfortable in the dark. Walk through the lit room with them, then turn out the lights and go through the room again, having them touch things to identify them. This can help create some comfort.
 Your child’s fear may arise from the presence of shadows in their room. Eliminate as many shadows as you can. If their coat hanging on a hook makes a creepy shadow, hang it in the closet instead. If their toys are casting a shadow near their bed, place them in a bin instead.Take a look at the room from your child's level. Squat down and look at look at everything from about their height to get an idea of what may frighten them.
 One way to help assuage your child’s fears is to have their bed facing the door. If their bed is facing away from the door currently, they may worry that a monster could enter without them knowing. Having them face the door can alleviate that concern., Some children benefit immensely from having a pet with them in their room as they sleep, as it can serve as a constant companion for them in a way that you cannot. Choose one that does not sleep in the bed like a hamster or fish.Make sure the pet is not very noisy as well so that it doesn’t affect their sleep.
If you have a dog, cat, or other large pet, you can talk to your child about how the pet helps keep the monsters away at night. Let your child think your dog is a guard dog.

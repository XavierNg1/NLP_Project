 People who have rosacea are more sensitive to harsh chemicals in skin products than those without it. If you suffer from rosacea, you should be exceedingly mindful about what kinds of products you use on your skin. Look for brands that are designed for sensitive skin or that advertise fewer chemicals that can be harmful to the skin.
 Protecting your skin from the sun is important for everyone, but it is especially crucial for those with rosacea because their skin is particularly sensitive. Use quality sunblock that is free from harmful chemicals., Ask your doctor to prescribe you some antibiotics to treat your rosacea. This will help eliminate the infection and reduce redness. Topical antibiotics are best, but oral antibiotics can also be effective., Drinking alcohol dehydrates the body and deprives the skin of its natural moisture. This can be a significant trigger for people with rosacea.

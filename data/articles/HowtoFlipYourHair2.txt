 This style works with all hair types: curly, wavy, and straight. It is best for shoulder length and longer hair. If your hair is not long enough, your ponytail won't flip properly.
 This style is also known as a "topsy turvy ponytail," or an "upside down ponytail." This style also works with a half-up, half-down style.
 Do not make it too tight; you want some space between the hair tie and the back of your head.
 There should be equal amounts of hair to either side of your finger. Also, make sure that your finger is sticking up, from under your hair.


Some people find it easier to use a special loop made for flipping ponytails. You can also bend a pipe cleaner in half, and use that instead.
 The easiest way to do this is to make a hook shape with your finger. If you are using a special loop or pipe cleaner, slip the ponytail through the loop. Make sure that the ends of your hair are facing your forehead.
 Tug your fingers/loop down through the hole, along with the ponytail. Tug it down as far as you can, but not so much that the hair tie goes through the hole too. If that happens, you have pulled too much.


If you are having troubles getting the ponytail through the hole, try widening the hole a little bit by inserting your first two fingers and spreading them. You can also try pushing the ponytail through the hole.
 Be gentle, however. If you brush or comb the hair too hard, it may pull your ponytail all the way through the holeâ€”including the hair tie.
 This is not necessary, but it can add that final touch to your hairstyle.

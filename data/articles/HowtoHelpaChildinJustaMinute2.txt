 Kids respond very positively to encouragement or praise for their efforts. And who knows? You might change their life with just a word or two (especially if that child is facing difficult circumstances). A single word or a kind hug can make the difference for a child who is still trying to formulate his or her identity and trust in blossoming abilities.


In a simple minute, you can wipe away a tear, boost morale or just smile in encouragement.
 Whether with your own children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews or friends, try to “catch them doing good.”


Try to use this sentence every day at least once: “I really like the way you…” and then name something positive: …share your toys, helped your sister, listened while we read a story, whatever.
Or name character traits you see: if a child is behaving in a caring, generous, or kind way, tell them so.
Use a list of all that's good. Consider making a list every year for the child's birthday, entitled: “Ten Things I Like About You.” What a great way to take a moment and affirm a child. Often, if you tell a child he or she is kind, the child will be more likely to try to live up to that identified preferred behavior or expression of goodness.
 It only takes a minute to say something nice to a child, and your affirmation will help the child more than you can ever imagine.


Note that a child who is being naughty or acting out is often looking for attention and love. Giving such a child positive reinforcement often improves their behavior.

 Place all components (excepting the strawberries) in a bowl and stir it until everything is well mixed.;
, Fold up the empty parts of the bag around the part that is filled.
 Place the Ziploc bag in the refrigerator and leave it there for forty-five minutes to an hour.


Do not leave the mixture in the refrigerator for over an hour.
 Carefully wash the strawberries and pat them dry. Cut the strawberries halfway through from the tip. Have two cuts, so the strawberries are now partially divided into quarters. Be sure not to cut the strawberries all the way through.
 Take out both strawberries and cheesecake.
 Spread open the strawberries from where you cut the "X" and fill them with the cheesecake mixture by squeezing the cheesecake out of the corner you just cut off.

 Purchase an inexpensive foam pillow. Lie on each side with your mask on, and measure where the mask makes contact with both sides of the pillow.Trace out the areas that you’ll need to cut out to make room for the mask. Be careful not to accidentally mark your mask.
 Use a long serrated knife or electric carving knife to cut the pillow. Carve along the marks you traced on each side.Carving cutouts for the mask on each side will allow you to comfortably sleep on both your right and left sides.
If necessary, cut a space at the bottom of the pillow for your shoulder., If you’d like, you can sew a case onto the pillow by stitching along the contours. If not, you can just cover it with a standard pillowcase. Make sure the pillowcase is large enough to fit into the contours without obstructing them.If the pillowcase fits too tightly, it won’t take the same shape as the contours you cut into the pillow.

It should aid current enjoyment, understanding and achievement and also promote future progression.
Good teaching uses teaching strategies that should be formulated according to conscious learning objectives for a particular student, whilst being sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs of the student in any particular lesson.;

A single lesson's objective may be to teach the student how best to practise legato pedalling for a Schumann piece but the long term goal might be to pass a Grade 5 examination in six months' time.
, The most relevant preferred learning styles for the pianist are:
Kinaesthetic - these students will prefer to learn by 'finger memory' (the feel of melodic lines and chord shapes) and they will probably be good at this way of memorization
Visual - these students will prefer to learn by looking at the shapes that the music makes on the keys and they will probably be good sight readers
Aural - these students will prefer to learn by remembering how the music sounded. They may like to learn by rote more than by reading music and they will probably be good at memorising
Combination learners - these students will be able to draw on a range of learning styles.

Develop students' learning capacity in the ways that do not come to them so readily. If we know a student is probably going to learn pieces more by rote than by reading the notation, we should be positive about that student's memorising abilities, whilst also encouraging better music reading by regularly providing easier sight reading opportunities. Do this in fun ways, such as via duet playing and music games.
 Efficient learning maximizes every student's chance to fulfill his or her potential.



The most successful piano teachers are those whose students are happy with the teacher/student relationship.

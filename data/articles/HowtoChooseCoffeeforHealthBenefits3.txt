 Black coffee is healthier, and easier on your wallet as a bonus., Black coffee isn't for everyone. If you need to, order your coffee drinks with non-fat milk instead of creamer or whole milk. You’ll avoid a lot of unnecessary calories.Some coffeehouses call non-fat milk "skim milk," so don't be confused.
 Avoid specialty drinks, like Frappuccinos, which tend to be high in sugar and fat. Instead, go for a plain coffee.If you decide to go for a specialty coffee drink, order the smallest size.
Many coffeehouses list the calories in each of their drinks. If you really want a specialty drink but aren’t sure which is the healthiest, pick the drink with the lowest calories--it is probably relatively low in sugar and fat.
 You should avoid syrups when possible, as these are high in sugar. Spices are available at most coffee shops, and can be a healthy alternative to flavored syrups.

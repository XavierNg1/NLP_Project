 A power of attorney gives another person whom you will name the power to make certain decisions for you. Some of these may include such intimate issues as health care, medical treatment, and continuing or discontinuing life support. You should select someone with who you have discussed these matters and who you trust to act on your behalf., A power of attorney does not have to go to a relative. In fact, you can name anybody you wish to act on your behalf, and you can name specific topics for your representative to handle for you. If you wish, for example, to have someone handle certain business affairs while you may be out of the country, you can do that. In this case, you may wish to name a broker, a financial adviser, or a trusted friend who is knowledgeable., There may be a time when, for example, you want to name a specific event or limited time period for someone to act on your behalf. For example, suppose your minor child is going to travel out of state on a vacation with her best friend’s family. You may want to issue a power of attorney to the friend’s parents to allow them to make medical decisions as needed for your daughter during the vacation.In an example like this one, it will be important for you to define the specific purpose and duration of the power of attorney. You do not, for example, want to grant the friend’s parents authority to make all decisions forever for your child.

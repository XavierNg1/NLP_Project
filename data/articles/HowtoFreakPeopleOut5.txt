 Saying and doing things that are too intimate or personal for the situation at hand is super awkward and creepy. Freak people out with one of the suggestions below, or make your own:


Propose to random strangers in random places. Be sure to choose places with some romantic value, like fountains, bridges, or Walmart.
Ask for advice with very personal problems. Involving people in problems that no sensible person would want to be a part of can be quite freaky indeed. Try asking strangers for advice treating hemorrhoids, for instance!
Act like you're old friends with a stranger. Talk to a stranger like you've known him or her since you were children. For instance, make bizarre inside jokes and try to get him or her to do a secret handshake that you make up as you go.
Make bizarre romantic remarks. Pretend that you've fallen in love with someone, but that you're hopelessly awkward. Shuffle up to someone and say something like, "Hey.... I, uh... I, um. I like your glasses."
Expose the world to personal arguments. On the phone (or with a willing friend), have a loud argument about something extremely personal, childish, or petty. You might try saying something like, "I can't believe you ate the last waffle! This is so like you. You just walk into people's lives and take, take, take, but you never give!"
Interweave very revealing things in a normal conversation and continue with the normal conversation as if nothing untoward was said. For example: "Can you direct me to the library? I grow horns on harvest moons. Is the library this way?"

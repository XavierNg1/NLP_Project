 Try to see the joy in the world. Laugh with others, but not at them. Everyone appreciates someone who is jolly and jovial. Smiling and laughing a lot is a huge part of having a good personality.;
, A lot of people seem like they have a good personality until you see them in an emergency or tense situation. Then they lose their cool. Don’t be this person! If you are in a tense situation, try to remain relaxed and see what you can do to resolve the situation.


For example, lets say your car breaks down on the highway and you’re going to be late to work. Don’t start yelling and screaming – that’s not going to fix anything. Keep your mind clear and start developing a plan to solve the problem.
 One part about having a good personality is being willing to change your worldview. Listen to others and always be willing to change your mind. Don’t pass judgment on other people just because they act in a different way than you do. Keeping an open mind will allow you to make many new friends and probably live a much more interesting life. There’s no need to shut off parts of the world.
 You could be the most talented, extraordinary person in the world, but if you don’t have any modesty than you probably won’t have a good personality. Always keep yourself level and balanced. Nobody likes a big ego.

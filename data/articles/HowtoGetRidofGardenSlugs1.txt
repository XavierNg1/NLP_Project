 Slugs will only notice these traps from a few feet (about a meter) away, so this is best used for small gardens or important areas.Set these up as follows:


Bury a tall cup with steep sides into the soil. Leave the rim Â½ inch (1.25 cm) above the soil, to prevent the trap killing beetles that hunt slugs.Fill the cup halfway with beer or milk.
Replace every few days. If the slugs are climbing out, replace with a mix of honey, yeast, and a little water, boiled until gluey.;
, Cornmeal is cheaper, but may not attract as many slugs. Put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and lay it on its side. Keep the cornmeal dry, and it will kill slugs by expanding inside them., Slugs will gather in shady, moist areas, such as underneath wooden planks, flower pots, or cardboard boxes. Set these up and check them daily for living snails to gather and discard a long distance from your house. For best results, attract them with one of the following slug foods:Cabbage leaves
Citrus fruit rinds, moistened with water
Dry pet food

, Water will ruin cornmeal and liquid traps. Set up an overhead cover to keep rain out. If you have pets that may eat the bait themselves, use a sturdy cover such as an upside-down flowerpot with a small entrance.
 While not the most fun task, hunting individual slugs may be necessary to deal with large infestations. Use a flashlight and disposable gloves, skewering the snails with a stick or dropping them in a bucket of soapy water.If you have one, a headlamp will leave both your hands free, making hunting easier.


Check the undersides of leaves.
Follow any slime trails you notice.

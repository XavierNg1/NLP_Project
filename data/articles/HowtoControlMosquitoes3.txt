 If possible, try not to be outdoors at dawn and dusk, when many species of mosquitoes are most active. Keep in mind that mosquitoes are also most active when the weather is warm and humid., If you are planning on being outdoors during a time when you know there will be a lot of mosquitoes, protect yourself from bites by wearing tightly woven long sleeve tops and long pants.Bright colors like red and yellow may attract insects, so stick to light colors.
Woven fabrics like nylon and polyester offer better protection from bites than knit fabrics.
If you are hiking in areas that have lots of mosquitoes, you may want to purchase special gear, including clothing that is treated to repel insects and a mesh head net.
If you have a baby, make sure to protect the stroller with netting.
Pay extra attention to covering areas where your skin is thin, such as ankles and wrists., Repellents that contain the active ingredients Deet or Picaridin are most effective.If you are concerned about the possible health risks of chemical repellents, you can buy products that contain lemon eucalyptus oil, which the CDC recognizes as an effective repellent., Certain plants, including lemon thyme, citrosa, and rosemary, are believed to produce oils that repel mosquitoes. Try crushing the leaves and rubbing them on your skin.These plants are not as effective and do not last as long as chemical repellents, so you will need to reapply frequently.
 Make sure your windows and doors have tight screens that will keep mosquitoes out. You should also ensure that there are no other openings into your home that a mosquito might use.


Installing a screened-in porch might be a good option if you would like to spend more time outdoors without having to worry about mosquitoes

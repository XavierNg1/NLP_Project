 Underneath this draw a vertical oval for the body and two small circles as bases for the legs. It should look like he's kneeling on a couple of eggs at this point, and his head should not yet be connected to his body--that part will come later.;
, Draw a trapezoid with a curved base for the tunic and two slim, inverted trapezoids for the feet and legs.
 For the belt, draw a rectangle across his waist and four concentric circles for the buckle.
 Draw a wide triangle covering one of his eyes, two smaller triangles for his pointy ears and an almond shaped eye with a round iris in the middle.
 Draw a small curve for the mouth, an even smaller, vertical curve for the nose, and two more lines forming a "T" right under his eye for the mark.
 His sideburns go all the way down his chest, and he has long hair partially covered by his shoulders.
 Draw curved lines from the left of his chest. One should be to the left, the other should be to the right. Connect them on the bottom. Draw a circle for the brooch.
 Add boomerang-shaped collars on his sleeves and and the straps of his sandals.


Remember to add folds in his cape and markings in his belt and head piece!

, Use purples for the tunic, cape and hat, a soft lavender for the hair, and a more pallid tone for the skin in his hands, face and feet. Use gold for the head piece, the belt, and the brooch and red for the pants, sandals, iris, and jewels. If you want a more realistic look, make sure to include shadows and highlighting.

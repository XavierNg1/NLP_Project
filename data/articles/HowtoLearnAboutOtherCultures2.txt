 Reading through travel books and travel journals gives you great ideas about local and international destinations and begins to expose you to new cultures.You can check out a guide to your chosen culture, or read travel journals by people who have spent time in that culture.
Look for guides that cover information about etiquette, gender roles, festivals, and religion.
 You can read fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or anything written by a person from the culture you want to learn about. Reading books by people from other cultures gives you a glimpse into the mind and life of the people from that culture that would be difficult to obtain otherwise.Ask your librarian for recommendations, or search online for famous books from that culture.
Read a history book about the culture you want to learn more about. It is important to know information on subjects such as major conflicts, holidays, and customs.
If the culture has a different language than your native language, search for translations of books in your language.
 Most libraries have a section where you can check out videos. Ask your librarian if any foreign films are available. Look for videos that offer translations or subtitles. Films from other cultures offer a view of what that culture values as entertainment.


If your library does not offer foreign films, search online for where to order or rent foreign films.
Also look for documentaries about other cultures. A documentary may not be produced by people from that culture, but often they are produced by people knowledgeable about the culture.
 Most libraries will have books that either give a basic overview of a language, or serve as a textbook. Learning the language of the culture you want to know more about is one of the best ways to get to know the culture.Look for a book specifically for beginners if you are new to the language.

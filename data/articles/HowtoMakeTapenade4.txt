 Place 3 ounces (95 g) of sundried tomatoes in a heatproof bowl, and cover them with 1 cup (237 ml) of boiling water. Allow the tomatoes to soak for 10 minutes to rehydrate them.Make sure that you’re using sundried tomatoes that aren’t packed in oil.
 When the tomatoes are finished soaking, remove them from the water and allow them to drain in a colander. To ensure that all of the extra moisture is removed, press them into a strainer to get rid of any excess water., Place the sundried tomatoes, ¼ cup (25 g) of grated parmesan cheese, a medium garlic clove that’s been minced, a small shallot that’s been minced, ¼ cup (4 g) of parsley leaves, ¼ cup (27 g) of coarsely chopped walnuts, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of white wine vinegar, and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of extra virgin olive oil in a food processor, and pulse until just  combined.You can substitute pecorino romano cheese for the parmesan if you prefer.
 Leave the food processor running, and slowly drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of olive oil into the mixture in a steady stream. Pulse the mixture until it becomes a coarse, chunky paste, which should take about 30 seconds., Taste the tapenade, and add as much salt and freshly ground pepper as you think is necessary. Transfer the tapenade to a bowl, and serve with crostini.You can store the tapenade in the refrigerator for up to 5 days in an airtight container. In fact, the flavor of the spread often improves after it’s refrigerated so you may want to make it in advance and chill for a day or so.

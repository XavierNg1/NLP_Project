 The slope-intercept form is y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}, where y{\displaystyle y} equals the y-coordinate of a point on the line, x{\displaystyle x} equals the x-coordinate of that same point, m{\displaystyle m} equals the slope of the line, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the y-intercept., The standard form is Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}, where x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} are the coordinates of a point on the line, A{\displaystyle A} is a positive integer, and B{\displaystyle B} and C{\displaystyle C} are integers., Use inverse operations to move variables from one side of the equation to the other side. Remember to keep the equation balanced, which means that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side.

For example, you might have the equation of a line 3x+2y=4{\displaystyle 3x+2y=4}. This is in standard form. If you need to find the y-intercept of the line, you need to rearrange the formula to slope-intercept form by isolating the y{\displaystyle y} variable:Subtract 3x{\displaystyle 3x} from both sides of the equation:3x+2y−3x=4−3x{\displaystyle 3x+2y-3x=4-3x}2y=4−3x{\displaystyle 2y=4-3x}.

Divide both sides by 2{\displaystyle 2}:2y2=4−3x2{\displaystyle {\frac {2y}{2}}={\frac {4-3x}{2}}}y=4−3x2{\displaystyle y={\frac {4-3x}{2}}}




, If you are changing an equation to slope-intercept or standard form, rearrange the variables, coefficients, and constants so that they follow the correct formula.

For example, to change y=4−3x2{\displaystyle y={\frac {4-3x}{2}}} to the correct slope-intercept formula, you need to switch the order of the number in the numerator, then simplify:y=−3x+42{\displaystyle y={\frac {-3x+4}{2}}}y=−32x+2{\displaystyle y={\frac {-3}{2}}x+2}Now, since the formula is in proper slope-intercept form, it is easy to identify the y-intercept as 2.

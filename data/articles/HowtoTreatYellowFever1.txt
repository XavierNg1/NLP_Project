 There’s no medication that cures yellow fever, but there are ways to manage your symptoms to help prevent the condition from worsening. The virus may pass on its own, though symptoms can be unpleasant and sometimes severe.If you are diagnosed with yellow fever, talk to your doctor about whether or not you should be hospitalized. Hospitalization can increase survival rates.For some, the safest idea is to stay in the hospital for observation and supportive care, which can include:Oxygen
Rest
IV (intravenous) fluids
Pain relievers
Dialysis if you have kidney failure
Monitoring your blood pressure
Treating other infections or complications that arise;
, If you have very mild symptoms, stay home and take care of yourself. Do not go to work or school until you are well. Stay in bed, relax, and rest – give your body time to recover and let the virus pass.If your symptoms worsen at all, seek medical care.
 You can easily become dehydrated if you are vomiting or have a high fever. Be sure to replace your fluids and stay hydrated while you’re sick.On average, men should drink 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids daily, and women should drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) a day.Drink at least that when you’re ill, and more if you’re vomiting or feverish. Tea, juice, and water count towards your fluids.
 Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer. Take it to relieve symptoms as indicated on the bottle, or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.Don’t take acetaminophen if you have severe liver disease.
Because of the risk of bleeding when you have yellow fever, do not take medications that increase your risk of bleeding: aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen., Avoid getting any more mosquito bites for at least 5 days from when you get a fever. This reduces the risk that uninfected mosquitoes will pick up the illness and spread it to others.

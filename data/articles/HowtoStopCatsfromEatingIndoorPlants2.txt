 Boredom is a large cause of misbehavior in cats, from scratching to meowing to eating houseplants. Prevent boredom in your cats by giving them a variety of toys and an interesting environment to explore. When you notice your cats becoming tired of their toys, swap them out for different toys.


For example, ensure your cats have climbing towers, scratching posts, access to windows, places to hide, and toys that keep them active.
 Take time out of your day to play with your cats. Keeping them active and busy will redirect their attention away from the indoor plants. Aim for several 5 to 10 minute play sessions a day or whenever your cats start to look bored.


If your cats begin to go near your plants, immediately try to distract them with a toy or a game.
 Buy a pot of cat grass that's safe for your cats to eat. If your cats begin to eat your indoor houseplants, you can redirect them to their pot of cat grass. You can also grow your own garden of cat-safe plants to keep indoors. Fill a large planting box with:Catnip
Barley
Sesame
Rye
Wheat grass

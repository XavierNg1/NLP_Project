 It may sound a bit odd, but if the hemorrhoids are very painful and uncomfortable, use a tiny bit of baby teething gel on the area. The gel contains a local antiseptic that can decrease the pain and discomfort., Then apply a small amount of aloe vera gel or an ointment such as Preparation H to help with hemorrhoidal pain and/or discomfort. Apply as often as needed.


Hemorrhoid relief ointments such as Preparation H usually contain petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine, which acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid.
Aloe vera gel contains components that have been shown to inhibit infection and help in healing minor wounds.
Avoid steroid creams as they can damage the delicate tissue around a hemorrhoid.
 If you have persistent discomfort, you may want to consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen.These can help you feel more comfortable and may aid in swelling reduction as well. As always, check with your care provider to ensure that it is safe to take a medication that you do not normally take.
 Most hemorrhoids resolve using natural methods within 3-7 days.If they don’t improve, or if they worsen, call your physician. Occasionally for external hemorrhoids and more often for internal hemorrhoids, you may still need some medical intervention. The most common approaches if the described methods don’t help enough are:Ligation: Tying a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow
Injection of a chemical solution designed to shrink the hemorrhoid
Cauterization-- burning the hemorrhoid
Hemorrhoid stapling-- blood flow to the hemorrhoid is stopped with a surgical staple.
Hemorrhoidectomy-- surgical removal of the hemorrhoid.

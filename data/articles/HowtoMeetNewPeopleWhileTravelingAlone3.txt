 Many people get nervous about saying hello to complete strangers. Remember that most people are perfectly happy to have conversations with travelers. Ask locals questions about the city and find out about their favorite spots or activities.Put yourself in the shoes of a local. Would you mind if a stranger said hello and asked a few questions? Probably not!

, Put a smile on your face and get excited about this opportunity to broaden your horizons. If you look like you’re enthusiastic about meeting new people, strangers will respond to your openness and excitement.


Even if you don’t feel confident, try to act the part. Appearing confident is half the battle. Straighten your posture, maintain eye contact, and keep smiling., Come prepared with key words and sentences to help you move around the city and be courteous to the people who live there. This will also help you interact with locals and overcome any language barrier between you.


Prioritize memorizing the translations for “please,” “thank you,” “excuse me” or “I’m sorry,” and “where is the nearest bathroom.”

, Be open-minded about your travel experience. Don’t approach your trip with a list of things you won’t do. This closed-down attitude will make it more difficult for you to reach out to new people and embrace the potential new experiences you could have with them.If you’ve always said, “I’ll never stay at a hostel,” stay at a hostel! Abandoning these preset ideas about your travel will help you develop a more flexible state of mind.
 As you meet new people, you might decide to join your plans with theirs. This may mean adjusting where you go to dinner or drinks, or adding a new item to your travel itinerary.


You can build flexibility into your travel plans by not over-scheduling yourself. Allow for plenty of time in each city you visit, and plan on a few extra activities getting added to your trip once you arrive at your destination.

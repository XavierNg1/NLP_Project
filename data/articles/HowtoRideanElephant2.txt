 Riding bareback with only one person per elephant is in the best interest of the animal. Avoid places that allow more than one rider and that strap platforms to the backs of the elephants.If you visit a place that has platforms, ask to ride bareback instead.


Make sure the camp you choose has weight limits for riders.
The rides should also be no more than 20 minutes.Long rides are difficult for the elephant.
 Many different methods are used to control an elephant. Verbal and foot commands and positive reinforcement are healthy ways to control an elephant. If you notice that hooks, nails, fear, and punishment are used to control the animals, choose a different camp.Fresh cuts and bloody wounds may be a sign that the elephant is being abused. Cuts are often covered in a purple antiseptic spray, a bandage, or a plastic bag.
You can also check to see if there have been any complaints of abuse or mistreatment filed against the elephant camp.
Visit the camp website and read reviews before you visit. If the site mentions any type of elephant show or elephant painting, choose a different camp.
 Elephants are social animals and like to be with other elephants. Choose a camp that allows the elephants to socialize and not be isolated. The elephants should be allowed to roam freely and not be chained up.If you notice the elephants are swaying in place or rocking, they are likely experiencing emotional distress.
The elephants should also have regular access to food, water and mud.

 By default, the To-Do Bar is displayed on the right-hand side of the Outlook application, and you'll find the mini calendar at the top.
 It doesn't appear to be a dropdown menu, but that's precisely the kind of functionality which is therein hidden. In a series of clicks, the mini calendar can be changed to display the future month of your choosing.
 Any day in the future is clickable on your mini calendar, and the next click takes you straight to the "Day" look of the selected day in your Outlook calendar.

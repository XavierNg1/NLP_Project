 Autistic people communicate differently, but that does not make their communication inferior. Every person (including non-autistic people) has unique mannerisms, and there is no right or wrong in personal expression.;
, You may have a fairly narrow view of what each specific behavior means. (For example, if you assume that lack of eye contact means inattention, you may think an autistic person is ignoring you when they're actually paying close attention.) Work on being open-minded and getting to know the individual.
 This may be new to you, and that's okay. Weird faces and flapping arms may seem unpredictable to you, but that does not mean the autistic person is dangerous, or that they're going to hurt you. Take a deep breath and relax.
 Because body language is complicated, and autistic people are diverse, there is no easy list or flowchart of body language logic. Look for contextual clues (environment, what is said, facial expressions) and use your judgment.
 It's okay to ask for clarifications about someone else's feelings, and it's certainly better than getting frustrated or confused. (Autistic people can understand the feeling of needing clarifications about feelings. As long as you're polite and respectful, it's perfectly okay.)


"I noticed you've been fidgeting a lot while we're talking. Is something up, or is this a normal part of listening for you?"
"I noticed that you haven't been looking at me while we're talking. Is this a part of your listening body language?"

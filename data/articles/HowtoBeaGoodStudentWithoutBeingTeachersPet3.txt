 It is ok to break the rules once in a while. One little mark is not going to tarnish the reputation your teacher has of you. If anything, it makes you seem more human and relatable to your peers.Don’t be afraid to whisper to your friend, pass a note, or make a joke during class. As long as you don’t make a habit out of it, and keep it moderation, you should be fine.
 A tell-tale sign that you are a teacher’s pet is if your only friend is the teacher. This isn’t necessarily bad, but it can be lonely at times. Try to branch out and befriend other students. Make friends with students whom you have things in common with. Perhaps you love to eat chocolate, read books, or love the Christmas season. These are pretty common things that you can use to connect with other people.Revealing tiny secrets that are slightly embarrassing is a good way to deepen a friendship. By sharing intimate details about yourself, you are showing the other person that you are human, and thus, relatable.
 A great student is a student that is motivated, and you can be motivated without being teacher’s pet. Instead of channeling your energy into pleasing the teacher (we know it takes a lot of energy and time), channel your energy into your interests.For example, try starting a photography, book, fashion club, or any kind of club at school.
If you like planning events, you can help plan school events, like pep rallies, Christmas parties, and field days, for example.

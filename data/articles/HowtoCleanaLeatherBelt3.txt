 Add some to a bag or other air-tight container, and throw the belt inside. Seal it up, and leave it for at least a day. If it still smells, try it for longer.You can find activated charcoal at pet stores (in the fish supplies) or online.
 Another option for deodorizing is kitty litter. Kitty litter is designed to absorb odors for obvious reasons. To use, seal the belt in with the kitty litter in an airtight container. Let it sit for at least a day; let it go longer if it still needs deodorizing., Another option for deodorizing is using baking soda. Simply seal it in with the belt and leave it for a day or so.If you're worried about it leaving a white residue, try one of the baking soda "packs" made to deodorize things like refrigerators, as the baking soda isn't loose.

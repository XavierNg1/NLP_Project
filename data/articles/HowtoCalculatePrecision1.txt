 It helps to begin by sorting your data in numerical order, from lowest to highest. This will ensure that you do not miss any values. Then select the value at the end of the list.

For example, suppose you are testing the precision of a scale, and you observe five measurements: 11, 13, 12, 14, 12. After sorting, these values are listed as 11, 12, 12, 13, 14. The highest measurement is 14.
;
, Once your data has been sorted, finding the lowest value is as simple as looking at the beginning of the list.

For the scale measurement data, the lowest value is 11.
 The range of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest measurements. Just subtract one from the other. Algebraically, the range can be expressed as:


Range=x(max)−x(min){\displaystyle {\text{Range}}=x(max)-x(min)}

For the sample data, the range is:


Range=x(max)−x(min)=14−11=3{\displaystyle {\text{Range}}=x(max)-x(min)=14-11=3}




, When reporting data, it is important to let the readers know what you have measured. Because there are different measures of precision, you should specify what you are reporting. For this data, you would report Mean=12.4, Range=3, or simply that the Mean=12.4±3.The mean is not actually part of calculating the range or precision, but it is generally the primary calculation for reporting the measured value. The mean is found by adding up the sum of the measured values and then dividing by the number of items in the group. For this set of data, the mean is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4.

 Self-pollinating plants, like beans and tomatoes, do not need an excessively large number of seeds, and the same goes for plants that are both self-pollinating and cross-pollinating. Plants that rely on cross-pollinating, though, need large amounts of seed.
 Place the seeds in a glass jar filled with an equal weight of dry silica gel for one week.
 A freezer-safe storage jar or plastic sandwich bag should work. Keep each seed type in its own separate container. Do not mix the seeds since mixing increases your odds of cross-pollination between varieties.
 This organic product is an effective way to kill off any insect or pest eggs that may be hiding in the midst of your seeds. Add just a little DE to the container and mix the seeds around to spread it.
 Write the current date out on the container using permanent marker. By marking the date on the jar, you will be able to keep track of how long the seeds have been in storage.


Note that you should also mark the cultivar name and type of plant on the container, especially if you grow multiple plant varieties.
 Humidity is your worst enemy if trying to save heirloom seeds. As such, freezer storage is ideal. This is especially true if you store the seeds in a freezer that is rarely opened.
 You do not want different varieties to get mixed up. If this occurs, you will end up growing different varieties of the same plant too close together, leading to cross-breeding and ruining your chances of collecting heirloom seeds later on.
 Before using them, all the seeds to thaw out to room temperature. Then plant as normal.

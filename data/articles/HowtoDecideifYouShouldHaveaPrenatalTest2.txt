 If you are in your late 30s or 40s, the likelihood of having a child with a disability or disorder increases significantly. If you know early on, you can research the disability to be prepared, or decide not to keep the baby if you can't handle it (e.g. putting it up for adoption).


In addition to being at higher risk of complications and premature delivery with increasing maternal age, you are more likely to give birth to a baby with Down syndrome or certain disabilities.
If you personally have a genetic disability, your child may be more likely to have the same condition.
 Make a list of genetic conditions found in blood relatives both in your family and that of your partner.


If you are very concerned about your baby’s risk of having the a particular condition, discuss family genetics with a genetic counselor or physician prior to testing; some conditions may only affect one gender or may be recessive, which can significantly reduce your child’s chance of having the disease.
 In many cases, by simply examining both parents with a simple blood test, you can check for a wide range of conditions your baby could potentially have.


Many genetic conditions are recessive in nature and could only manifest in the baby if both parents are carriers and pass the recessive gene to the baby.
Remember that not all conditions are based on the parents’ genetics, and that genetic testing of both parents will not tell you whether the baby may have a developmental condition or chromosomal problem.

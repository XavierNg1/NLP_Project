 Simply wash off as much as you can, working lightly. Don't worry if some of it doesn't come off at first -- this is just to help you use less oil later on. Always start with soap and water -- many water and latex paints will come completely free with simple hand washing.The earlier you can get to the paint, the better. Once it has dried it will be a little trickier to remove.;
, Mineral oil is the best cleaner since it works effectively on both oil, water, and latex-based paints. Pour just enough on your skin to cover the entire painted area. Lightly rub it on, then leave it for 2-3 minutes to soak in.









Any vegetable oil will work here, in a pinch, including coconut, flax seed, olive, etc.
 Using your fingertips, rub the baby oil into the painted part of your skin, and gently scratch off as much of the paint as you can. You can just use your hands, working in small circles to massage the oil into the paint and remove it.
 If you have an old washcloth, you could use this as well, though it may get stained. You just want something a little rougher to scrub your skin. Scrub lightly in circles to remove tricky bits of paint.
 Saturate the cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and use it to get at any stains that don't respond well to the mineral oil. Some people have had success with make-up remover as well.









Alcohol will dry your skin out if left for too long. Use a moisturizer once you're done to prevent cracking or flaking.
 Once you've got everything off, use soap and water to remove the oil and smell of alcohol.









If you still can't get the paint off, you're likely using a stronger oil-based paint. You can attack it directly using other oils and cleansers.

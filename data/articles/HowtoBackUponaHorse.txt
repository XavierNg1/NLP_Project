, Don't pull hard on the reins, just grip firmly and pull back with as little pressure as your horse will respond to.

Don't pull and release on and off. Just pull and hold.
 This is optional depending on how well the horse can read your cues, but may need to be exaggerated if the horse still doesn't know what you're asking., Keep asking verbally and with your body until the horse backs.

Realize that if you're working a young horse, or a new horse for you, you shouldn't ask too much of them at first. Have him back a few steps, then reward him! Gradually increase the amount the horse backs until he does so without a problem.
 Mainly do this by releasing the pressure on the bit and re-shifting your weight, but also by using verbal praises and a few scratches to the withers.

The newer the horse is to backing, the more you should praise him when he reacts correctly. With a more experienced horse, the release of the pressure on the bit should be enough of a reward.

 Coconut oil makes a great choice for making popcorn.Add coconut oil and popcorn together to a heavy-bottomed pan. Use enough coconut oil to coat the bottom of the pan, and use just enough kernels to make a single layer. Stir or shake to make sure the kernels are coated well with the coconut oil. Place the pan over medium heat and cover it. Listen for the kernels to start popping. As soon as the popping slows to intervals of a few seconds, remove from heat.

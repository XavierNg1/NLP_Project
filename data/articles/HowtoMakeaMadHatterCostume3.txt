 You can buy these at a local craft store for relatively little money. Try to buy different colors for each spool. That will make the belt look cooler.


Take the labels off your spools. The Mad Hatter wasn’t buying his spools from a grocery store, so don’t make it look like you did.
 There are holes in the top and bottom of each spool, so run a piece of yarn throughout the spools. If you enter it through the bottom of one spool enter through the top of the next spool.
 You can find old belts for little money at any thrift store. Now make four holes in a square right next to where you made the cut on both pieces of the belt. You need eight holes in total. You can use a hole puncher or a utility knife. Be careful.
 Thread one end through four of the holes and the other end through the other four holes. You should run the thread through all four of the holes in such a way that you end up with a ‘X’ pattern. Once you’ve done that, tie the thread off and cut off any extra. The spools should be secured to the belt and you’re ready to wear it.

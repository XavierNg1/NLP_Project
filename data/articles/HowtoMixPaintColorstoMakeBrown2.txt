 While primarily used in the printing industry, Pantone provides a precise color reference to help you find exactly the brown you are looking for. You can purchase one new or used online.


It's important to be aware, though, that Pantone defines its colors in the CMYK color space, not RGY. CMYK is the acronym for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. White is not included, as that is generally the color of the paper that is being printed on, so you will have to do some interpretation.
 There are a large number of cards to flip through, so be patient. You can also take advantage of Photoshop or other graphics applications, which often include Pantone colors in various formats.


Look for the exact percentages of magenta, yellow, cyan and black needed for that color, and mix accordingly. Note that in this example, the percentages are C:33%, M:51%, and Y:50%
Note that magenta, yellow and cyan are more accurate primary colors, but they are not the standard for mixing paints at this time. For more information, see this article.
 Using the proportions provided on the Pantone guide, mix your your paints to create an exact shade of brown. Although this Pantone guide is typically used for mixing ink for prints, you can use magenta, cyan, black, and yellow paint to create the perfect hue of brown.

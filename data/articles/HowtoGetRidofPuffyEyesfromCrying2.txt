 Even if your puffy eyes are caused by crying, other factors can determine their severity. Get at least eight hours of sleep each night to reduce swollen or baggy eyes.


Children, teenagers, and older adults may require different amounts of sleep. Ask your doctor for a recommendation.
 Salt buildup around your eyes can increase fluid retention, causing puffiness. Drink plenty of water to counteract this.


Cut down on your consumption of salt and caffeine, which dehydrate you.
 Mild allergic reactions to pollen, dust, animals, or food can cause swollen eyes. Avoid any foods that make you feel itchy, puffy, or uncomfortable. Take allergy relief medication when you can't avoid exposure. Visit a doctor for more advice.
 If you frequently get puffy eyes, there may be an underlying cause. An optometrist can check your vision and possibly prescribe glasses or contacts to reduce eye strain. An ophthalmologist can examine your eyes for medical conditions.
 When looking at a computer, phone, or book, take breaks every twenty minutes. During these breaks, focus your eyes on something across the room. While eye strain is not the most common cause of puffy eyes, this is recommended anyway for general eye health.

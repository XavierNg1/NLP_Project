 During long periods of time, it's best if you keep discs in their jewel case, or a covering of some sort that protects their entire body. You could damage the disc's mobility on your stereo if you leave it on a device that is portable or movable, like a Walkman or a PlayStation.;
, Never touch the shiny side of the disc.
 Wipe from the center to the edge with a damp paper towel with soap, then wash a second time to get the soap off. Window cleaners are often helpful also.

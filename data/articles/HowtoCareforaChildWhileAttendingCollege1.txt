 Before you begin school, research daycares close to your apartment/house and the University. You will want to enroll your child in a daycare that will be easily accessible for you should you be in a rush in the morning or if your child should become ill and you need to leave class to pick them up. In addition to proximity, consider cost, reviews, as well as all of the amenities of that particular daycare. For instance, some daycares have cameras that you can login to so that you can check on your child virtually throughout the day.
Some daycares have a religious curriculum and others do different educational activities.;
, One of your major concerns about daycare is likely the cost. However, there are many programs available either through your school or through the government that will provide you with daycare assistance. Contact your local Department of Health and Human Services as well as Parent and Family Services Office at your school to see what aid can be offered to you.Enlist the help of the childâ€™s mother or father as well to help assist you in paying for daycare.
 In addition to daycare, there are also many free childcare programs like Head Start or pre-K that you can enroll your child in if they are age 3-4 or older, depending upon the state and available slots. Look into these programs in your area if your child is of age.
 In addition to relying on family, friends, and daycare, try to find a local and reliable babysitter that you can use in times of emergency or when planning a night out with friends. You can search for them on Care.com or SitterCity.

 The bright light from the beam can temporarily blind or distract the operator of the vehicle. This is extremely dangerous to all of the passengers on board. A laser beam in an airplane cockpit is not just a continuous beam, but appears as a flash that is very distracting.It is actually illegal to aim laser pointers at planes and you can be arrested for it.
 At these types of events there are large crowds of people and you can’t be sure that your beam will not end up in someone’s eyes. Aiming the beam at the stage or at a player on the field is annoying both for other viewers and for the players themselves.If you have no specific need for the laser pointer, leave it at home.
 Just as you shouldn’t point the laser beam at a person, you should never point it at an animal either. Animals have very similar eyes to ours and they can be harmed by the beam. In addition, you can frighten or confuse the animal by accidentally flash blinding them with the bright light.If you see someone aiming a laser pointer at an animal, gently let them know that this is unsafe.
 Most laser pointers are not powerful enough (5 mW) to actually damage your skin, but it’s best if you don’t shine the laser on your skin. Stronger lasers (500 mW) can actually burn your skin if you shine them for too long. It is safe to test that the pointer is working by briefly shining it into your hand.

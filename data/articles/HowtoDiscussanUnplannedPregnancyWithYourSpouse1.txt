 Before you run through different scenarios in your head, be 100% sure that you are pregnant. Home pregnancy tests are convenient and very accurate. If your home pregnancy test is positive, visit a health care provider to take a blood test. You can skip the home pregnancy test and go straight to the doctor's office if you would like. In a addition to a missed or lighter period, other pregnancy symptoms include:Breast tenderness
Increased nipple sensitivity
Nausea or vomiting
Being unusually tired
Feeling more emotional
Cramps
Bloating;
, You experience many emotions when you find out that you are pregnant. Identifying how you feel about your pregnancy is helpful for both you and your spouse. You need to be able to let your spouse know how you feel. You will not be able to communicate that information if you have taken the time to consider your feelings.Get in a comfortable, quiet area so you can think and process your feelings.
You may feel excited, surprised, confident, peaceful, happy, strong, or alive.
You may also feel disappointed, sad, guilty, worried, confused, or embarrassed.
It is not uncommon to feel conflicting emotions such as being both scared, worried, and excited. You also may feel numb or uncertain about your feelings all together.
 You have three options when you become pregnant: continue with the pregnancy, terminate the pregnancy, or give the baby up for adoption. Make a chart for each option that you are considering and list the positive and negatives of each. Think about how your life would be if you chose each option. Think about what is best for you, your spouse, and your child."The idea of having an abortion makes me feel ___ because ___ and I'm thinking ___."
"The idea of continuing my pregnancy and placing my child for adoption makes me feel___ because ___ and I'm thinking ___."
The idea of having a child right now makes me feel ____ because ____ and I'm thinking ___."

, It may be helpful to speak with a close friend, family member, or counselor before you talk to your spouse. This person can help support you, comfort you, and offer you advice. A professional counselor can also advise you about approaching your spouse.


Your spouse may not be happy that you talked to someone else before you talked to them. If you talk to a friend or family member, ask them to keep the conversation just between the two of you.
Look for a therapist that specializes in pregnancy counseling.

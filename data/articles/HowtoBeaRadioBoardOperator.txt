 You can learn many things during your high school years that will be beneficial to you as a radio board operator. Math classes help you calculate time measurements. Computer classes help you become skilled with new computer programs and software. Speech classes prepare you to speak on air, if given the opportunity.;
, A radio board has many buttons, switches and slides that control different functions, such as volume, playback, microphones and other aspects of radio. By learning to efficiently operate buttons on stereos, mp3 players, digital recording devices and other electronic equipment, you can become proficient in managing several devices at once. That will be part of your job while you are operating the board.
 Speak to the general manager or the program director and offer your services. Many small radio stations are looking for volunteers to help out with odd shifts. Even if the station isn't looking for a volunteer, you may choose to ask for a tour and a demonstration. This will help you learn about that particular station's board and what happens behind the scenes.
 Most broadcasting education programs take between 18 months and 2 years to complete. You learn to run a board, speak on air, create logs and master other duties related to radio broadcasting. A diploma from a broadcasting school shows a future employer that you are dedicated and have some radio board knowledge.
 Often, board operators perform mundane tasks, such as preparing logs for the next day, tracking transmitter readings and taking out the garbage. Board operators rarely get to hear their own voices on the air, nor do they participate in programming choices or ad spot creation. They may take phone calls and perform secretarial duties when needed.

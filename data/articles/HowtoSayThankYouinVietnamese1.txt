, Since Vietnamese is a tonal language, pronunciation is extremely important to the meaning of both words and phrases. When you’re hoping to say “thank you,” say “cảm” in a broken falling tone, and “ơn” in a flat tone.Since it is hard to imagine these sounds from simply reading about them, listen to recordings of the phrase online.When pronounced correctly, “cảm ơn” will sound like “gauhm uhhn”.
The “auh” portion of the first word is sounded out in a rising, then falling voice.
 Increase the politeness of your expression by including a personal pronoun corresponding with the person you are addressing. In other words, say, “cám ơn,” in addition to an appropriate word for “you” in Vietnamese. Use “bà,” pronounced “baa,” when addressing an older woman, and “cô,” pronounced “coh,” to address a young girl.Use “ông”, pronounced “ohng,” to address a man who is older than you, and “anh,” pronounced “ang,” when thanking a young man.
For instance; “cám ơn cô” means “thank you,” as you would say it to a young woman.
 Add “nhiều lắm,” pronounced “nyee-oh luhm,” after saying “cảm ơn” to express especially strong gratitude. This addition indicates the English equivalent of "a lot" or "so much.”Accordingly, say, “cảm ơn nhiều lắm,” pronounced “gauhm uhhn nyee-oh luhm,” if you’re hoping to more strongly convey your gratitude., The Vietnamese language includes another word to help express appreciation in contexts that requires extreme formality and politeness. In particular, the word “xin,” which translates to “to ask” or even “to beg” is placed before “cảm ơn.” Altogether, say “xin cảm ơn,” pronounced like “sin gauhm uhhn.”

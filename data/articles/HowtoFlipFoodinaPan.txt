,, This should be whatever takes the longest to cook.


If combining meat and veggies, it would usually be the meat (or meat substitute if cooking a vegetarian dish).
If cooking veggies alone, onions or carrots are a good place to start.
 If using multiple ingredients, now is probably a good time to add in the next ingredient. Distribute it evenly over the top of the first ingredient but do not mix it in.
 Pick up the skillet and hold above the burner. Do not try to flip food with a skillet that is too heavy for you to easily control.



Resist the temptation to do a lot of flipping the skillet up, as this can send hot food and oil back in your direction.






Instead, what you want to is allow the sloped side of the skillet to direct the food up.

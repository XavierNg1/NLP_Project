, Panic is your greatest enemy. If you run wildly around, even for a little while you could lose your sense of direction complete. Try to remember how you got to your present location.
 Use the compass to give you a sense of direction. Think of which way you came, and if that was Northeast, and then recall if you took a turn and what the direction the turn was. If you are calm, you can remember a great many things. If you are on a trail do not leave it.
 Leave markers where ever you go, so you can return to where you are. Also, if someone tries to find you, they will look for markers. So make as many as you can, on every turn that you make, and try to mark the direction you are taking. You got off the trail, maybe ten minutes ago, so if you track back more than that time, you know you are on the wrong track.
 Create a marking so it can be seen by air. Sing loudly or shout help, when you hear others trying to find you. If you have a whistle, blow it or use a blade of grass. Stay in the open so they can find you easily. Do not hide in a cave or under brushes.
 It is smarter to stay put and try to find your way out in the daylight.
 This can be hard going but will often lead to a trail or road. and you will eventually come to civilization.

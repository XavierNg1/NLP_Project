 This is an obvious one. Create a Facebook account to get started. Don't fake your first or last name as it could ruin you later on.;
, Most last names can be pretty common. Begin your search with your last name.
 Try looking for familiar symbols of your family. Search through pictures (if they have some), see where they live (if they have that shown), or see who's in their friends (if they have that shown).
 Send a friend request to them, if you think they are apart of your family.
 Sometimes, parents name their children after other family members.
 If they have the same last name as you, and they are one of your family member's friends, it's a good chance that they are apart of your family too!

 Don't close the pocket though. Let the pocket be open and only do this if your clothes isn't tight at all. This is why this works best with sweatshirt-pockets. The pet will crawl in and out the pocket, and crawl around you! Be careful so that the rat/mouse doesn't fall off you!

, You can use treats to navigate the mouse/rat through your homemade obstacle course! Place the treats with about 5–7 centimeter (2.0–2.8 in) of distance.
 Place your pet under a piece of cloth or something similar, and watch him/her trying to find out! Do not use a heavy cover, though, and if you see your pet doesn't like it, or is taking too long to find out, then stop the play, before the pet gets mad or ill.

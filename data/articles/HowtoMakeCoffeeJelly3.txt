 Place the cold water in a medium mixing bowl. Sprinkle the unflavored gelatin over the water and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.As the gelatin sits, the individual granules should begin to absorb the water. This process, known as "hydrating" or "blooming," makes it easier to dissolve the gelatin once you add hot liquid.
 Pour the strong, hot coffee into the gelatin mixture. Stir well for several minutes, or until the gelatin completely dissolves.


Note that the coffee must be very hot when you add it; otherwise, the gelatin may not set properly.
The coffee should also be quite strong to balance the sweetness of the condensed milk and mimic the taste of Vietnamese coffee.
 After the gelatin dissolves, pour the sweetened condensed milk into the mixture. Stir well to combine.


You must use condensed milk. Do not used evaporated milk since it lacks the sweetness and thickness of condensed milk.
 Carefully pour the coffee mixture into an 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) square glass dish.


To make thinner cubes of coffee jelly, you could use a 7-inch by 11-inch (18-cm by 28-cm) glass dish or a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) glass dish.
 Place the filled dish into the refrigerator. Chill for 2 to 4 hours, or until the coffee jelly is firm.


Thinner cubes will solidify quicker than thicker cubes.
Wait until the jelly feels firm enough to hold between your fingers. To be on the safe side, you may wish to wait 8 hours or overnight.
 Cut the finished coffee jelly into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes and turn the cubes out into a large serving bowl or dish. Enjoy immediately.


Store extra coffee jelly in an airtight container kept in the refrigerator for up 3 or 4 days.

 To play Bin Weevils, users need to create an avatar (BinWeevil) - it's free!;
, To do so children must build on their social skills and rely on one another to complete missions, tasks and maintain virtual jobs. In return they earn “Mulch” (virtual currency) to spend in the Shopping Mall where they can grab a bite to eat or visit one of many stores to pick up a new state of the art remote control helicopter for their “BinNests” (virtual homes).
 BinWeevils is a fantastic opportunity for children to communicate with their friends and have fun in a safe online environment. The chat function on the site is a great way for children to make friends, giving them the confidence and comfort of chatting behind their BinWeevil avatar.
 Children are given an opportunity to build their world the way they like it – fun and colourful, where the sky is hardly the limit.
 It is a fact that children learn better through play, this is why BinWeevils uses its 3D Online Entertainment Platform to “edu-tain”, a mixture of education and entertainment, to help establish valuable life skills for users.
 Being a journalist within the BinScape is challenging but rewarding for users. Children are also able to decorate their own disco clubs to share the fun. They are able to host DJ parties for their friends, to meet new BinWeevils and to socialize in a safe environment.

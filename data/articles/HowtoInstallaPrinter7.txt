 You can either install the printer as a network printer or connect it to a computer and share it. AirPrint printers allow you to print wireless from your iOS device as long as it is connected to the same network.
 You can print from most apps that support opening files, such as Mail, Photos, Pages, and a variety of others.
 This looks like a square with an arrow coming out the top.
 This will open the AirPrint printing menu.
 Your AirPrint printer should appear in the list of printers as long as you are connected to the same network.


If your printer is not showing up on the list, try turning the printer off and then back on. This may help fix its network connection.
 Your file will be sent to the printer, and it should begin printing momentarily.
 Many printer manufacturers offer apps that allow you to print to their network printers, even if they aren't AirPrint compatible. You can usually download these apps for free from the App Store.


Make sure to download the correct app for your printer manufacturer. The HP ePrint app won't be able to print to Canon printers.

 Place an item of 1/4-1/2 inch or 1/2-1 1/3 cm thickness, such as a tongue depressor or a chopstick, between your top and bottom teeth. Orient the object such that the length of it is sticking out in front of you, rather than out of the sides of your mouth. Now, shift your bottom jaw forward to try to point the object towards the ceiling. When you master one object comfortably, gradually increase the thickness to give you greater range of motion.Try to select an object that is made to go in the mouth, such as those indicated above. Other household objects may accidentally chip your teeth during the exercise, if you are not careful.
Perform this exercise as needed when you feel you need more mobility in your jaw, such as before a meal.
 Place your 1/4-1/2 inch or 1/2-1 1/3 cm item between your top and bottom teeth again, but this time, place it horizontally. Move your bottom teeth from side to side rather than up and down. This will help increase your lateral jaw mobility.Perform this exercise as needed in response to pain or when you feel you need more jaw mobility.
 Many people carry their heads slightly forward when they walk. This brings the spine out of alignment, aggravating TMD. Stand against a wall and tuck your chin, bringing your jaw to your chest, while pressing your shoulder blades together behind your back. This stretches the spine into a more neutral position that can alleviate TMD symptoms and increase jaw mobility.

 If you are already in a relationship with the target girl, then you should be sure to keep the stream of compliments flowing. Don’t take it for granted that she knows you consider her pretty. She will appreciate hearing it every now and then – and the more the better.


“You are so beautiful/cute/pretty/lovely” will always work. Or, alternately, call he a goddess or say something like, “You are as pretty as you are smart.”
Focus on different outfits, as well. When your girlfriend wears a new outfit, tell her how good she looks in it.
 Think of different ways to compliment your girlfriend once a day. When you are in a relationship, simply telling your girlfriend she is pretty may grow stale. Fortunately, there are a number of other ways to pay her compliments.


Compliment her on looks, but also on her personality, her dress, her scent, and her grooming. Trying saying in you next conversation, “You are right! You’re so smart.”
Try more general complements that reflect how happy you are with her, like “I so lucky to have a pretty girl like you” or "You make me so happy.”
Compliment her in new and different ways. Try making her a playlist of songs that have meaning for the two of you, for example.
 Words go even better with gestures. Every once and a while, for instance, bring your girlfriend a random gift to back up all the compliments you have been paying her. She will remember your thoughtfulness.


You can try also leaving a note, sending her a random text message and/or posting a comment on her facebook or instagram page, or calling her unexpectedly. Use your imagination.

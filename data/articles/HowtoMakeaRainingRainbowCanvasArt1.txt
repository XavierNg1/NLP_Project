 Note that if you're doing a realistic rainbow, you will need shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, depending on your taste.


If you're doing a rainbow that's differently colored, that's fine too. You could use pastels, psychedelic colors, your favorite colors, etc. It's art, so use your creativity.;
, This is to prevent any staining from the wax colors.
 Glue them in a rainbow formation.
, Allow the crayons to begin melting and dripping down the canvas. Do this slowly, in small increments.


Take care to keep your skin well away from both the heat source and the melting wax, as you could burn your skin if it comes into contact with either.
, The next day, when dry, it will be ready to hang on your wall.

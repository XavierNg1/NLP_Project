If they call asking what you are wearing to a party, tell them you aren’t sure yet., Avoid shopping with a friend who copies you, as they will likely buy the same or similar clothes. Especially avoid shopping for big events like prom with these types of friends., Be mindful of what you post, as your copycat friend could be using your social media to bite your style. Only share things that you wouldn’t mind them copying from you, like the books you’re reading or movies you’re watching.

You might also consider limiting their access to your profiles so they can’t access your updates.

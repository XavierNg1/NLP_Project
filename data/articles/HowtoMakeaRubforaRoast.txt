Chicken pairs well with citrus and herbs. To make a rub for a roast chicken combine 1 tbsp. (15 ml) salt free lemon pepper, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) dried thyme, 1/2 tsp. (7 ml) granulated garlic and 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) salt in a small bowl. Combine the spices and then generously rub the chicken with the spice mixture. Roast the chicken at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for about 45 to 60 minutes for a whole chicken or until the internal temperature of the chicken (check the thickest part of the chicken such as the thigh) reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).;

Rosemary and garlic are a natural compliment to pork and make a wonderful spice rub. Combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) dried rosemary, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) granulated garlic, 1/2 tsp. (5 ml) salt, 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) ground pepper and 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) dried chili flakes. Rub this mixture over the pork to be roasted and cook it at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) or until the internal temperature has reached at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and let it rest for 3 minutes until serving. Cooking time will depend on the size and cut of the roast.



Roast beef can accommodate much more assertive flavors in a dry rub. Combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) granulated garlic, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) dark chili powder, 1 tsp. (5 ml) dried mustard powder, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) dried oregano, 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) ground pepper and 1/2 tsp. (5 ml) coarse salt. Rub evenly over the beef and cook in a preheated 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) oven for about 20 minutes for each 1 lb. (450 g) of meat for boneless cuts and about 25 minutes for each 1 lb. (450 g) of meat from a bone-in cut. This will result in rare meat; adjust cooking time for your desired level of doneness.



Turkey pairs well with less aggressive flavors. Combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) dried thyme, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) granulated garlic, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) poultry seasoning and 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) ground pepper. Rub over the turkey and roast the turkey at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for approximately 20 to 25 minutes for each 1 lb. (450 g) of turkey or just until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the turkey has reached 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

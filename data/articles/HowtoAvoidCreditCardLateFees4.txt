 If you risk making late payments, you can at least minimize the fee by keeping a low balance on your credit card. Credit card late fees are often linked to the amount of your outstanding balance. If you have a higher balance, you will owe a higher late. With a lower balance, your late fee will be minimized., If you miss a payment, get yourself back on track as soon as possible. You may have a slight grace period that allows you to avoid a late fee. Get your payment in to the company right away., If you see that a late fee has been assessed to your monthly statement, call the customer service number right away. Ask to speak with someone about the fee. If you have a good history of paying on time, you may be able to have them waive the late fee. Be polite and respectful, acknowledge that you made a mistake, and ask to have the fee waived.Introduce yourself and ask, “I am calling about a late fee on last month’s credit card statement. I realize that I missed the due date by a bit. However, I have a long record of paying on time, and I was hoping you might be able to waive the fee this one time.”

, If the first clerk is not able to help you, ask to speak with a supervisor or manager. Someone higher up the chain might have more authority to help you. Especially if you have a good record as a customer, a supervisor should try to keep your business.You may want to hint that you are willing to leave the company if they refuse to help you out. You can say, “I have been a good customer for years, and I hope I don’t need to switch to another credit card company.”

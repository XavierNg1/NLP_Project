 Don't accept requests from random Jammers and don't send friend requests to someone you haven't seen out of desperation. If the new friend seems nice and supportive, add them. If the friend seems mean or you don't seem to hit it off, say "It was nice talking to you. Goodbye!" and leave. Don't buddy them because you really want buddies.
 These are slightly busy, but nice and empty, too. This way you don't get bombarded with requests and random Jammers. Avoid Aldan, because this server is packed with Jammers and you will not have room on your list.
 Just do nice acts of kindness and stay humble about them. If someone was scammed, gift them something to help them. If someone is sad, try to see what's wrong and comfort them. If someone is being inappropriate, encourage Jammers to block and report. If someone makes a mean or offensive den or outfit, encourage Jammers to block and report.
 No one wants to buddy a rude Jammer and neither do you! Instead, block and report rude Jammers instead of trying to yell at them or blast mean words back at them.

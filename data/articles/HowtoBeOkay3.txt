 Find an opportunity to be alone, where you can cry and let your feelings loose. Let yourself punch the couch cushions and scream into pillows. Call a friend to vent if you need to.
 Focus on your surroundings, take deep breaths, and try counting in your head. (Try counting by sixes, sevens, etc. if regular counting is too simple.)

, Don't worry about anything beyond that. What are you going to do? Choose something reasonable. When you have planned a designated time to work, and a designated time to relax, you can feel less anxious. Here are some example plans.


Spend the next half hour on drawing pictures and relaxing. Then do a half hour of the lab report.
Draft one body paragraph of the essay. Then take a long, relaxing bath.
Write a draft of what you want to say to your boss. Then stop thinking about the conversation and play with your cats.
 Indulge in a favorite hobby, invite a loved one to see a movie with you, or go get some frozen yogurt. Recognize that relaxation is part of being prepared and successful.
 Emotional support can help you overcome your struggles, or at least make things a little easier. Don't be afraid to ask for help or companionship. You deserve it.

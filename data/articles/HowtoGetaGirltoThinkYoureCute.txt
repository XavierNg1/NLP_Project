 Girls really like guys that are funny. When you tell a joke and everyone laughs take a quick glance to see if she is giggling.;
, Remember, you have to take the first step forward.
, If she was not sure she liked you, she will just get scared of you and will try to avoid you.
 Don't push her or say bad words in front of her, girls really don't like that.
 Instead of just making her jealous, you will make her dislike you.
 Groom yourself. Girls hate guys that smell, especially when it comes to bad breath or bad body odour.
 Sometimes being a little weird, or strange is a GOOD thing. Try saying something random, humorous, and out of nowhere.
 But there IS A LINE between "cute weird" and "oh my God what's wrong with him weird".
 They are cute and funny so use this to your advantage. But be careful, if the girl is in a bad mood or doesn't like being touched don't do it.
 However, be sure that the girl you are talking to doesn't know the girl you are trying to impress, otherwise things could go wrong.
 this is probably the most important thing, for if a girl OR boy does not like you for who you are, they're not worth your time.

 A lot of sugar in your diet comes from sweets – ice cream, cakes, pies, candy, soda, juice, sports drinks, and sweetened coffee or tea. Stay away from anything that tastes overly sweet, that contains honey or molasses, or that lists sugar in the ingredients. This can be a big challenge for people. Exchange your current dessert option for a lower-sugar fruit, or start by decreasing your portions of sweets.;
, Sugar is also found in less obvious places like fruit and dairy.Avoid milk sugars by replacing cow’s milk with unsweetened soy or almond milk.
 A healthy diet should include fresh fruits, so don’t fully avoid eating fruit. Choose fruits that are lower in fructose (fruit sugar) than others, such as blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, and citrus. Stay away from fruit juice and dried fruit.
 Stop drinking alcohol altogether or drink it only in very small amounts, such as one serving (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, or 1.5 oz. of liquor) a week. Alcohol contains a lot of sugar.If you’ve been drinking and feel like you need help to quit, talk to your doctor.


Drink unsweetened tea or water flavored with citrus instead.

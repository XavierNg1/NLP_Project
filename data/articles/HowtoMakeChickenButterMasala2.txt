 Add only the chicken pieces––don't add the spice mixture just yet. Fry until the skin of the chicken becomes golden brown, in the same manner that you see for chicken tikka. Cook on medium-high heat for 10 minutes by turning over the side. Then cook slowly for another 10 minutes until the chicken is done.

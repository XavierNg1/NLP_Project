 Doilies are crocheted cotton put into round patterns with a lot of open space--just like spiderwebs.If it's possible to be picky, choose ones that look more web-like but don't fuss too much.


You can find doilies among old belongings, at your local thrift store, and at your local arts and crafts store.
Wash and dry the doilies if they are used or old.
 Lay the doilies flat and spray with the black paint, passing over several times for complete color. Allow to dry, then repeat on the other side. Hang to dry when complete.Choose a spot with open ventilation and cover the work surface with cardboard or newspaper to prevent staining the surface underneath.



Space the doilies at an acceptable distance from each other to give the impression of different spiders weaving their webs. Tack in place with black thread or hot glue. Apply as many as will fit nicely.
 Tie one end of black embroidery thread to the back of one doily. Thread this on the curtain from one web to the next. Don't overdo this--just a few strands here and there will give the effect of loose webs.
 Use some of the embroidery thread to hold the curtain in place as if spiders have tied up the curtain while they were weaving. Hang over a good light source, like a window or anyplace like a skylight or a screen with a light behind it.

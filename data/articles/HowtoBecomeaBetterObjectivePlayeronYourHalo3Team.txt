 Learn to utilize the Mauler CORRECTLY. If you can figure out the MAXIMUM distance you can shoot the Mauler and it still causes a good amount of damage to the opponent you can do your job correctly. The Mauler has the same lunge distance as "punching" with the Gravity Hammer. The infamous Mauler Beatdown combo is your greatest asset when rushing the flag, hill or ball. When playing against people that know how I play when they find the Mauler they waste all of its ammo. When you grab the Mauler you should scare your opponents into doing the same thing.;
, If you don't know how to check the scoreboard hit select. When you do this a literal scoreboard will appear showing who is left standing who is down and how many points each team and individual has. When playing objective based game two or more enemies down = go for the main objective. two or more allies down = drop back into a safe area and don't rush the objective unless two or more of the opponents are down as well.
 This does not mean pick it up and charge. This means pick up and drop the flag then immediately do it again. You get a speed boost for this and it confuses the opposing team if your team can successfully pass the flag between each other. You can run with the oddball to get into safe areas but you will NOT gain time.
 You will get into close battles so Rockets and Snipers are rendered useless. The Plasma Pistol only works for supports because they should be in hiding while still hitting the opponents. The only weapons an Objective player should carry is the Mauler, BR, and as a LAST RESORT the carbine.

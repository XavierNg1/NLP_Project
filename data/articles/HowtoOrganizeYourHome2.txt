 Go through all of your keep items and decide what their primary function is. Like items should be grouped together so that you can decide how best to store them. They may be able to nest inside each other or otherwise be stored together efficiently. If they donâ€™t really have a function, you may want to consider putting them in the donate pile.
 Once your items are sorted by function, separate and organize them by what room is appropriate for them to go in. Think about their function and locate them where they can be efficiently reached and used. Though items may share a similar function, they may need to be split up if one serves its purpose better elsewhere.


For example, kitchen supplies should be kept in the area of the kitchen where they can be easily accessed when necessary. Items which are not used often can be stored up and out of the way, like infrequently used appliances (such as ice cream makers) or fancy or overly large dishes.
 Consider items which serve multiple purposes and find a place to store them where both can be served without hindering the other. In some cases, you have multiples of that item, you can split them up between locations but this may not always be possible.


An example of such an item may be small towels, which may be necessary to both the bathroom and the kitchen.

 Share the information with your disorganized boss and any key team members to ensure that everyone understands what is expected of the team and individual players.
 Ask your boss if you can discuss the week's priorities on a regular basis. By having a consistent time every week that you enforce, your boss will begin to conform to a schedule. Choose a good meeting date that works for both of you. During the meeting, create weekly goals and confirm task assignments. Review your mutual accomplishments a week later.
 If you need a meeting or some information from your boss, give them plenty of time to respond. If you do not receive a response in a timely fashion, a gentle reminder will help motivate an answer. By giving them plenty of time, you will increase your chances of a response. , Just as you should communicate with your boss, you should be working with your coworkers as well. Understand what issues they have in the workplace and come up with management solutions that work for the whole office.


You can use “I” and “we” statements here too. Try asking, “I have noticed that our files are disorganized. I was wondering if you had similar problems. What can we do to fix this?”
Include your boss in the conversation. Otherwise, it may seem as though you are plotting behind his or her back.
 By taking initiative around the office, you are positioning yourself as a valuable team member and leader. This can boost your chances of promotion. Furthermore, it will remove the burden from your boss, giving them more time to focus on planning and productivity.


Your boss is probably under extreme pressure as well. Be understanding of your boss' stress as you volunteer to help manage tasks.

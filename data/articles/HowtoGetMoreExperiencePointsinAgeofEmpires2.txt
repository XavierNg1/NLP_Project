 Trade routes are predetermined paths in the AoE3 game world with designated sites where the player can build Trading Posts to gather XP.


Move your explorer around in the unexplored areas of the map by left-clicking him and then right-clicking the area where you want him to go.
Keep doing this until you find a trade route. Trade routes have the unmistakable appearance of windy gravel paths on the landscape.
 Once you find a trade route, have your explorer follow it till you see what looks like an unfinished building foundation next to the path. That is the site on which any player may construct a trading post.
 First, make sure you have the required resources for constructing a trade post, which is 250 Wood. You can gather wood by commanding your villagers to chop down trees in the game world.


Select your explorer by left-clicking him. The explorerâ€™s command panel will appear on the bottom left corner of the screen. The second button of the build row of the panel is the Trade Post button. Click it.
Move the mouse over the trading post site and left-click to place the foundation. Your explorer will immediately start constructing the trading post.
Different trading posts earn different amounts of XP, depending on factors like which map the user is playing in and the length of the trade route.
Each time the trade cart passes next to the trading post, the amount of XP earned will flash above the trading post.

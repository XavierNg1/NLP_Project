 Figuring out your pet's needs is the first step to finding the right veterinarian. In addition to finding a vet that has experience treating your type of pet, you also need a vet that has experience treating any of the conditions or illnesses that your pet has and a vet and office staff that show proper concern and care for your pet.In most cases, unless your pet has a rare condition, most vets that are properly trained will be able to treat the common ailments of animals that they are experienced treating.
Along with your animal's needs, you need to consider your needs as well. This can include the veterinary practice's location, the hours of operation, and the cost of services, among other considerations.
 This list should be of veterinarians who are experienced in treating your kind of pet and experienced in treating any conditions or illnesses your pet has. To get this information you may need to look at the websites of veterinary offices in your area or even call the veterinary offices and ask them some questions about their practice and experience.


To find veterinarians in your area you can do an internet search. Look at the websites of the veterinary offices, as well as any online reviews of the practices.
In addition, you can ask friends and family about their veterinarian or if they have heard of any great veterinarians in their area.
Make sure the veterinarians on your list were all trained at accredited veterinary schools and that they are registered to practice veterinary medicine in your state., Contact the veterinary office that you most interested in and ask whether they are accepting new clients. If they are, make an appointment to get your pet a general checkup or make an appointment to simply meet the veterinarian and to discuss the practice. This appointment is a good time to get a sense of whether you like the office staff and the veterinarian in general and whether they can fulfill your needs.Have a conversation with the veterinarian that includes any questions you have about their expertise, their treatment philosophy, and whether they are comfortable giving your pet care.
Getting a general checkup also allows you to get a sense of the general costs for services at that particular practice.

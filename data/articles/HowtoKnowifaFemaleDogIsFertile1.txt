 When the dog is reaching her fertile phase, known as estrus or heat, her vulva will begin to swell. This can be seen on the outside of her body if you look at the area directly below her anus.The vulva will be puffy and will appear red in color. By the time she is in full heat, the vulva will swell to about three times its normal size.;
, Along with the vulva swelling, she will also have bloody discharge coming out of her vagina.This discharge begins before the dog is fertile and lasts until after she has ovulated and is no longer fertile.


Vaginal bleeding usually starts a week or so before the dog actually ovulates.
Sometimes it is hard to spot the vaginal bleeding because the dog cleans herself quickly and does not allow it to become evident. In cases such as this, you should look for increased licking.
 During her fertile period, a female dog may urinate more than usual. This is a sign that her hormone levels are changing and that she may be ready to mate.The urine passed by a female dog in heat contains pheromones that signals to male dogs that she is in heat.
 There are tests that can be used to identify when a female dog is fertile and ready to mate. These can be done by veterinarians at their veterinary practices.One test is a vaginal cytology test. This is a non-invasive vaginal smear test that examines vaginal cells to look for changes associated with ovulation. To assess when your dog is fertile it may take several tries.
The other test is a serum progesterone test. This is a blood test that looks at progesterone levels. It is very accurate and popular but does require that your dog's blood be drawn.

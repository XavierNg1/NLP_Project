 A brand-new decent quality practice amp will run about 100 dollars. However, if you can find one used, or on sale at a local music shop, go for that.;
, Once you have your money amount decided upon, it is time to think of what you want to use it for.
 Generally these will have an 8-inch speaker inside, but a 10-inch speaker is preferable. These usually cost around 60 to 150 dollars.
 A combo amp is still preferable in this situation, and a 10-inch speaker can be enough, but 2x10-inch speakers or a 12-inch speaker would be optimal. These cost about 180 to 450 dollars.
 A half stack consists of a head and a cabinet. Or, for easier portability, you can buy a high powered combo with 200+ watts of power which will help with transportation and setup. When purchasing the two, make sure of the impedance (ohms) of the cabinet, and the power rating for the head at that impedance. Make sure the cabs RMS rating is about the same as the head's power output at the impedance of the cab. A head can be solid-state or tube, the tube option tends to be less durable, but sounds better and is more expensive. A good solid-state head costs 200 to 600 dollars and a good tube head costs 500 to 1400 dollars. But don't think that you absolutely need to spend all your money, there are many good amps in smaller privately owned stores that may be used but pack a lot of punch for a much lower price. A cab in a half stack should be a 1x15, a 2x15, a 4x10 or a 6x10. For big, booming bass go with a 115 or a 215, if you want for a tighter, punchier sound, opt for a 210, 410, 610, or an 810. 115's and 215's are generally going to give you a very deep, solid rumble that you hear as much as feel. With the 210s and up, you'll get a lighter, punchier sound, but you won't get that unbeatable deep rumbling you get from a 115. If you have the option, spring for a head or combo with a speaker extension jack, if you have a 210 and up, connect a 115 or 215. If you have a 115 or 215, connect a 210 and up for better range of sound. If you have a more complex amp with a crossover feature, you can send the lows to the 15's and the mids and highs to the 10's.


But before you do anything, if you can buy a Combo with a 115 with an extensive EQ and anyone with a bit of knowledge can almost perfectly match the sound of a 410 or 610.

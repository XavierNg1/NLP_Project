 To ensure that the decal paper adheres to the vase, the surface must be clean. Use rubbing alcohol on paper towel or a rag to wipe down the vase and remove any dirt and grime.


Decal paper adheres to most surfaces, so you can use a glass, plastic, or ceramic vase.
 Do an image search to find leaf images that fit the design that you’re trying to create, and save them on your computer.You may need to resize the images, so it helps to have basic photo editing software.
 When you’ve found the leaf images that you want to use, place some decal paper in your printer. Print the images out on the paper, so they’re ready for the vase.You can usually find decal paper at craft stores, office supply stores, and online retailers.
If you’re not sure how to use the decal paper in your printer, consult the instructions on the packaging.
 Once you’ve printed out the leaf images on the decal paper, use a pair of scissors to cut them out. Be as precise as possible as you cut to keep the leaf shapes as sharp as possible., After you’ve cut out the leaves, place the images in a large bowl of cold water. Allow them to soak for 30 seconds and remove from the water. That will help loosen the images from the backing paper so they’re ready to adhere to the vase.It’s best to soak just one or two images at time, so they don’t wind up soaking in the water for too long.
 After you take the leaf images out of the water, gently peel away the paper backing. Place the images on the vase in whatever arrangement you prefer.Use your fingers to smooth out any air bubbles or wrinkles in the leaves. If the paper is starting to dry, run a damp rag over them to smooth  them into place.
 Once you’ve added all of the leaves that you want to the vase, allow it to dry completely, which should take one to two hours. When the vase is dry, you can add ribbon and other embellishments or just set some flowers inside.If you want the vase to dry more quickly, you can use a hair dryer.

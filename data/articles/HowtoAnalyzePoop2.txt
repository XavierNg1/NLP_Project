 The ideal flavor is medium brown, but some variation can be found among healthy people.


Green or yellow stool is usually caused by your bowels moving too fast, as with mild diarrhea. Bile, the main pigment in poop, starts out green and turns brown over time.
Pale gray or yellow feces may indicate liver disease., Take note of any stool that is red or pitch black in color.


Bright red indicates bleeding late in the digestive tract, likely the large intestine or anus. This type of bleeding typically indicates non-serious health issues, such as minor inflammation or hemorrhoids. It can also rarely be a sign of cancer. Talk to your doctor if it happens multiple times or if your bowel movements become painful.
Bleeding higher up in the digestive system, such as from the stomach or small intestine, produces feces that are extremely dark red or black in color. It will also have a sticky, tar-like consistency. If you pass this type of stool, talk to your doctor. It could be a sign of a variety of serious problems ranging from peptic ulcers to bowel cancer.Eating beets can also stain your poop red. However, beet red is fairly easy to distinguish from blood red. If the red has a magenta or fuchsia tinge, it is almost certainly from beets or food coloring, not blood., Almost all transient causes of changes to stool color can be traced back to food coloring. Even if you don't remember eating a food with a particular color, dyes may be hidden or masked by other colors more easily broken down. Food coloring may also interact with other pigments in the digestive tract to produce unexpected results.

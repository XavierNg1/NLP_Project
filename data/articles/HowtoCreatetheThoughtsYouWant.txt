 You should be conscious of your thoughts. Every moment one thought or other will pass through your brain. Don’t try to control them in this phase as that may lead to stress. Just be conscious;
, Whenever you become conscious of a negative thought passing through your brain, just pause that thought. You can even visualize as if there is a ‘pause’ button somewhere near to your right ear and just press that button and pause the thought!

, Replay that thought in your mind. Suppose the thought was ‘I don’t think I will win this contract,’ just replay that thought again in your brain. Here also you can visualize a ‘Play ‘ button next to the ‘pause’ button!

, While the thought is ‘paused,’ ask yourself, ‘Is this what I want?’ You will get an answer from your brain ‘NO.’

, Ask yourself, ‘what is it that I want?’ Then the brain will say, ‘In fact I want the contract to be won.’

, Reframe the need statement in the present tense as mind operates in the present. You can reframe this as “I am winning the contract, come what may,”

, Now you press the ‘Play’ button and hear the sound “I am winning the contract, come what may.” Replay this statement again and again and again. While you are driving to the client’s office to sign that contract, let this statement be played continuously in your brain.

 If he/she has a cut, bandage it with toilet paper. If he/she broke his/her arm, make him/her a cast. If he/she just bruised himself/herself, put a bandage on it. If the bear has a virus or you can't work it out, give rest or visit the hospital.;
, Make sure to give him/her lots of blankets so he/she doesn't get cold!

, You can do so by putting some water in a small cup. Every hour or two, give him/her about 2-3 small spoonfuls of medicine.
 Either put on some nice music, tell him/her to take a nap, or put on a nice movie for him/her to watch.
 Love will help him/her get better faster.


Make sure he/she spends at least one day resting. The next day, you can put him/her in his/her play area. He/she should have the casts on for at least 3 or 4 days. On the third day or so, you can take him/her outside for some fresh air, but don't keep him/her out to long or he/she won't get better!

, Take some white paper and write your teddy's name on it! Then use some clear tape to attach it to your bear. This wristband will be so the doctors can identify your teddy.
 Get an old shoe box—or any kind of old box that your teddy fits in—line it with soft felt or cloth and make a pillow out of an old shirt. Or you could let your teddy use your bed! Also, put down some tissues and a book to read for your teddy so he or she won't get bored.
 Give your teddy an X-ray to see if he or she has any broken bones, and check his or her eyes and ears to make sure they're healthy! And don't forget to check his or her tonsils!

, Put together water, sugar, pepper, salt and maybe some juice to make some medicine for your teddy. This will make him or her feel better! Remember to give it one tablespoon a day!

, This is only for broken bones! To do this, take some colored pre-wrap and wrap it around the arm or the leg, depending on what bone is broken. Then, get some clear or white tape and tape it together so it won't unwrap itself when you play with it. After about 6 days—the teddy bear equivalent of 6 weeks—take the cast off. The teddy will be all healed and ready to play again.
 Yay! Send him or her back home with some lollipops and a small book.[[Image:Care for a Sick Teddy Bear Step 6.jpg

 Place the blade of a sharp knife or vegetable peeler at the top of on sweet potato and drag it down the length of the potato peeler, applying just enough even pressure to remove the skin. Continue peeling off strips of skin until the entire potato is skinless. Repeat with the other two potatoes.

, Do not cut off much; a small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (1/2 to 1 1/4-centimeter) slice on both ends of a potato should suffice. Doing so will prevent your fries from having small, pointy tips, which is important because these little pointed tips tend to burn quickly and taste bad.
 Use a sharp knife to cut each sweet potato into two equal halves, cutting from the top tip to the bottom, leaving you with six halves.
 Use a sharp knife to cut each half in half crosswise, cutting from side to side instead of from top to bottom.
 Each wedge should ideally be around 1/4-inch (1/2-centimeter) thick and 1/4-inch (1/2-centimeter) wide, but the length of the wedges can vary depending on personal preference. Wedges between 3 and 4 inches (7 1/2 to 10 centimeters) in length are usually a pretty good size. Regardless of what you choose, however, try to keep the majority of your wedges uniform in size.









Note that you can also use a crinkle cut knife to produce crinkle cut sweet potato fries. Similarly, you can use a knife or mandolin to cut the sweet potatoes into disks.

 Every school has its own set of rules that help students stay safe and learn well. You may need a hall pass to use the bathroom during class, for example. Learning the rules of the school will help you adjust and will keep you out of trouble.
 When you are starting a new school, you should follow your teachers' instructions very closely. You don’t need to be a brown-noser, but making a good impression with your teachers will go a long way to making a positive adjustment to a new school.
 Keeping up with your homework and making a solid effort to do well in school will help with your adjustment. You are already under enough stress with adjusting to a new school that you don’t want to add more stress with poor grades.
 When you move to a new school, your education so far is assessed and you are placed in your grade. Almost all of the time, this will mean that you are placed in the grade you are expecting (for example, if you left your old school in 4th grade and you’re moving over the summer, you’ll start in 5th grade).If you are in high school, meet with a school counselor to make sure you are on track with prerequisites and graduation requirements.
 When you are adjusting to a new school, you might feel lonely or shy. But every day, there are good things that happen, even if they are minor. Telling your parents about these things can help you realize that you are getting used to your school.


Examples include: getting a good score on a test, saying hello to someone new, scoring a goal in PE, and so on.

Not everyone agrees with using dairy or other plant milk to make coconut milk from; decide for yourself what you prefer. Water is just fine, as is using a plant milk.
 Stir frequently. Do not allow to boil.
 Pour the liquid into a bowl.
 Twist out as much additional liquid as possible into the strained liquid in the bowl before discarding the coconut. Let the mixture cool before squeezing the cheesecloth so you don't scald your hands.
 Use the coconut milk in your recipe as required or as part of a drink.

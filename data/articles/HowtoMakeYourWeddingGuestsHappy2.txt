 If your wedding is outside, you might need to offer objects, apparel, or accommodations that acknowledge the specific venue in which you’re being wed. Think about the environment your wedding will be in and plan accordingly to keep your guests happy.For instance, if you’re getting married on the beach, you should provide your guests with a pair of flip-flops or sandals so they don’t get sand in their fancy shoes.
If your wedding is at a mountain lodge during the winter, you should provide guests with blankets as they make their way into the wedding hall.
 The wedding ceremony itself should be short and sweet. Nobody wants to sit stiffly in uncomfortable seats or benches for longer than necessary. The fun part of the wedding is the reception, so a short wedding ceremony means more time for the fun part.Keep the ceremony under 45 minutes from start to finish.
 The one thing that is guaranteed to make your wedding guests happy is to be happy yourself. Relax, enjoy your wedding, and smile. Think about the many happy years of love and marriage you have ahead of you.Let your guests know you are happy. Say to each guest, “I am so happy that you came. It’s great to see you.”
Find positive ways of dealing with stress. If you’re worried about something going wrong on your wedding day, push the thought away when it emerges in your mind with an opposite thought. For instance, if you think, “The cake will not arrive in time,” recognize the thought and challenge it with a though like, “Everything will proceed as I have planned.” Positive thoughts will help you worry less and feel happier.
Even if something goes wrong – like you trip on your way down the aisle – just laugh it off. Contextualize all the minor inconveniences against the joy and happiness of your wonderful marriage.

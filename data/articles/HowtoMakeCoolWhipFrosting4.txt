 The addition of butter to the cream cheese is a key part of what makes this frosting so rich.









Using a hand mixer and a large bowl or a standing mixer, whip the softened cream cheese and butter at medium speed until well combined.
 The additional powdered sugar in this recipe is the other key component to its richness.









Add the vanilla and then the powdered sugar--one cup at a time--and mix at medium speed until well combined.
 Gently combine the whipped topping with the existing mixture to round out the frosting.









Using a low-medium speed, add the whipped topping.
Mix until light and fluffy.
 You can use this frosting to top a range of cakes and desserts, from angel food cake to cupcakes to sheet cakes.


With a spatula, begin spreading the frosting over your desired dessert, several tablespoons at a time.
After you’ve covered the surface of the dessert, use the spatula to smooth out the frosting and ensure that it’s evenly distributed.
You can run a butter knife or spatula over the spread frosting to create a wave-like design if you like.
Alternatively, you can spoon the frosting into a pastry bag (or a plastic storage bag with a small hole cut in one of the corners) equipped with a frosting tip, then squeeze frosting onto the dessert.

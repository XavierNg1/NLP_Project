 It should not be surprising that it contains many internal variations, as it did not go through a systematic compilation all at once. The process which created the Bible involved many different cultures, and therefore many different motivations. If you can accept this, it will enrich your study by giving you the power to see the beauty of the evolution of ideas.;
, Talk with others about what you are reading, look at good biblical commentaries and pray often.
 Remember that, with diligence, you can resolve these conflicts by comparing the Bible with other texts from the same time period. For this reason, it is OK to start with any translation. The NIV is the most understandable version, but the King James version is the most accurate. The NKJV is a good compromise, accurate and understandable. If it is the truth you seek, your journey will never end.
 All the stories we have of Jesus were written by humans, who can make errors. So we must not accept any one text as authoritative. The only safety is found in a process of comparing and contrasting between the many available sources found within and outside of the Bible.
,, All scripture either points to the cross or refers back to it.
 Expect God to reveal Himself, answer your questions, and change your life for the better.
 So be patient with yourself and work toward consistency. Five minutes per day is much better than an hour once a month. A simple decision, followed by daily determination, is necessary.
 Routine is very important. Treat it like an appointment that you cannot miss. Scheduling your study time first thing and then everything else around it is always best.
 Surprise!

, Disappointment may follow. Don't worry. Just pick up where you left off and stay in the flow. Regularity will develop over time. Always have grace with yourself in how much, or how often, you read the Bible. Don't be legalistic about it. Do it because you want to, not because you feel that you have to.

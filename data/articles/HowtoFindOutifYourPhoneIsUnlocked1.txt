 Doing so will give you an idea of what most people have experienced in this area. You can also use your phone's model number (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S6" instead of just "Samsung Galaxy") to narrow the search results.

With very few exceptions, Android phones are unlocked by default.;
, If you open an iPhone's Settings, tap Cellular (or Mobile Data) near the top of the menu, tap Cellular Data Options (or Mobile Data Options) near the top of the page, and see an option entitled "Cellular Data Network" (or "Mobile Data Network") on the page, your iPhone is likely unlocked.

A "Carrier" option just below the "Cellular" section in the Settings menu is also indicative of an unlocked iPhone.
 Some carriers provide a service on their website to determine whether or not your phone is unlocked. You can view your phone's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number like so:


iPhone - Open Settings, tap General, tap About, and find the "IMEI" section. The fifteen-digit number listed here is your phone's IMEI number.

Android - Open Settings, scroll down and tap About device, tap Status, and find the "IMEI" section. The fifteen-digit number listed here is your phone's IMEI number.

Most phones - Type *#060# into your phone's Phone app to display your phone's IMEI number. This won't work on Verizon phones.
 If you can't figure out whether or not your phone is unlocked from researching or using an IMEI number-checking service, just call your carrier and provide them with your account details. They'll be able to tell you if your phone is unlocked and, if it isn't, if it qualifies for unlocking.

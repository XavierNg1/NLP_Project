 Most of the time, you may be much harder on yourself than you would be on others or vice versa. Think about how a dear friend or family member would see your situation.Ask yourself whether you can look at your circumstances differently. For example, you encounter a setback while applying to college that makes you question your worthiness. How would your best friend or mother view the situation? They would likely tell you to keep pushing and not beat yourself up.;
, The words you use to describe yourself have the power to tank your self-confidence. Plus, absolute terms are often very unrealistic. Remove absolute terms from your vocabulary and notice how your feelings of self-doubt start to change.Skip words like “always,” “never,” “no one,” or “should.” These terms are rigid and unrealistic, only adding to your sense of insecurity.
 When you lack self-confidence, you can trick your brain into thinking you feel empowered by repeating a mantra. Certain words or phrases have the capacity to shift your thinking and help you believe in your abilities.For instance, you might say, “You are worthy” or “You are doing great.” Repeat these aloud for maximum impact.
 Cultivating gratitude is another way to shift your thinking in a positive direction. If you are insecure, you may focus primarily on what’s going wrong. The very nature of gratitude is the opposite—to focus on what’s right in your life. Spend some time each day in gratitude.Start a gratitude journal or log. Add two to three things that you appreciate about your day to the journal.

 You must be somewhere where no one can easily kill you, but not so far away that you can't see your target.;
, This always helps when you can't see him very clearly.
 Measure how tall your enemy is. If he is half a peg, then aim up about 2 pegs, if he is a peg high, aim up about 0.8 pegs (0.897532424 pegs, to be exact).
 If it hits but doesn't kill him, shoot again.
 This will help you get more points.

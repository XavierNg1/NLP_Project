 Use gallon or quart (liter) glass jars, canning jars, or recycled condiment jars with tight lids to store your herbs.
 Write labels on your herb jars, including the name of the herb and the date you purchased it. Herbs can often be difficult to identify by appearance alone.
 Pantries or closets with no light and little moisture will preserve your herbs the longest.

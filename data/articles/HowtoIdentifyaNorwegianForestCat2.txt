They love being near their humans, whether they choose your lap or nearby furniture. They have been known to follow their owners around the home.These cats are also very good with other pets and children due to their mild temperament.
 This breed is descended from a line of hunting felines, and they still have this instinct. They will chase and stalk toys like they are prey. If presented with their favorite toys, this generally mild breed becomes much more excitable.They are obsessed with their toys. They particularly seem to like lights, like laser pointers.
The breed is also very nurturing and territorial. You may find that they patrol your home throughout the day to make sure everything is okay.
 Wegies have a moderate activity level. They nap a lot with small bursts of activity through the day. When they are active, they love to climb high. When theyâ€™re napping, they love to sleep on high platforms. Because this breed is strong and agile, they are excellent climbers.This cat will scale the tallest cat tree and cat shelves. They also love looking outside, so expect them to perch near a windowsill.

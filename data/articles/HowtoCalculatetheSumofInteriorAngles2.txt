 The polygon can have any number of sides and can be regular or irregular.

For example, you might want to find the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon, so you would draw a six-sided shape.
 Label this vertex A.

A vertex is a point where two sides of a polygon meet.
 The lines should not cross. You should create a number of triangles.

You do not have to draw lines to the adjacent vertices, since they are already connected by a side.

For example, for a hexagon you should draw three lines, dividing the shape into 4 triangles.
 Since there are 180 degrees in a triangle, by multiplying the number of triangles in your polygon by 180, you can find the sum of the interior angles of your polygon.

For example, since you divided your hexagon into 4 triangles, you would calculate 4Ã—180=720{\displaystyle 4\times 180=720} to find a total of 720 degrees in the interior of your polygon.

 Keep an eye on your hands for any cards you might want to hold. Remember, you won't be using this card immediately, you will be storing it for use later on.


Be patient and wait for the best card to come to you.
Only select a card that is in a poor hand.
Play any good hands normally.;
, Take your whole hand under the table and leave the card you want to hide hidden somewhere on you. Bring your hand back up to the table and fold.


The easiest place to hide the card is under your leg.
Drop the card out of your hand and onto your lap.
Pretend to drop something on the floor.
Pick it up, but leave your card hidden somewhere.
The best hiding places are ones that allow for easy and quick access.
Move smoothly and quickly.
 Get rid of your poor hand after you have hidden your card. Try to remain calm and collected as you drop this hand.


Keep your cards close together when you fold.
Spreading your cards out makes them easy to count and can get you caught.
 Always keep in mind which card you have under your leg. Remember that the next hand could be the best time to play it or switch it for another.


Wait for the right moment to make your next move.
Consider if your new hand is the best time to play your hidden card.
Don't be in a rush to use your card.
 Take action when a better card or hand comes your way. Playing your hidden card or switching it for another will require you to make another cheating move.


Try acting confused as to what to do during your play.
Bring your hand down to your leg or wherever you have the card.
Pick up the card and add it to your hand, or, switch it for another.
 If you haven't yet made use of your hidden card, you will have to get rid of it. Removing the card from your hand at the end of the game or when you are done cheating is a great way to remove evidence.


Use the same tactics as before to add the card to your hand again.
Fold or play to get rid of your extra card.
Do not get caught with an extra or hidden card after a game!

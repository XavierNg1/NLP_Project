 Antidepressants are usually prescribed by your doctor or psychiatrist for atypical depression. SSRIs are one common type of antidepressants with fewer side effects. SSRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin available on the brain. Examples of SSRIs include Prozac, Celexa, Lexapro, Paxil, and Zoloft. Your dosage will depend on the prescription given by your doctor or psychiatrist.
 Another antidepressant group is SNRIs, which work by increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine available in the brain. This group includes medications such as Effexor XR, Cymbalta, and Pristiq.NDRI is another option. It affects the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. It includes a medication called Wellbutrin.You can also take atypical antidepressants, named so because they does not fit neatly into other categories of antidepressants. This category of antidepressants include Remeron and Viibryd., The oldest group of antidepressants is MAOIs, which have been proven effective to treat atypical depression. They also help related symptoms, such as anxiety and panic. Medications in this group include Parnate and Nardil.


Though MAOIs are very effective, they are not used as much as the newer type of antidepressant such as SSRIs. They are generally used as a last resort if other treatments don't work due in part to serious side effects.MAOIs require the user to follow a strict diet, as they can have dangerous (or even deadly) interactions with certain foods and other medications, like birth control pills, decongestants and certain herbal supplements.

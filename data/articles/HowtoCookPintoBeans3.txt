 Alternatively, cook the pinto beans using a pressure cooker (in which case, it should only take a half hour); follow the bean instructions accompanying your pressure cooker.
 Some people use the cooking liquid, others use fresh water or broth, it's up to you. Add small amounts of liquid––you can always increase the water but it's hard to drain drowned mashed beans!









Some shredded cheese can improve the taste if you like cheese.
 Add salt and better to taste while mashing.
 Or, simply eat as a side dish or spread on your bread or tortilla.

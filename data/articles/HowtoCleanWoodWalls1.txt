 Get a microfiber cloth or a linen cloth to the wipe the wood walls. Do not wet the cloth, as water can damage the wood walls. Follow the grain of the wood, wiping in a circular motion. Fold the cloth over as you wipe the walls down so it picks up any dust, dirt, or grime on the surface of the wood.If you are wiping down a large section of the wood walls, you may need to use more than one dry cloth.;
, If the wood walls are really coated in stubborn dirty or dust, use a small amount of lemon oil on the dry cloth. The lemon oil will help to catch any dirt or dust and will not damage the wood.Put one to two drops of lemon oil on a clean dry cloth. Then, gently wipe the walls down with the cloth to remove surface dirt or dust.
 If you have a vacuum cleaner with the dusting attachment, use it on the wood walls. Run the vacuum with the attachment over the walls to pick up any grime or dirt. Make sure the vacuum attachment does not have any sharp edges or sides that can scratch the wood.If you have a floor sweeper with a dusting pad instead of a vacuum, you can use it to clean the wood walls. Simply run the floor sweeper over the walls with a clean, dry dusting pad. Change the pad as needed to get all the dust or grime off the walls.

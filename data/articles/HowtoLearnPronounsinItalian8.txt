 In Italian, in contrast to English, there are no possessive pronouns. Instead, possessive adjectives are used with the modified noun dropped and "definite articles" are placed in front of them to convey the same meaning as English possessive pronouns. For example:



Di chi è questo libro? È il mio. (Whose is this book? It is mine.)

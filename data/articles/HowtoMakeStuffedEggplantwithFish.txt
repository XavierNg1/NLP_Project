 Take it off the heat and scoop out some of the inner portion of the eggplant, leaving a thin layer in the inside along with the outside skin.
 Take out the fish masala already cooked and put it inside the eggplant in a small portion. Mix the cheese, cornflour, pepper and parsley/coriander and put a layer of this mixture in the top.
, Fry the eggplants upside down for 2 minutes, in high flame in a pan, to give a nice crisp. Also, slightly fry the sides of the eggplants to give it a crisp. There is no need to add extra oil to fry the eggplant.

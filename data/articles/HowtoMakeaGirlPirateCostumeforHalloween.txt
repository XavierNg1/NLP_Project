 Here are the items you'll need to make your girl pirate costume:


Torn red shirt
Black leggings
Black cami
Black boots
Skull bracelet;
, Now that you've gotten your clothes, put on the black cami and leggings first. Add the torn red top and boots and place the skull bracelet on the hand you use most. You now have your "shiver me timber" clothes on!

, Or wear any other type of piercing. If you don't have one, you can superglue a small fake gem to your nose for the night.
 Here is what you'll need for your girl pirate costume:


Foundation
Red lipstick
Grey and black eyeshadow
Powder
Concealer
Black nail polish

, Now that you have your supplies, get started. Apply the foundation as you usually do, but use one that makes you glow. Then, add concealer to your trouble spots. (Don't worry, everyone has them.) Then, set it with powder.
 Just place gray eyeshadow on your inner lids and add black near the outside, toward your creases. This will create a smoky effect.
, This is a very pirate-like color and will match your outfit.
 For this all you need is your imagination. Just add whatever you feel is needed to look amazing, such as an eye patch if you want.

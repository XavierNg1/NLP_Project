 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an agency of the U.S. government that keeps and organizes government and historical records. Visit the genealogy section of the organization's website, which provides guidelines on how to start your search. The site also features a list of online resources for starting your search, including a list of the genealogical records that the NARA has online (e.g. Fugitive Slave Case Papers, 1850-1860).The NARA also overs a Powerpoint genealogy tutorial, available on their website.
 Based on your knowledge of your family history and information provided to you by relatives, determine what records you should be looking for first from the National Archives. Note that the NARA keeps only federal records, and that very few of these records pre-date the revolutionary War (1775â€“1783).The NARA records most pertinent to finding your ancestors are:Census Records
Military Records
Immigration Records (Ship Passenger Lists)
Naturalization Records
Land Records

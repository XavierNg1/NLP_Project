 Taking a few minutes to iron the hem flat before you sew can help to improve the look of your finished project and make sewing the hem easier. Fold over your hem fabric and iron it flat.You may also consider pressing your hem after you finish sewing it. This can be especially helpful if you accidentally stretch out a portion of the fabric and want to shrink it slightly.
 Interfacing is not required for hemming knit fabrics, but it can help to create a more structured hem. It can also help to ensure that your hem is straight by providing a guide for you to sew over.To use interfacing, get some interfacing tape in the size of your choice. For example, if you want a ½” (1.3 cm) hem, then you could get ½” (1.3 cm) interfacing tape.
Then, cut he interfacing to the length needed for your hem and lay it down on the wrong side of the fabric so that it is about ¼” (0.6 cm) from the raw edge.
Fold the fabric and interfacing tape over.
Sew just along the edge of the interfacing tape to create the hem.
 Pins are essential for most sewing projects, and sewing with jersey is no exception. However, regular pins may poke holes in your fabric. To avoid this, you can use ballpoint pins. Pin your hem to hold it in place and to keep the edges even as you sew.Ballpoint pins have rounded tips instead of the pointed tips that regular pins have, so they go in between the stitches of knits rather than poking holes in them.
 As you sew your hem, be careful not to stretch it. Stretching the fabric may result in puckering or an uneven hem. Keep the fabric straight, but do not pull on it as you sew.To avoid unintentional pulling, hold the fabric in your lap or place it on the table as you sew. Do not allow it to hang off the table and touch the floor because this will cause the fabric to stretch.

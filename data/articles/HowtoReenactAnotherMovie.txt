 If you have a camera or are considering buying one, they usually come with video, also. MAKE SURE THE CAMERA RECORDS SOUND FOR YOUR VIDEO! Or, if you are wanted to buy a video camera, several stores such as Walmart carry them for $60 or less. If money's tight and you can't get any video recorded, forget the camera; you'll remember doing this with your friends!;
, Every good actor needs to know what they're acting! If you feel you're not up to the challenge of memorizing all those lines, watch the movie enough so you know the main idea of it-you don't HAVE to know it word for word.
 Watch it over and over again so you have it down by heart, even down to the little funny movements your favorite character makes.
 This step is optional. If you're not so sure about how good your acting skills are, get in front of a mirror and practice to yourself. (Just make sure that siblings and/or parents in the house know what you're doing, so they won't assume you've gone crazy.)

, Invite friends and family to join you. No movie is complete without a cast!

, You'll need a make-up artist to make them look like the character they're replacing; a camera-man (make sure they are very good at holding the camera still-that can immensely affect the quality of your video); and any other people you think necessary.
 Time to play dress up. Is your character Anakin from "Star Wars"? Make sure he's got blonde-ish hair, maybe a little braid to the side, a robe, etc.
 Another "Star Wars" example. If you're reenacting that movie, get fake light-sabers. Too expensive? Make your own!

, Start acting. Make yourself feel as if you ARE that person. Imagine if you were in their place. Work on facial expression. That is one of the most important parts of acting-especially on close-ups!

, Use Windows Movie Maker, or that one that came with your camera. Put all the mini videos together, and, VOILA! You have yourself a reenacted movie by you and your friends!

 Villagers are attracted to pumpkins, so put one down, then build a deep hole around it (as deep as you can). Then sit back and watch as the villagers fall to their doom!;
, Put a bunch of TNT around him and make it explode! The Iron Golem will die or at least take a lot of damage (so you can easily kill it with a sword), leaving you to kill the villagers in any way you can think of.
 Iron Golems like giving children flowers, so spawn an Iron Golem and a Villager Child, but before you do, make a deep 1x3 hole with lava in the bottom and put a pumpkin behind it. The child will be attracted to the pumpkin and run for it, making it fall in the hole. The Iron Golem will Chase it,and it too will fall.
 When it does, the Iron Golem will be too busy killing monsters to care about you. So sneak into the villagers' houses at night and kill them!

, If villagers are far from Iron Golems, those mobs don't attack you and you can kill a Villager without getting attacked.
 Remember cacti can't be placed next to other blocks(including itself) and cacti can only be placed on sand

, Remember, you can't spawn zombies in the daytime, so wait until night.

 Just as Batman has evolved since his debut in May of 1939, so has his costume. There are two prevalent images of Batman:



The Dark Knight: This is a darker version of Batman that began to appear after the Batman Begins movie. This portrayed Batman as more of a dark outcast in Gotham city, a vigilante who lives outside the law. Alfred Pennyworth said it best, in the movie The Dark Knight when he said, "Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman, he can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make. The right choice."

The World's Greatest Detective: This is the iconic comic-book version of Batman. This batman costume is more playful and colorful (with the bright yellow accents) and follows a more detective-style way of fighting crime. This costume best depicts a Batman character who is witty enough to yell "freeze!" to Arnold as Mr. Freeze.

 One program is RPG Maker VX. This program isn't free but you may wish to use the 2003 version - it's free. Some simple video games may also use coding, instead of point-and-click systems. A good basic coding is Python GUI which is free and open-source from their website.;
, Surely you have a rough idea about what this game is about? If not, think about your favourite games, what games sell or simply think about fantasy. Fantasy is always a good starting point for (ok) game makers/designers. Mainly due to the fact about 96.23% of games are indeed fantasy .
 Use Photoshop, Gimp or even Window's basic Paint tool.
 Have an introductory page where you name and edit your game character. The first map is usually plain and simple, don't go overboard on your first map.
 If you are more adept with game design then why not try your hand at scripting? This is however, harder to do and is really not advised to new designers. Also, you really should have a, well, a point... This makes a game a game. Maybe the point of a mini game is to kill the boss via doing a quest and then going to the boss.
 Don't forget the credits!

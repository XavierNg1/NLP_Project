, Gum paste will begin to harden if exposed to air. Keep unused portions in a sealable bag or air-tight container to retain moisture.
 After you take it from the container, the gum paste may be stiff. Knead it in your hands a few times to make it soft again.
 Dip 1 end of the toothpick into the food coloring. This covers the tip of the pick and allows you to apply little bits of color at a time.
 Wipe the toothpick against the paste, transferring the color. Roll the toothpick to get the coloring off all its sides.
 A pair of kitchen or latex gloves will prevent the color from staining your hands., Use your palms and fingers to work the color into the gum paste. Continue kneading until the color is uniform throughout. This will take some time to achieve a solid color.
 If the color is too dark, you can knead in more untinted gum paste to lighten the shade. Add more food coloring as needed to darken the color of the gum paste. Add color a little at a time to make sure you get the color you want. Since gum paste decorations are mainly intended to be looked at and not eaten, as much coloring as is desired for even the deepest colors can be used. Use a new toothpick each time you need to get more coloring from the jar.

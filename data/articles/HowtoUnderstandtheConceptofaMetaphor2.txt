 When writing your own stories, think about what comparisons you can make between characters and other nouns. Examine each character separately. What are her qualities? How can you link her to perhaps an inanimate object or another living being? For example, to talk about how popular a classmate is, you could say, "Jane is the rockstar of her high school." Or, if you wanted to express that someone has a kind heart but a prickly demeanor, you could say "Deshawn's a cupcake wrapped in a pineapple."


See Write a Metaphor for more tips.
You can use metaphors to express emotions, be original in your writing, or to demonstrate your command of a language.
 When comparing your life to another object, could you link it to one word? For example, maybe your life is a bit boring at present. Your life could be a peaceful lake. On the other hand, if you are experiencing turmoil, perhaps your life is a roller coaster.
 If you examine an artwork, see if you can express a metaphor. For example, "the flames are anger" or "the blues are peace." Try to connect the colors, symbols, and expressions to tangible moods or objects. Sometimes, a piece of art might be drawing a contrast.
 Metaphors are powerful when they can communicate surprise, delight, or some sort of unique meaning. Metaphors become "dead" when they have become so overused that they no longer pack a significant punch. For example, "hit the nail on the head" has become so frequently used that it no longer communicates the intensity of the comparison -- you may not even visualize a hammer and nail when you hear the phrase.

 Though a bit obvious, you need pitchers that can throw strikes consistently. That means staying in the strike zone, while still throwing pitches that batters have a hard time hitting., Most great pitchers have a variety of pitches to throw, from curve balls to change-ups. A variety of pitches will help keep the other team from getting hits as often.For instance, a fastball followed by a much slower pitch can confuse batters., By studying what kinds of pitches the other batters can and cannot hit, you can help the pitcher know what pitches to throw to what batter., An ace pitcher can turn things around for your team, especially if you've been losing for a period of time. Ace pitchers can help you win tournaments.The most important trait of an ace pitcher is consistency. Your ace should be able to throw great pitches on a regular basis, even if he or she does not have as fast a pitch as other pitchers., Every pitcher has to be taken out of the game sometime. You need good relief pitchers and closers who can follow up for your star pitchers and help win the game., Because so few pitchers throw left-handed, having one pitch on your team can sometimes bewilder batters, working to your advantage.

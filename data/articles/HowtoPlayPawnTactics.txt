;
, Forts allow you to fire bullets down at your opponents with out getting hit yourself. It is also called height advantage.
 Hold mouse down before releasing to get a farther throw.
 Only heavy, guards, and assaulters have them.


assaulters can kill practically anything for as long as you are skilled enough, heavies can destroy almost all classes except for guards and lancers. Lancers can destroy basically anything but are frequently killed by recons, assaulters, and even supports in a defense. Supporters have powerful shotguns that is capable of defeating a recon at close range. However, due to the reloading issues, they can be easily killed in open fields.
 Don't just stand in one place and shoot. Move around so that not all of the bullets are hitting you..


Guards have a special defense mode call "shields up."
This can easily be destroyed if you have explosives or move behind the guard.

assaulters vs guards. Always save your grenades for the last. If a guard comes up to you with shield up, you should try to kill it by first blinding it with a flash and then go behind his shield and attack him.
Recons against heavies. Switch to mp5 and start firing from a position of advantage.
Lancer against recons. Switch to automatic pistol and move backwards as the recon chase you.
Support against heavy/guards/assaulters. Fire once, dodge behind a wall and wait for reload. Fire again, and then dodge again.
 Try to hide behind wall and fire at the lancers.




Maulers against recons. blast the recons with explosives and remember that it only take two careful aims to kill one recon.
Mauler against guards. Continuously moving left to right and fire straight at the guards.
One against all. This situation occasionally arises when too many people leaves the game. In this situation, heavies and maulers are the best class.

 Use plastic or glass, rather than a metal bowl. Make sure the bowl is deep enough to hold the hot dogs comfortably.
 It may boil over the sides, so try to leave an inch (2.5 cm) or so between the top of the water and the rim.
 Place the bowl in the microwave. Close the door, then cook the hot dogs on high for 2 to 3 minutes. Some larger hot dogs may need more time in the microwave.
 Let the hot dogs stand for 30 seconds to cool and dry off, since they will be bursting with heat when they come out.
 Once the hot dogs are dry, put them in buns and serve them. This quick method of cooking hot dogs is conducive to serving with a simple mustard and ketchup combo for an on-the-go meal.

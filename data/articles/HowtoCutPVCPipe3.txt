 A miter saw can be used for PVC projects that require many specific, detailed cuts. Use a tooth-count saw appropriate to the cutting job and the saws available. When in doubt, go with something like a standard 10 Tooth per-inch (TPI) wood blade, which comes with most miter saws. It'll depend on the particular brand and style of saw that you've got, though.
 Miter boxes are the easiest things in the world to use, since you've got the cut-lines pre marked alongside the box for you. You won't be able to miss.
 Start the blade and bring it down at a fairly slow to medium speed. Once cut, the process can be repeated with ease, making additional cuts in the pipe as necessary.

 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need". When purchasing or making stencils, consider what theme or presentation you're looking for. Some ideas include:


A beach side theme, perhaps with shells, starfish, seaweed, crabs, dolphins, etc.
A cabin theme, with moose, logs, bears, pine trees, etc.
A pattern design, such as circles, squares, lines, etc.
A holiday theme, with baubles, trees, angels, Santa, etc.
A Halloween theme, with ghouls, witch hats, wands, stars, etc.;
, Lay the tablecloth over the table you're planning to use it on once completed. Look around the cloth to see where placement of the stencil designs would look most effective.


Decide where you want the stencils to go and draw up a pattern on paper to follow; or, if you have a complicated pattern, consider marking it out direct on the tablecloth using a disappearing fabric marker. Some questions to help you work out a design include:
Do you want just a sprinkling of stencils in a corner?
Do you want a border of stencils?
Do you want a pattern of stencils? For example, a fan, circle, animal shape or some other design which the pattern follows around or forms the shape of?

, Position the stencil where you wish to start placing the design. If you're working with a marked-on pattern, position with extreme care to match the marks; use pins or fasteners to keep in place. Any mismatches will cause the pattern to look skewed.
 Less paint on the brush is always better and will appear more even when stenciled on. You can always add more if needed.
 Keep dabbing until the shape is filled, then carefully lift up the stencil. Be careful not to press too hard or you risk splashing paint elsewhere or even going over the stencil border.


Continue painting all the stenciled areas until they're finished. Work across the tablecloth either top to bottom or side to side to avoid working over already finished stenciled areas.
, Although this step is optional, it does make a nice finishing touch.

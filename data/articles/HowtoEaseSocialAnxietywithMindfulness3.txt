 You shouldn’t wait to use mindfulness when you get anxious in a social situation. Instead, you should use mindfulness in your daily life. Set aside 10 minutes in your daily routine for some times of mindfulness exercise.For example, you may use 10 minutes to meditate or perform breathing exercises.
 When you are going through your mindfulness exercises, you should get rid of anything that can distract you. This includes cell phones, computers and tablets, television, and radio.Try arranging a room or an area of your bedroom in a pleasing way and use it as a "time out" area. Try to make this room or area into a sanctuary for yourself. Place pleasing materials, objects and scents in the space to incorporate all of your senses. For example, you could place a soft blanket in the area, warm the space with a small heater, place a small dish of your favorite candies in the area, keep a scented candle nearby, and play some soft soothing music.
Tell your family or roommates not to disturb you for the next 10 minutes or so.
 Mindfulness meditation is a technique that can help you get out of your head and practice mindfulness. Meditation has been shown to reduce anxiety in people. With mindfulness meditation, you can take a step back from your thoughts and look at them without any judgment.Close your eyes. As you notice your thoughts and feelings, watch them go through your head in a neutral manner. Don’t judge them, agree with them, or even react to them. Just acknowledge that they exist.
Next, pay attention to the way your body feels. Feel the sensations in your limbs and muscles. Pay attention to your breath as you inhale and exhale. Focus on your senses.

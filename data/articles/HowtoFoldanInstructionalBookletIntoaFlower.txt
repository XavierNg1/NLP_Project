 It needs to be square-shaped.


If it's rectangular, you can still use it, but you have to cut it into a square shape. Just cut the bottom off, until it looks like a square – don't worry about it being exact.;
, This is your "first base".
 Do this diagonally to meet the left hand corner.
 Fold the left hand corner of the bottom up to the top right, diagonally.
 There should be a "V" shape between the two folds. Hold it so that the "first base" is on the left side, and make sure that the first page has a point at the bottom and the second page has a point to the top. For the first page, we'll call it point A. For the second, it is point B.
 Fold point A down over point B and it closes the triangle.


Steps 3-6 with the rest of the pages, and there should be one left – this is your second base.
You should have a shape as shown in this image.
 Repeat on the other side.
 Unfold them (the two flaps) completely.


You'll notice that there are folds that look like "X"'s on both sides. This is what is called a rabbit ear fold: push in on the sides so it folds back on itself and makes a triangle, to match the rest of them.
 Your new decoration is complete!

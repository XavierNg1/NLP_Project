 If the tofu is in a package, open it up and drain off all of the water. Don't spend too much time on the draining process. If you aren't incredibly worried about texture and you just want to keep the food fresh, then feel free to skip the pressing steps and freeze the tofu directly after you drain it., Use a clean dish towel or a layer of 3-4 paper towels. This material should absorb the moisture.


If you are using paper towels, then you will need to switch them out every half-hour or so.
 Place a flat, heavy object on top. Over the course of an hour or so, the pressure from the weight of the object should gradually push the excess water out of the tofu hunk.Try using a cutting board and/or a skillet. The object should be heavy enough to apply enough pressure, but not so heavy that it crushes the tofu.
Make sure that the heavy object is clean! You are going to eat this tofu. Make sure that the object is not something that will be damaged by moisture â€“ e.g. a book.
 The act of pressing should squeeze out most of the water. You'll know that the tofu is ready when it feels dry and firm.

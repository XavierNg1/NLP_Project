 Available products include clothing items, stationery, bags, calendars, posters, mugs, clocks and mouse-pads. You can also use CafePress to sell books-on-demand and audio CDs. You can click on any product to get information about its size and design options

, Each product has specifications as to the dimensions of the artwork it can support; depending on the product, you may have to adjust its size on your computer before uploading, or you can do so after uploading it to CafePress. Depending on the product, you can adjust the placement of the image and preview how it will appear on the product.


Generally, you'll want to avoid having large borders around your images, as this will take away from the space available for the image itself. Also, if you're designing an image to go on a black item, create it with a transparent background so that CafePress will not surround it with white.
 If you have either a Basic or Premium Shop, you'll need to set the prices for the items you're selling. CafePress charges a base price for each item; you set a higher retail price (markup) for each item you sell in your shop. When an item sells, CafePress gets the base price, and you get the amount of the markup.


Your markup price should take into account any costs incurred in designing the images used on your products as well as time spent in designing them and the costs for any marketing you're doing to promote your CafePress shop. Also, take a look at what similar items are selling for elsewhere online and in brick-and-mortar stores.
 This will give customers a short explanation of what your shop sells and invite them to purchase items from you.


If you're taking advantage of CafePress' search engine optimization (SEO) features, include several keywords in your shop description to help Internet search engines find your shop.
 If you have a business logo, you can upload it to your CafePress shop to display your brand to your customers. If you have a website, you can also set it up so that when customers click on the logo on your CafePress shop, they are taken to it.
 Although optional, having a shopkeeper profile tells your customers about you or your organization beyond what you state in your shop description. The profile can also include your picture or a logo of your organization, as opposed to the logo for your shop.
 You can choose whether or not to be listed in the CafePress Marketplace. Items sold through the CafePress Marketplace earn you 10 percent commission of the retail price, but CafePress sets the retail price for any item listed and retains the right to enhance the artwork as necessary to improve the product's saleability. Not all products are available for inclusion in the CafePress Marketplace, but products listed there are eligible for affiliate program sales.

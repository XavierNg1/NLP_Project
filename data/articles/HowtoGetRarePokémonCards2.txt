 Independent game and card shops will buy and sell “used” Pokémon cards. This is the perfect way to peruse a library of cards and purchase just the individual cards that you want.Particularly rare cards will be quite expensive due to their high demand. Trade in a few cards that you don’t want to offset the high price.
Check back every week or so – players will always be trading in cards they no longer need.
 There are a variety of online shops that will sell individual cards – sometimes even fresh from the pack. If you don’t have a local shop and have the means to do so, find a reputable website and try building your collection.


Make sure you’re purchasing from a respectable company. If you are buying cards from an individual seller, such as through eBay, check their reviews and make sure you are purchasing exactly what you want.
Online card shops may charge a premium for certain cards, particularly if they open new packs to acquire them. Think of it as a convenience fee, as not everyone is necessarily willing to sell off cards they don’t want.
 Yard sales are a great place to find loads of cards. It's not uncommon for someone to get rid of their entire collection this way, whether it's someone who lost interest in the game, or a parent getting rid of a child’s old things.


Pawn shops are another great place to find a large number of cards. Some people sell their collection to a pawn shop just to get them out of the way. You can find some hidden gems this way, and usually for cheap!

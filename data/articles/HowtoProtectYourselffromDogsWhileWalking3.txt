While it’s common for dogs to share walkways with people, think about how comfortable you are around dogs before you go to an area that is popular for dog walking. Dogs can sense emotions and will know if you’re uncomfortable, which could trigger a stressed dog.
Be on guard while walking on country roads. Unwanted dogs are often dumped in the country and left to fend for themselves, which leads to roaming dogs along country roads.
Always carry a big stick and other protective items such as a stun gun while walking alone on a country road.
If you are going on a walk to explore a new area, ask the locals about the likelihood of dog encounters. Dogs roam in packs in some countries or rural areas, so get information about how to stay safe before you go exploring.
 Dogs are very territorial and will aggressively defend their home. If you see a dog or know that a dog lives at a particular house, change up your route to avoid the dog. Large dogs can jump fences if they’re agitated., If you see a dog that is walking near you or is engaged in an activity nearby, don’t walk up on it. It’s best to quietly walk in the opposite direction. Surprising a dog can make even the gentlest dog act out aggressively because it’s afraid.

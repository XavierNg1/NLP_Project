 Siri can find nearby locations for you as well. To start Siri, either press and hold the Home button, or say "Hey Siri" (if this feature has been enabled).
 Siri will perform the search and display the closest gas station to your current location. The gas station will be marked with a pin on the map in Siri.If you'd rather see all of the nearby gas stations, say "Find nearby gas stations." You'll be shown a list of nearby gas stations, and tapping one will load it in Maps.
 The Maps app will open and center on the gas station, and a pop-up for it will appear.
 This will display the quickest route to the gas station.
 Your phone will begin turn-by-turn navigation to get you to the selected gas station.

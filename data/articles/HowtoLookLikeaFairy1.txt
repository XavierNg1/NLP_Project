Fairies live in and make use of the natural world. They wear flowers in their hair and around the necks and wrists.
Fairies embrace a wild beauty; they aren't overly-tidy and their style is exuberant, rather than tailored.
Fairy clothing is old-fashioned and romantic. Think long skirts, lace and ribbons, a Shakespearean aesthetic.
Fairy hair is very natural, so no need to over-process it with perms, dyes or straighteners. Take care of your hair with regular deep conditioning treatments.
Fairies glow, so take care of your skin. Wash, exfoliate and moisturize for a healthy glow.;

 Reading a long book can be a challenge if you have no interest in the bookâ€™s subject. To make reading a long book more fun, try to relate it to something that is familiar to you or at least try to understand the context of the book to make it more familiar.


For example, if the book is about a love triangle between three fictional characters, try to relate their situation to something that happened to a friend of yours or to the plot of a movie you like.
Or, if you are reading a book that was written over 100 years ago, do a little research about the author, the year the book was written, and the place where the author lived. This may help to make the book seem more approachable.;
, Pretend that you will have to teach someone what you are about to read and then read with that in mind. Consider how you would describe a character, event, or concept to someone who has not read the book. This will prompt your brain to remember the material and make it easier for you write or answer questions about the material later on., If you are reading the book for a class, then you might have a paper or test that will require you to draw on what you have read. Identify the questions that you might have to answer before you start reading. This will make it easier to stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed by other information., Using visualization can also make reading more fun and help you to remember important information. As you read, pause now and then to imagine what the characters in the book look like, what the setting looks like, or how an important scene might have looked.


You can also use this strategy to help you remember important dates, names, and other facts as you read. For example, if the book you are reading describes an important battle, take a moment to imagine the scene. Imagine that the date of the battle and other important information about it are stamped onto the image.

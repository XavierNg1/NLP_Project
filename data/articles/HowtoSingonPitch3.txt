 In the 1970s, Edwin Gordon developed the term audiation. The concept of audiation pertains to the concept of auditory imagery, or the ability to hear, or visualize, sounds in your head. In order to understand audiation, work through the exercise described below:


Select a song that is incredibly familiar to you. It could be your nation’s national anthem or a song from your childhood, like “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.”
Don’t hum or sing this song. Instead, think about it—visualize the familiar melody in your head.
The ability to hear this song in your head without humming, singing, or listening to it, is called audiation.
 Select a familiar song—it can be the same song you choose before. Find a quiet spot where you can focus and sing without being disturbed. Once situated, sing the song out loud. As you sing, commit the following to your memory:


The melody.
The pitch of each note.
The intervals between each set of notes., When you feel confident in your knowledge of the song, enhance your audiation skills by visualizing a small portion of the song. Starting at the top of the tune, sing every other line out loud. When you are not singing, visualize the line of the song in your head.


The first note of the lines you sing may be extremely challenging to sing in tune. As your audiation skills improve, however, you should be able to hit the note right away.
Continue to count as you visualize the lines., Once you have mastered singing and visualizing alternating lines, you can attempt a more challenging audiation exercise. Select a few words to sing from each line.


Sing the first word of the song.
Visualize the portions of the song that lie in between the words you have chosen to sing.
Try your best to hit the correct pitch of the words you are singing.

 Realise that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism and is truly a religion of peace and truth. Just because numbers of people around you target your religion and say negative things about you and your religion it does certainly not mean that what they're saying is true, and for a matter of fact, what they're saying is false. Get those bad thoughts out of your mind, you know Islam is the truth and you know that those people are foolish and ignorant people that have no idea of what comes out of their mouths.
 You know they're wrong, don't let them fill your head with a load of rubbish. Walk away, don't interfere. Racism is always serious, you have the right to report people who are racist to you, but don't be racist back to them, as it can get you into serious trouble and isn't an act that should be done by a Muslim., Walking away and not interfering with them does not mean you are allowed to talk bad about them and make racist comments about them. Remember, no matter who they are, your enemy or your friend, if they do something bad to you, in return, don't take revenge, do something good for them for the sake of Allah and they will realise what they have done is wrong and should apologise, of course some people will unfortunately not realise their mistake and dig themselves into a deeper hole., Teach the people who make the racist comments the truth. Some people may not need the truth, some people will simply not be teachable, but every opportunity is worth the effort., Don't worry, just carry on your life as a Muslim, every little good deed you do is recorded, and will be rewarded, and every sin you do is recorded, and punishments will be made on the day of judgement.

 Four Suit Spider Solitaire is intense, but it's the exact same in format and play. Use the same amount of cards, use the same set-up, and use the same basic rules for winning.
 This time, you're seeing the suits for what they are. Diamonds are diamonds, spades are spades, etc. Just like in the two-suit version, they must be played together. In order to get King-to-Ace sequences cleared off the table, they must all be of the same suit.
 You can make any numerical sequences you'd like (6-7-8-9, etc.), but they can only be moved within their suit. A six of hearts on a 7 of spades on an 8 of diamonds is going nowhere. However, a six of hearts on a 7 of hearts on an 8 of diamonds? The 6 and 7 can be moved.


See how this gets virtually impossible? When you're moving the cards around, you're going to have to know which allowances to make and which moves to avoid. In general, you want to open piles and rows -- if the move doesn't do that, you may be best off skipping it.
 The four-suit version is really the only version where it's strategy over all (not ignoring luck). To make your sequences and clear them off the board (which is how you win the game), you gotta be very careful.


Go for higher ranked cards first. In other words, move the Jack onto the Queen before you move the 10 onto the Jack. If you move a 10 onto a Jack that's a different suit, you're virtually killing it.
Move Kings to open columns as soon as you can.
Get cards off of columns that are almost empty. The sooner you get empty columns, the sooner you can get your Kings off the column and off the table.
Though it should go without saying, try your best to keep sequences within a suit. As the game progresses, you'll be glad you did.

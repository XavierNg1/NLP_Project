This feature is rolling out in waves, and may not be available for you yet.You can check for Instagram updates by opening the App Store and tapping the Updates tab.;
, With the latest version of Instagram for iOS, you can stitch together multiple clips that you've previously recorded on your iPhone. These videos are still limited to 15 seconds of total length, or 60 if your app has the ability for longer videos.
 This will display the filter selection.
 A thumbnail of the currently-selected clip will appear at the bottom of the screen in the timeline.
 The second clip will appear on the timeline next to the original clip.

 You're limited to 15 total seconds of clips, or 60 seconds if longer videos have been activated for your account.

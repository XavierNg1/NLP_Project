 A bombshell blowout is characterized by its voluminous and sleek, yet effortlessly wild and imperfect appearance. Use a comb to divide your hair into at least four manageable sections.Part your hair down the center of your head, from the top of your forehead to the nape of your neck.
Part your hair horizontally from the top of your left ear to the top of your right ear.
Twist and secure the two top sections of your hair with a duck bill clip.
 In addition to a blow dryer, you will need a medium or large round brush. Beginning with the left or right bottom section, grab a subsection of hair near the roots with a round brush. As you pull the brush down through the hair, the blow dryer follows over the brush. Repeat this process throughout your mane until each section is completely dry.


Always point the blow dryer’s nozzle down to prevent frizz and promote shine., Squirt a few drops of shine serum onto your fingertips.Comb your fingers through the ends of your hair to distribute the serum. Do not apply the shine serum to your roots—this will cause your hair to appear oily., Blend the sections of your blowout by rough drying your hair. Point the nozzle of your blow dryer up towards your head. As you blast your hair with heat, comb through your hair with your fingers.Complete your effortlessly wild and voluminous blowout by smoothing out and separating the ends of your hair.

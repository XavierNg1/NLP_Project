 This may be around 9 or 10 at night in the summer, 7 or 8 in the winter.;
, Does your friend have the biggest backyard, but you have the woods? Take a vote so everyone involved gets a share.
 If you have an odd number or people, that's okay; just make sure it’s fair. Two of the groups will end up being hiders while one will be seekers.


If you divide your teams into more than three groups, make sure you have one group of seekers for every group of hiders.
 It would also be a good idea if you have everyone’s cell phone numbers.
 If they are wearing shorts, it might be a good idea to put them on their ankles, too.
 Cover pale faces with makeup or wear a ski mask.
 They are as follows:


There are two winners, one for the hiders, and one for seekers. The hider who wins is the last person out there. The seeker who wins is the one who doesn’t turn on the light without tagging anyone or who tags the most hiders.
The hiders can choose to hide anywhere inside or outside, and can change hiding places at any time.
Hiders have to stay hidden or out of sight. They can always run around a corner if there are some seekers coming!
The seekers each have to carry a flashlight, but can only turn it on if they see a hider and are going to tag them. You ‘tag’ them with the light.
When a hider is tagged by a seeker, they have to sit in an off-limits room and wait. You could also make them go along with the seekers.
If a seeker turns on the light to tag somebody and there isn’t anyone there, they must go inside and wait. This prevents against seekers running around with the lights on all the time.
When there is only one hider left that hasn't been found, a seeker goes around the house and turns on all the lights in the house. This is a signal to whoever is left that they are the only one out there.
 Change groups to accommodate everybody’s wants.

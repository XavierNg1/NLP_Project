 While it's not necessary, it is certainly helpful.


There are three types of shoes worn- girls' soft shoes, boys' soft shoes, and hard shoes. Boys' soft shoes and hard shoes resemble tap shoes, except instead of metal, resin is used. Boys' soft shoes also only have a tap at the heel. Girls' soft shoes resemble ballet slippers.
There are seven types of solo dances- Reel (2/4 or 4/4 time, soft shoes), light and single jigs (6/8 time, soft shoe), slip jig (9/8 time, soft shoe, usually girls only), treble jig (slow 6/8, hard shoe), hornpipe (2/4 or 4/4 time, hard shoe), and traditional set dances (time signature varies, hard shoe).
There are also Ceili (kay-lee) dances, which are danced in groups. They are in soft shoe, and there are dances for two, four, six, or eight people.;
, Since you're just starting out, just socks, gym shorts, and a t-shirt should be sufficient. Eventually, you'll need soft shoes, hard shoes, and additional equipment if you choose to perform or compete.
 To get a feel for Irish dance, try learning a few simple steps. Start slowly, and you can gradually get faster.


Singles

Hop on one foot, then step. Repeat over and over.


Doubles

These are like singles, except you step three times.
Think "hop one two three"


Switches

Just switch from one foot to the other.
 Ideally, the top half of the body shouldn't move at all. Keep your arms straight at your sides and your shoulders pulled back, with your hands in fists.Keep your knees straight and turn your feet out, one foot in front of the other. Make sure you're up on your toes.
 If you've tried Irish dancing out and like it, why not get a teacher? There are Irish dance schools everywhere, even if you're not in Ireland!

, The Internet is typically split in half on a DS screen. The top screen automatically zooms in while the touch screen requires you to scroll with the control pad or the stylus.


To switch screens, tap the arrow icon at the bottom of the screen. This setting allows your touch screen to be bigger while the top screen is smaller. Or you can open the menu in the bottom-right of the touch screen and switch to the column view.
 This will take you to the main menu.
Tap "History". This will show you all the pages you've visited recently.
Tap "Delete all". This will delete all of them. You can also select which history to delete.


For deleting cookies:

Go on the Internet main menu.
Tap "Settings".
Scroll down and tap "Delete Cookies". Tap "Yes" to confirm.
Another method is refreshing the page.
 Any mistakes made there won't be mistaken for vandalism of the site.

 If the secret involves one or more people being hurt, you may need to tell someone who can help, particularly if there are children involved.


If someone is harming or has harmed herself or another person, you may need to report it.
If someone is involved in criminal activity and tells you about it, you might be held legally responsible for not reporting the action.
 If you asked about telling the secret when you found out, double-check to see if it is still an appropriate time before you start telling people. Some events, like surprise parties, will have an obvious “secret” deadline.


Ask if your “reward” for keeping the secret can be getting to tell someone yourself when the time is right.Whatever you do, do NOT text the secret to anyone because then they have proof that YOU told them. Tell the person in person.
Depending on the secret, you may not want to tell other people that you knew before they did. This may hurt the feelings of the person’s close friends or family.
 Any time you decide to tell a secret to someone else, you must evaluate the risk of many people finding out and you being thought of as untrustworthy against the satisfaction you will feel when you tell someone the secret.


If you are considering telling a secret, write down a list of pros and cons to telling.This can help you make a well-reasoned decision.

 If you have an open or gaping wound that needs closure, you may need a butterfly bandage. Butterfly bandages are ideal to close narrow gaping wounds by pulling the skin together so that it can heal. These bandages should not be used on wounds larger than 2 inches long (or 5 cm)., Clear cellulose tapes or thick metallic tapes are not ideal but may work in emergencies.
 Pinch the ends of the tape between your index finger and thumb as you fold back. The sticky side of the tape should be facing out towards you.
 There should be two triangles on either side of the tape. Leave about a pinky-sized space between the triangles. If you do it correctly, the triangles will form a small square of space. This will become the non-adhesive pad of the bandage.
 The bandage should now resemble a butterfly or a dumbbell. The folded center should be non-sticky on both sides. This is the part that will lie directly over your wound.
 With clean fingers, gently hold close the wound and stretch the bandage over it. The non-adhesive folded center should be directly over the wound. You do not want any part of the sticky bandage touching your wound.
 There should be one inch or 3 cm between each bandage. The bandage does not need to cover the whole wound, so long as the wound is not bleeding.

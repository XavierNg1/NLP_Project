 Black widows spend a lot of time on their webs, whether it's to guard an egg sac or wait for prey. Sprinkle a non-repellant insecticidal dust over the web when you find it â€” the dust will eventually kill the spider. Return to the web to make sure the spider is dead, and dispose of both in a sealed plastic bag.
 A wettable powder applied to corners and nooks will prevent the formation of new webs, making it harder for the black widows to catch prey and thrive.

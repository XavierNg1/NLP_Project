 Kik provides an expansive gallery full of GIFs (silent, usually entertaining, mini-videos that play on a loop) that you can send to friends.,, An icon bar will appear beneath the chat, and your phone’s photo gallery will be visible just beneath.
 Now you will see a search box that says “Search for GIFs,” as well as a series of emoji that look like the ones you may use in text messages.
 If you want the GIF you send to show excitement, type “excited” in the box or tap one of the smiling emoji. A new gallery containing GIFs that match your search criteria will expand.


For example, if you tap the frog emoji (or search for “frog”), this will begin a search for frog-related GIFs. Several moving frog images will appear, and you can scroll through them as you would a photo gallery.
 When the GIF is enlarged, you will notice a back button on the left side, and a send button on the right (in the form of a chat bubble).


Use the back button to return to the GIF list at any time.
 It’s located on the bottom right corner of the enlarged GIF. Now the GIF will appear in the chat box, ready to be sent.
 If you want to add a message along with your GIF, type something into the text box.
 The GIF will now be visible to the person you are chatting with.

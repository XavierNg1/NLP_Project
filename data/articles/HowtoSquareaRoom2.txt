 You can use any unit of measurement you want as long as you stay consistent.
 Make a mark.
 If the straight line between the two marks measures 5 feet (1.5 m), that particular corner is a perfect 90° angle.


The math technique that you use to measure the corner is called the Pythagorean theorem. It states that the squares of the smaller sides of a right triangle are equal to the square of the longer side: a2 + b2 = c2 Only right triangles can be used in the Pythagorean theorem, so if the triangle's numbers don't add up, the corner of the triangle isn't 90°.
You don't need to use 3-4-5 as your measurements. You can also double, triple, quadruple, etc. the measurements if your room is very large. Measuring 6-8-10 is the exact same as measuring 3-4-5.
 If they are all 90° angles, and each wall is equidistant, you've got yourself a square room.

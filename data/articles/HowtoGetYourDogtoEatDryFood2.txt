 Dog food is formulated to meet all the nutritional needs of dogs. Dogs have different requirements than humans for fat and protein and particularly for minerals and vitamins. They cannot thrive for long on human food.Dry dog food helps to remove some of the bacteria and plaque that collects daily on your dog's teeth.
Nutrients in dog food, like calcium, help to build strong teeth and bones.
 The most desirable ingredient in dry dog food is meat. Examine the ingredient labels on a few brands of dry dog food. If meat (not meat by-product) is the first ingredient (or the first two or three) there is a good chance that it will be a better tasting dry food.


Steer clear of any dog food that lists corn as a top ingredient., If you are trying to switch your dog from one brand of food to another, begin by mixing a small amount of the new food in with the old food. Over the a course of one to two weeks feed more and more of the new food and less and less of the old food until it is only eating the new food.
 If your dog is hooked on human foods, then you can start the conversion to dry food by giving your dog wet food that is the same brand as the dry food that you want him to eat. Mix some of the wet food in with the human food that your dog likes to eat. Then, reduce the amount of human food and increase the wet food over the course of a week or two until you arenâ€™t feeding any human food.


After your dog is eating the wet food, then start mixing in dry kibble with the wet food over a two week period gradually feeding less and less wet food until the dog is only eating dry food.

 Dumbbells can also be used to exercise leg muscles. This works by adding weight to resistance moves that force your muscles to work harder. To perform weighted toe raises, hold dumbbells in each hand, slowly raise yourself to tiptoe, and then lower yourself slowly to the normal standing position. This will focus in on your calf muscles.For variations, you can do this one leg at a time or both together.
You can also do this exercise while standing on a step. This modification will increase the range of motion by enabling your heel to drop below the level of the rest of your foot.
Do two to three sets of eight to 20 reps.
 Lunges can be performed by stepping a single foot forward or backward and keeping body weight evenly distributed between each foot. Add dumbbells to each hand to add resistance. As you bend your knees and drop down, you will feel the burn in your thighs.


You can perform a side lunge just by stepping out one leg to the side and lowering your backside towards the ground.
When performing lunges keep your back straight, don't let it round. Engage your core and concentrate on working your legs.Do front, back, and side lunges around two to three times for each leg.
 Adding dumbbells to regular squats can make a big difference and will really test your leg muscles. Hold dumbbells in each hand and slowly lower your body by bending the knees at a 90-degree angle into sitting position. Hold the pose for a moment before slowly standing up straight again. Keep your upper body steady on the way up and down.One-legged squats will increase the difficulty significantly.

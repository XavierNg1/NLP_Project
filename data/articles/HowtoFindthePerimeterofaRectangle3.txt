A standard rectangle has four sides. The two sides composing the length are equal to each other, and the two sides composing the width are equal to each other. Therefore, the perimeter is the sum of those four sides.
A compound rectangle has at least six sides. Think of a capital “L” or “T” shape. The top “branch” can be separated into one rectangle and the bottom “bar” can be separated into another. The perimeter of this shape, however, does not rely on breaking up the compound rectangle into two separate rectangles. Instead, the perimeter is simply: P = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6.
Each “s” represents a different side of your compound rectangle.
 In a standard educational math problem, the measurement of all sides should be provided.


This example uses the abbreviations L, W, l1, l2, w1, and w2. The uppercase L and W stand for the full lengths and widths of the shape. The lowercase ls and ws stand for the smaller lengths and widths.
As such, the formula P = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 equals P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2.
Variables, like “w” or “l” are simply placeholders for unknown numeric values.Example: L = 14 centimeter (5.5 in), W = 10 centimeter (3.9 in), l1 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in), l2 = 9 centimeter (3.5 in), w1 = 4 centimeter (1.6 in), w2 = 6 centimeter (2.4 in)

Note that l1 and l2 will equal L. Similarly, w1 and w2 will equal W.
 By plugging the numeric values of the sides into your equations, you’ll be able to find the perimeter of your compound shape.


P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2 = 14 + 10 + 5 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 48 centimeter (18.9 in)

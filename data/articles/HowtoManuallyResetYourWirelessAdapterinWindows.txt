 Press and hold the Windows key and press R. This should open a small box in the lower left-hand corner of your screen. Type “Control” into the box, and hit Enter to open the Control Panel.;
, Once the new Control Panel window opens, click the blue “Network and Internet” menu option. A new page will load. From this page, click “Network and Sharing Center” to continue.
 There should be a few different options inside the left-hand pane of the Control Panel window. Click “Change adapter settings,” and a new window should open.
 There may be a few different options depending on a few different things. The option that you're looking for should be shown as “Wi-Fi.” In Windows 7 and earlier, the “Wi-Fi” adapter may appear in this list as “Wireless Network Connection.” The process for disabling and enabling is the same, regardless of which device is being used, as long as the operating system is Windows 7 and up.
 Right-click the “Wi-Fi” option. A small submenu should appear, the top option being “Disable.” Click it to continue. The adapter icon should go from colored to black-and-white.
 After the adapter icon turns black-and-white, wait 15 seconds or more, before right-clicking and selecting “Enable.” Once enabled, the icon should return to color. You have just reset your Windows wireless adapter.

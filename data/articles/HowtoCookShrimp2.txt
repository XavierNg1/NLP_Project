 Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before you plan to cook them.
Rinse them with cool water and allow them to sit at room temperature.


Shrimp can be boiled with their peels on or after they have been peeled.;
,,, Make sure they are completely submerged.
 As the water begins to heat again, watch for small bubbles to break the surface of the water. This will occur after about 1 to 2 minutes, depending on how much water is in the pot. When you see the bubbles, remove the pot from the heat.
 Allow them to continue cooking in the hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the shrimp. They will turn pink when they are finished cooking.
 Pour the shrimp into a strainer or colander to drain them. Serve warm.


If you didn't peel your shrimp before cooking them, you can either serve them with the peel on and allow people to peel their own shrimp, or peel the shrimp yourself when they're finished cooking and serve them that way.

 Then, create seven columns of five cards. The columns should be evenly spaced, and the cards in each column should overlap each other so that the bottom card in each column in the only card not overlapped. After the columns (tableau) are situated, place the remaining cards in a face-down pile below the tableau. This is called the stockpile.;
, The foundation or waste pile has just been created. The object of the game is to move a card from the tableau to the foundation that is not overlapped by any card and is at least one more or one less than the foundation card's face value. If you've played TriPeaks Solitaire before, this game is so similar, it's virtually the same style only this game has only one peak and no cards overlap each other - they are in vertical-straight line overlaps. Aces can be counted as either the lowest numbered card in the deck or the highest number on-top of the King.
 When there are no more playable cards in the tableau, flip cards over from the stockpile and into the foundation until there are playable cards in the tableau again. The game continues until either the tableau or the stockpile runs out of cards.
 When the tableau runs out of cards, it is considered a win, but if the stockpile runs out of cards before the tableau, it is considered a loss.

 Instead of bundling up in big, bulky outfits, use multiple light layers to stay warm. For example, wear a tank-top under a light t-shirt underneath something like a sweater or flannel button up.Make sure the outermost item you put on is long and flattering.
 A sweater can be a nice, cozy option. However, short and thick sweaters can make your outfit look bulky. Instead, opt for a longer sweater that hangs a little past your waistline. You can also go for a slightly thinner sweater with layers underneath.A sweater dress can also work well if you're looking for something slightly more dressy.
A turtleneck sweater may add extra warmth.
 Any more than three layers can start to add bulk to your frame. Challenge yourself to selectively choose three layers to best keep you warm.Choose your layers wisely. Two thin layers underneath a warm wardrobe option, such as a flannel shirt, should keep you sufficiently warm.
You can also add accessories, like a scarf, if you're still cold. This will help you stay warm without adding bulk.
 Do not forget to layer your lower half as well. You need to keep your legs and feet warm in the colder months. As with your top half, aim for several lighter layers.If you wear skirts, try wearing a skirt over pants or leggings. You could also do this with a dress.
You can also try to wear slim leggings or long johns over pants.
Add thick socks underneath a pair of boots.
 If you've layered efficiently, you do not need a bulky coat to hide your form. Go for something sleek, like a light leather jacket or a bomber jacket, instead of a big, puffy coat.A longer fitted coat, like a trench coat, may also help you avoid looking bulky.

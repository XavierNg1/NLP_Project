, Once you have been properly diagnosed, you can decide if online treatment is right for your condition. If you have a common or simply treated mental disorder, online counseling may work for you. If you have a severe mental illness that needs direct and close treatment, online counseling is not right for you.

If you live in rural or remote areas that do not have easy access to in person counseling services, you could greatly benefit from online counseling. It can also be easier if you have mobility limitations or other physical impairments that make it difficult to travel.This can also be helpful if you travel or are away from one central location for months at a time., In many cases, online sessions are cheaper than in person counseling sessions, but they may not be.When choosing an online counselor, make sure you know up front how much it is going to cost you. Also ensure that you have a secure way to pay for the services.

Ask your counselor about the difference in cost., One major concern for you when deciding to do online counseling is the cost. Many insurance providers will now help pay for online counseling sessions, but there may be stipulations or requirements.

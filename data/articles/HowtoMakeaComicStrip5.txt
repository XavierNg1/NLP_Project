 If you're going to get your comics printed in a paper, that paper will probably have a very specific schedule for when they need comics to be updated. You will have to meet those requirements. If you're publishing online, you'll have a little more flexibility. Still, remember to be realistic.
 If you want to publish your comics, the first thing you're going to want to do (regardless of what medium you're going to use to get your comics out to readers), is build a buffer. This is a backlog of available strips. For example, if you have a single update a week, have a buffer of 30 strips. That way if you get behind, you've still got strips available to go out on schedule.
 You can publish your comics in a newspaper if you want to. This can be either your school newspaper or a local paper. Call their submissions department to find out if they're interested in new comics. Getting your comic in a paper, as an unknown, can be very difficult. Be prepared.
 If you want to reach a larger audience, have more control over your work, and a better shot at controlling how much money you make, you can publish your comics online instead. This is easy to do but how much money you make will vary and it can be difficult to develop a readership.


Use a website. There are many websites that are known for hosting comics. Like starting a blog, you can start an easy-to-update page where people can find your comic. This is great for beginners. A popular options are SmackJeeves and ComicFury.
Make a website. You can also make your own website. This will give you a little more control but can also be more work. Only do this if you feel you are capable of making a nice, looking site on your own or with a little help.
Use your blog. It is becoming increasingly popular to publish comics using blogging sites like Tumblr. This is an incredibly easy publishing mechanism which allows you to put up ads to make money but also not cost you money to host the site.

 Right now is your chance to start fresh and be yourself, since you're in a completely new group of people who don't know anything about you. No one knows what your true personality is, and it's important that you're who you want to be. That way, your personality will attract the right friends, not the wrong friends.
 While you and several others may think it's cool and that it will earn you more respect, others will laugh and your reputation will be lowered if you get in trouble. Plus, it's a bad start off to a new year and you'll be horribly humiliated. It's best to play it safe and follow all the rules, no matter how long you stay at this school!

, You have no idea what your classmates really are like yet, so refrain from judging them right away. Also, you'll want to avoid making enemies. Be nice and sensitive about other people's feelings.
 No one likes to be interrupted while they're in the middle of speaking! Find an appropriate pause to slip in your comment or part of the conversation, but make sure the speaker isn't just taking a breath!

, Act modest but have some confidence in yourself. Confidence is the key to attracting friends, as people will look up to those who are confident in themselves.

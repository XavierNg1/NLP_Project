 You can form a proper ball shape by placing your hands on either side of the clay, and rotating them in a circular motion.;
, Place the clay on a smooth surface and press down on it until it is flat.
 Take a plastic knife or scissors and trace out the shape of an eye (simply a small circle), winking eye (a thin arch), two eyebrows (also arches, but more curved than the wink), and smile (a thick curve).
 It should resemble the image above (the iPhone version)., Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool. You now have made a clay winking emoji!

 If you already use and pay off a credit card, then make sure each dollar spent is giving you airline mileage. If you are confident that you can make most of your purchases on a credit card and then pay off the balance each month, you can rack up enough mileage for 1 to 2 plane tickets per year.


Some airline miles rewards cards give you 2 or more miles for every dollar spent. Make sure you do not choose a card with a dangerously high interest rate, especially if you are uncertain whether you will be able to pay off the balance each month.
Do not avoid mileage credit cards with an annual fee. Some cards give you 2 miles (3.2Â km) per dollar spent, but charge $50 to $100. Doubling your mileage and earning 2 plane tickets will save you money on travel, even if you pay an annual fee.;
, Ask your children what they would prefer as well, which will get them more involved with the trip. Several small trips within a day's drive may be more affordable than a week-long trip to another country.
 Many banks offer Very Important Purchase (VIP) accounts that let you set up to a certain amount of money aside each month. Although they do not always offer the best interest rates, you can choose how much to put aside and the date when it will become available.

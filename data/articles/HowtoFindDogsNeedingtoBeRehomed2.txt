 Call or go into your local shelter and ask if they have any dogs that they cannot keep at the shelter any longer that are in need of a home. This is especially useful for shelters that practice putting down dogs who havenâ€™t been adopted after a certain amount of time.Let the shelter know why you are looking for dogs to rehome. They may have certain limits regarding personal adoptions versus you coming in as part of a rescue.
 Many shelters place dogs in foster homes when they do not have space or resources for them at the shelter. Ask your local animal shelter if they have any dogs currently in foster care looking to be rehomed.Keep in mind that if you are not looking to adopt the dog directly, it may be best to leave the dog at its foster home where it will get more personal attention and care than it would in a rescue facility.
 Some rescues operate entirely by bringing dogs in long distance from high-kill shelters in underfunded and underserved areas. These rescues are always in need of people to take care of the animals and find them good homes once they arrive.If you choose to work with a long distance shelter, make clear to them whether you are looking to adopt the dogs or whether you are operating as an extension of their rescue with intention to rehome the dogs.
Ensure that you have proper space and supplies for the dogs coming in, as these rescues do not have any facilities of their own for the pets.

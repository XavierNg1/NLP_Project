 Most professors prefer you use 1-inch (2.5-cm) margins on all sides and a 12-point Times New Roman font. The cover page should be center-aligned.In Chicago style, cover page and title page refer to the same thing.
Your professor may have other requirements. Make sure you use the preferred formatting for your course.
 Your title should be typed about a third of the way down from the top of the page. It should be centered on the page.Capitalize the first letter of each major word in your title, but not those belonging to minor words. For example: How to Make a Cover Page
Alternatively, some style guides suggest that the title be presented in ALL CAPS.
Do not underline, italicize, or bold the title.
If you have a subtitle, place a colon following your title and write the subtitle on the following line.
 You should go several lines beneath the title, and write your first and last name. If you collaborated with other authors, make sure to include their names as well, separated by a comma.Your name should be typed about three quarters of the way down the page.
Use the same font and size that you've used throughout the cover page.
 Note that this final section should be double-spaced, and each of these elements should be listed on a separate line.Include both the name and course number of the subject.
Write your professor's full name and title. Use "Dr." only when appropriate. For example: "Dr. John Doe" or "Professor John Doe."

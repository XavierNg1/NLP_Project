 Other techniques that may help include:


Cross training. Encourage her to try new sports or activities; this also helps reduce her risk of overuse injuries, and encourages proper muscular balance.
Test her capacity. Her current routine might not be overloading her enough to stimulate further development.
If weight loss is her goal, have a chat with her about nutrition. No matter how hard she works out, if she's eating more calories than her body needs she could maintain or even gain weight.

 Thinking ahead is a good way to eat healthy when you have a busy schedule. Look at the next week and decide what you want to eat for lunch and dinner every day. This can give you a sense of what you will need to take out of the freezer to thaw, what you need to prepare ahead of time, and save you the time of figuring out a meal on the fly.When you are hungry and get home after a long day, not knowing what you want to cook for dinner can lead to unhealthy decisions, like take-out. Instead, with a menu you will already know what you are going to cook.
If there are days you get home later than others, you can plan easier meals or leftovers for those nights.
 When you go grocery shopping for the week or month, you should take a list with you. This helps you have a clear plan for what you will eat. It also keeps you from buying random ingredients you don’t need, or ingredients that are not healthy for you. Instead, you will have a list of all your healthy ingredients to buy.Taking a grocery list also ensures that you have everything you will need for all of your meals for the week.
 It is extremely easy to slip when we are busy. Having a dedication to your goal of eating healthy can help you maintain your plan and make healthier food choices. This can help you stay motivated even when you are busy.Taking just a moment to think “I want to eat healthy” can help you avoid slipping up and making a bad choice.

 The first step in signing classically is listening to classical music. You can buy, borrow, or browse classical music from a variety of places like the library or the internet.


Visit your local library and check out a famous classical singer’s album. It’s free!
Do an online search for a music video of your favorite classical singer.
You can also purchase classical music recordings online or at your local music store.;
, Set aside some time to focus only on listening to the classical music you acquired. You can take notes on what you do or don’t like about certain singers and styles.
 Once you’ve listened to recorded classical music, seek out a classical performance at a local venue. It doesn't need to be The Met to be great!


See the next opera at the local college.
Check out a classical singing performance at a local church.

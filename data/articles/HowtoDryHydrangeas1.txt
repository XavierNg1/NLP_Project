 To keep the color of most hydrangeas, it's best to start the drying process when the flowers first bloom. Cut or buy fresh, recently opened hydrangeas on the morning you plan to start the drying process.

Pee Gee Hydrangeas however, look better when left to mature. Take these at different times of the season. They start out a pale green, then as they mature, some pink shows up, later turning to burgundy, and finally a chocolate brown color very late in late fall.

 You can buy a used, unlocked cell phone from a variety of online retail stores or buy from an auction website, such as eBay.


Perform an Internet search using keywords such as "used unlocked cell phone," then browse unlocked phones on the retail websites that appear in the search results.
 Because you will not have the opportunity to inspect or test the phone in person, you may receive a phone that does not function properly.


Read and review the buying policies on every website to determine the procedure for returning or exchanging a phone in the event it doesn't function properly.
Before you buy a phone from eBay, review the seller's feedback ratings and comments to help you determine if the seller has a positive eBay reputation and if their other buyers have had positive experiences.

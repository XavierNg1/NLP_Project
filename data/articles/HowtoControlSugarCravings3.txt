 Going cold turkey is a tough but effective way to help eliminate sugar cravings. Start by going through your home and eliminating all foods with processed or added sugars.Read the food labels carefully to determine if there are hidden sugars in them.
Try not to focus on removing natural sugars. In moderate quantities, natural sugars from sources like complex carbs are healthy and necessary to consume.
 Getting rid of added sugars will take effort. To ensure that no unintentional sugar slips into your diet, plan your meals ahead of time. Focus on incorporating whole nutrients such as proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates in every meal.Plan snacks as well as meals. Quitting sugar all at once will likely leave you feeling hungry frequently for the first few days. Make sure you can anticipate your hunger and keep it in check.
Keep cravings in check by getting around 20g of protein at each meal. This could include 3 oz (28 g) of lean white meat such as turkey or chicken, paired with micronutrient and fiber-rich vegetables like broccoli to keep you full longer.
 Sugar withdrawal is real, and if you quit sugar cold-turkey you will likely feel it. For three to five days, prepare to feel shaky, irritable, and lethargic. For most people, these symptoms only last a few days. If you want to quit refined sugars all at once, it will be necessary to push through those first days.Help your body adjust more easily by not eliminating natural sugars such as fruit. Allow your body to indulge in naturally sweet foods to help lessen detox symptoms.

 Make sure your boat has enough space for a cooler to store freshly caught prawns. A row boat without a motor works best, as it won’t create noise and scare the prawns away. If you do use a boat with a motor, turn the motor off as you approach the prawns’ habitat.
 After you steer the boat to your desired location, put on your wading boots and climb overboard. When you wade, you can walk through shallow waters where prawns are plentiful and follow them as they move. Return to the boat to store your prawns in a cooler to keep them fresh.
 Fishing for prawns will be easier if you work as a team with one or two other fishers. One of you can be responsible for the net while the other steers the boat or aims the flashlight.
 A sounder is a sonar device that can help you find fish. To tell prawns apart from fish, look for a mass of objects coming from the bottom of the water. It should look like a cloud.You can buy high-tech sounders at marine and fishing supply stores for under $100.

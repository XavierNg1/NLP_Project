 Working with food coloring gets messy, so throw on an apron first. Wear older clothing that you don't mind getting messy., Use a plastic water bottle with a lid that is secure. Add half a cup of water and eight drops of food coloring to the bottle.If you want a lighter color,add less food coloring. Try going for four drops, for example, to get a more pastel shade.
 Make sure the cap is on completely first to avoid a mess. Shake the bottle vigorously. Keep shaking until you have a clear, consistent color. You can now use your dye in a tie dye project.

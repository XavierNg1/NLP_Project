 Dampen a washcloth or rag slightly and try to wipe away as much of the paint as you can. Switch out the cloth as needed if it becomes too saturated.


This may be ineffective on paint stains that have been dry for awhile. Soap and water are most effective on fresh paint stains.;
, Use a basic glycerin soap, like dish soap, that will produce a good lather and get into the grain of the wood. You can use liquid or bar soap for this.
 Keep scrubbing and adding more soap until all the paint is gone. Rub the cloth in straight lines with the grain of the wood to try and get all the paint out of the grooves.
 Continue to wipe at the spot until the soap suds are gone. You may need to rinse the cloth once if the spot was really soapy.
 Wipe away as much excess water as possible. The wood will remain damp, and may take up to 48 hours to fully dry depending on the size of the spot.

 Ensure that it is a DL DVD +R and that it has not been used before.
 This freeware program allows your burner to surpass the 8.5 GB limit of a DL DVD and actually burn 8.7 GB, which allows you to fit a full XGD3 onto a disc.


Run BurnerMAX before starting the DVD burning software. Click the “BurnerMAX” button and wait a few seconds. You should receive a message saying “BurnerMax is Enabled.” If you do not receive this message that means that your DVD drive is not compatible.
If you insert a new DVD or restart your computer, you will have to run BurnerMAX again.
 You should see that the maximum capacity of the DVD is now 8,738,897,920 bytes. Load the .dvd file for the game you are copying and set the Write Speed to 2.4x. This is especially important for XGD3 games, as the chance of failure is much higher.
 Make sure that you do not have any extra programs running, and that the screensaver will not start during the burn process. These are all much more critical when burning XGD3 games. The margin of error is very slight, and any hiccups during the burn process will lead to an unusable game.

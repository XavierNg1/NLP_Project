 Select one multiplication table to learn at a time. Start with the simple tables such as 2s, 10s, 5s, and 11s. By the time you learn the more difficult tables such as the 7s and 8s, you will already know several facts.Remember, 1 x 4 is the same as 4 x 1 so you only have to learn half of the multiplication table because the other half is just written the other way.;
, In fact, this would be the worst way to learn. Choose a table and focus solely on that one. Take as much time as you need to master each one before moving onto the next one.


Spend about 15-20 minutes each day studying flashcards or playing math games to master each multiplication fact.
There are many multiplication math games with different themes that can be found online.For instance, if you really like dinosaurs, find one that uses dinosaurs to make learning more fun.
 Once you have studied them enough to know them well, ask your family to quiz you on the tables you have just learned. This will help you remember them long term and keep the numbers fresh in your head.


When you have all the tables memorized, ask them to quiz you on all of the numbers, not just one number at a time.

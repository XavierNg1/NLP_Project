 Focusing for hours and hours without stopping will most likely just slow you down. Every 25 minutes or so, take about 5 minutes to stretch and walk around to give your brain and body a quick rest., Drink plenty of water and eat light, healthy, tasty snacks while you work to enjoy foods that you like, enhance your memory, and revitalize your brain and body. Stay away from soda, sugary junk food and energy drinks while you work to make sure that you won’t crash halfway through completing your homework.Try eating celery sticks and apple slices with peanut butter.
 Plan to go over to a friend’s house, play your favorite video game, shoot hoops in the driveway, or go out for a sweet treat with your sibling(s) once your homework is done. Remembering that this fun activity is coming up will help you stay motivated to focus and work efficiently.

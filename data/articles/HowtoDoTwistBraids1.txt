 Wash, condition, and dry your hair. Comb it thoroughly to get any knots out, and tie it back securely in a high ponytail at the crown of your head.If you have curly hair, you will probably need to straighten it in order to achieve a polished looking rope braid.


If your hair is layered you may have trouble twisting it into a rope braid. Depending on how dramatically layered your hair is, you may still be able to achieve this look if you twist it tightly enough, but it may not turn out as neatly.
This kind of braid can be done on smaller sections of hair rather than one big ponytail at the back of your head, but if you are just learning how to do it, this is the easiest way to start off. Doing smaller rope braids uses the exact same process, it’s just more fiddly because you’re using smaller sections of hair.;
, Divide the ponytail into two equal halves. Twist the first half in whichever direction is easiest for you, until it tightens into a rope and you can’t twist any further. Without letting it untwist, pin it gently to the side of your head., Repeat the same process with the rest of your hair, making sure to twist the second section in the same direction as the first. Instead of pinning it to your head when you are finished, unpin the first section, and hold one securely in each hand to keep them from untwisting.
 This time, you will need to twist in the opposite direction as before. Twist the two sections of your hair around each other, so they look like a fancy rope. Tie the rope braid off at the bottom, and you’re done.

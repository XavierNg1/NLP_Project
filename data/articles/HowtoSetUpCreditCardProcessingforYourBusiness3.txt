 When shopping for credit card processing, you'll quickly realize that rates and fees can vary greatly from company to company. It is always a good idea to get a half a dozen quotes before choosing a provider. That said, while looking for competitive rates, it is always best to make sure the credit card processor you intend to choose can support your business needs.


Test out the credit card processor's customer and technical support lines before agreeing to use them permanently.

Call them several times at various times of the day through the week.
See how long you wait on hold before someone answers your call, or see if you are forwarded to an answering machine. It doesn't matter if your services are the least expensive around––if your solution goes down, you have a lineup of customers wanting to pay, and you cannot get a hold of technical support to assist you.
 Be careful before committing to an agreement with a credit card processor, particularly as most agreements are for at least three years and come with some heavy early termination fees. Ask for references and testimonials.

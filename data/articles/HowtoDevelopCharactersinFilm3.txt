 Stereotypes should be avoided as they most often reinforce a negative image, for example it has taken decades to get over Hollywood's stereotyping black people. you can however create interesting characters by subverting a stereotype by giving them an odd trait, for example a body builder could have a passion for classical music or like arranging flowers.
 Archetypes are very powerful as we are all aware of them. Here are the common types of archetypes:


Hero.
Sage.
Magician.
Ruler.
Jester.
Lover.
The explorer. free spirit
The rebel. breaks rules
Creator.
Care giver.
Orphan/regular guy or gal.
Innocent/virgin.

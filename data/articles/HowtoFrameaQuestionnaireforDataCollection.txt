 In order to get usable data from a questionnaire, the research must first be clear about the information that he seeks to gain. Based upon the research question, determine the variables of the study and define the exact information needed to answer the research question.;
, Breakdown the research question and variables into several short lose ended questions. Put them down on a paper for easy reference. Since this would be the first draft, create as many valid questions as you can.
 Once you are done with the 1st draft, read each of the question carefully and group them based upon similarity of ideas. Remove duplicates. In case of two similar questions, choose the one that conveys the message better to the target audience.
 Based upon the groups, order the questions in a logical flow. Ideally start the questionnaire with easy to answer questions and slowly proceed to the tougher ones.
 In case, the respondents speak a foreign language, it is better to get the questionnaire translated in the local language. You may choose to have 2 sets of questionnaires â€“ one in English and other in the local Language, or incorporate both in the same questionnaire. This decision will depend upon the comfort level f your target respondents.
 Ensure that each question clearly conveys the idea and does

not leave a gap for different interpretations. Especially in case of translated questionnaires., This will make the respondents more comfortable and give an idea about what they can expect in the questionnaire.

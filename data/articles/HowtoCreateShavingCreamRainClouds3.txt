 If you don't want to get your counter dirty, you can use a plastic tub or tray instead. Make sure that you are using plain, white, foamy shaving cream. Do not use the gel kind.


This project makes a soft, fluffy dough. It is a great sensory activity for small children.
 The cornstarch will help bind the dough and make it more squishable. If you want a sparkly cloud, add a sprinkle of white or iridescent glitter.
 Use your palms to scoop and smoosh the two ingredients together. Keep kneading the dough until a dough forms and the texture is consistent.
 The dough should be soft and fluffy, but the final texture depends on your personal preferences. If it is too sticky for you, knead in some more cornstarch. If it is too dry, add more shaving cream.Keep in mind that the more cornstarch you add, the less puffy the dough will be., You can poke it, smoosh it, or shape it. Young, teething children must be supervised. Store the dough in an airtight container when you are done playing with it. Keep in mind that it will eventually dry out.

 Depending on the situation, your vet may already be aware that there is a problem and may have already given you instruction for handling the remains. If you haven’t contacted your vet, however, you should do so because they can help give you specific instructions on how to humanely take care of the remains.If you would like the body examined to determine cause of death, you should definitely contact your vet to determine the best way to store the body if it can’t be picked up or delivered immediately.
 You may need to store the body for a few hours or even a day as you work out how you will handle the remains. Take care to store the body in a way that keeps it cool and dry.If possible, store it in a plastic bag or sheet in a freezer.
If it can’t fit in a freezer, try to store it uncovered on concrete.
Choose a place where children and other people who might be easily upset won’t see the body.
 Many dog owners consider cremation when deciding what to do with the remains of their deceased pet.This option allows you to keep some of the remains in memorial or to scatter it in a favorite place your dog loved. It’s also a viable option for people that don’t have land for a private burial or don’t want to have a public burial. There are many cremation options ranging in price from $50 - $200.,

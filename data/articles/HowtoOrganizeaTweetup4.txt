 Provide large labels and pens for writing their Twitter handle on the label. Encourage this from everyone, as it's the best way people will get to know one another initially––recognizing a Twitter handle can be a wonderful icebreaker.


If you know the names of attendees in advance, you might like to print off labels for them. However, this may not be realistic unless you have an exact list of participants.
 Start conversations. Introduce one another and, as organizer, try to move around. When you're the organizer of the event, you're responsible for ensuring that those who have gone along to it are having a good time and are getting into the spirit of the occasion.
 Even if you meet someone whose tweets have annoyed you, remember that this person has made the effort to turn up. And getting to know people for real is a whole lot different from being irritated by their online babble! You may find you have much more in common than you realized by extending a warm handshake and being willing to listen.
 At the beginning of the event, thank everyone for attending and explain what the Tweetup is all about, and what you hope that the attendees will get out of the event. At the end of the event, thank everyone once again, both for attending and for making the event worthwhile.


If you would like contact details or indications of enthusiasm for future Tweetups, leave a list for placing details on, along with a marker, and encourage people to fill this in at some stage during the event.

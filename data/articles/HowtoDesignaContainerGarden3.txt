 The different plant habits are upright, mounding, and trailing. You can use all three types of plants in your container.


One idea is to use a tall plant in the middle for the focal point, mounding plants to put around the focal point, and trailing plants to hang over the edges.Other terms used are “thriller,” “filler,” and “spiller.” Thrillers refer to the upright habits, fillers, refer to the mounding, and spiller refers to the trailing plants.
 You could put plants together that are all somewhat similar in size. You could also group plants together in a range of sizes that complement one another. For example, tall sunflowers could be in the same container with medium-height zinnias and small daises. You could use filler like baby's breath to round out the variety.
 Be creative and don’t be afraid to use plants of a variety of textures for the fillers and spillers. This will generally make the design look more natural and less contrived. For example, sweet potato vine is leafy and bright, creating a thick texture. You could contrast this with a brightly colored thriller, such as a bird of paradise. Ornamental grasses are also a good choice; they come in many different sizes, colors, and growth habits.
 Try planting a variety of herbs, since they have different textures, grow well together, look attractive and all share a similar function. You could also arrange different kinds of flowers in containers. Choose flowers with a variety of petal colors -- they could complement (or contrast) with one another.


For example, you could group a variety of herbs like lavender, thyme, basil, catnip and rosemary together.
If you wanted to try something visually appealing with flowers, try a few different types of blooms in a range of shades. For instance, for a purple theme, you could plant violets, purple pansies, irises, bell heather, verbena and lavender.

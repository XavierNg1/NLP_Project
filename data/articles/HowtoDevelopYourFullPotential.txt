 As children we are full of excellent ideas, they never stop flowing because we have an open mind and belief in ourselves that we can accomplish just about anything. However, as we grow up fear of if we are doing the right thing and of speaking out and being ridiculed takes over and we stem the flow of our imagination and ideas. We hold back our thoughts and this can stop us from developing our full potential.;
, So focus on your skills and abilities and let your thoughts run free, put them to use and truly excel in life.
 Characteristics that you can nurture and that will lead to developing your true and full potential include:


Working hard – putting your all into everything you do when working towards what you want in life
Having patience – things don’t happen overnight so have patience and you will be rewarded
Determination – stick to your guns and never give in when things don’t go your way or you come across hurdles
Commitment – be committed towards your goals and what you want to achieve, set goals in mind and don’t let anything or anyone stand in your way of reaching them
Organizational skills – the more organized you are the easier the road to success will be, plan out your ideas to their fullest before putting them into action
Learn from mistakes – you will make mistakes along the way but you can learn valuable lessons from these and move on
Confidence in yourself – you have to be self-confident and believe in yourself and your ideas, there is no room for doubt
Stay realistic – don’t set yourself goals that you cannot realistically achieve in a set amount of time, by setting yourself unrealistic goals you are setting yourself up for failure again and again.
 Once you have these facts clear then you can go full steam ahead towards achieving what you want.

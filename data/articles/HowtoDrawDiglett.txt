 Then draw two parallel lines down from the side to make the body; they should end at roughly the same place like any parallel lines. Don't make them too long, though; Diglett isn't that big!
, This will be the dirt. Remember to sketch lightly because it will be erased soon., Put the vertical line between where you want to put the eyes and a horizontal line under where you want to put the nose. Erase the inside lines if you have trouble seeing your shapes., It helps if you look at a reference of Diglett. Draw the rocks and soil around the mound of dirt and give it the shape of unearthed soil. Erase the circle after you draw the dirt., Look at the vertical line and draw an oval. On the horizontal line, draw a small oval standing up for the eyes and on the other side another eye. Erase all of your construction shapes that are inside Diglett.,

Decide where your light source is. Is your Diglett facing towards the light? Draw a line of dark brown near the top right or bottom right of his body and colour that small patch to show the light isn't hitting his back. Colour the rest of his body in a lighter brown.
Is the sun behind him? Mask him in shadows, but colour his back in light brown.
Colour his eyes in black or even pencil and leave a white spot for his pupils. Do not fill in the spot as a Diglett pupil is white. Colour his nose pink and like the eyes leave a white spot.
The soil should be grey.


Draw a background. Is he in a rocky place or in a clearing surrounded by trees?
Draw a few more Digletts! Digletts are very social Pokémon and love to burrow with other Digletts.

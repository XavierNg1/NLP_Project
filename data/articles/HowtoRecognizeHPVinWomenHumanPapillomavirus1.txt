 The most evident symptom of a low-risk HPV infection is genital warts. These warts may appear as small raised bumps, flat lesions, or small protrusions from the skin. These warts tend to be grouped, and can show within days or weeks of infection.In women, genital warts are most often seen on the vulva and labia, but may also occur around the anus, in the vagina, or on the cervix.
Low-risk HPV strains may also lead to some lesions around the cervix, but generally speaking will not lead to cancerous cell development.;
, High-risk HPV rarely has any associated symptoms unless it has progressed to an advanced stage of cancer. This is why it is important to get an annual pelvic exam from your OB-GYN, who may be able to detect problems before they advance to a cancerous or pre-cancerous level. Symptoms of advanced-stage HPV that may be causing cervical cancer include:Irregular bleeding or spotting between periods or after sexual intercourse.
Irregular menstrual cycles.
Fatigue.
Weight loss or loss of appetite.
Back, leg, or pelvic pain.
A single swollen leg.
Vaginal discomfort.
Odorous discharge from the vagina.
 High-risk HPV most commonly causes cervical cancer, but it has also been linked to cancer of the vulva, anus, and throat.These cancers can be detected early if you get regular medical examinations, which is why it is important to get regular screenings.


On exposed areas, such as the vulva or around the anus, swipe a flat palm over the area to check for lumps that may indicate genital warts.
If you believe you have been exposed to HPV at any point, alert both your OB-GYN and your general practitioner, and ask them to screen you for any potential cancers associated with HPV.

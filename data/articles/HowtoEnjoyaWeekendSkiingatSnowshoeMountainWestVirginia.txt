 There are places for rent around the area, including houses.;
, This makes using the resort supplied maps a bit confusing, since the trail maps and the resort maps are depicted from different perspectives. Further complicating matters is that the resort features slopes on three different faces of the mountain including two faces that are directly opposite each other. That is just difficult to express on the map.
 As mentioned, Snowshoe is really three different skiing areas. The main section has the bulk of the runs. It has a few long blue and black runs but the majority of the area is either green or short black/blue runs that empty into greens at the bottom of the hill.


The Widow Maker run - this is at the far extreme left of the resort. Its remote location keeps the lift lines very reasonable all day.
The Western Territory - this is located across the street from the main area. This is the place for the most technically challenging skiing that the resort has to offer. It only features two 1.5 mile (2.4Â km) runs, both black (with one containing a double black section at the bottom). Get there early to avoid the crowds.
The last area is called Silver Creek - this is accessible via a short, free shuttle bus ride away. This is the section of the resort that features night skiing, the main terrain park and snow tubing. Tucked away in the back are two very nice black runs. One of which can prove to be a favorite run for beginners and those who are uncertain on their feet, since it isn't too steep. It is especially good when it has some nice soft powder. The lines here do not tend to be long.

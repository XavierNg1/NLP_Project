 You can either break apart an aloe vera leaf and rub the gel onto your bites or use a commercially bottled aloe vera gel.
 You can wash with green or black tea, comfrey tea or a tea made from fresh or dried lavender flowers. Alternatively, you can place used tea bags directly onto the bites.
 Try crushed basil or calendula flowers. You can also try just a drop or 2 of basil oil.
 You can make an oatmeal bath on your own, or you can buy the oatmeal bath at your local grocery or drugstore. Tepid water is important. Hot water has a tendency to dry your skin out.
 Make or buy a tincture of echinacea and put just a few drops onto the bite. You can also make a skin wash from fresh echinacea flowers and warm water., Mash the coconut up, and then put the pieces in the blender, shell and all. After you blast it, you should have a nice pulp, and this is what you are going to use to treat your flea bites. Rub the paste onto the affected areas, and wrap in a towel for about an hour, and then just wash it off. You should do this about three times and you should notice the swelling of the bites reducing in that time. Then just do it again before you go to bed and you should be almost all clear in the morning. If not, just repeat the process.

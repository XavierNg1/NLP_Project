 This is the most important thing. If you get scared, chances are you won't do the trick. And half the time, you would have landed the trick the first time had you just committed. So don't ever wuss out. How, you ask? Well, for starters, when you go up to a trick, come up with a word you can use to get yourself to commit. Some good ones are "Balls Out," "what is so hard about this trick anyway," "Be a Man," or "Just do it." These should really help you.;
, You will get very bored very quickly by doing the same old stuff every day, just riding, say, a Factor X ramp, or a small flat bar in your garage, or even a set of stairs near your house. Try to go out and do a new spot every day. Get your friends or even parents to drive you and some friends to different skate spots or parks--this way, you can get used to skating a bunch of different things.
 Most skateparks don't have the best street obstacles, and you'd be lucky to have a stair set at the park. Instead, look for skate spots at places like supermarkets and schools. (Namely, Jewel Osco's Shipping Docks work good, and most mini malls have some good stair sets.)

, It doesn't matter if you slam while trying something cool; chances are, you can get back up and try it again. If you break your leg while skating, your friends will respect you for it. Every slam gets you tougher.
 You never know when you'll get bored, and you never know when you'll see a good spot. Better safe then sorry.
, When you think to yourself "what if i fall off and hurt myself" or "what if i break my board". Well, chances are you won't hurt yourself and your board's gonna get wrecked (eventually),so get over it. Just think to your self "I can do this" and then just do it. And anyway, why be scared of pain? It only lasts for a few minutes, then it's all good again.

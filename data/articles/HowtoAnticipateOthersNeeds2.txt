 Do not approach strangers alone. If you're going to approach a stranger, do it in a place where there are a lot of people around and preferably with a friend. You don't know what these strangers could do to you.


If you're approaching a small child, approach them in a way that they feel safe as well.
 If the person you are looking at is laughing or smiling, then obviously they don't need anything. A head buried in the arms, slumped shoulders, or (mostly for small children) crying all signal that the person is unhappy and in need of something.
 If the person you are observing is having a conversation, try to listen in to get a hint about what they need. To do this, take a seat near them, maybe a table over. Appear to be doing something normal, like eating or reading a book, and listen to the person talk. Try to find out what their problem is.
 Ask them if they are okay and if you can help them with anything. You can gently bring up one of your past observations, saying something like:


Are you okay? You look a little sick.
I thought I heard you say you lost your wallet. Would you like some help finding it?

, The exception to this is if they are a total creep, in which case you should politely excuse yourself from the conversation, or if they are a small child who is lost. In that case, they obviously need help and it is up to you to help them.
 It's fine to be a friendly stranger lending a helping hand, but you'll appear creepy if you're staring at people, butting into their conversations, and trying to help everyone who walks by.

 Remember, it is not your job to find your friend a job. It is their responsibility and they should take initiative for themselves. Also, if your friend is the type of person who likes to do things for themselves, you may seem more overbearing than helpful.


Sometimes people like to do things for themselves or some people don’t like to say no but really want to.
You know your friend the best and depending on their personality act accordingly.
 It is good that you want to help your friend find a job and your friend will more than likely be very appreciative of that. However, they may not want or need your help all the time. It is best to offer your assistance but be prepared for them to say “no”.


If they say “no” at any given time do not be offended.
It is their job search and you should let them make their own decisions.
 Being supportive of a friend during their job search means encouraging them to stay on track by looking for the best jobs for their qualifications and not giving up. Job searches can take some time. Letting your friend vent about the process, providing your honest opinions and providing words of encouragement such as “don’t give up, you have great qualifications” can do more than you think.

 You can do this by heating some water in a kettle, and then pouring it into a cup. You can also do it by pouring some water into a mug, and heating it in the microwave. The water does not have to be boiling, but it needs to be hot.
 If you are using watercolor pencils, you don't need to leave them in for that long; you can just dip them into the water for a few seconds.
 If you are doing a picture, such as a smiley face, start with the background first. You will add the details later. If you make a mistake, wipe it off using your finger or a q-tip.


Give the pencil a quick flick when you take it out of the water to knock off any excess water.
 Once you are happy with your design, you can add the final touches. For example, if you are drawing a smiley face, you can draw the mouth, eyes, and outline.


If the pencil starts to dry and become hard to work with, dip it into the water again; you don't have to leave it in there for 5 minutes this time., This should only take a few seconds. Be careful not to touch your tattoo during this time, or you might spear your artwork. Avoid blowing on the tattoo to help it dry faster. If you used a lot of water, you might end up "spreading" the water and "ink" while blowing on it.
 This tattoo will only last until the next time you take a bath or shower, but coating it with hairspray will protect your artwork and keep it from chipping.

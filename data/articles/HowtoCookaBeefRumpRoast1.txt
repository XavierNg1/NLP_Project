 Don't remove all the fat from the roast, but if it has a thick or tough layer on one side, use a sharp knife to loosen it, then pull it off and discard.;
,, Place the roast in the pan and cook until it is brown on all sides.


Don't move the roast around in the pan until it is browned and ready to turn. Moving the meat will prevent it from browning thoroughly.
Do not overcook; remove the meat as soon as it is brown on all sides. The point is not to cook it through, but to bring out the flavors in preparation for roasting.
 You may use the same dutch oven you used to brown the roast, or a clean roasting pan.
 Season liberally with salt and pepper.
 Place in the oven and roast for 1 1/2 hours, or 30 minutes per pound.
 Remove the lid or foil from the pan and insert a meat thermometer into the roast.


Rare meat is done when its temperature has reached 125 degrees Fahrenheit(52 degrees Celsius).
Medium rare meat is done at 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius).
Medium well meat is done at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).
Well done meat is done at 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).



Carve the meat with a sharp knife and serve sliced.
If you'd like to make gravy, pour the drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Add a few tablespoons of flour and stir until thickened.

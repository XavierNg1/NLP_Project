 There are two main ways to open the Task Manager:


Press Ctrl+â‡§ Shift+Esc.
Right-click the Taskbar and select "Task Manager".;
, If you don't see the "Startup" tab, click the "More details" button first.
 All of the programs that start with your computer will be listed here. Select one that you want to prevent from starting with Windows.


If you aren't sure what a program is in the list, right-click on it and select "Search online". This will open your default web browser and search Bing for the program information.The "Startup impact" column will give you an idea of how much each program will slow down the startup process.
 This will prevent the program from starting with Windows.


It is generally safe to disable any program on this list, though it may affect how the particular program runs.
 If you've disabled all of the programs on the list and you are still plagued with pop-ups when you start your computer, you may have a virus or malware infection. The best way to combat these is by using your antivirus program in combination with Malwarebytes Antimalware (malwarebytes.org).

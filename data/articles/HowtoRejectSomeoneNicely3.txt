 If you’re stuck trying to reject someone who can’t take a hint, won’t take no for an answer, or is just a creep who won’t leave you alone, you may not have the luxury of kindness. Just get things done quickly and safely.


"I'm sorry, I'm not interested in pursuing this further, and that's all there is to say. Good luck and goodbye."

, A good “poker face” will help; if you know you’re a terrible liar, it’s probably best just to skip trying.


Lie as little as you think you need to. A smaller lie is easier to sell than a big one.
Trot out that fake phone number or fake boyfriend/girlfriend if you need to. Or try (“I” focused) statements like “I just got out of a long-term relationship;” “I don’t date outside of my religion/culture;” or “I think you look too much like my brother/sister.”, This is a situation where a text or email can suffice. Particularly if you have any concern that the person may lash out in anger at your rejection, feel free to place some distance between the two of you before doing what needs to be done., Some people simply need an absolutely clear, no-doubt, no-wiggle room, outright rejection to get the picture. Don’t hedge, don’t leave any seeds of uncertainty. As politely as you can, be blunt.


Don’t ignore their texts/calls/emails until after you have clearly expressed your desire not to be involved. Once you’ve made yourself clear, then you can ignore their pleas, complaints, rants, etc.
If you ever feel threatened or unsafe because of the other person, get help and/or contact the authorities. Some people really can’t handle rejection.

 Use a comb to part your hair in two places to create three sections with even amounts of hair. One section is on the right side of your head, one in the middle, and one on the left side. Use your fingers to hold the sections separate from each other.
 Keep the sections tight, so the finished braid won't come loose. Now the right section has become the middle section.
 Cross the left section over the middle section. You've now completed the first segment of the braid. Keep holding the sections taut and apart from one another.
 Keep weaving the left section over the middle, then the right section over the middle, always holding all of the sections taut and separate. Keep braiding the sections together until you run out of hair.
 Hold the braid in place by wrapping a hairband around the end, leaving a 1" unbraided tail to keep it secure.
 Now that you know the basic braiding form, try these gorgeous hairstyles to show off your new skills. They may take some practice, but you'll be pleased with the results.



Do a French braid. French braids start at the scalp, incorporating hair from the sides of the head, and end in a braided tail secured with a hairband. Done correctly, a French braid will keep your hair out of your face all day and earn you plenty of compliments.

Do a fishtail braid. This pretty braid looks more delicate than a regular braid, since you're working with smaller sections of hair.

Try a Dutch braid. This looks like a French braid, only inside-out.

Create a rope braid. This is made by twisting the strands of hair as you braid them.

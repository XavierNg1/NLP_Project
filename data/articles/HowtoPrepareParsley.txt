 Parsley is normally sold as a bunch. It is best to buy fresh parsley rather than dried parsley. When buying it, make sure that the leaves are fresh and bright green and don't look wilted or yellow.
 When not dried, it should be kept in a plastic bag and sprinkled with water when it appears wilted. It could also be stood upright in a jar with a little water, as long as you clipped the ends.
 Washing parsley is very similar to washing spinach. For this, you need to fill a bowl with cold water and place the parsley in it.
 Repeat this process with clean water until the water no longer gets dirty after washing the parsley.
 You can use a knife or kitchen scissors.

When using a knife, hold the tip of the knife down with your non-dominant hand. Then move your dominant hand up and down the leaves until the desired consistency is achieved.
When using kitchen scissors, put the parsley in a bowl and keep on snipping with the scissors until it is chopped to the desired consistency.
You can also rip the parsley, instead of cutting it.

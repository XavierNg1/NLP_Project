 Once you have succeeded in cleaning up your language in one situation (say in front of your nephew), add new situations week by week.


For example, if you successfully did not cuss in front of your nephew all week. Next week do that, and do not swear when near playgrounds.
If you are not successful at your first goal, then that means your challenge was too big. Make it more manageable. Instead of never cussing in front of your nephew, make your goal smaller. Such as, "I will not cuss before 8 am", or "I will not cuss at the drive through window". Pick a time frame and situation that you know you can do, then expand the challenge from there, week by week.
 The key to success is to pick manageable situations and time frames to improve in. It will take time but slowly you will ease out of the cussing habit. It may take years before not cussing becomes your new habit. Self-improvement is always difficult but undeniably worth the effort.

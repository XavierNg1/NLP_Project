 Life is going to throw a lot of curves your way and finding humor in less than ideal situations can be very useful. Put things in perspective. If you have a flat tire or a bad public speaking moment, take a step back and realize it's not the end of the world. If someone says something hurtful to you, be the first to laugh at yourself. It shows you understand you may have flaws and aren't afraid if others recognize that.;
, One way to prevent taking yourself too seriously is to stop dwelling too heavily on the negative. If you're having a less than ideal day, try to find something positive thing about that situation.For example, if you get a flat tire, be glad it didn't happen on a highway or lead to an accident. Tires always need replaced eventually. This just expedited the process.
 Rather than being worried about hiding things you are sensitive to, embrace them and laugh at them. If you are sensitive about your weight, make a joke about it and get everyone to laugh at it with you. This will loosen you up, but also make you less apt to worry about others and what they think about your sensitivities. Start slow and in appropriate situations. Do it around people you like and trust and who you feel comfortable being vulnerable with.

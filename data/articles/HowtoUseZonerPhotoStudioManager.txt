, You can do this in two ways.


Acquire your images. You can do this through:


Getting them through a device (camera or thumb drive), through your TWAIN device (scanner), or copy from the clipboard.
Navigating through your computer to find your images. Manager starts you out at 'My Pictures'.
 This allows you to maneuver your way around your computer's folder structure.
 Your choices there are:
Acquire
Edit
Information
Publish
Workspace


Look at the Edit options. These are the things that you can do without going into the Editor.
Look at, or change, information about your photos.
Organize your images. You can create albums, folders, and web albums.
Create something with your photographs. The options you have are creating a panoramic image, a 3D image, or a postcard.
Publish your images. There are a lot of things that you can do with your image and Zoner Photo Studio makes it easy.
Manipulate your workspace. You can make your workspace suit your workflow.
 You can click on one or more photographs and click on one of the quick fixes in the upper right hand corner.
 The histogram helps you see what your photo's 'spread of colors' is.

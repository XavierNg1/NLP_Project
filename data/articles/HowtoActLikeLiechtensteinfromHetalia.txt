 Liechtenstein is so innocent, so don't start swearing or talking about inappropriate topics. Remember, she's only about thirteen years old.;
, Lilli doesn't talk as much as most of the other characters.
 Lilli is almost always with her brother, and she looks a lot more innocent with him.
 Never ever EVER be rude!

, Like the little pictures Switzy drew for her in Axis Powers!

, Lilli is only a child, so don't act like an adult. But, don't act like Sealand, where you pull pranks and yell.
 Liechtenstein's voice is higher, but not irritating. It's soft and sweet, not loud and harsh.
 Liechtenstein wears bows quite a bit, so don't leave that out.
 This may sound easy, but it is vital! She's always happy, so try not to be anything but. Of course, we're all human, so it isn't always possible. But, for the most part, don't be a downer.
 Low-cut tops and short skirts are your enemies!

, When someone's cooking or cleaning up, offer your help. Insist, even.

 Choose whether you want your doll to wear pants or a dress/skirt. Decide on the skin color. You could opt for realistic flesh tones, other solid colors, or patterns.
 Use a ruler to measure two inches of length on an old piece of cloth. Mark the two-inch mark across the cloth with washable marker or tailor’s chalk.
 Cut on the line you just created. Divide the cloth into 13 to 18 equal parts. You can do this with the marker or tailor’s chalk. Cut the cloth into strips.
 Roll two strips into a ball. Take two more strips, and fold them over the ball. Tie the strips right below the ball with a ribbon or rubber band.
 Lay two to three fabric strips over the doll’s head. Position the strips lengthwise running down the body. Make sure the head is in the center of this layer.
 Tie the long strip with a ribbon or rubber band directly below the head. Fold the top half of the strip down so that the head is visible again.
 Repeat Steps 5 and 6. This will give both sides a complete appearance of clothing.
 Take two more strips. Lay one on top of the other. Fold each of the ends into the center. Twist the strips to thin them out a bit. Tuck them into the doll’s body below the rubber band marking the head., Tie off the area right below the arms. Use a rubber band or ribbon to do this. Securing the arms will also form the chest and the waist.
 Gather the area below the waist into two equal parts. Twist each side once to make them thinner. Tie the bottom of each side to give the appearance of legs, ankles, and feet.
 Cut out small circles of blue, brown, or green fabric to make the eyes. Use a small piece of red yarn to make the mouth. Glue these to the face.

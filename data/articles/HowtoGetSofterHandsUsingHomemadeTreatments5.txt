 Harsh chemicals and other unnatural substances can really do some damage to your hands! Take precaution and wear gloves whenever possible.
 If you live where it's cooler or it just happens to be winter, wear mittens (or gloves) to cover the skin. Prolonged exposure to the cold can really dry your hands out.

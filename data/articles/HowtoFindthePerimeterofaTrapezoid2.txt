 To do this, draw the height from both top vertices.

If you cannot form two right triangles because one side of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the base, just note that this side will have the same measurement as the height, and divide the trapezoid into one rectangle and one right triangle.
 Since these are opposite sides of a rectangle, they will be the same length.For example, if you have a trapezoid with a height of 6 cm, you should draw a line from each top vertex extending down to the bottom base. Label each line 6 cm. 


, (This is the bottom side of the rectangle.) The length will equal the length of the top base (the top side of the rectangle), because opposite sides of a rectangle are of equal length.If you do not know the length of the top base, you cannot use this method.

For example, if the top base of the trapezoid is 6 cm, then the middle section of the bottom base is also 6 cm.
 The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle (the side opposite the right angle), a{\displaystyle a} is the height of the right triangle, and b{\displaystyle b} is the length of the base of the triangle., Make sure you plug in the side length of the trapezoid for c{\displaystyle c}. Plug in the height of the trapezoid for a{\displaystyle a}.

For example, if you know the height of the trapezoid is 6 cm, and the length of the side (hypotenuse) is 9 cm, your equation will look like this:62+b2=92{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=9^{2}}


, Then, subtract to isolate the b{\displaystyle b} variable.

For example, if the equation is 62+b2=92{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=9^{2}}, you would square 6 and 9, then subtract the square of 6 from the square of 9:62+b2=92{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=9^{2}}36+b2=81{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=81}b2=45{\displaystyle b^{2}=45}


, (For complete instructions on how to simplify square roots, you can read Simplify a Square Root.) The result will give you the value of the missing base of your first right triangle. Label this length on the base of your triangle.

For example:b2=45{\displaystyle b^{2}=45}b=45{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {45}}}b=45{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {45}}}b=35{\displaystyle b=3{\sqrt {5}}}So, you should label 35{\displaystyle 3{\sqrt {5}}} on the base of your first triangle.
 To do this, set up the Pythagorean Theorem formula for the second triangle, and follow the steps to find the length of the missing side. If you are working with an isosceles trapezoid, which is a trapezoid in which the two non-parallel sides are the same length,the two right triangles are congruent, so you can simply carry the value from the first triangle over to the second triangle.

For example, if the second side of the trapezoid is 7 cm, you would calculate:a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}62+b2=72{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=7^{2}}36+b2=49{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=49}b2=13{\displaystyle b^{2}=13}b=13{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {13}}}So, you should label 13{\displaystyle {\sqrt {13}}} on the base of your second triangle.
 The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all sides: P=T+B+L+R{\displaystyle P=T+B+L+R}. For the bottom base, you will add the bottom side of the rectangle, plus the bases of the two triangles. You will likely have square roots in your answer. For complete instructions on how to add square roots, you can read the article Add Square Roots. You can also use a calculator to convert the square roots to decimals.

For example, 6+(6+35+13)+9+7=28+35+13{\displaystyle 6+(6+3{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {13}})+9+7=28+3{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {13}}}Converting the square roots to decimals, you have 6+(6+6.708+3.606)+9+7=38.314{\displaystyle 6+(6+6.708+3.606)+9+7=38.314}So, the approximate perimeter of your trapezoid is 38.314 cm.

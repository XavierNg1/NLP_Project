 Find a medium-sized bowl and mix the rest of the 1/4 cup of water, 1/2 cup of light corn syrup, 1 pinch of salt, and the 3/4 cup of white sugar., Put it back into the medium-sized bowl and continue to mix (use a mixer)this time you're going to add the mixture of cold water and the 2 packets of gelatin powder together, set the mixer on high and mix for 10-12 minutes, make sure to mix until the mixture is lukewarm and fluffy. take a spoon and fill up the peep molds. (Or if it's easier, use a piping bag if you're going to use a piping bag make sure to scrape the mixture into the piping bag immediately, then fill the molds)., After letting them sit, gently and carefully remove the peeps. Use the 1/2 cup of colored sanding sugar to roll the peeps in. To add faces use and melt the 1 tablespoon of chocolate chips, after melting the chocolate chips put the melted chocolate into a small plastic bag, use scissors and cut a small piece off the corner of the bag, (Use the corner of the bag to make the peep's face)., A batch of homemade peeps make great Easter/Christmas gifts!

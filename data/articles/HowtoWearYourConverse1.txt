 This is a versatile look with many possible options, such as:


Wear your Converse with skinny jeans for a modern look. If you have high-tops, you might even tuck the hems of your jeans inside the tops of your Converse to show off the side patches.






Wear them with bootcut jeans for a subtler look. Longer, wider jeans will show only the toe of the Converse.






Wear them with old jeans for an old-school grunge look. This is a good option for everyday use.






Wear them with flare jeans and a Free People top. This is a "hippy" or free spirit look. Hang loose!






Wear them with baggy jeans for a gangster style. To achieve the look popularized by Lilâ€™ Wayne, tuck baggy jeans into red, boot-style Converse, which should be laced no higher than the ankles.

, There are several ways to do this well:


Wear shorts and identically colored socks with your Converse. Wearing red high-tops with medium-length red socks, for example
Wear some short jean shorts and converse. High tops are best for this look, but low tops work fine too. Some clever lacing might also add some flair to this simple look (see below)






Just make sure your shorts are short enough. It won't look good if they're too long.
, Put a nice long, oversized sweater on, and wear long tights that reach the ankles. This look works for either high Converse or low Converse.

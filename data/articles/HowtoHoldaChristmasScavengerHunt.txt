 You'll need to create several clues to the "finder" to alert them to the next place where they'll find the next clue.;
, If you can, prepare yourself with several boxes (boxes that look like gifts work best) to hide each clue inside. You can also place the clue underneath safe Christmas decorations, tinsel, or something else. Only use stuff that is associated to Christmas, and plan out where each will go so that you can tackle the actual clue writing.
 Think up several rhymes that will help guide your kids to their next intended location.


Use your imagination when thinking up ideas. The key is to keep your kids mind's thinking, yet still keeping them uninformed until the very end.
 Make sure to disperse them into several rooms over long distances. If you have more than one floor, you can even have them chase up and down the stairs at times. Criss-cross the notes. If you can, have the clues hit into every room of your house.


Make sure you second-guess your own kid's intended route-markings, after you place the clues in their intended spots. Check to make sure the planned route you've set up for your kids can safely get them and you there, without crossing into a former location's answer.
A light mark of a pencil can help make sure you haven't crossed into a previous location's clue a second time around.
Clues that are in a room, can be placed in two different spots, but make sure they are easy to get access to.
 This could probably be inside cabinets in the bathroom or inside a master bedroom, or wherever you decide it imperative for them not to look.
 Either wrap up several gifts in a separate box, or if the gift is larger than one other gift box, have it in a place where you can be assured your kids can't accidentally notice the first time around and move it shortly before the scavenger hunt begins.
 Enjoy the hunt, and get into the Christmas spirit!

 olive oil
1 tbsp. honey (organic is recommended)
Whisk
1 container with a lid

, Make sure that they are well mixed. You can use the container that you will be storing the exfoliating scrub in.
 Do this until the lemon juice, olive oil, and honey combine into a medium-thick solution.


You can adjust the amount of honey and olive oil you use depending on how thick or thin you want the scrub to be.
 Whisk the whole mixture together until it’s well blended. You can add more sugar depending on your personal preference.
 Use a gentle cleanser to wash your face with lukewarm water, then pat your face dry with a clean, dry washcloth.
 Use gentle circular motions to apply the scrub to your face. Avoid your eyes and mouth while applying.
 If you have any cuts or open acne on your face, avoid applying the scrub to those areas as the lemon juice will sting them. In addition, the friction from applying the scrub may make your acne worse.
 Let the solution sit on your face for 7 to 10 minutes. During this time, the mixture should help tighten your pores and even your skin tone (lemon), reduce the appearance of scars (olive oil), remove dead skin and clean your pores (sugar), and prevent acne (honey)., Rinse your face with cool water until the scrub is completely gone, and then pat your face dry with a clean, dry washcloth.
 Seal in the moisturizing effects of the scrub with your favorite moisturizer.
 You can also apply this scrub to your entire body. If you do this, you’ll want to focus on rough spots like your elbows, knees, feet, and hands. Rub the solution in circular motions over your skin for 3 to 5 minutes.


You needn’t be as careful as you were with your face, as the skin on the rest of your body is less delicate.

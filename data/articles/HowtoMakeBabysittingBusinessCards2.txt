 Make sure it's a durable card stock so it won't just tear or crumple in someone's pocket or bag.
 Make as many as you'd like.
 Now is the time to add in the info the parents will need to know. Some possibilities include:


Your name
Your contact info (phone number or email)
Location (never exact; stick to cities and areas only)
A catchy phrase
When you are free (the times and days you can babysit)
If you have any certification
If you have any experience
Possibly how much you charge, but you may want to negotiate that separately for each family.
 Add colour and stickers and drawings. You could even add a picture of yourself or a babysitting picture from the internet. Just be careful not to go overboard; you want to appear professional and organized, and a huge number of stickers or doodles can negate that impression.

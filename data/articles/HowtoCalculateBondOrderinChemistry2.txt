 A single covalent bond has a bond order of one; a double covalent bond, a bond order of two; a triple covalent bond, three – and so on.In its most basic form, the bond order is the number of bonded electron pairs that hold two atoms together.
 In any given molecule, the component atoms are bound together by bonded pairs of electrons. These electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom in "orbitals," each of which can only hold two electrons. If an orbital is not "full"—i.e., it only holds one electron, or no electrons—then the unpaired electron can bond to a corresponding free electron on another atom.

Depending on the size and complexity of a particular atom, it might have only one orbital, or it might have as many as four.

When the nearest orbital shell is full, new electrons start to gather in the next orbital shell out from the nucleus, and continue until that shell is also full. The collection of electrons continues in ever-widening orbital shells, as larger atoms have more electrons than smaller atoms., This is a handy way to visualize how the atoms in a molecule are bonded to one another. Draw the atoms as their letters (e.g. H for Hydrogen, Cl for Chlorine). Illustrate the bonds between them as lines (e.g. – for a single bond, = for a double bond, and ≡ for a triple bond). Mark the unbonded electrons and electron pairs as dots (e.g. :C:).Once you've drawn your Lewis dot structure, count the number of bonds: this is the bond order.

The Lewis dot structure for diatomic nitrogen would be N≡N. Each nitrogen atom features one electron pair and three unbonded electrons. When two nitrogen atoms meet, their combined six unbonded electrons intermingle into a powerful triple covalent bond.

 If you are married and your spouse works but you do not work, some states classify your spouse’s income as community property. This means that you are entitled to the credit that your spouse’s income provides because you are a member of the household.


Not all states allow you to get credit using community property. Check to see if your state is one of them before attempting to get a credit card using community property.Arizona

, In most cases, you will be able to apply for the credit card from your computer. If you prefer to go to your bank and complete the application in person, make sure that you bring all of the required documentation with you.


When you arrive, ask to speak to an account representative.
When you meet with the account representative, say “I would like a credit card application.”

, When the form asks you to list your employment, write something that best describes you like “housewife,” “Stay-at-home dad,” or “homemaker.” Then, in the section labeled “other income,” you can list your spouse’s income.


Keep in mind that community property credit card applications do sometimes get rejected. To reduce the chances of a rejection, consider having your spouse co-sign your application or listing only half of your spouse’s income., Go back over your answers to make sure that all of the information is correct. After you have reviewed the application, return the form to the account representative.

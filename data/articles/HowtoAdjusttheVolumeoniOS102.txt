 The ringer volume affects your phone ringer, your notification sounds such as new texts and email messages, and your alarms. If you're using an iPad or iPod Touch, this will adjust the media volume instead.
 If you are playing a song, watching a video, or playing a game, the volume buttons will adjust the media playback volume on your device.


Not all apps will show the volume indicator when you are adjusting the volume., When the switch is moved down, exposing the orange color underneath, your device will be put in silent mode. Pushing the switch up will restore volume.

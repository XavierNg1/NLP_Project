 To create a cleanser to remove the paint from your skin, add a small scoop of coconut oil and 2 to 3 drops of lemon essential oil to a bowl. Mix the ingredients well to ensure that they’re thoroughly combined.You can use any type of oil, such as olive oil, jojoba oil, or canola oil, to help break down the oil-based paint. Coconut oil usually work best because it is solid at room temperature so it won’t make as big a mess as you rub it into your skin.
The amount of coconut oil that you’ll need depends on how much paint is on your skin. Start with a small amount and add more if the paint isn’t coming off.
Adding the lemon essential oil is optional. However, it is believed to be an extremely effective cleanser so it may help the paint come off more easily.
 After you’ve mixed the coconut oil and lemon essential oil, use your fingers to apply the mixture to the areas where the paint has stained your skin. Massage the coconut oil into your skin until the paint breaks down and comes off.If all of the paint isn’t coming off, add a little more coconut oil to your skin to help break down the remaining paint.
 After you’ve removed the paint with the coconut oil, use your usual hand or body soap and water to clean the residue from your skin. Pat your skin dry, and follow up with a moisturizing lotion to keep your skin from drying out.If you have a lot of paint on your skin, you may need to repeat the cleaning process two or more times to remove all of it.

 Some cats dig because they are bored and they have nothing else to play with. Others may feel lonely. Find toys your cat enjoys, so it won't mess with your houseplants. Also, play with your cat for about 30 minutes a day, broken up in two or three sessions.Your cat might like jingle ball toys or scrunchy toys. However, your cat may be equally happy with a cardboard box. When playing with your cat, lure toys are usually a good bet. Make sure you supervise your cat if you let them play with a string toys. Strings can be very dangerous if your cat swallows one.
 Most cats detest being sprayed with a water bottle, so it's an effective deterrent. Of course, you have to catch the cat in the act for this deterrent to be of any use. Simply spray the cat using only water, and the cat will jump down. Do it enough times, and the cat will likely avoid the plant., Some cats who dig in houseplants benefit from spending some time outside. However, you don't want to just suddenly let an indoor cat outside, particularly if the cat is declawed. You should supervise the cat on a harness and leash.To get your cat used to a harness and leash, start by placing the harness on the cat around the house. Begin with short periods, and work up to longer periods. When the cat is used to the harness, you can try taking it outside on a leash.

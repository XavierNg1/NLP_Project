 Some people will openly dispute and even discriminate against people who do not share the same political views. The reason for this is that many people tie their political concepts to their own personal identity. Any attack against a political view, therefore, becomes a personal attack. If this is the case with either your parents or yourself, it is probably best to avoid continuing to talk about politics with them (and others with whom you strongly disagree). Because political issues can be very polarizing you do not want your political differences to drive a wedge within your family and your associates. By avoiding political discussions with your parents you can more comfortably maintain your own political views while enjoying a strong and healthy relationship with your parents.Be prepared to say: I love you, but we obviously do not see eye-to-eye politically. Let's just avoid the topic of politics, at least until this election is over.'

Avoiding politics can be "peacekeeping", if you have already attempted to discuss your differing political views in an calm and civil manner.
 If your parents refuse to discuss your political views with you, then perhaps some of your conservative friends, colleagues, or teachers, etc. may be more open to discussions. You might want to locate people who share similar political views as you, and save political discussions for when you are with them.
 You can also help to maintain your Republican views despite familial differences, by becoming active within the party. For example, you could try volunteering for the Republican Party during an election campaign. In this role you will get to meet and communicate with like-minded individuals which can help to strengthen and reinforce your own political views.

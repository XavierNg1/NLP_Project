 When you're being photographed, or just when you're having fun showing off, flaunt your curves by standing with a jutting hip. Instead of planting your weight evenly on both feet, try putting your weight on one foot. This will tilt your pelvis upward on the side of the weight bearing foot.Exaggerate the pose by jutting that hip a little further.
 Place a hand on your waist or hip. The space between your inner elbow and your waistline will draw attention to your hips and make your waist look smaller.Try dropping one arm behind your jutting hip instead, for a sultry look.
If you're really hamming it up, raise an elbow and put your hand behind your head.
 Sitting or even standing with your legs crossed will narrow the line of your knees and make your hips look curvier. Only do this if it is comfortable, and take breaks!

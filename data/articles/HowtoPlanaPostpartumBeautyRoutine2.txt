It also makes styling your hair au-naturel much easier.Have your partner or a close family member watch your baby while you get your hair cut, or ask them to come along with you and the baby to your hair appointment.

 At times, you may not even have time to wash your hair, especially during the first couple weeks after having your baby. However, do not fret. Instead, use a dry shampoo to give your hair a clean look. Apply the shampoo to your roots.

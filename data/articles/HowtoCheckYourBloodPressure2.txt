 Purchase a wrist blood pressure cuff and read the instructions carefully. Strap the cuff onto your wrist and turn the machine on. Press the button that initiates the reading and wait for it to inflate. Keep your arm level on a table in front of you while the wrist monitor is working.When the process is over, the cuff will automatically deflate and the reading will flash on the screen.
You should be able to purchase a wrist monitor relatively inexpensively at your local pharmacy store.
 Find a blood pressure machine and follow the instructions on it. These types of machines typically require you to insert your arm, remain motionless while the machine inflates, and then wait for the reading. The cuff will automatically deflate when the reading is complete and you can remove your arm.Most pharmacies have these types of machines, including pharmacies inside grocery stores.
Make sure you take a minute or two to calm down and rest before you take your blood pressure reading.
 The most accurate way to check your blood pressure is to have it checked by a medical professional. Make an appointment with your regular doctor and tell the nurse (or the doctor) that you are interested in finding out more about your blood pressure reading.Some of the other machine methods may have a wider degree of variance than getting your blood pressure checked by a medical professional.

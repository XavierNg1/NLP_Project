 When paying bills or shopping online, you will typically have the option to use several different kinds of cards: credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cash cards or gift cards, etc. While it is up to you to use the card that makes the most sense, keep in mind that credit cards typically offer more protection against liability for fraudulent charges. If possible, use a credit card for online purchase to ensure you are covered.Make sure you are able to use your credit card responsibly.
 When you make a transaction using your credit card online, be prepared to enter the necessary information, which includes the credit card number, expiration date, and security code, as well as your name, billing address, and email address. Some merchants and services may require you to create a personal account, others may give you the option to complete the transaction as a “guest.””One click” shopping is another convenient method of buying online that some websites offer, allowing you to purchase something with the click of a single button, as soon as you see it on a merchant’s website. Just keep in mind that each of these “clicks” charges your credit card!

, Sometimes, the convenience of buying online can get the better of us. It is a good idea to double-check the items you have in your “cart” before finalizing your purchase, to make sure you didn’t accidently add items you don’t want, for instance. Most merchants will do this for you, by giving you the option to “review” your transaction before finalizing the transaction and charging your credit card.Expect honest merchants to send you a confirmation of your purchase via email or to show a confirmation on the website after you complete the transaction. Treat this like a receipt, and keep a copy for your records.

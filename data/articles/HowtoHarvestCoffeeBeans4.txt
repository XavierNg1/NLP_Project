 Squeeze the cherries to separate the seed or the coffee bean from the fruit.
 After you have separated the beans from the fruit, some meat will remain on the beans. Soak them in a bowl or bucket of water for one to two days to break down the fruit and separate it from the bean. The fruit will float to the top and can be discarded, while the beans sink to the bottom of the bowl.
 Drying the beans is a lengthy process, taking between 10 to 30 days, depending on the weather. It is worth the wait, however. Lay the bean on a wire mesh or concrete somewhere outdoors in the shade. Several times each day, stir and rotate the beans to make sure they dry evenly. You will know the beans are dry when their outer skin flakes off easily.

 Examine the Slinky mess you have. Figure out where one Slinky begins and ends.
 Try to figure out how the two Slinkies are attached. Look for U-shaped tangles and knots.
 Start your untangling job on the Slinky by tackling the tangle that is closest to one end of one of the Slinkies.
 Using one hand, keep the untangled end together so that it doesn’t end up tangling back into the rest of the Slinky mess.


You can also use a ruler or another straight, hard object, to keep the Slinky aligned.
 Rotate the Slinky around and around so that more coils move from the tangled side to the untangled side.You might need to carefully hang onto the tangled end with the other Slinky so that you don’t introduce more tangles into the mess.
 If possible, focus just on one Slinky that seems easiest to untangle.


If you can extract one Slinky from the other, then you can work on each Slinky separately to untangle them. There may be a point when one Slinky will become unknotted from the other Slinky.
 If your Slinkies are not coming apart, start working on another end of the Slinky. Twist the coils around and around to work out another tangle from another end.
, It’s likely that once you’ve gotten most of the tangles out, you’ll be able to see how the Slinkies are attached.
 Once you’ve identified the nature of the tangles, you can untwist them. Or, you can do a final rotation of the coils on one of the Slinkies to separate it from the other one.

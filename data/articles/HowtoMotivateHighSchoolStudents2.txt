 No matter how engaging you are, students will likely grow tired of purely listening. Try to encourage discussion and ask questions of the students frequently.


In your lectures, try to keep them light-hearted and maybe try to crack a joke every so often. Do not be too uptight and formal with lecturing.
 These would be role models that students can identify to, such as relevant or local authors, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists.


If the students can see clearly how to structure their learning or careers in order to achieve what these people have, they will be much more inspired in their studies.
Be sure the guest understands what the class is about so that it has some relation to the material.
 Tests and quizzes are an effective way to gauge the students' understanding level, but they can also add unnecessary stress. Students will respond better, and feel more comfortable, in discussions.


It is also important to remember that tests do not necessarily gauge the understanding level of every student. Some students simply do not test well, even if they understand the material.
 Students can tell when a teacher does not care about the topic he or she is teaching. It is incredibly important to try maintaining an interest in your subject.


Try to encourage the administration to allow you to have some wiggle room in creating your own curriculum. It is much ore difficult in public schools due to the common core, but try to fight for freedom in the classroom.

 Make sure that your phone is logged in with the Google account that has access to the document that you want to download. You can download documents that you've created, as well as any documents that have been shared with you.


You cannot download files on the iOS version of Drive, but you can save them so that they're available when your device is offline.
 This is the default format that Google Docs are downloaded as.
 If you want to download the Google Doc as a Word document, you'll need to export it as a Word Document first.


Open a Google Doc that you want to download as a Word document.
Tap the More button in the upper-right corner and select "Share & export".
Select "Save as Word (.docx)". This will create a Word document in your drive with the same name as the Google Doc, and it will open automatically.
Return to the Google Drive list of documents and then press and hold the new .docx file.
Select "Download" to save the .docx file to your device's Downloads folder.

 First, you want to turn the bottle upside down until the egg is positioned in the mouth of the bottle. This technique relies on you building up the air pressure behind the egg so it will come back out of the bottle.Make sure the egg is in the mouth of the bottle and the bottle remains upside down for the whole time.
 Keeping the bottle upside down, bring it above your head so that you can put your mouth around the opening of the bottle.Try to avoid pushing on the egg because it needs to remain in the opening of the bottle.


Keep the bottle upside during this whole process.
 With your mouth around the bottle, start blowing as hard as you can into the bottle. The air will go past the egg and build up the pressure behind it. As the pressure builds, the egg will be pushed back out of the bottle.Depending on how much pressure you build, the egg will either slide out slowly or pop out rather quickly. Take care not to get hit in the face with the egg when you take your mouth off the bottle.If the egg doesnâ€™t come out, you need to blow into the bottle harder.
The egg may land in your mouth, but it should remain intact. Take care not to choke on the egg.

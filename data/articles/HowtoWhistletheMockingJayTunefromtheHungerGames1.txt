 If you already know how to whistle you can skip this part.;
, First, wet your lips. You don't need a ton of spit dripping down your chin, just get your top and bottom lip a little wet. You could also drink some water if you prefer. Next, position your lips. There are several ways to do this:


The sound tends to be clearer and louder if you put your lips in a round O shape. It's often easier to make the O be a small O instead of a big, wide one.
The whistle is higher pitched and shriller if you form a broad, flat shape with your mouth.
 This is tricky at first, but if you keep practicing you'll soon make a decent sound.


Don't press your tongue against your teeth. That cuts off the airway for any sound to come through.
Curve your tongue slightly upwards, but don't let it touch the roof of your mouth. It also helps to curl your tongue a little bit at the sides, but not too much! Your cheeks should be sucked in, like if you were sucking a straw.

 The treatment consists of two phases: an iron reduction phase and a long-term maintenance phase.


Iron Reduction Phase:
A phlebotomist or health care professional will remove close to one pint of whole blood. This is usually done once or twice a week.
The treatment lasts until the extra iron in your body has been removed. This can take three months to one year - time varies from person to person.
During this phase your doctor will also check your hemoglobin (a protein that is a found in red blood cells) and serum ferritin levels.

;
, How often one needs phlebotomy is based on the severity of the symptoms.
 Treatments differ for men and women and the elderly.


Men most often need to have 3–4 US pints (1,000–2,000 ml) of blood taken out about once every 3 months.
Women may require 1–2 US pints (470–950 ml) of blood be taken out once every 6 months.
Older people may not need to have any more treatments, but they should still have their serum ferritin levels checked at least once a year.

 You should be facing down, with your arms shoulder-width apart and your legs extended. Your weight should be evenly distributed between your hands and feet., Exhale when you bend your arms, and contract your abdominal and gluteal muscles. Focus on keeping your back straight., Inhale when you push up and make sure to keep your back straight and your core and gluteal muscles tight., Work up to 4 sets of 12 reps. If the traditional push-up is too difficult for you, kneel at an incline, so that your back remains straight.For an additional challenge, move each arm 2 inches (5.1Â cm) outward, away from your chest. This push-up position will work your chest and deltoid muscles more than the traditional push-up with your arms at shoulder-width.

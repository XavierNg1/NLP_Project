 Alaska is not a cold person. She has strong emotions, and they see saw back and forth. In one part of the book, she is described as a person who goes “from a hundred miles an hour to asleep in a nanosecond.”


Sometimes in the book, Alaska is funny and very bubbly. In the next moment, she might switch to being cold and condescending. Sometimes she breaks down into tears.
Overall, you could describe Alaska as moody and a person whose emotions are chaotic and often expressed. She is often very sad, as she is still trying to deal with her mother’s death.
 Alaska is fairly obsessed with death. Her mother died. She jokes about death, and says she smokes to die. She hints at death in the novel. Her name, Alaska, came from a Velvet Underground lyric that starts, “she’s not afraid to die.”She thinks she will die young. Her jokes are macabre and dark. She has a dark side to her personality. She reads deep messages into things other people think are just pranks. Alaska’s life ends tragically. If you have thoughts of self-harm, you should seek help from a trusted adult or a counselor. Being as sad as Alaska Young is really not something you should desire.
Alaska is self-destructive, whether it’s substance abuse or cheating on a boyfriend. These are ways that she numbs her pain. She carries a lot of suffering and pain inside. Her mother died of an aneurysm in front of her when she was a young child, and she didn’t call 911.
 Alaska Young is a girl who loves books. Reading goes along with Alaska’s complexity. She’s smart, and she’s deep. She’s not a shallow person.


Alaska collects books from yard sales. If you’re not interested in books, you’re not going to quite capture her vibe.Reading adds layers of complexity to Alaska’s personality. She is interested in exploring other worlds and gets lost in other people’s lives because she rejects the concept of home for herself.

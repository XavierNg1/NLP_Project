 Cut the paper as wide as you want; a wider strip means both more drawing surface and a bigger figure to draw. If you wish to be really precise, try folding the paper and then cutting the strips on the creases. If you have a ruler, you can measure to be exact., Make the folds as even as possible.









A good trick is to first fold the strip in half multiple times. When the desired rectangle size is met, unfold the paper. Using the creases made from the folding, fold it accordion-style., For this step, you can draw it free-hand or use a stencil. Draw the person with the head, feet, and hands touching all the edges.
 As you cut, you can trim out any imperfections from the drawing. Cut carefully in order to keep the chain intact.
 The chain of people should be holding hands.
 Paper-people chains are neat in and of themselves, but with some markers, crayons, or color pencils, you can draw details on the people. Be creative and pick themes, draw different clothing, add stickers, or glue some glitter.

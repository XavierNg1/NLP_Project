 As you level up, you can unlock Skill Masteries. Masteries are passive skills that improve the character in many ways. They’re divided into six types, with each one augmenting the character in a different way: General, Advance, Attack Spec, Defense Spec, Tactical Spec, and Special. Only one mastery in each tier can be equipped, but you can switch the chosen Mastery at any time.
 General Masteries are basically the first tier of skill masteries available and improves your first set of skills. They are unlocked at level 14. Advanced Masteries, in return, improve on the latter set of skills, and is unlocked at level 19.
 Attack Spec, Defense Spec, Tactical Spec, and Special masteries are unlocked at levels 17, 22, 23, and 41, respectively. Attack Spec passively improves the basic attack stats, Defense Spec improves the basic defense stats, Tactical Spec adds chances to either debuff enemies or buff the character, and Special deals with improving Combo Skills from subclasses and giving minor stat bonuses.
 You can also buy Masteries from the Masters in Navea for Tokens, or find some in high-level dungeons. Keep in mind that you’ll need an absurd amount of Tokens (gained from doing quests) and a high level just to afford those, much less reach the level requirements.

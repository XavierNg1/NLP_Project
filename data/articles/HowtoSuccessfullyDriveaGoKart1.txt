 If you are selecting from seemingly identical karts, look for karts with fresher tires or from karts that have been winning previous races that day at the track. , This single tip is the most important lesson of fast go-karting. Winning a go kart race is about maintaining momentum throughout the entire track., You may think you are cool slamming on the accelerator, but sliding and jerking actually slow you down. Accelerate smoothly, brake smoothly to retain momentum and be faster all around that track. , For example when you are entering left turn you stay at the right side, then cut in the apex. Then drive to the right again. For a right turn, vice versa.


When you are just learning, it can help to follow a fast driver to duplicate her race line as closely as possible.
 Sliding and drifting may look cool, but they aren't actually fast techniques for the beginner or intermediate driver.


Brake at the end of the straightaways before you enter the turn. If you start breaking during the turn, you will slide.
Control your front tire grip. If your front tires stay in control, your kart will stay in the line you want. It can be OK to let the back tires slide a bit.
 Don't pass when there is risk that you will end up in the tires.
 Also, most go kart tracks will make you leave if you repetitively crash into people.
 If you go a lap without crashing then push a bit more and you might gain some seconds. If you crash, slow down a bit. Also learning about its history if it's quite old and quite big can help you "get into touch" with the track.

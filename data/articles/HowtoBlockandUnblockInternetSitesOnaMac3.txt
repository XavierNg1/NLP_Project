 Chrome, Firefox, and most other modern browsers allow you to install user-made extensions (or "add-ons") to adjust browser behavior. Search your browser's extension store for "block websites," "filter websites," or "productivity" to find apps that block websites. Install the app, restart your browser, then open the app settings and add the sites you would like to block.


Be careful of apps with low ratings, or too few reviews to judge accurately. Untrustworthy extensions may install malware to your computer.
This will only block websites on that browser.
 Blocking sites on your router will prevent any device using the wireless network from accessing those sites. Here's how to set this up:


Go to System Preferences → Network → WiFi → Advanced → TCP/IP tab.
Copy the IP address listed after "Router" and paste it into your browser's address bar. This should take you to your router settings.
Enter the username and password to log in to your router. If you have never set these, look up the default password for that router model. (User "admin" and password "password" are common defaults.)
Browse the router settings for site blocking options. Each router brand has a different set of options, but most allow you to block sites in an "Access" or "Content" menu.

 The American Psychiatric Association (APA) requires that psychiatrists pass state exams in order to become licensed. Fulfill your state's licensing requirements by passing the United States Medical Licensing Examination and/or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination. Each state has slightly different examination requirements having to do with specific state laws.


If you move states, you may have to sit for another examination to practice psychiatry there.In order to prescribe medication, you must also get a federal narcotics license and register with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)., This is not a requirement, but it improves your chances of getting a job as a psychiatrist. The ABPN offers certificates in general psychiatry and specialized fields like teenage psychiatry. Earn the certificates that apply to the field of psychiatry you wish to pursue.
 After you've been licensed, you have several choices when it comes to employment. You may apply for a job at a hospital, work at a psychiatric clinic, or open your own private practice. Figure out which work situation is the best fit for you, then fill out applications or take steps toward opening an office and receiving patients.


Working an a hospital or clinic setting provides stability and structure, but the hours can be long, just as they are for any doctor.
Opening a private practice is lucrative, but it may be tough to get patients when you're first starting out.

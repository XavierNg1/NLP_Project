 Great herbs don’t need fertilizer. Fertilizing your herbs makes them grow faster, but all that growing takes away from the plant’s flavor and can even turn them bitter. If your plants need a little bit of help, try fish emulsion or bone matter—and only rarely.If you do use a fertilizer (rather than fish emulsion or bone matter), avoid eating the plant for at least 6 weeks.
 Too much water will kill an herb faster than too little water. Once established, most herbs prefer to be a bit on the dry side which makes them great for a beginner gardener. Only water when the soil on top is dry to the touch. Check the soil regularly to see if it needs water., For the best herbs, start trimming your herbs as soon as they are mature so that the trimming will not kill them. The more you use them the bushier they become and the more useful they are. To harvest, cut close to a leaf intersection—the spot where the branch splits off to form leaves. This signals to the plant that it needs to grow more leaves.Harvest the leaves of your herb before the plant flowers. If your herbs are outdoors, harvest them in the morning, after the dew has dried off and before the day gets too hot.
Avoid washing herb leaves, as this strips away some of their flavor. A light rinsing to remove any dirt is enough, as long as you’re not using pesticides.
Harvest herb flowers before they are fully open.
Harvest herb seeds when the seed pods change color.
Dig up herb roots in late summer or the beginning of autumn., Great herbs are at their best immediately after you pick them because they are still alive. The longer you wait to eat them, the less flavorful they will be.
 Annual plants are plants that only live for one season—they need to be re-planted annually. This means that much your herb garden is not likely to live through the winter. When your herbs start to die in the fall, this is nature—not a failure on your part!

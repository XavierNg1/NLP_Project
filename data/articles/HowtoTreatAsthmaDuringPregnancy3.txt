 Effective asthma control can significantly lower the risks associated with maternal asthma.Effective asthma control means:


Minimal (to no) asthma symptoms during the day and night
Minimal (to no) exacerbations
No missed school or work
No limitations to activity
Maintenance of near-normal pulmonary function
Minimal use of short-acting inhaler
Minimal (or no) adverse effects from medication

, In order for you to achieve asthma control, it is essential for your obstetrician to be involved, and for all of your doctors to be in communication with one another. This allows for a comprehensive treatment plan.Your obstetrician should track your asthma symptoms at every check-up. They should monitor:


Day and nighttime symptoms
Peak flow measures and/or spirometry readings
Medication usage

, If allergy or irritants play a role in the your asthma, if there are other complications, or if the your asthma is especially severe, it may be best to consult with an asthma specialist. Just as before, it is very important for all of your health care providers to be in communication with one another and to work as a team., In order to keep your asthma under control, you must work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan. Together, you can determine the signals for being in “the green zone” (doing well), “the yellow zone” (caution), and “the red zone” (get help now!), as well as what measures to take if you need relief in each zone.You can print out a sample action plan at http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/asthma/asthma-action-plan.pdf and bring this with you when you visit your doctor.
When you are pregnant, it is very important to make tracking fetal activity a part of your plan. If you feel decreased activity or movement, contact your doctor.
It is a great idea to post this action plan in your home and/or provide a copy to anyone who may be around when you experience an asthma attack.

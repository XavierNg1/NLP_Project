 If you are the descendent of an Israeli citizen or Jew, or if you have married an Israeli citizen, you are able to apply for citizenship if you intend to settle permanently in Israel. You must settle in Israel to prove that you want citizenship for the right reasons and not just to gain an Israeli passport.
There is no time limit here on residency here. You just need to show proof that you are settling in Israel permanently. This kind of proof can include rental agreements for housing, work contracts, utility bills in your name, etc. You are not required to work during this time, but it will only help your case if you have work documents to show when you apply for citizenship.
 Visit the Israeli consulate or the Ministry of the Interior (Misrad Hapnim) with your birth certificate to prove your descent. You should also take your marriage certificate to the Ministry if your spouse is Jewish or an Israeli citizen.This is where the first stage of the application process takes place. They will give you the correct application forms to complete and tell you what other documents they may require from you.
 Once you have completed the application, you will be granted an Israeli identification card, along with citizenship documents (including a passport, though this document can take a bit longer to process).Apply for an Israeli driver’s license so that you have more documentation proving your residence status.The process for attaining an Israeli driver’s license includes getting an eye exam, visiting a physician for a health exam, scheduling a driving lesson, and taking a written examination.

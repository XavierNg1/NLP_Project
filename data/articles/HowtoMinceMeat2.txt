 Using the sharp knife, cut the meat into one to two inch (2.5 cm to 5 cm) cubes. They do not have to all be the same size, and they don’t all have to be exact cubes. Use 1-2 inches and cube-shaped as a guide that can be adjusted to the specific pieces of meat you’re using.
 Lay the meat chunks in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place them in the freezer to firm up. This should be at least 15 minutes and up to about 30 minutes. They should become firm but not frozen. Place the blade and bowl of the food processor in the freezer, too.








Chilling the meat gives you cleaner cuts and keeps the fat from melting during the chopping process. The same concept applies to the food processor. A cold blade and bowl chop better.
 To make sure the food processor runs well and chops the meat evenly, don’t fill it excessively full. Throw a couple of handfuls of meat into the processor at a time. The size of your food processor will ultimately determine how much you can mince at one time.
 If your food processor has a pulse setting, use this as opposed to a setting that runs non-stop. Pulse the meat at a speed of 6-8 for a few seconds at a time, checking the meat after 3-4 pulses. The meat should begin to form a ball around the edges.








It is better to leave the meat less chopped than to over-process it. If you end up with a smeary paste, you’ve definitely processed it for too long.

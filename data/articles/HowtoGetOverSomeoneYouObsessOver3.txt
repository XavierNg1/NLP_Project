 Avoiding the person is a good way to tell your body and mind that there are plenty of other people in the world who could demand your attention. Because it's true: There are plenty of other people out there, and your whole life doesn't have to revolve around one person.


Maybe you're in school with the person, or involved in an activity. Avoid the person as much as possible. Don't sit with the person at lunch; don't enroll in the same projects. As much as possible, be in a different place at a different time.
Don't put yourself in situations where you could bump into one another. If he goes to a lot of concerts during the summer, go play tennis instead. If she haunts the mall on Saturdays, only go to the mall during the week.
If you are forced to be in the same room, or do bump into him/her, just smile, make small talk if necessary, and make an excuse to leave. "Sorry, my friend needs some help with her homework," or something like that, could easily work.
 It's hard to control your thoughts, of course, but when that someone does something to get noticed or be near you, try to notice something else or be somewhere else. You won't get over someone you obsess over by just going with the flow.
 This one is kind of like the association game, except this time it actually involves something physical instead of being purely mental. See if it works for you.


Put a loose rubber band around your wrist. Every time you think about that person, give yourself a little snap with the rubber band on the inside of your wrist. An obsession is a habit of thought (a certain way of thinking) that you can decrease with punishment, i.e., the pain of the band snapping against your wrist. Soon you'll see how less often thoughts of them cross your mind. That's progress!

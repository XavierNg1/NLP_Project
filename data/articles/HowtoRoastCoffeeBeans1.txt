 When you first begin heating your green coffee beans, they will turn a yellowish color and start to emit a grassy smell. When they actually begin to roast, they will start to smoke and smell like true coffee., While you will start out with ‘green’ beans, when they begin to roast, your beans will go through a whole array of color. A good rule of thumb is to keep in mind that the darker the bean, the fuller the body of the bean.


Light brown: This color is generally avoided as it can result in a sour taste. The body is weak, the aroma medium and the sweetness low.
Light-medium brown: This roast is common in the eastern United States. It has a full body, a full aroma, and a mild sweetness.
Full medium brown: This is a common roast in the Western United States. It has a full body, strong aroma, and mild sweetness.
Medium-dark brown: This roast is also known as a Light French or Viennese roast. It has a very full body, a strong aroma, and a strong sweetness.
Dark brown: This is known as espresso or French. It has a full body, a medium aroma, and a full sweetness.
Very dark (nearly black): This is also known as Spanish and Dark French. It has a weak body, a mild aroma, and a low sweetness.
 As the beans begin to roast, the water inside them will begin to evaporate, causing a crackling sound to occur. There are generally two stages of crackling called first and second cracking. These two sounds occur as the temperature rises while the roasting occurs.

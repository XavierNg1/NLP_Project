 If your hearing loss is recent, a great place to get started is by registering with a disability resource office in your area. Doing so can help you gain access to services and accommodations in your local community.

Once you register, you might be assigned a special advocate to help you take advantage of various services.
If you are having trouble coping with a recent diagnosis, this center can also provide you with adjustment counseling services to cope with being deaf.
 Depending on your level of hearing loss, you might be able to select from a variety of devices. One of the most effective choices is hearing aids, which may help enhance your hearing and quality of life.

Based on your age, you might also be a candidate for cochlear implants, which are devices that are surgically inserted to connect directly to the auditory nerve. Such implants bypass any damaged structures in your ear to improve sound quality., Most public places align with the disability laws to provide assistive hearing technology such as closed captioning TVs and phones, amplified phones, FM systems and strobe lighting or vibrational alarm systems. In addition, you can take advantage of social technology such as social networking sites, modified video conferencing, chat rooms, and smartphones., Your local disabilities office probably offers a variety of skills-based courses for deaf or hard of hearing individuals. Check with your local office to find out which classes they have available.

In addition, you can take part in special programs such as Leadership Opportunities for Teens (LOFT). This program focuses on helping teens develop communication, self-confidence and leadership skills that are necessary to lead a full life.

 When connecting a printer to the network, you will need to connect it to the router, either via Ethernet or wirelessly. If you are using an older printer, you can use a print server to allow the printer to connect to the network.


Ethernet - Many printers can be connected via Ethernet to the router. This may only be practical if the printer and router can be in the same general location.
Wireless - Most new printers have built-in wireless, which allows them to connect to your wireless home network. Check the documentation for your printer to see the specific instructions for connecting to the wireless network.
 Some printers require you to install the software before adding the printer. Other printers will be automatically detected and installed by Windows.
 If the printer is connected, but is still not showing up, you can try manually adding it. This may be required for older printers that aren't automatically detected by Windows.


Open the Control Panel. You can access the Control Panel by pressing âŠž Win+X and selecting Control Panel.
Select "Devices and Printers". If you are in Category view, click the "View devices and printers" link. The window will display all of your connected devices.
Click Add a printer. This is located at the top of the window.
Select your printer from the list. The list of available printers may take a few moments to load.
Verify that unlisted printer is properly connected, has the correct software installed, and is compatible with your computer.

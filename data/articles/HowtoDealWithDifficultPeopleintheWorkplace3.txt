 You have basic rights to be safe and free of harassment at work. If things get to the extreme there are legal routes to take to end a hostile work environment., As mentioned above, getting to know how the human resources team works can help in extreme cases.


Most work places will have written policies for human resources that include a formal grievance or complaint process.
 This can be as simple as moving your desk away from the person you have a problem with or changing departments to avoid working with them. If the problem escalates you may want to consider getting a new job or taking the issue to your boss.
 An important part of this step is to make sure you are following the natural chain of command and don’t overstep your immediate supervisor unless they are the person you have an issue with.


Harassment on the job can lower performance so most bosses are willing to proactively address problems.Approach your boss with clear details of the problem. For instance, you might start off by saying “I am having a problem with…” then explain what you have done to try to resolve the issue before having to come to your boss.

 This method only works for chain necklaces. Unclasp the necklace, take the straw and thread one end all the way through, meet and secure the necklace clasps (for larger bulkier pieces using a toilet roll is a great alternative).;
, Place one sheet of Press N Seal on a flat surface, place your necklaces on the sheet and cover the top with another sheet and seal it down.
 This method works best with mini zip lock bags. Place your necklace in the plastic bag, bring the closed clasps of your necklace to the top so it's hanging out. Pinch the zip lock bag so that the rest of the necklace is secure.
 For more delicate chains and necklaces, placing them in a padded pouch, box or both is most suitable. If your pouch and box is not padded you can utilize bubble wrap, paper towel, cotton pads, etc.. For extra protection place your fragile necklace in a pouch and then in a jewelry box for stability.
 Place a small towel or placemat on a flat surface, laying your necklaces on the towel or placemat in evenly spaced increments. Carefully roll one end to the other. Secure by tying with a sturdy string/tie/rope.
 Have a clean carton on hand. Place your rings and earring pairs in separate cups of the carton. If you're worried about your earrings moving around in the cup you can utilize buttons. Just insert the earrings in the button holes to keep the pair together. For added protection, you can fill the cups with some kind of cushion (e.g. cotton, pieces of bubble wrap, paper towel). Close the carton.
 This method works the same for either box or case. Arrange your accessories and place your rings and earrings separately in each compartment. This keeps your jewelry stored neatly.
 This works best as a ring carrier. Just store all your rings into the case. For added protection and to keep your rings from bumping into each other, risking scratches, secure your rings by wrapping each one with paper towels, wrapping paper or packing paper.

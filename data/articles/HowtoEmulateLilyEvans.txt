 From what we know about Lily Evans she didn't judge people from what they looked like, and she could see good things in people that other people couldn't, as we have learned from Remus Lupin. So if there is someone at your school for example, that seems kinda lonely, try to get to know them. If you are too shy for this, have no fear! If they don't seem to wanna talk, you could just shrug and say that they can always come and talk to you if they want/need to.;
, We might not know many details about Lily's personality, but from what we've heard from various characters, she was open minded, incredibly kind, and was a good student. However, she did not tolerate bullying and had no problem standing up for herself! When James bullied Sev, she showed no fear, but walked right up to them, and told James to stop. Although, she could be rather sensitive. She got really, really sad when Sev called her a "mudblood". Understandable, the guy was her best friend, but still. She tried not to think about it too much though, and tried to stay positive even in harsh situations.
 Lily seemed to be the kind of girl that liked to show her natural beauty. So skip all those products that you may use right now, and show the world that pretty face of yours as it was meant to be! I'm not saying that you shall skip make up entirely, just don't overdo it. Put on some natural coloured eyeshadow, some mascara and if you'd like, some light blush. It's definitely enough!

, We all know that Lily had that beautiful, ginger hair. She also had olive green eyes that Harry later inherited when he was born. If you don't want to, or are not allowed to completely dye your hair red, get highlights if you can, but only if you want to. As for the eyes, I think it's uncomfortable to wear contacts, so skip them if you don't like the thought of wearing contacts!

, Lily is perfect as a role model, and I'm trying to think like her in various situations, but it's also important not to loose yourself!

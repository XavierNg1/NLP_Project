 Don’t immediately switch gears when you finish reading. (Switching gears immediately is the surest way to erase everything you just read from your short term memory.) You will process better and remember more if you take a few minutes to reflect on what you read.

Write a summary. Here are some sample questions you could discuss:

What is this writer’s purpose? Who is the audience?
What are the main points/topics covered?
What reasons and evidence support these main points?
How is it relevant to this course? Context.
What am I supposed to learn from this?
How and how strongly do I react to this? Why?


Question the material. What do I think is wrong/right? Why? What reasons do I have for my beliefs?

, This helps move the material from short-term to long-term memory.
 If you find you need to review the material in order to complete your assignment, you will be able to find the parts you need more quickly.

 You can set your iPhone or iPad to block specific websites, which will keep them from being accessed by any browser you have installed, including Safari.
 At the top of your General settings list, tap "Restrictions".
 If you haven't enabled restrictions before, you will need to create a passcode to lock them.
 In the Restrictions menu, tap the "Websites" option to access the blocking tools. You can choose to limit access to Adult Content, but to block specific sites tap "Add a Website" in the "Never Allow" section.
 Type in the website address and press the Done button. If the website has a mobile site, you will need to add both. For example, to block Facebook you would need to block "www.facebook.com" and "m.facebook.com".


To block for complex URLs, you may need to visit them first and then copy and paste the address into the Restrictions tool.
 Once you've set the block, try accessing the site. You should receive a message that the site has been restricted. If you can still access it, make sure that the URL was entered correctly. Copy and paste it if necessary.

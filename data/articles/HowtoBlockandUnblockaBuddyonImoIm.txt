 In order to block someone, you'll need to have started a conversation with them. You cannot block someone by manually entering their username.


This process is essentially the same on Android, iPhone, and Windows.;
, You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to block the user.
 The user will be added to your block list, and the user will no longer be able to message or call you. The blocked user will not be able to see if you are online or offline.
 This can be found in the lower-left corner (â˜°), and will display your username and several options.


If you're using the Windows chat client, click the "imo" menu and select "Blocked users."

, This will open a new menu with additional options.
 This will display a list of contacts that you have blocked.
 Tap "Unblock" again to confirm that you want to unblock the person. The blocked contact will be returned to your contacts list, and you'll be able to call and message each other again.

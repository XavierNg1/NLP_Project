 Add one part gum arabic and two parts distilled water to a small bowl. Stir vigorously to combine.


The exact amount will vary depending on the amount of fondant you need to cover, but you should always maintain these proportions. For most small pieces, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) gum arabic and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) water should suffice.
 Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Afterward, vigorously stir it again to combine the components.


Resting and re-stirring the mixture in this manner should help the two ingredients combine more evenly, making the glaze more effective after application.
 Using a small, soft paintbrush, immediately paint an even layer of glaze over the fondant.


Work carefully to avoid getting stroke marks, fingerprints, or other marks in the glaze.
Immediately after applying the glaze, the fondant should have a very high gloss. This will not be the way the final finish looks, however.
 Wait for the glaze to dry a full 24 hours before handling the fondant further. Once dry, the fondant should be slightly hard and semi-glossy.


This glaze should be permanent, so re-application is not necessary.

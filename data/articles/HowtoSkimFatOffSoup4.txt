 Submerge a long-handled ladle into the center of the stockpot. The bottom of the ladle should touch the bottom of the pot.
 Spin the ladle around the soup in a spiral pattern, working from the center of the stockpot out toward the edge.


You should notice foam and other fat gathering around the edge of the pot as you swirl the ladle around.
 Use the cavity of the ladle to spoon away the fat gathered along the edge of the stockpot.


Hold the ladle at a slight angle and submerge it so that the rim just barely falls beneath the surface of the liquid. Skim along the surface, picking up as much fat as possible. Some liquid will also be lost in the ladle, but if you work carefully, it shouldn't be much.

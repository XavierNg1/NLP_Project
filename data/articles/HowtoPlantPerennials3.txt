 Hold the container upside-down and shake it lightly to loosen the perennial's roots. Gently pull the plant from the container.


Examine the root ball. If many roots are visible, the plant is likely rootbound. To force new growth in a rootbound plant, slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of roots using a sharp knife. With your fingers, break up the root ball by separating the roots along the side of the root ball. If you don't break up a rootbound plant, the roots may continue a circular growth pattern and stunt the plant's growth.
 Using a shovel or garden trowel, dig a hole that is slightly wider and the same depth as the perennial container. If the perennial is planted too deep, the plant will experience stress and may not thrive.
 Using a garden trowel or your hands, fill in around the plant with soil. Gently tap down the soil around the plant using your hands. The root ball should be even with or slightly below the surface of the garden soil.
 Water immediately after planting. Examine the plant each day for about 2 weeks while the roots become established. Make sure the soil around the plant is moist and that the perennial isn't wilting. Most perennials need daily watering during the first week, and every other day during the second week. Perennials planted during the summer may require more frequent watering.

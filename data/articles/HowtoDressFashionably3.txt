 The best thing to do is to buy long-lasting pieces that will retain their class throughout the seasons. Fashion changes extremely quickly! Don't fill your wardrobe with things that won't be appropriate the same time next year; you'll just regret buying it. Every women needs half a dozen items that are staples in her wardrobe. Find yours.


In the context of what flatters your body, find a handful of your favorite, variable pieces. A classic white button-down, a favorite pair of flatteringly-cut jeans, boots, cinched-waist skirt and a sweater, for starters. You can mix and match these items all you want for dozens of different looks.
 Now that you've got the basics, it's time to have fun! Buy some great shoes, cute accessories and get a haircut! Bright purple leather trench looks too tacky? A handbag in the same style will be fantastic.


After all, the devil's in the details. Accessories and hairstyles are the parts that show your sassy side the easiest. So cut out that celeb 'do from that magazine and head on over to the salon. Might as well get your nails done while you're at it.
Note the ol' adage, "Put on your accessories, then take off one before leaving." And it rings true: accessories are great--but a necklace, bracelet, earrings, rings, watch, sunglasses, and hat are a bit much. Pair a couple of accessories with each outfit; don't go overboard.
 It's always good to have an outsider's perspective, especially a friend to make the time pass by more quickly. Bring along someone who can give you well-formulated critiques regarding your clothes. The image we see in the mirror isn't always how we really look!


Take everyone's perspective with a grain of salt. Her style is her style, not yours. But if she absolutely adores something on you and you don't see it, take a moment to look. Wait a minute to see if you can find what she sees. Your mind may open up to a brand new style.

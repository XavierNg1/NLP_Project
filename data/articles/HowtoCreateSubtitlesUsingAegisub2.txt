 Under the audio waveform, there is a text box. Type the desired text in this box.
 As you might have already seen, there are two frames in the audio window; one is red, and the other blue. The red simply signifies when the text will appear, and the blue signifies where the text will end. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the red frame to the beginning of the waveform; then drag the blue frame to the end of the waveform.
 If you don't like the way the subtitles appear on the video, you can always edit the size, font, or color using the Styler Manager, located under the Video menu.
 Yes, you can move the subtitles to anywhere you want on the screen. In the vertical toolbar to the left of the video, click the second icon from the top. A square box will appear underneath the videos; just drag and drop the subtitles wherever you like.

This can help you save space as it allows you to organize more effectively, making the most of your closet space.You can place some shelf dividers on, say, the top shelf of your closet. For many, this space gets messy easily. You can then use the top shelf to store items clogging the bottom of your closet, like shoes and scarves.
 If you have clothing that does not need to be hung up, roll it up. T-shirts, flannel shirts, and some pants can be rolled up prior to storage. This will free up a surprising amount of space in the drawers in your closet, giving you a lot more space., Shoe hangers and shoe trees do not just have to be used for shoes. You can use them to store things like nail polish, toiletries, jewelry, and other small items that don't have a place. By hanging a shoe hanger somewhere in your closet, this frees up drawer space and floor space., If you have a lot of chaotic drawers in your closet, you may not be using your space in the most efficient manner.

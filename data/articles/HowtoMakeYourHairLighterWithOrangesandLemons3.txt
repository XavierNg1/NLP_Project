 Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of club soda, ¼ cup (59 ml) of fresh orange juice, ¼ cup (59 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of fresh grapefruit juice to a spray bottle. Shake the bottle lightly to mix the liquids.You can substitute lime juice if you’re out of lemon juice.
Because the spray contains an essential oil, it’s best to use a glass spray bottle. Essential oils can break down easily in plastic containers.
 When the water and juices are combined, mix in 1 drop of sage essential oil. Shake the bottle vigorously to ensure that the oil is fully incorporated.You can find sage essential oil at health food stores and organic grocery stores.
 Mist your hair with the spray, and use your fingers or a comb to work it through so all of the strands are evenly coated. Allow the spray to sit on your hair for two to four minutes., After the spray has soaked into your hair for several minutes, shampoo your hair as your normally would. Follow up with your usual conditioner.Use the spray every two weeks for brighter, lighter hair. If your hair is extremely dry, use it once every three weeks.

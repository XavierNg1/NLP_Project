A Benetton is a basket usually made of willow cane, but can also be of other woven canes and can be round or long. They are sometimes, but not always, lined with a cloth so the Benetton must be well floured before use to prevent sticking. The basket should be at least twice the size of the dough you put in, preferably 2.5 times.
Benetton s can be sourced from artisan or professional bakery stores, but its usually easiest to buy them online. You can use unvarnished and unpainted wicker baskets that are sourced from thrift or craft stores as long as they have minimal gaps between the canes. Scrub them clean before use and dry them. Then flour them before use.
 Ideally a batard style is easiest, but mould the dough according to the shape. Place the bread seam side up (so the good side is down).
 Invert the Benetton & bread onto the hot stone or baking tray, and lift the bane ton off vertically. The "good side" should be up. Further decoration is usually unnecessary as the wicker cane and flour leaves a pattern in the dough, but you may add some slashes with a razor to add extra details.

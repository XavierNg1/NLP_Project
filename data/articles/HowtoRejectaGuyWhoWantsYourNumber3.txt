 One way to sidestep the issue is to say that you don't ever give out personal information to strangers as a way of staying safe. Of course, this has an element of truth for most people, so you're really not lying.You could say, "I'm sorry, I don't give out my number to strangers. I've had some bad experience with doing that in the past, so I don't give out my number anymore."
If you make it so he realizes it's a general rule, he won't feel so personally rejected.
 Even if you don't have a boyfriend, you could use a pretend boyfriend to make the rejection easier. If the guy thinks you have a boyfriend, then it's nothing personal against him.As an example, you could say, "I can't give you my number. I have a boyfriend." Most guys will walk away without another thought at that point.
 Another way to sidestep the issue is to ask for his number instead. That way, the power is in your hands, and you can do with it what you want. Just make sure to take the number yourself. Don't hand him your phone, as he could use it to give himself your number.It may seem cruel to take a number just to blow the guy off later. However, if a guy won't leave you alone, it's a good way to get him to stop.
 Don't be afraid to walk away if you need to do so. If a guy turns hostile after rejection, get security involved and then leave where you are as soon as possible. It's always better to be safe than sorry.If you're not in a place that has security, tell management or call the police if you feel your safety is threatened.
It's also a good idea to go out in groups. While guys don't limit asking girls out to clubs, when you are going out to the club, take some friends with you.

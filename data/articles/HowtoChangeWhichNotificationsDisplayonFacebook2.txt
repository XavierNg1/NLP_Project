 If you're logged into Facebook, doing so will open your News Feed.


If you aren't logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) into the top-right corner of the screen and click Log In.
 It's in the top-right corner of the Facebook page.
 It's near the bottom of the drop-down menu.
 This option is on the left side of the page.
 It's near the top of the page. The "On Facebook" category of notifications covers all internal notifications you'll receive on Facebook (e.g., notifications for pokes or likes).
 It's toward the top of the page, just below the "Sounds" heading. Some types of notifications you'll see here include the following:


"Close Friends activity" - Covers notifications for activity from close friends like new posts, likes, and uploads. Clicking the On or Off button on the right of this category will prompt a drop-down menu with the opposite option available.
"Birthdays" - Regards notifications for your Facebook friends's birthdays.
"Pages You Manage" - Covers your created or managed pages. You'll see a button that says Edit to the right of this heading; clicking it will allow you to enable or disable notifications for each page you manage.
 Do this by clicking the button on the far-right side of the category (e.g., you'd click Edit to the right of "Group posts" or On to the right of "Live Videos") and then tailoring the options based on the kind of notifications you would like to see (or not see).


When you're done, you can exit Facebook or go back to browsing your News Feed. Your changes will be saved.

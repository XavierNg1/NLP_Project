 The more information you have, the easier it will be to find out if that person is in jail. At minimum, you should try to have the individual's full name on hand. Other identifying characteristics, like that individual's birth date, age, gender, race, and hair color, can also be helpful in performing a search, especially if that person has a common name.If you do not have the full name of an individual, you might be able to track that person down if you at least have a nickname and date of arrest. You will not be able to use any online resources with this information alone, though, and will likely have a harder time finding out the information you need.;
, The people that are normally housed in jail have been arrested but have not yet been arraigned, are awaiting trial but have not been released on bail, or are serving sentences that are less than one year in length.


If someone is serving a sentence that is longer than one year, they are usually housed in prison.
 If you know the status of the person that you believe may be in jail, it may be easier to figure out which jail he or she is being held in. If the individual has just been arrested, it is likely that he or she will be in the jail of the county where he or she was arrested.


Additionally, if someone is awaiting trial or arraignment, they will most likely be held in jail in his or her home county, or whichever county that person was arrested in.
However, sometimes if an inmate is serving his or her sentence, the jail will transfer the inmate for space reasons.

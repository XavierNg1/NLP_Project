 Explore the ways you learn, and then create new patterns. When you're done, think about them. For those ideas that are more theoretical, figure out how you can connect them to your life experiences and what you've learned from experiments you've conducted in the past., Do this even if it seems silly. For instance, imagine life as a banquet table, and you as one of the dishes. Now evaluate the table through several points of view of the diners.


What would they expect to see on that table?
What would disappoint them if not included?
Is there anything laying on the table that's absurd, like a blow dryer?
How can you make the arrangement more appetizing, and what can you add to make it unappealing?
By challenging your imagination, your brain gets used to new thinking patterns, and creating fresh ideas will become easier.
 Divergent thinking is not so much about finding answers as it is about asking the question to get to those answers. Asking the right questions will get you what you are seeking. The challenge, though, is to figure out the questions to ask.


The more you formulate specific questions that delve into the differences, the better your chance of succeeding.
Simplify complicated matter by breaking it down into pieces. Then expose each one by asking, "What if?"

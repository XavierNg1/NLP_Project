 In a small bowl, add the sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Mix together.
 Use a chef's knife to cut the pumpkin into 2 inch (5.1 cm) pieces. You can either cut them into cubes or slices that are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.
 Coat baking dish with cooking spray, olive oil, or butter to prevent the pumpkin from sticking. Place the pumpkin into the baking sheet.
 Use a basting brush to cover the pieces with peanut oil, olive oil or butter. If you do not have a basting brush, then use a spoon to drizzle the oil onto the pumpkin, being sure to coat each piece.
 Sprinkle the pumpkin with the cinnamon and sugar. Cover the baking dish.
 Have the pumpkin bake in the oven for 40 minutes. Remove the baking dish and stir the pumpkin, then bake again, uncovered, for an additional 15 minutes. Pumpkin should be soft when finished.
 Pumpkin can be served as a side dish or as a dessert. Consider serving with whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream. Dust with a little bit of spice for a nice presentation.

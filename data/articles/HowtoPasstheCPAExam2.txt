 Sometimes, studying on your own can be difficultâ€”there are distractions, questions that seem to have no answer, and times when you just need the support of your peers.
 A Google search for "CPA study groups" is a good place to look.


Check out accounting forums to find people in your area who are looking to form study groups for the exam.
Social media sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook offer connections to study groups. Log in, and in the search field, enter "CPA" and you'll see a list of all CPA-related groups.
Most CPA exam prep providers also host online study groups, and links to other candidates in your area.

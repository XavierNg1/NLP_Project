 Since they are above three weeks of age or are about that age, they should have a warm place to stay. Decide a place that's quiet and peaceful. You can't expect them to sleep in a place with rock music or whatnot.;

If you buy the liquid type of kitten formula, do not microwave it because this creates it creates areas in the formula that are too cold and too hot; it is not evenly warmed. Try putting the formula in a container, then putting the container in hot water.
 See whether they are able to eat solid food. If not, give them warm proportions of canned sardine or tuna or anything moist and soft. Keep this balanced with moistened kitten kibble. Rich foods will give them diarrhea.

If you'd rather go for a different name, don't let others stop you by saying rude things like,"What?! That is SO common!" or "What kind of name is that?"

 Their soft little fur needs warmth.

 If you want to improve the condition and shine of your hair without changing the color, opt for a clear gloss treatment. Color-free hair gloss provides intense conditioning by actually lowering the PH level of your hair. Purchase an at-home treatment or visit a salon for a professional clear gloss application., To boost your current color or give it a slight twist, check out hair glosses in color tones that are within the range of your current color. Note that rich, golden hair tones can improve the look of your skin tone and make hair look shinier. In addition, warmer tones can boost how bright your hair looks, especially during cold, gray seasons.If you are unhappy with your current hair color and want to use hair gloss to change it, it is best to visit a salon to leave the treatment (and coloring choices) to a professional.
 Rescue your hair color from brassiness (due to factors such as sun exposure or hair products) with a balancing hair gloss. Purchase a shine gloss treatment in a cool color tone to minimize brass and add shine to your locks. Hair gloss is a cheaper and less-damaging alternative for repairing your hair color than frequent re-dyeing., Since hair gloss is a non-permanent hair treatment option, feel free to test different products to find the one that suits you best. For best results, start with clear, temporary glosses and work up to color-depositing, demi-permanent ones. Look for hair gloss in pharmacies, beauty supply stores, or online.

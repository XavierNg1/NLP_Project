 Make sure you are properly warmed up before you start practicing your kicks. Focus on stretching your legs. As a minimum, stretch your knees, then do half splits, splits, front splits, butterfly stretches. Also do kick warm ups. Donâ€™t forget to go deeper every time in your stretch. This will increase your flexibility and you will be able to kick higher.

 Don’t smoke, eat, or chew gum while you’re talking. This will make it hard for the deaf person to read your lips. Never cover your mouth while you’re talking. , Yelling or talking loudly to a deaf or mostly-deaf person will not help them to hear you any better. In addition, yelling looks aggressive to the person you’re talking to and makes others nearby feel uncomfortable. , Most deaf people can only understand about a third of what you say while lip reading, so it’s important not talk too quickly. Try to speak clearly (don’t mumble or stutter, if possible), but don’t exaggerate your speech, either. It’s fine to start off speaking at your normal pace. You can always slow down if you need to. Don’t over-enunciate. Exaggerating lip movements will make it harder for the deaf person to read your lips, not easier. , Try not to get too complicated with your wording in the beginning. The more complex your phrasing and vocabulary, the more likely your deaf companion is to miss something. Try to avoid using slang or jargon that isn’t widely known. , If multiple people are speaking at once, the deaf person won’t know who to look at to follow the conversation. This means that they’ll miss parts of the conversation. When someone else is speaking, don’t turn away from the deaf person in your group. This will make them feel left out of the conversation. You don’t have to look at the deaf person while someone else is talking, but try to make sure your face is visible.

 Do you both like sports? Mention that with him when you both talk. It's going to make him find you highly more interesting.;
, This is one of the hardest things some girls can do. When you're around your crush, you mumble and grumble and somehow you say really rude things like, "so what did you get on your test? Guessing C-?" and can really hurt his feelings. If you always feel this way, take a few breathes and try small talk with him.
 This is not always a good idea, but flirt. Say things like, "Is that a new cologne?" but don't go extremely flirty saying things like "If you were an ice cream, I would love to take a scoop of you". It sounds tacky and completely immature.
 And you are friends, laugh/giggle with him and at him. Even when his friends don't laugh, you should laugh so the tension between the air can lower.
 Don't ask his friends if he likes you, cause they will tell him. see if he gets nervous around you or if he's shy. See if he watches you out of the corner of his eye. If he is, try to catch his eye and smile at him.
 He will only like you if you show him the real you.
 Or he will be jealous.
 Make sure you try to show you're having fun.Â 

,, Guys don't like girls that cover themselves in makeup; it makes them unsure of what's underneath.
 Don't act crazy around him. Act calm, sweet, nice, and mainly cute!

, It all depends on the look.
 Sometimes, they will smirk and tease him if they see you. They might know if he has a crush!

, Let's say that the boy you like is there with his friends. You arrive, but just sit down. Do not act excited he is there. Act like it's no big deal. Even thought you are excited he is there, don't overdo it. He might suspect something is up.

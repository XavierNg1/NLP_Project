 The Signal icon looks like a white speech balloon in a blue box. Signal will open up to a list of your recent chats.


If Signal opens up to a chat conversation in full-screen, tap the back button to go back to your chats list.;
, This button is in the lower-right corner of the chats list. It will bring up your contacts list.
 You can scroll down on your screen to see the rest of the list, or use the search function at the top to quickly find a contact by their name or number.
 You will see your contact's first name initial letter next to their full name and number. If the letter is written in blue color, this means your contact has an activated Signal account and they're using Signal. If it's gray, your contact does not have Signal on their device.

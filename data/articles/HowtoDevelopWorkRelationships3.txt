 Your coworkers will respect a person that can keep things professional and that has the best interest of the organization in mind at all times.
 When you spend a significant portion of each day in the workplace, it is very easy to bring personal problems and issues to the office with you. While venting to a closer coworker is fine on occasion, keep things professional. Do not make it a habit of discussing your personal issues with colleagues or bragging about your personal life at work; this is not professional and it can taint your image. A person who portrays himself or herself as a womanizer or a "man eater," respectively, will not always yield the impression of a trustworthy businessperson.
 Be careful of the jokes you tell and the nature of the conversations you have in the workplace. Do not make jokes concerning race, sexuality, politics or other taboo subjects in the workplace. No matter how entertaining you may think you are being, you run the risk of offending your colleagues.

 Although there are no required immunizations, the Center for Disease Control recommends that you keep up to date on routine vaccines, such as diphtheria, polio and measles, mumps and rubella. They also recommend that you get a typhoid fever, rabies, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccine if you will be going outside any of the main tourist areas.


Get your vaccinations at least 6 weeks in advance of your trip for maximum effect. See a travel medicine provider in your area.
 If you plan to go out into the smaller towns or jungles, you will want to start taking anti-malaria pills a few days before you enter the country.

If you do not decide to take malaria medication, it is a good idea to use insect repellent to avoid being bitten by disease-carrying mosquitoes. You can also avoid being bitten by wearing long sleeved shirts and long pants and sleeping underneath a mosquito net.
Belize is generally more expensive than most tourists realize, because it is far more expensive than neighboring Mexico and Honduras. Its relationship with Britain and America makes it an extremely popular tourist destination.

 Run the mint under a stream of cold water, being careful not to damage the delicate leaves. Shake off any water droplets clinging to the leaves and stems and set the mint on a layer of paper towels.Herbs should always be washed before use or storage, as they can contain traces of dirt and bacteria or residue from pesticides and fertilizers.
Turn the faucet on to a light drizzle so that the stream of water is not so heavy.;
, Use a pair of scissors to snip off the ends of the mint stems. This will allow the herbs to soak up water more easily. Be careful not to cut the mint sprigs too short, or they may not be able to sit properly in the container.Cutting the stems at a slight angle will improve their water intake., Fill a small vase, jar or another shallow container about one-third of the way full. Insert the bundle of mint stems-first into the container so that the snipped ends are completely submerged. The mint will now have a constant supply of water to draw from, increasing its shelf life.Change the water in the container every few days to keep it clean.
For even more pristine preservation, use distilled or mineral water., Drape an empty grocery bag or piece of saran wrap over the top of the mint bundle to keep the herbs from being exposed to the air. Twist the plastic wrap around the base of the container and use a rubber band to secure it. You can then store the mint vertically in the refrigerator, if you have room, or out in the open in the corner of your countertop.When properly covered and given lots of water, your mint will last for weeks, or possibly as long as a month.Refrigerated mint will usually last a few days longer than mint thatâ€™s kept at room temperature.

I want to apologize because it was me who misunderstood the situation. How can I make it up to you?”

, If you are secure in your relationship, you will not feel the need to be with your partner all the time. However, you may still want to have a discussion about what boundaries you think are appropriate in regard to other people. Try to remember that your partner had a life before you two got together. Encourage your partner to spend alone time with their friends and family.

You can say, “We have been hanging out a lot lately. We should try to spend more alone time with our friends.”
Remember to hang out with your friends and family, as well. Don’t ignore them just because you have a new boyfriend or girlfriend.
 The best way to lose your partner’s trust is to lie, which may include not telling the whole truth. Try to be open and honest with your partner all the time. If you feel like you have to lie to your partner, then you should reassess the relationship. Also, hold your partner to the same standards you hold yourself to.If your partner catches you in a lie, it will be hard for them to trust you again.
If you catch your partner in a lie, bring it up. You can say, “You told me that you were going to have dinner with your family Friday night, but someone told me that they saw you at the movies with your friends. I feel bad that you had to lie to me. Why did you feel like you needed to lie?”

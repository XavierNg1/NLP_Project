 Place your bowl and whisk in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes. If you are using a stand mixer or a food processor, see if you can detach the bowl, and put it into the freezer. If you can't, then don't worry about it.Working with cold equipment prevents the whipped cream from getting too soft.
 Place everything, except for the strawberry purée/jam into the bowl of your mixer. Beat the ingredients together until they get soft peaks., You can use something that you bought from the store, or you can make your own.
 You want the color and texture to be even and consistent. If you are using a handheld mixer, be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.
 At this point, your whipped cream is ready to use. It may not be perfect to your liking, however, so give it a taste, and add more sugar, cream, or purée/jam. Be sure to beat the frosting well after each addition.


If it is too thin or not sweet enough, add more sugar.
If you want more of a strawberry flavor, add more strawberry purée or strawberry jam.
If it is too thick, add more heavy whipping cream.
 Use the frosting within 3 days.

 Handling seasonal bipolar disorder can be stressful and can take a toll on your physical health. In turn, being tired, ill, or stressed can cause your seasonal bipolar disorder to be more challenging to manage.Being active can help you reduce stress and tension, manage your seasonal bipolar disorder, and boost your overall health.


Try going for a walk or doing some stretches as a way to energize yourself, stay fit, and release tension.
Participate in an organized activity like a spinning class, tennis, or water aerobics as a way to socialize a bit and be more fit.
 The foods that you eat do a lot to support your overall health and immunity, but they also influence your brain health, hormones, and stress levels. All together, your diet can play a key role in how well you handle your seasonal bipolar disorder. Make sure that you’re eating foods that will help your body and mind function at their best.


Eat foods that are high in nutritional value like whole grains, fresh fruits, unprocessed foods, water, and juices.
For instance, instead of having chips, a soda, and a chocolate bar out of the vending machine for lunch, consider bringing a fruit cup, chicken salad sandwich, and lemon water from home.
 It will be much easier for you to manage your seasonal bipolar disorder if you are well-rested. At the same time, you want to make sure that you aren’t sleeping too much, which may be a sign of a depressive episode.


Go to bed at a regular time each evening and wake up at about the same time each morning so that you can get 6-8 hours of sleep each night.
Create a bedtime and waking routine. For example, you might do a little work, read a book, and then watch the news before bed. In the morning, you might meditate, do some yoga, and then have breakfast.

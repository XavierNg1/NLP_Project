 These are often called cones. You will need to make one for each rose you want to make. Fashion the cone with a point at the top and a rounded base. Make them a little smaller than the petal size. Insert a toothpick into the base and stand them up in your Styrofoam block.;
, You will want this to be rather thin.
 Place all but one in a Ziploc bag or airtight container to keep it from drying out.
 This creates a frilly edge.
, Wrap your petal around the cone. This first petal will cover or cross over the tip of the cone base, overlapping itself.
 Take 2 rose petals you have already prepared from the container or baggie and position them around the cone so they hug the bud and overlap each other on the sides. Maneuver the petal tops with gentle bending and manipulating from your fingers. Allow the flower to dry before proceeding.
 Apply Tylo glue to the petals and attach them to the bud, overlapping each new petal you add with the one previously attached. Bend and manipulate the petal tops as desired. For a more full rose, add more petals, allowing the flower to dry between each new layer.

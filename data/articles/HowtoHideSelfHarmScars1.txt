 There are many brands that formulate their makeup specifically to cover tattoos or discoloration, and these are also the best types to use to try to cover scarring. You may have to find these in specialty stores or online.


Look for a brand that has a good variety of shades to choose from. You want to match the shade you select to the skin around your scar, not to the scar itself.
Look for a brand that specifically claims to cover or camouflage tattoos or scars; there are several highly rated ones you can search for online or in stores. If you can't find any of these in stores near you, try any "full coverage" or "maximum coverage" foundation or concealer, especially those available in stick form, as they tend to be more covering than liquids.;
, Brushes create the smoothest application and help to blend makeup into crevices.


Look for a small, rounded brush that is advertised as a concealer brush.
 Using the brush, gently pat a small amount of concealer or foundation across your scars and the surrounding skin. Add another thin layer if one layer is not enough.


If you want to, you can set it with translucent pressed or loose powder to help it last longer.
 A kit generally contains several products that are designed to work together to cover scars. These kits can be more expensive than regular makeup, and more time intensive to apply. But if you have an important event like a wedding or job interview, it might be a good investment.


Search for "tattoo covering kit" or "scar covering kit" online to find many different options along with user reviews.

 The hair should still be damp as you do this. The size of the braid will determine how wavy your hair will be. The bigger the braid, the less wavy your hair will appear.









If you want a tight frizz, divide your hair into many small sections to braid.
If you want loose waves, divide your hair into four or five sections.
 Take one section of hair and divide it into three equal parts. Hold the left section in your left hand, the right section in your right hand, and the middle section between two fingers of your dominant hand. Cross the hair over the middle strand.








First bring the right strand over the middle strand. What was the right strand is now the middle strand.
Now bring the left strand over the middle. What was the left strand is now the middle.
Repeat this process until the whole section has formed a braid.
 At the end of the braid, use an elastic band or butterfly clip to keep the braid in place. You want the braid to be secure enough that sleeping on it or blow-drying it will not cause it to come loose.
 Repeat the process for each section of hair. Remember that only the braided part of your hair will be wavy.









Begin as near the crown of your head as possible, to ensure that the waves don’t begin halfway down your head.
Braid as far down the section as you can so that the tips of your hair are not straight when you undo the braid.
 In order for your waves to stay, you’ll want the braids to dry completely before undoing the braids.









Use a blow-dryer to dry the braids.
Sleep on your braids and undo them in the morning.
 Carefully unbraid your hair to release the waves. Gently run your fingers through to separate the strands. Do not brush or comb your hair as this may create frizz or undo your waves entirely.
 If your hair tends to lose curl easily, add a light covering of hair spray to fix the curls. Choose one with a relaxed hold so that the hair does not become crunchy or sticky.

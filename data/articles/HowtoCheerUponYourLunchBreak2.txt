 One way to help cheer yourself up at lunch is to make sure you leave your desk. If you stay at your desk, you'll likely just stay in whatever funk you're in. Getting up and away can help break up the mood you're in., Seeing green can put you in a better mood, so spend some time outside looking at nature. Plus, getting out in the sunlight is also a natural mood booster, so be sure to spend at least ten minutes feeding your skin with vitamin D from the sun.
 Break out of your everyday lunch routine. Maybe you sit in your office most days or go eat in the break room. Try doing something new. Visit a restaurant you've been meaning to try, for instance, or visit a new park. Just trying something new and exciting can perk you up., It can be tempting to skip over eating if you're in a bad mood. However, that will likely drag you down even more, as your blood sugar crashes in the afternoon. Eat a solid, healthy meal to perk you up for the afternoon.Try including a lean protein, some whole grains, and a fruit or veggie.
Of course, eating some you enjoy can also boost your mood, so if you are really craving it, go for that ice cream at the end.

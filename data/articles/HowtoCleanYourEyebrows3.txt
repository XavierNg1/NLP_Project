 Your eyebrows have natural lubricating oils to help them stay clean. Try not to overdo it with eyebrow cleaning or washing, as this could end up damage your brows. Instead, stick to cleansing your eyebrows with every face wash. Use other products on your eyebrows every few months or once a year.
 When you do clean your eyebrows, try not to load on too much product. This can end up clogging your eyebrow hairs and lead to patchiness on your brows. Only put small amounts of product on your eyebrows at a time.
 If you are nervous about cleaning your eyebrows or maintaining them on your own, see an eyebrow professional. The professional can advise you on how to keep your eyebrows clean. They may also suggest other eyebrow maintenance options like waxing or tweezing your eyebrows to keep them looking healthy and clean.

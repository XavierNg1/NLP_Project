 If you’re interested in dating someone casually as opposed to committing to a monogamous relationship, be sure you are clear about these intentions with the man or woman you are dating. Try saying, “Mark, I really enjoy spending time with you but I am not in a place for a serious, committed relationship. Can we keep it casual?”

, It’s key that everyone’s on the same page about being in a casual relationship. Once you’ve made your intentions clear, talk with the other person about what is and what is not permissible in your casual relationship. You can try sitting down with them and making a list – paper or mental – of dos and don’ts such as sleeping with other people., If you are involved in a casual relationship you shouldn’t be making the emotional investment of spending time with the important people in each other’s lives. Meeting and hanging out with someone’s best friends or parents should be reserved for a serious, committed relationship., You should always practice safe sex and this is especially important if you are involved in a casual relationship where one or both of the partners may be having sex with other people. A sexually transmitted disease or unwanted pregnancy are the last things most casual daters want to deal with. Make sure you and your partners are using protection each and every time you have sex, which includes oral sex.

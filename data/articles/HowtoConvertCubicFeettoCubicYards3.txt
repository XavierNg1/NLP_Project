 In this method you begin with cubic yards and end up with cubic feet. If you are working with square feet and square yards, this conversion method will not work.
 There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. That means that the number of cubic feet will be 27 times more than the equivalent number of yards., This will give you the number of cubic feet equivalent to the given number of cubic yards. Since feet are smaller than yards, the number of feet will be greater than the number of yards.

For example, if you wanted to convert 20 cubic yards to cubic feet, you would calculate (20)(27)=540{\displaystyle (20)(27)=540}. So 20 cubic yards is equivalent to 540 cubic feet.

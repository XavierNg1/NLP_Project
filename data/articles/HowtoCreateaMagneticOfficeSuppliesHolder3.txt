 Avoid overfilling jars so that you donâ€™t crowd supplies and can easily add the lid. Also, in some cases if supplies become too heavy the jars could drop off the magnetic strip.
 Center the washer on the lid and add glue around the bottom perimeter. Allow the glue to dry for several hours before using.
 Arrange jars along the magnetic strip--ready for use!

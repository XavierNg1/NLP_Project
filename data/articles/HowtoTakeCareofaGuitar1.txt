 Treat guitars how you would treat guitars at the store, or maybe your other valuable possessions. Never lay it down on the ground when you are not playing it or doing maintenance on it. The best place for your guitar is inside it's own fitted case or something that will hold it properly. You can choose between a hard case, or a gig bag, or hang it on a wall hanger or stand it up on a floor stand.


If you have an electric guitar, try loosening the strings a bit so you can remove the dust that most likely has gathered around the pickups.






If you have an acoustic, loosen the strings and remove the dust by the bridge.






You don't need to loosen them much, just enough to get a cloth underneath. *Prod the hardware to see if it is loose, and if it is, see if there is a screw you can tighten.
 Guitar cases have a hard shell that protects your instrument from damage.

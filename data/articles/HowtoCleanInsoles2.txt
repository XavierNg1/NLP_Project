 Vinegar is a good deodorizer for insoles, especially if they have a strong smell. It also kills bacteria and germs. Mix one part white distilled vinegar and one part warm water together in a large bowl or in the sink., Place the insoles in the vinegar and water mixture. Let the insoles soak in the mixture for at least three hours.You can add essential oils like tea tree or pine oil to the mixture if the insoles really smell. Add a few drops of the essential oils to the mixture and let the insoles soak in the mixture.
 Once the insoles have soaked in the mixture, remove them and rinse them out under running water. Make sure you remove all of the vinegar-water mixture on the insoles.
 Place the insoles on a towel to dry overnight. You can also dry them by stacking them in a dish rack or by hanging them from a clothesline.

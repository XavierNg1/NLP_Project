 The best socks for heat packs are long ones without holes. Add four cups (946.4 mL) of non-instant white rice or other heatable food, including dried corn kernels and flaxseed, to the sock.The amount of filler you use can be adjusted. Less for example makes the heat pack softer and able to be used to focus on smaller areas on your body.
 Wrap the end of the sock so that you can twist it into the knot. This keeps the filler from spilling out and giving away heat.
 Limit the amount of time microwaving to one minute at a time and no more than three minutes. The sock can get too hot and the filler can burn. The sock should feel warm to the touch but not painful.Keeping a cup of water in the microwave next to the sock will slow down the heating process.
 Now that the sock is warm, it is useful for treating cold, sore, or painful spots. Drape the sock on the painful muscle or area or press it against the area you wish to treat.

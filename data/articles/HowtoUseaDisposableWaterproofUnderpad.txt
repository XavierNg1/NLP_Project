 Doing so will present you a better place to hold onto the pad as you take it out of the packaging. Start to cut into the edges of the bottom of the bag until the scissor feels tight without breaking through the entire package. Pull the bottom two sides apart and continue opening each of the sides of the bag(without opening the entire sides or top of the bag) until the product packaging is open.;
, Much like taking out a disposable diaper from the package, reach down into the package and grab one with your open fist. Keep your palm open, but curve your fingers, so that you only pick up one pad.


Likely, when you lay the pad down on the surface without unfolding it, the plastic-looking side will likely be face up. If you see the colored or plastic-looking surface (absorption surface) you're likely looking at this a bit awkward; you will want to be looking at the pad with it showing the white (non-plastic-like surface).
Try to grab the pads one at a time. Opening the package from the bottom may give away the secrets to only grabbing one (and if you are adept at taking out diapers from a package, this feeling is rather natural), but if you may feel the need to double the absorption rate or one pad might not be enough, you may need to use a second one on top of the first.
 Grab the edge of the product and "throw" it outward, away from you. This'll potentially be enough to create an air burst to be able to separate the quarters of the product from each of themselves.
 The white side can absorb the moisture, while the plastic-looking side can help deter any moisture from going through and onto the surface (which is potentially what you're trying to avoid by using these pads! Right?)


If both sides are white colored, look for a side that has a smooth, non-glossy (non-plastic-like) surface. The non-plastic side is the side the person must lay on. The liquid will be absorbed through this side, and yet won't travel through the plastic out the back.

 Fill a bucket with warm water and add 1⁄4  c (59 mL) of ammonia and 1⁄4  c (59 mL) of baking soda. Soak a sponge in the cleaning solution and use it to scrub your porcelain surface. Pay special attention to areas where stains are more pronounced. Keep scrubbing until you notice the stain diminishing.Be sure to wear rubber gloves while cleaning with ammonia.
After you finish, rinse the porcelain well to remove any remaining ammonia.
 If rinsing with soap doesn’t work, you may need to try something a bit more hardcore. Spray some bleach (or a cleaner containing bleach) on your porcelain item and let it sit for a few minutes. Then scrub it with your sponge and rinse the rest of the bleach off.Remember that bleach can be damaging to clothing and other fabrics. So try not to get the bleach on anything other than the sponge and the porcelain.
Be sure to wear rubber gloves when scrubbing with the bleach product.
 Simply pour a bit of the cleaning solution directly on the stains and let it sit for a few minutes. Then spend some time scrubbing the rest of the stains out.You can purchase Bar Keepers Friend online and at most home improvement stores.

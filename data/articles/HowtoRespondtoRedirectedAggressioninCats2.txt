 If your cat is an indoor-only cat, consider limiting how much access your cat has to viewing the outside world. Your cat is responding with aggression to things that it sees outside, but taking it out on you. You can minimize this problem by removing the temptation of the things the cat feels aggressive toward outside.Try covering the windows with blinds or curtains, preferably ones your cat can’t simply push out of the way.
Remember to leave the door closed so that your cat can’t constantly look out of the screen. Additionally, you can try closing the doors to rooms that provide views of the outdoors.
 If you have more than one cat in your home and one (or more) of them seems to initiate fights and engage in aggressive behavior often, you may want to consider separating them.After the cats have been separated for a while (at least a few days), start introducing them to one another again slowly.
Start with a smell introduction, where you bring in something that smells like the other cat. Then move toward a short face-to-face encounter.
Keep lengthening the amount of time you keep the cats together until you think they’re ready to be around each other full time again.
 Sometimes cats redirect aggressive behavior towards their owners if they catch a whiff of an unfamiliar animal on their human. If your cat is acting aggressively, try to limit your contact with other animals outside the home.If you must engage with other animals, try to wash your hands or change clothing before you see your cat at home.

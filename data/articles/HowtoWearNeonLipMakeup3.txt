 When wearing neon lipstick, avoid other bold makeup choices. Your lips should be the focus of your look. Add minimal amounts of foundation, blush, and concealer and keep your eye shadow light. Choose an eye shadow that matches your natural skin tone rather than a shadow in a bold, noticeable shade., In some offices, neon lips are acceptable. However, if you work in a more conservative atmosphere, neon lips may be out of place. If your company has a strict dress code, avoid neons during your work day., Always apply neon lipstick to the center of your lips and spread it out. Neon lipstick looks sloppy and overwhelming if you spread it across your lips. You only need a small amount of neon lipstick for a bold neon look.

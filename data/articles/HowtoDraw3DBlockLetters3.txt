 Start by writing the letter you want to draw., Outline the letter with ONE thin line., Connect the ends of the inner letter to the corners of the line around it., Decide where your light source is going to be. You can draw a circle or square or some other symbol that will let you know where the light is coming from., Pretend you are looking at a real block letter sitting in front of you. Shade in the spots that light isn't shining on.

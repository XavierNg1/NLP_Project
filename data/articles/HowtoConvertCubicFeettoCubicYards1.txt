 In this method, you should know how many cubic feet you have, and want to find out how many cubic yards that value is equal to. Make sure you are working with cubic units (volume), and not square units (area).

For example, you might want to convert 600 cubic feet to cubic yards.
;
, There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. This means for every cubic yard, you have 27 cubic feet. You can show this by the proportion 1yd327ft3{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}}., On the left side will be the unit proportion of cubic yards to cubic feet. On the right side will be a proportion representing the number yards you are trying to find. Create a fraction with an unknown number of yards in the numerator (x{\displaystyle x}), and the number of feet you are converting in the denominator.

For example, if you want to know how many cubic yards are in 600 cubic feet, your equation will look like this:1yd327ft3=x600ft3{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}={\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}}.
 To do this, multiply each side of the equation by the number of cubic feet you are trying to convert. Multiply the number of cubic feet by the numerator of the unit proportion on the left side of the equation.

For example:1yd327ft3=x600ft3{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}={\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}}1yd327ft3×600=x600ft3×600{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}\times 600={\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}\times 600}600yd327ft3=x{\displaystyle {\frac {600yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}=x}


, This will give you the equivalent number of cubic yards. Note that you can simplify this method by simply dividing the number of cubic feet you have by 27.

For example:600yd327ft3=x{\displaystyle {\frac {600yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}=x}22.2yd3=x{\displaystyle 22.2yd^{3}=x}So, 600 cubic feet is equal to 22.2 cubic yards.

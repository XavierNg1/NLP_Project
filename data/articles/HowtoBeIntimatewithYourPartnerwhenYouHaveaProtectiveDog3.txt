 If you have tried obedience training and other techniques to no avail, you may want to bring up the issue with your vet. Tell your vet that your dog acts protective when you and your partner become intimate. You may describe your dog’s exact behavior and demeanor to your vet. Giving your vet as much information as possible can help them give you guidance on how to train your dog to avoid the issue.


For example, you may tell your vet, “My dog gets protective if my partner and I hold hands” or “My dog barks at my partner and I when we kiss in front of him. What can I do to address this?”

, Your vet may suggest that you see a professional dog trainer for hands on advice to address the issue. Your dog may respond better to a professional trainer who is confident around dogs and aware of how to deal with the problem.The trainer can then teach you different commands or techniques you can try to get your dog more comfortable with your partner. They may also suggest ways where you can get your dog out of the room so you and your partner can be intimate with no disruptions or distractions.
 If your dog continues to be protective when you are with your partner, you should check back in with your vet about the issue. Keep the lines of communication between you and your vet open so you can work on dealing with the issue together.


You may also try several different tactics and report back to your vet about what worked and what did not work. Over time, you may find a solution that helps your dog feel at ease around your partner when you are intimate with them.

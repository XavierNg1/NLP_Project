 Most children will not need a multivitamin, and the dangers of taking in too much of a vitamin can outweigh the potential benefits. Many foods are fortified with essential nutrients, such as B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium and iron. In short, your child may already be getting enough nutrition, even if it seems like he's a pretty picky eater.Foods are the best source of vitamins and minerals for children as well as adults.
Make sure your child has access to a varied, healthy diet for meals and snacks.
 If your child has physical and developmental delay (i.e. failure to thrive) she may benefit from a multivitamin. Some children are allergic to milk, or have food sensitivities that result in an overly restricted diet.Heartburn, reflux or vomiting can cause a child to have difficulty consuming a healthy dose of vitamins. A multivitamin will help provide her with proper nutritional requirement.
Children with gastro-intestinal problems may also benefit from a multivitamin.
Talk to your pediatrician before starting your child on multivitamins.
 The major brands of children's vitamins do not submit to the voluntary process of USP or CL verification, relying instead upon brand identification for consumer's trust. This means that there is not an independent firm checking for quality control, ensuring that the vitamins contain what the label claims.In order to encourage the child to willingly take his vitamins, children's vitamins often taste more like candy than medicine. This encourages over-consumption, which can be dangerous. Make sure you keep your child's vitamins out of reach.
Children's vitamins also contain additives and sweeteners, which don't benefit your child's overall health.

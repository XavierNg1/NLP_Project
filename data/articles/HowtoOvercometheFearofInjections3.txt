 A fear hierarchy is a way to document the different degrees of fear you experience related to needles and injections. This technique gives you a clear progression, but allows you to move at your own pace and make your own records of what how find most fearful. Write down different aspects of needles and injections which scare you and rank them by the amount of distress they cause you, on a scale of 1-10. An example could look like this:


Having an injection in my arm - ranked 10/10.
Holding a needle - ranked 9/10.
Watching someone have an injection in real life - ranked 7/10.
Watching a video of an injection online - ranked 5/10.
Looking pictures of needles and injections - ranked 4/10.
Thinking about an injection - ranked 3/10., Once you have drawn up your hierarchy you will have already begun thinking about your fears, an important step in countering them. When you are ready, start at the bottom of your hierarchy and put yourself in the situation which gives you the lowest amount of distress. When you begin to feel distressed, practice applied tension or breathing for relaxation to bring your blood pressure back down and control your fear.Stay in this stressful situation until your anxiety has started to noticeably drop. As you come out of this situation, looking away from the video of an injection, or putting down the needle, take time to breathe deeply and relax.
Congratulate yourself on your progress and courage before moving up your hierarchy.
 Now you can steadily work your way up your hierarchy and keep track of your success. Only move on when you feel really confident with the previous situations, and don't worry if you need to re-do one situation a number of times before you feel comfortable. It's worth persisting with it.


Overcoming your fear will take time, practice, commitment and courage. But, it will certainly make your life freer from anxiety and stress in the long-run.

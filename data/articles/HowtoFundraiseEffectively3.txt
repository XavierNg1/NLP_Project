 As lovely as it would be to have an unlimited budget, make sure you know your organization’s money goals before you plan a fundraiser. This will help you better plan on what sort of fundraising you will need to do.
 To entice people to give to your cause, set specific goal amounts and make it clear what the money will be spent on. For example, if you’re presenting your goals, state something like:


”We are here this evening to raise $100,000 for John’s medical bills. John spent two weeks in ICU and could use our help.”
If you do not know a specific amount, try and be specific with how the money will be spent. “All proceeds from this auction will go to building a new roof for our local school.”

, Do not expect one person to fund your entire campaign. Instead, consider your audience and what they are likely to spend. By thinking about the average amount your donors will spend, you will have a more realistic expectation of how much money you will raise during an event.

 You can actually test how well certain objects develop electrical charges (static) by making a homemade electroscope.To make a simple electroscope, tie a piece of puffed sugarless cereal to a thread and hang the thread off something such as a table or paper towel rack.;
, Plastic combs and wool are two of the more common household objects that hold a great static charge. Since wool is a great way to develop a charge with plastic materials, you can rub the wool against the comb or balloon to develop a charge. Rub the two materials together for ten to fifteen seconds.You may want to mark the portion of the plastic material you’re rubbing because the strongest ionization (movement of electrons in the atoms which is the cause of static) will be at this point., After charging the comb or balloon, slowly bring the spot you rubbed toward the cereal. When you get close enough, the material will start attracting the cereal.Since the materials are insulators, you can turn the object so the far side of the object from the charged side faces the cereal, and the attraction will cease.You can do this same test with a slow steady trickle of water such as with a faucet. Holding the charged spot of the balloon near the stream will pull the water slightly toward the balloon., Many other common things around the home are great for creating static. Dry human hair, dry human skin, leather, fur, glass, nylon, wool, and aluminum all shed electrons easily.Additionally, teflon, silicon, vinyl (PVC), polyurethane, styrene (styrofoam), polyester, gold, brass, silver, copper, and hard rubber all gather loose electrons easily.Try rubbing objects from the first category against objects from the second category, and then test which ones create the most static.


For instance, most people know that rubbing a balloon against your hair will create static. Notice that dry human hair comes from the first category and that rubber—which is the actual material from which latex balloons are made—is in the second category.

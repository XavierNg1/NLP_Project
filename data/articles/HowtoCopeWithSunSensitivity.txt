 This duration of time is when the sun is the strongest and brightest in most locations.;
, While SPF 30 may protect certain people decently, it may be a good idea to get a higher SPF depending on how severe your sun sensitivity is. Be sure your sunscreen protects against UVA and UVB rays and reapply frequently.


Protect your lips. Get a lip balm that offers SPF protection to protect those lips from getting sunburn. Remember to apply it frequently!

, Wear UV protective clothing or at the very least cover up with breathable fabrics. Don't forget your hat and sunglasses!

, Along with going out during hours the sun is less intense staying out for shorter periods of time lessens your sun exposure.
 Shady areas that don't allow the suns rays to penetrate will also limit your exposure to the sun. If no shade is available consider carrying a sun umbrella.
 While doing the steps above will help you greatly with your sun sensitivity, talking to your doctor will help determine how severe your sun sensitivity is and what other steps you can do to lessen the symptoms.

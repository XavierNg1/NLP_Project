 Since the majority of mobile phone spam is sent through the Internet (where spammers can text you for free) you can ask your service provider to prevent all Internet messages from reaching your phone. As of June 2008, this feature is offered by T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. , If there are some messages you want to receive from the Internet (airline schedules, hotel reservations, etc.), then some providers will allow you to create a unique alias, blocking all messages that are not addressed to your alias. This filters out spammers, who usually find their targets by sending text messages to random numbers (1234557890@txt.company.com). Give your alias address only to the people and website you actually want to receive messages from. As of June 2008, this feature is offered by AT&T, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile., If the reply-to address isn't your alias and someone replies to your message or e-mail, their message will get blocked because it wasn't sent to your alias.
 Have people text message you at that address, and have all the e-mails from that account forward automatically to your phone.
 Most providers offer this option, and it can be useful if the spammer consistently text messages you from the same number or e-mail address, or if they always include their URL in the messages they send. You can also block all (or the majority) of known phone spam numbers for your area according to a user-generated database., If spammers continue to get through, you may be able to convince the carrier to drop the charges associated with those messages. You have a better chance at this if you call as soon as your receive the spam.

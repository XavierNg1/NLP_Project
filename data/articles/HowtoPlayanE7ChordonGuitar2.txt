 This only works for chords starting on the sixth string, but this makes it easy to play a seventh chord anywhere. Imagine that the open strings were actually a barred fret -- they are all the same "fret" being sounded out in your chord. This means your other two fingers will make any chord "barred" a 7th. Since the next E begins on the 12th fret, your E7 barre chord would look like:









--12--
--12--
--13--
--12--
--14--
--12--

, When barring chords on the 5th string, you can use the same strategy to move your chord anywhere as the one used in the last step. However, you must use the form of an A7 chord, because an open A7 resembles a barre chord on the A string the same way an open E7 resembles a barre chord on the E string. For an E7, you'd start on the 5th string, 7th fret, an E, and play the following form:









--7--
--9--
--7--
--9--
--7--
--X--


Note: If you moved this form all the way to the open strings, so you only fret the second string on the 2nd and 4th strings, this is an open A7 chord.

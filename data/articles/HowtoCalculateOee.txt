 Operations pros identify the core factors of the OEE measurement as Availability, Performance and Quality.;
, Divide the actual production time by the total planned production time.


For example, if the equipment is planned to run 24/7, but averages a total of 12 hours of down time each day, the Availability result would be 50 percent.
 In general, the Performance component of OEE assesses how equipment is used during its actual running time. To get the Performance number, divide the actual number of pieces produced by the planned capacity of production for the same time frame, according to engineering specs.


For example, if your equipment produces 85 pieces in an hour but the specification says it should produce 100, your result is .85. If another shift runs the equipment and produces 105 pieces, the result increases to 1.05.
 This involves determining the proportion of pieces, out of all manufactured pieces, that are good enough to meet your company's standard of utility. You'll need to know your own company standard for utility. It usually relates to whether or bot pieces are good enough to be sold. Using that standard, divide the number of usable pieces by the total number of pieces made.


For example, for 92 saleable pieces from 100 pieces made, the Quality result is 0.92.
 When you have your total figures in hand, try to identify the reasons for any low percentages. One possible explanation, particularly in the Availability component, relates to the human use of machinery. Most factory machinery is controlled by humans and down time may indicate training or safety problems, so include these items as part of your overall assessment.
 Maintenance, job setup, electrical and fuel sources, along with other issues may all affect your OEE numbers.
 Your OEE numbers will help you to learn more about specific opportunities for better work space setups and better production with the same amount of resources.

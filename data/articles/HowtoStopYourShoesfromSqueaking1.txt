 Sometimes squeaking may be caused by friction between your insoles and shoe soles. You can use baby powder, talcum, or corn starch to address squeaking due to friction.


If your shoe has a removable liner, take it out and sprinkle corn starch, talcum, or baby powder on the bottom of the shoe. Then, place the liner back in and see if it fits more snugly. These powders can reduce moisture, resulting in less motion between the liner and the shoe.If your shoes are squeaking when you walk across a tile or wood surface, then you can also try applying a bit of powder to the bottoms of your shoes. Just be careful when you walk because applying powder to the bottoms of your shoes can reduce the traction of your shoes, so it may be easier to slip and fall.;
, If you donâ€™t have any cornstarch or baby powder handy, then a paper towel or dryer sheet can also stop your shoes from squeaking. Stick a folded paper towel or dryer sheet in between the sole and insole of each of your shoes.

To do this, you will need to take out the insole place the towel or dryer sheet into the bottom of your shoe and then replace the insole.
 Sometimes shoes will squeak because the tongue is rubbing against the inside of the shoe. You can easily fix this by smoothing out the tongue with a bit of sandpaper. Get some fine grit sandpaper or a nail file and rub it against the outer edges of the tongue (where the tongue rubs against the inside of the shoe.

If you prefer not to sand the tongue of your shoes, then you can apply a bit of athletic tape to the edges of the tongue instead.Wrap the athletic tape around the tongue's edges so that the areas that rub against the inside of the shoe are covered.
 If you wear shoes without socks, the moisture caused by your feet sweating may be causing the squeaking. Simply wearing socks might reduce squeaking. Try wearing socks with your shoes for a few days and see if the squeaking goes away.

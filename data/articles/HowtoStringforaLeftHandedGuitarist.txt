 These strings are usually just arranged for display, though some strings are already adjusted for immediate use. Be sure to have some way to identify which note is which, such as note cards with each note on them. (You can save these for future use in stringing) Otherwise you'll have to undo all of your hard work to fix it!;
, There are two kinds of "E" strings, a lower pitched string and a higher pitched. The first string is the lower pitched of the two. "A", "D", "G", "B" and the higher "E" complete the strings. Make sure when you buy strings they have all of these, even if you have no use for them at the moment. You never know when they'll come in handy.
 The notes that the strings play are organized in a low to high note system. For a left-hand friendly guitar, you simply make the first note the highest, and steadily lower it to the last string in the set. Since a left-handed person requires the guitar to be positioned differently, (the left hand will strum, the right will pick out chords) the strings will play exactly as they do for standard guitarists, merely far more suited for the left-handed.
 Tuck the end under the loop and secure it with a gentle pull. Too tight and you'll damage the peg.
 It is the one most likely to come loose.

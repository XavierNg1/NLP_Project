 HAP occurs in patients who contract pneumonia while hospitalized. HAP refers to pneumonia that patients acquire while in the hospital. This strain is typically very severe and is accompanied by high death rates. It accounts for up to 2% of all rehospitalizations. It happens to all kinds of hospital patients, from those who are getting surgery to those who had a fall to those already with a serious infection. Hospital acquired pneumonia can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure, and death.The symptoms of hospital acquired pneumonia are the same, since they are both types of the same disease.
 Community acquired pneumonia is spread through the transmission of common pathogens. Hospital acquired pneumonia, however, is spread within a hospital. There are some patients that are more at risk than others based on their condition, though anyone in a hospital can contract HAP. These risk factors include:Being in the ICU
Being on a mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more
Staying at the hospital or ICU for an extended time
Those with severe issues with their underlying issues when they were originally hospitalized
Those with heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, COPD, and diabetes

, Hospital acquired pneumonia can occur through complications after surgery, such as a post surgery collapsed lung or from not taking enough deep breaths due to pain. It can also occur due to poor hygiene from the medical staff at the hospital, especially while caring for patients with central lines, those one ventilator care, and those having a breathing tube placed or replaced., HAP can be avoided through excellent hygiene amongst healthcare providers, meticulous ventilator care, and post-operative use of incentive spirometers, which are devices that encourage deep breathing among post surgical patients. It can also be avoided if a person gets out of bed faster after surgery and if any intubations are removed as soon as possible.

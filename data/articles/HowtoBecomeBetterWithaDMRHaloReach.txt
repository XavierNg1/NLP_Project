 A lot of people spam the trigger with a DMR. It's important to take it slow. Make sure your reticle stays on your target.;
, Bloom is a new feature in Halo Reach. This makes it doubly important to keep your reticle on the target, even after you've shot. You need to wait until the reticle goes back to normal to ensure your shot connects.
 This is vital for dispatching foes effectively. It takes five body shots and one headshot to polish off an opponent, so it's better to hold your DMR at head height.
 Stay at a distance. Your DMR has a range advantage; keep it that way. Also, try not to scope; it should be easy enough to headshot anyway with the DMR.
 If you're a serious gamer, and have a TV for gaming, go to level ground and aim your reticle at a team mate's head. Then, get some clear plastic, put a dot in the middle, and stick it where your reticle is now. This will allow you to go to headshot height easily.

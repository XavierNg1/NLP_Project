 This kick begins just like the side kick. Make sure that your target is to the side of your body. It is important to have a fixed position to target for this kick even though it uses a more circular movement than the side kick.
 This is the same as the side kick. By bringing your knee up and to your torso, you are packing more strength behind your kick. This is the same as a side kick.
 Be sure to maintain your balance in this phase or you’ll fall over and your kick will fail. Whereas the sidekick extends straight to the target at this point, the hook kick moves forward (in the direction of your toes). You need to do this in order to pull back in the next step, thus making the hooking motion.
 Complete the hooking motion. This is a great place to reevaluate your target. If your opponent has moved since you initiated the kick, now you can lower, raise, or shift your kick.
 Depending on the position of your opponent during this phase, you’ll want to hit with a safe part of your foot. The heel is the best, but the sole of your foot works too. Do not kick with your toes or the top of your foot.

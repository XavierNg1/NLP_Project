 Creating the zippered face makeup look is easy, but you do need some special items to do it. Before you get started, you will need:Zipper
Scissors
Liquid latex
Makeup sponges
Cotton balls, squares, or rounds
Red face paint
Red eye shadow and/or lipstick
Skin safe adhesive
Petroleum jelly;
, Cut off the fabric around the edges of the zipper. Otherwise, it may look quite obvious that you have a fabric zipper glued to your face. After you finish trimming of the fabric around the edges of the zipper, cut the bottom part off of the zipper.








If you will be placing the zipper at an angle on your face, then you may need to trim one side of the zipper to be shorter than another.
 When you have decided where to place your zipper, use your eyeliner pencil to trace the area within the zipper. You should trace a V-shape so that the zipper will look like it is really unzipping your face.Experiment with different placements of the zipper on your face to determine where you want it to go.
 You can use bits of cotton fluff to help you create texture on your skin. This will give your skin a lumpy, bumpy appearance that will be more realistic than smooth red skin.








Pull apart a cotton square, ball, or round and set the cotton pieces aside. You will use them when you apply the liquid latex to your skin.
 Petroleum jelly mixed with a bit of red lipstick will help you to create a shiny finish on your skin. This will make the red textured makeup appear more realistic, as if the wound is fresh.








You can also add in a little black or brown eyeliner or eyeshadow to darken the color.

 The majority of Domestic beer kegs sold in the US use the American "D" system. However it is wise to confirm this with the vendor, as some imports may require a different tap system. Possible systems include.


American "D", European "S", and "U" systems
The Grundy "G" system
The German Slider or "A & M" systems;
, To insure the perfect head on your beer, chill your keg before tapping. To properly chill your entire keg (and not just the bottom half):


Line your keg bucket with a plastic garbage bag.
Fill the bottom of the bag with ice.
Place your keg in the bag and on top of the ice.
Pack more ice in the garbage bag, around the perimeter of the keg.
Pull the bag up and around the keg, while packing with more ice.

It helps to enlist a friend here. One to hold the bag up, around the keg, while the other friend fills the bag with ice.


Secure the bag full of ice around the keg.
Let your keg sit on ice for 4-5 hours.

You may need to periodically replace the ice, as it melts.
 Do not forget to also ice the tap system. Otherwise you will lose carbonation when your cold beer hits the warm tubing of the tap system. To properly cool your tap system put it on ice for one hour before you need it.

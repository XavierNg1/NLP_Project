 This is a nice feature if you want to add the ingredients before work, but want the bread to be fresh when you get home. However, you cannot use this feature with bread recipes that call for milk or eggs.
 This can be instead of or in addition to a delayed start option since it keeps the bread warm and fresh if you are not home to immediately enjoy it.
 Some can mix pizza dough or cinnamon rolls. There are bread makers that also allow you to add fruit or nuts to make different types of bread.
 Whether you are allergic to gluten, or are just trying to reduce your consumption of it, look for bread machines with a setting to make dough free of this ingredient.
 This allows you to check on the progress periodically.
 Certain models let you know when to toss in extras, such as fruit, nuts or chocolate chips.

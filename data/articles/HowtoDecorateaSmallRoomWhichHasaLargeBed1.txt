 Dark colors in an already small room can make your bedroom feel like a cave. If you like dark colors, use them in accessories like throw pillows, area rugs, and accents in drapery and bed linen. Consider using lighter colors on the walls and ceiling to open up the space visually. Bring in natural light as much as possible to illuminate the space and your mood.A light, neutral-colored carpeting will seem to disappear into the room, tricking the eye. Similarly, horizontal stripes will widen the room, making it seem larger.
Keep your bedding clean, neat, and simple. Detailed patterns and outrageous colors draw the eye to the largest item in the room, highlighting its size.;
, A small bedroom is not the place for a sleigh bed. It just takes up extra space and you'll find yourself moving around it, or, more accurately, running into it.


Head boards are fine. But as with everything, try to keep it light colored and not bulky; it's decorative, not necessary. You'll relish the extra 4 inches (10.2Â cm) of space if you don't have one that's huge.
 Ever walked into a room that was messy and disorganized, cleaned it, and your mood automatically lightened? That goes double for a small room. Grab your little knickknacks that you don't actually use and put them away.


Get a bedskirt. There is so much space you can utilize under your bed. Buy some boxes or baskets and shove 'em under there -- it's easy access, too. If your closet is small, use it for your shoes. More room for your clothes!

 Your vet may recommend putting a device to put in your dog’s mouth to realign the abnormally positioned teeth. A popular orthodontic device for dogs is the inclined plane, also known as a bite plate. It is commonly recommended when the lower canine teeth point straight up into the mouth, rather than being angled slightly outward (‘base narrow canine teeth’).Vets recommend placing an inclined plate in a dog’s mouth between 7 and 9 months of age. It fits over a dog’s upper teeth and works by directing the lower canines into their proper positions., Your vet will anesthetize your dog to make the acrylic composite (basic shape) of your dog’s upper teeth to make the inclined plane. They will clean the teeth first to make sure the composite is accurate.Your vet may make what’s called a telescoping inclined plane so it does not stop your dog’s jaw from growing., Just like human bite plates, canine inclined planes need to be kept clean. Your vet may recommend sedating or anesthetizing your dog to clean its inclined plane. If necessary, your vet will make adjustments to the inclined plane, since your dog could have dislodged it when biting down on something hard.If you regularly brush your dog’s teeth, it may be a little more challenging to do so with the inclined plane. Talk to your vet about how to brush your dog’s teeth while the inclined plane is in place.
 The inclined plane will not stay in your dog’s mouth throughout your dog’s life. Your vet will remove the inclined plane when your dog’s teeth are in proper alignment., Once your dog’s teeth are properly aligned, the inclined plane could be used as a retainer for several months to maintain the proper alignment.Talk to your vet about this option.

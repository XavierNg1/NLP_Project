 Pick a structured shoulder bag or clutch to dress up any outfit with denim shorts. Try a textured leather bag for the dressiest look. A cross-body bag always looks nice with shorts and is easy to carry in the summer. If youâ€™re wearing more sedate colors or a denim-on-denim combination, choose a brightly colored bag.Never pair a denim bag with an all-denim outfit.
 Wear a long necklace when you pair your denim shorts with a white t-shirt. Try longer earrings to contrast with the shortness of your shorts. Pair any combination of outfits with stacks of bracelets. Wearing any jewelry with your denim shorts will make you look dressier and more put-together.

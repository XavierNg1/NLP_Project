 Nuts are great for adding a crunchy texture to your favorite ice cream dishes. Hazelnuts are a natural choice for pairing with Nutella ice cream. Shelled and chopped hazelnuts are excellent sprinkled over a bowl of ice cream, but this isn't your only option. For instance, you can use a few whole hazelnuts as a tasteful garnish.


While no ice cream dessert is going to be outright good for you, hazelnuts themselves have several health benefits like high fiber and folate content., Crisp cookies make the perfect companion for rich, smooth ice cream. Crisp wafer cookies work well — flavors like chocolate and vanilla are natural choices. Other good ideas include:


Biscotti
Round "straw" cookies (Pirouettes, etc.)
Chocolate sandwich cookies (Oreos, etc.)
Nilla Wafers

, The hazelnut flavor of Nutella pairs excellently with coffee, so this Italian espresso dessert is a special treat. To make an affogato, put a scoop or two of Nutella ice cream in a mug, then make a shot of hot espresso. Pour the espresso over the ice cream and eat immediately for a delicious mix of flavors and temperatures.


For added presentation, you can also try topping the ice cream in the mug with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and so on — it's up to you.

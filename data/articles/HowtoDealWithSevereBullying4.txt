 If you see someone being bullied, tell the person to stop. It takes courage to step in, but you can be someone's hero by stepping in. Often, it just takes one person standing up to the bully to make him or her stop.For instance, you could say, "Hey, leave that kid alone. What did he ever do to you?"

, Even if you don't step in, it's important not to encourage bullying. That means, you shouldn't laugh as someone else gets bullied.If you just watch and laugh, you are contributing, as you are providing an audience for the bully.Even just standing and watching without laughing can encourage the bully, as you are giving the person an audience.That doesn't mean you should just walk away. If you're not willing to step in, move on to the next step.
 If you're not willing to step in yourself, tell an adult. Find someone in a nearby classroom, or talk to your school counselor. That way, the adult can step in and handle the situation.

 Most hotel prices are set for two people to a room (with small children staying for free). If a third adult will be staying the night, you’ll likely be slapped with an “additional person fee.” Look around for a hotel that doesn’t charge such fees (not all of them do) before booking., Anyone who is trying to save money knows they should avoid the mini-bar. What you may not realize is that simply by touching items in the mini-bar (in some hotels) you may trigger a sensor that adds charges to your room. (This prevents guests from trying to replace mini-bar items). You can avoid this fee by steering clear of the mini-bar completely.If you should ever be charged for an item you touched (but did not consume), speak to the front desk about removing this charge.
 If there are baskets of bottled water or snacks sitting out in your room, they may seem complementary. Unfortunately, they may not be! Refrain from consuming any food or drink provided in your room unless you have inquired about the price., It is customary to leave a tip for housekeeping, as well as for spa services (like a massage). However, at some hotels, gratuity for these services will be charged to your room. Inquire about gratuity charges ahead of time to avoid tipping twice.

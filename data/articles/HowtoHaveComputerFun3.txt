 Got some time to kill, but no money? Go online shopping, but don't buy anything. You can buy almost anything online, and it can be fun to poke around and price-compare anything from clothes and shoes to land-plots and condominiums. Make a wish list of everything you want. Just don't max out your credit card.
 Use Google Maps to explore cities you're unfamiliar with and explore local landmarks on Wikipedia.

Once you know where you want to go, you can start saving up to make your dream come true.

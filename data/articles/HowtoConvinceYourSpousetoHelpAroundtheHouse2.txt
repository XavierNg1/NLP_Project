 Write down which areas of the house need the most cleaning and which chores you do most frequently. Get specific about what needs to be done on a daily or weekly basis.For example, don’t just put “clean the kitchen” on your list. Instead, break the task down into washing dishes, wiping down countertops, taking out the trash, and sweeping the floor.
 Using your list, work with your spouse to divide up chores in a way that seems fair to both of you. Take your other responsibilities and your individual preferences into account during this process.For instance, if your spouse likes to cook, it might make sense for them to take over the kitchen duties.
 Agree on specific times when you’ll get your housework done. Don’t just plan to do it whenever you’re free or feel like it. Instead, commit to a schedule so that you’re both accountable for your work.

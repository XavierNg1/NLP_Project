 If you see someone alone in a corner looking at their phone, they might want to mingle but not know quite how. Approach them and ask some questions to get the conversation going. For instance, you might say, “Great party, right?” or “Hi! Do you know anyone here?”, If you find two people talking together, they’re probably either a romantic couple or just two random people who started talking to each other. In either case, groups of two are easy to mingle with. Join their conversation or kick the conversation off by asking, “So, how do you two know each other?”, This person probably knows many of the other party-goers, and can help you mingle with strangers by introducing you to them. Talking to the life of the party is easy because they are extroverted and will carry most of the conversation.Identify the life of the party by looking for certain personality traits. The life of the party often has a boisterous laugh and attracts many people to them. They might also have a sophisticated storytelling capability that inspires or amuses others.

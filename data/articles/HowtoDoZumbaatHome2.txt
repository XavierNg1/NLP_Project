 There are a large number of workout videos you can purchase, watch with a streaming service, or watch for free online. The first video that you watch may not be the right one for you. Watch a few different ones to find one with moves you can do and an instructor who explains things clearly.If you are a beginner, look for a video geared towards beginners. If you have been doing Zumba for a while, find one with more advanced moves.
 Zumba is a great workout for any fitness level. Some moves may look high impact or intense, but you can adjust the moves to fit your mobility and fitness level. The important thing with Zumba is to move, perform the moves as best as you can, and have fun.Most workout videos provide modifications for beginners, intermediate, and advanced participants. If they don’t, find a way to move similarly that doesn’t cause you pain.
 Though Zumba is traditionally danced to salsa and Latin music, people dance to just about everything. If you want to shake your hips to top 40 pop, hip hop, or dance remixes instead, find videos that use that kind of music.Some videos focus on mostly hip moves, while others are more full body movements. Experiment with different styles of dance to figure out what you enjoy. Better yet, mix them together for a fun, diverse workout!

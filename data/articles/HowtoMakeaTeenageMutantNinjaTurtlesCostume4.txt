 A good TMNT costume is made up of in the details. Otherwise you're just a turtle. Grab the following:

Wide brown ribbon






A circle of cardboard






White paper






Marker in your turtle's color






Wide ribbon in your turtle's color







, Cut it so it fits like a loose belt.
 They need only be about 3" (7.5 cm) in diameter. Draw the letter of your turtle on the white paper (in the appropriate color) and attach to the cardboard.
 Tape is easiest, though glue and staples will do as well. If you don't want a tie in your belt, use the circle to join (and hide) the ends together.


The letter should be worn front and center. Make the belt tight enough that it doesn't rotate too much.
 You can identify which turtle you are by having a headband, armbands, and leg bands in your turtles color. Where the headband across your forehead, the armbands around your bicep, and the leg bands around your calf.

If your ribbon is wide enough, you could always cut eye holes in it and use it as a mask instead!

, Again, do this in your turtle's color. This is a simple alternative to having to mess with a bandana wrapped around your head that you still have to see out of.


Paint up to the eyebrow, just below the eye, a thin bridge around the nose, and lines to the ears. Their masks weren't that wide.
 Now it's time to go to town with quilt batting or pillow stuffing -- unless you already have the body of a body builder. Stuff your chest, biceps, and thighs. Sculpt it to your liking.


Stuffing your costume isn't necessary, no. But it will make your costume even more noticeable than it already is!

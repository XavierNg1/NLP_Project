 Click the center button on your Xbox One controller. Your Xbox will turn on and you will be on your dashboard.
 If you look on the right side of the screen, you can see that there is a box that says “Games and Apps.” Move your cursor so that it highlights that box, and then hit the A button.
 When the next page loads look at the left side of the page. You can see the different sections of your games and apps, select the “Apps” button with the A button.
 After the app section loads scroll through your applications until you find the Netflix app. It is red text that says “Netflix” with a white square background. When you find it, select it, and the sign in page will load.
 Enter your email address and password in the boxes provided then select “Sign in” to continue.
 Now all you have to do is scroll through your videos until you find something that you want to watch. Once you find something that catches your attention move your cursor over the movie or show and hit the A button. The video will start automatically.
 If you are watching your movie or TV show and something important comes up, you can pause the video by simply tapping the A button on your controller.


If you want to resume the video just tap A again.
 If you need to rewind or fast forward you can do so easily by using the back triggers on the controller. The left trigger causes the video to rewind, while the right trigger makes it fast forward.


If you want to play the video again at normal speed just hit the A button.

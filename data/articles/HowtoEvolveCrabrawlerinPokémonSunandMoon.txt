 You'll find it at berry trees on Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, Route 8, Route 10, Route 16, Route 17, Secluded Shore, Poni Plains, and three areas of Poni Wilds. Route 10 and Poni Plains give the best chance of finding one. Depending on where you're looking, you'll find one between level 7 and level 57.;
, If a Crabrawler is there, an exclamation mark will appear above the player character's head and you'll go into a Pokémon battle. If you go without finding a Crabrawler in any of the trees, you'll have to wait for the berries to re-appear to find one.
 If it's a low-level Crabrawler, you can use a Nest Ball to make catching it easier.
 Level up Crabrawler there, and it will evolve into Crabominable. This works at any level except for level 100, so you can have a Crabominable as low as level 2 (if you bred a level 1 Crabrawler instead of catching one as described in the previous steps).

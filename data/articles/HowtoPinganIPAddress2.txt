 Open your Applications folder and select Utilities. Look for Network Utility.
 Specify a hostname or IP Address.


A hostname is typically a website address. For example, to ping wikiHow’s main web server, type www.wikihow.com in the field.
An IP address is a computer’s location on a network, either locally or on the internet. For example, to ping the IP address 192.168.1.1, type 192.168.1.1 into the field.
 You can typically get a good measurement with only 4-6 pings. Click Ping when you are ready and the output will be displayed in the lower part of the window.

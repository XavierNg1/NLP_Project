 A California plumbing contractor is listed under the C-36 classification, but the application is the same for most contractors.
 Keep the following guidelines in mind as you fill out the form:


Do not leave any spaces blank. You may be given 30 days to make corrections, but this will delay your application.
Use only full legal names and official addresses. You will need to fill out personal information, including your social security number and information on any prior convictions.
Do not strikeout or blot out any corrections. Start on a new form, or else your application is unlikely to be accepted.
Support all work experience documentation with official payroll or W-2 forms. Submit a copy of your apprenticeship program certificate or diploma.
Ask a prior employer or colleague to fill out the work experience certification form. They must have direct experience with you during your time as a journeyman.
,, You will schedule a time to show your trade skills to a CSLB proctor.
, This can be shown in the form of a letter from a bank certifying that you have access to this amount of money.
 Submit proof of your registered bond to the CSLB. This money serves as consumer protection against poor contractor work.

 Continue to bid on the computer for as long as your budget allows until you see the status change, saying that you have won the bid. You will see the status of the product on the "Bids/Offers" page change, informing you if you have been outbid, in which case you will have to go to the products page and enter a higher bid in the "Place Bid" area.
 Each payment method requires you to follow a different procedure that will be displayed to you step by step when you buy computers on eBay.
 The receipt should give you the estimated arrival time for the computer that you will get through a postal service.

 To truly overcome your prejudices, you need to watch what you say with your mouth or your fingertips.


Carefully read aloud any comments you make on blogs, forums, or on social media. Ask yourself whether this comment could hurt someone else. If so, edit your words to remove any biases.
If you see others perpetrating racism online, report their behavior to the site administrator., Some sites involve racism as a part of their culture or philosophy. If you notice a repeating pattern of biased or prejudiced news or information on a website, stop visiting it. The less exposure you have to hateful, hurtful language the less likely you are to develop these beliefs and use similar language in your own life., If, for some reason, you can’t seem to modify your language online or in-person, maybe it’s best if you keep quiet. Racist remarks—even when shared with innocent intentions—fuel racism and discrimination. Until you work on changing your beliefs and educating yourself about other groups, keep your opinions to yourself.

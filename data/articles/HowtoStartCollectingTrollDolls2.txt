 Since Troll Dolls are from the past, one of the only ways to find them is to go to a thrift shop, trade center or antique store. Another trend is some comic stores are starting to sell vintage tool figurines and there's also vintage stores that sell all 40s to 90s stuff Ebay is also a great source to find rare trolls and have a variety of options.

Be selective! Only go after the ones that really capture your heart instead of every model of a troll doll there is. Like all collecting this too can get addictive very quickly.

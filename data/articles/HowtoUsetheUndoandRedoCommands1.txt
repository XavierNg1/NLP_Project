Press the "Undo" or "Redo" buttons. The "Undo" button will look like an orange arrow pointing to the left and the "Redo" button will look like a blue arrow pointing to the right. You can find them next to each other on the top of the toolbar.
Use the F2 and F3 keys. The F2 key can undo an action and the F3 key can redo an action. You may need to press the F-lock key to activate these buttons.
 Though some of the above options may also work in a variety of other programs, if you've opened another program, just click on "Edit" on the top of the toolbar and see the key codes that are listed to the right of the "Undo" and "Redo" options. This will tell you which keys to press to undo and redo your actions.


Note that unfortunately, not every action can be redone or undone. If you're pressing the correct buttons and it's not working, then you've done one of these actions.

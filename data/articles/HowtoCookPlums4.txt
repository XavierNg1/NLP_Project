, Measure out ⅔ cups (150 grams) of white granulated sugar and ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon. Put them into a bowl, and mix them briskly together with a fork. Make sure that the cinnamon is distributed evenly throughout the sugar.
 If you have not done so already, crack open an egg over a shallow dish, and separate the yolk from the white. Discard the yolk, or save it for another recipe, then whisk the egg white. You want it to be a little foamy, but not so much that it turns white and stiff.
 Simply rinse them, then pat them dry. Roll them in the beaten egg white until they are evenly coated, then roll them in the cinnamon-sugar.

 Getting a stool sample from a cat will require you to touch the cat’s stool. Before you do this, always put on medical gloves. You do not want to contract any bacteria or pathogens by touching the stool with your bare hands.Stool samples are often requested by a vet if they want to test a cat for parasites and other pathogens. You will need to bring the stool sample into the vet so they can run various tests on the sample and diagnose the cat.
 With your gloved hands, pick up stool from your cat’s litter box. Try to get stool that does not have a lot of litter attached to it. Fresh stool is best for testing so try to pick up the stool soon after your cat has gone to the bathroom.If you plan to get the stool sample tested, book a testing appointment with your vet in advance. Then collect the stool from the cat’s litter box on the same day as the appointment. The fresher the stool samples are, the more accurate the results of the testing of the samples will be.
 Use a plastic bag with an air tight seal. Once the stool sample is in the bag, label the bag “stool sample” as well as the date. Then, bring the sample to the vet for the testing.If you are not bringing the sample into the vet for testing right away, you can store it in the refrigerator overnight. Do not keep the sample next to open food items or fresh foods. Double bag the sample and place it on its own shelf so it does not come in contact with the food in your fridge.

 Allow the ashes to cool before you attempt to handle them. Do not use any ashes that contain residue from plastic or trash that may have been burned, since these ashes could be toxic., If it's from a natural source, allow the water to come to a boil first in case it’s contaminated. Allow boiling water to cool before you attempt to wash the dishes, however, since it could splash on you and injure you.
 While you’re waiting for the water to heat, use a sponge, a rag, or even a sturdy stick to remove large bits of food from the dishes. Don’t worry about any grease left on the dishes since this will actually combine with the ashes to form a basic soap.
 Add the water slowly and gradually since you only want to add enough to create a paste. Stir it thoroughly with a stick and let it sit for a few minutes.


While it's sitting, the hot water is dissolving potassium salts from the ashes to make a strong alkali solution. The alkali water will react with the fatty acids in the grease on your dishes to make soap., Do not touch the paste with your bare hands, since alkali water is extremely harsh on your skin. Wear gloves if possible, or use a stick or a scrubber with a handle to smear the paste all over your dishes.
 Do not rinse anything near a water source like a river or stream since you’ll contaminate it with the ashes.Instead, find a spot away from any bodies of water and rinse everything with the leftover boiled water, or boil more water and allow it to cool enough to handle.

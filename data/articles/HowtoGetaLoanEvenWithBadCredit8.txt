 If you plan on getting a loan, you're going to have to ask for it eventually, and that means meeting with a lender.You must present hard copies of financial documents to back up the information you presented in your loan application. Plan to bring with you: employment information and housing history for the last two years, two years worth of W-2 forms and income tax forms, complete information and several months worth of statements for all bank accounts and complete information for any outstanding loans and credit card debt., A loan application captures basic information about you including your social security number, income, expenses and savings to name a few. Be sure your application is neat and complete. A lending officer shouldn't have to struggle to read your information. In some lending situations, you may choose to write a loan application letter. Use this letter to explain why you need the loan, how you plan to use it and your plan for repayment.
 Without a strong credit report behind you, you may have to work harder and have greater determination to get a loan. Facing rejection is never easy, but don't let it stop you from trying again and again if that's what's necessary to succeed in getting the money that you need.


Make a plan. Create a list of at least a dozen lending institutions in your area and begin applying. If you receive a rejection from the first company, move on to the next institution on your list. Just knowing that there are more possibilities out there can help to keep your spirits up and your options open.
Ask for feedback. If your loan application is rejected, be sure to find out why. Use what you've learned to try to strengthen your position for your next application.

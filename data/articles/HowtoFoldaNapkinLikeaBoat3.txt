 Start with the napkin in a square position. Fold it down so it meets the bottom right hand corner. Crease the fold with your hand, or a heavy object like a paperweight. Then turn the napkin around, so the fold is facing downwards., Take the left corner with your hand and fold it down. Do this until you have a straight edge running down the middle. Note: you are not folding it left to right, but down. Do this until there is about one inch of fabric left at the bottom. Crease the fold you have made with your hands., Take the right corner and fold it down. Do this until you have a straight edge in the middle. You should now have two edges in the middle (from the left and right folds) that are basically touching each other. Crease the fold with your hand or a paperweight., Pull the bottom left flap upwards. Do this until the top flap meets the bottom fold. Now do the same with the bottom right fold. Lift it up until the top right flap meets the bottom fold. Crease both folds with either your hand or a heavy object., This will create the "boat" part of the sailboat. Pull up the bottom edge as much as you would like, depending on the size of the boat and/or sail you want. Once this is done, lay the napkin on a plate.

Social support is an important part of emotional health, and having a few good friends can help heal the hurt caused by a toxic parent.Take the initiative and join groups, classes or activities with people who have similar interests as you. Introduce yourself and ask questions about them. Choose to be with people who value your presence and who make you feel good about who you are as a person.
 People who grew up with toxic parents often subconsciously choose friends and romantic partners who recreate the same dynamic. Take a look at your social circle and evaluate whether your relationships are built on mutual liking, helpfulness, and trust.If you discover that you have some toxic friendships, it’s probably best to distance yourself from those people.
Listen to your instincts when selecting new friends. Do you often feel uncomfortable, pressured, or frightened around them? Do they shame you into doing things you don't want to? Stay way from these types of people.
 You might not like to think about it, but it’s possible that you could have learned some toxic behaviors from your parent.

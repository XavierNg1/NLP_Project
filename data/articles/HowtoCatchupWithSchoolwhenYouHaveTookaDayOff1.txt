 Do not procrastinate on catching up with school. As soon as you return to school, collect any assignments you missed and ask your teachers about any tests and quizzes you need to make up. New work will start piling on fast, and if you put off catching up on old work you can fall even further behind., A list can be a handy tool to show you what you need to do to catch up. This way, you can make sure you don't miss anything. Talk to all of your teachers and make a catch-up list that incorporates work from every class.Do not just write down the subject. Write down the specific material you need to catch up on.
For example, instead of writing down "Finish English assignment," write down "Complete the 10 questions about The Outsiders."

, After writing your list, figure what work should get done first. Some assignments may be more pressing than others.Teachers often differ in how long they give you to catch up. If your English teacher said you have until the end of the week to turn in the work you missed, you can do English homework later. If your science teacher wants the work the next day, do that first.
You should also think about which assignments will be more time consuming. If your English assignment requires a lot of writing, you may want to do that first to make sure you have enough time.
 Once you've prioritized your list, make a schedule to catch up. Carve out blocks of time where you can focus on different subjects. You can, for example, spend the first hour after school doing your science homework before working on your English homework.If you have a study hall at school, incorporate that into your schedule. You can plan on doing some of your missed work during study hall.

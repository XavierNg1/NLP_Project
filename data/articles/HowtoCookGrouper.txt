Preheat the grill to medium heat and coat it with oil or nonstick cooking spray so the fish does not stick.
Grill the grouper fillets for approximately 5 minutes per side or until they flake with a fork.



Use 3 shallow bowls and fill the 1st with flour, the 2nd with 1 cup (237 ml) of milk and 2 eggs and the 3rd with cornmeal and seasonings.
Dredge the grouper in the flour and place it into the egg wash. Dip the fish into the cornmeal to coat both sides.
Preheat a large skillet with 2 inches (5.1Â cm) of vegetable oil until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius).
Add the grouper fillets but do not crowd the pan and fry on both sides until golden brown and flaky.



Preheat a cast iron pan over medium heat with 2 tbsp. (29.58 ml) olive oil. The olive oil should be smoking before putting the fish in.
Place the grouper fillets into the cast iron pan. Allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes each side or until the fish flakes with a fork.



Add 4 cups (948 ml) of your choice of liquid, such as water, broth, wine, juice or a combination, to a large skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add herbs and spices, if desired.
Place the grouper fillets into the simmering liquid.
Cook for about 5 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and flaky.



Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).
Grease a baking dish with a thin layer of olive oil and place the grouper fillets in the dish.
Sprinkle the top of the fillets with breadcrumbs to help hold in moisture and create a crunchy topping.
Cook uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes or until the fish flakes with a fork.

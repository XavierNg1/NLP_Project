, If you are using an online service, upload the image to the website. If you are using a downloaded program, open the image file in the program.
 This could take a few minutes if the image file is large.
 After scanning the document, the OCR program will return the text it was able to retrieve. The text that you get will be dependent on the clarity of the original image.


OCR programs will not provide you with the original image. Only text is converted.
 Paste the text into the document that you want to add it to.
 Even the most advanced OCR software will occasionally mistake a character or two. Make sure to carefully read the converted text to ensure that there are no typos or serious errors.

 If you are in a relationship with someone who is abusive to you or you have a coworker who treats you with disrespect, talk to someone about it. If the relationship has become violent or you fear for your safety, ask for help to get away from the person. Do not attempt to deal with the person alone. Ask a friend or family member to help you.


If you are a victim of domestic abuse, you can also call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233., If the sociopath you are dealing with is not a family member or other loved one, disengage with the person. Continuing to spend time with the person may have a negative impact on your life.


Stop contacting the person, and avoid situations/places where you may run into the person, if possible.
Let the person know that you need some space, and request that he/she refrain from contacting you.
If the person does not cooperate and refuses to leave you alone, then you may want to consider changing your telephone number and other contact information. If he or she proceeds to stalk you, then consider filing for a restraining order., If the person you are dealing with is someone that you cannot or do not want to cut out of your life, be cautious about the way that you confront them about their behavior. Before you confront a sociopath about his or her behavior, remember that sociopaths are by nature defensive, irritable, and potentially violent. Ask for help from friends or family members and organize an intervention to prevent the likelihood of a hostile reaction.


Avoid making accusatory statements or pointing out specific things that the person has done wrong. Rather, focus on the bigger picture and let the person know that you are genuinely concerned for his or her health. Start by saying something like, “I am worried about you and I want to help.”
Avoid talking about your feelings or how the person has hurt you. Sociopaths are likely to be unresponsive to these types of statements.

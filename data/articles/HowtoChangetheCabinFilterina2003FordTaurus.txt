 The difference is that this one is a bit thinner/smaller.;
, In plain English, this is the plastic piece just below where your window wipers sit when they are at rest. There are two "cowls" One on the driver side, one on the passenger side. You will be removing the passenger side only.
 Face your front windshield and look for a series of small metal retaining clips at the base of the cowl (closest to the engine, not the windshield) You will remove the first three only - counting from the passenger side toward the center. One clip holds the left and right cowls where they meet.
 Set these aside in a safe place. Close your hood. Gently lift the rubber seal that is molded to the cowl from the windshield and locate the four more retaining clips. These don't come off, as the others did. Simply insert a small flat head screwdriver and press down on the barbed portion of the clip to release it. For ease of access, you may want to lift the wiper into the up position. Just don't forget to lay it back down before you open the hood again.
 It should come loose quite easily.
 There is rubber seal that runs along the top of it and is not necessary to remove. Look just under the visor and you'll see the Cabin Air Filter. The left side of the visor is a friction fit. The right side has a simple snap clip molded in to the plastic visor. Lift up on the visor. The snap clip should release itself with gentle pressure. Now you should be able to reach in and remove the Cabin Air Filter.
 from the surrounding housing/area.
,, Done!

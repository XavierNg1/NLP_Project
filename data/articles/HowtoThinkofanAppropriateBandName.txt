 There's a lot of really cool sounding bands out there with pretty strange/cheesy names. E.g. 'DragonForce' A band from London. They're really awesome. But not many people like the idea that 'DragonForce' is a video game from the 1980s.;
, Or even try making up your own word. Or put in some variety. Make up your own word and find another word that already exists to go in it.
 A small example 'Madness'. A band from London in the late 1970s. They chose the name Madness because of all the trouble they had to go through into just forming a band and making songs.
 If you have already wrote some songs, then scan through a few of them and have a look for a lyric or a bunch of lyrics and see what sounds cool as a name.

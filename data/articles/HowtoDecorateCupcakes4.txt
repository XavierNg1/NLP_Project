 Place a spoonful of icing on the center of the cupcake. Use an icing spatula (or palette knife) to spread the icing around the top of the cupcake, out to the edges. Smooth the top with the spatula as desired.


For a smooth look, run the spatula edge across the top. For a fluffier look, lightly touch the iced surface with the spatula blade and lift up.
 For a twist to your ordinary frosted cupcake, pour ganache, melted chocolate, or icing over the tops of your cupcakes. To do this, let the cupcakes cool completely. Begin pouring over the center of the cupcake. You can totally cover the cupcake or cover just the top and let the topping drip over the sides.


Set them on a cooling rack positioned over top a cookie sheet. The cookie sheet will catch any drippings. Let the cupcakes cool to allow the topping to set.
The same method can be used with warmed icing.
 The bottom sides of cupcakes are easiest to cover with fondant. Use a spatula to spread a thin layer of buttercream frosting over the surface. Roll out the fondant to the desired size to cover the cupcake, keeping the thickness to about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm). Lay the fondant over the cupcake and smooth it out.


Cut off any excess frosting at the bottom. It's easiest to trim with a spatula. Use your hands to continue to smooth the surface of the fondant.
 Now that cupcake baking is such a trend, you can find just about anything. You can find any image in the form of buttercream, fondant, gum paste, royal icing, or candy. Any.

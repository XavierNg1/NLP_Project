 Decide where to place your bracket but it is important to measure each hole's distance of your bracket and apply that distance on the wall by using a marker such as a pencil or a pen.;
, Drill holes by using a drill bit as deep as the anchor. Brush off the dusts.
 Push them in the wall with your fingers. You might have to push them in to seat them flush against the wall with a plastic screwdriver handle after you push them as far as you can with your fingers.
 Turn the screw until it's firmly holding the bracket against the wall. The anchors are shaped with ridges so they won't pull out easily once you put them in the wall.
 If you make a hole too big with the dry wall anchor and have to start over in a new place you will need to buy a small plastic container of a material called spackling. This is a white pasty type of material that is used to repair small dents, holes, and other minor drywall damage. You put it in the hole with a plastic putty knife, and smooth it down to look more aesthetic.

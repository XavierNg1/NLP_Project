 Girls don't want to deal with your week-old BO. Man, YOU don't want to deal with your week-old BO. Take regular showers and use deodorant. It will surprise you how much of a difference this makes if you haven't been doing this already.;
, It's not like you have to go around wearing Armani or anything, just wear clothes that fit, suit your body, don't have holes or stains, and don't look like they were the height of fashion in 1986. Don't worry so much about brands: a girl worth having won't care what brand of clothing you wear. Just make sure you're dressed such that she wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen with you.
 Just like you love a girl who smells like a perfect princess fresh out of fairy land, girls love it when men smell amazing too. You can do this by first keeping your body clean, and then adding a nice scent. This can be as simple as getting a really nice smelling deodorant. If you want to go a bit further, you can try cologne or body sprays. Just make sure that the smell is subtle and that you put it on correctly. She doesn't want you to smell like you bathed in Axe.
 Just like guys usually prefer a fairly skinny girl, girls usually prefer decently fit guys. Don't feel like you have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, because she won't care so much whether you have a six pack or not...just get yourself to a point where you're healthy and comfortable...say, walking up a large hill. This will make you feel better in your own skin and help attract women.


It's not that they're vain or hung up on societal ideas about weight, it's more that not exercising shows that you don't really care about yourself enough to keep your body healthy (even if that's not true).
If you've both got a couple of extra pounds, you better be prepared to work on your own weight if you're going to ask her to work on hers.

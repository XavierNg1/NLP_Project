 Your personal information should be considered highly-sensitive material when dealing with people online. Pick a user name other than your real name (unless you are comfortable with the other person or community). Protect information that could be connected back to you:


Banking information
Social security number
Age, location, school or workplace
Anything which could, in turn, be connected directly to you (such as an email address containing your real name)
When chatting with a webcam, make sure there isn't anything personally identifiable in the frame. You might be surprised how easily people can spot things like an address on an envelope or a high school picture.
 Trolls are people who say things to intentionally get a rise out of others. They also often rely on vicious personal attacks. Trolls can make chats difficult, and can trick you into divulging information you shouldn't. Learn how to spot trolls, and avoid falling into their traps. The best way to deal with a troll is to ignore it; responses of any kind only feed the troll.
 You may get asked to meet up in real life from time to time. You should only agree to this if you are comfortable meeting a stranger, and such meetings should only occur in a safe, public location.


Make sure to tell a friend or family when and where you are meeting the person.
 Treat every interact as if it can be pulled out later and used in the most unpalatable way imaginable.


Almost all chat services will save a copy of your chat log and IP address in case the authorities subpoena them for a copy. Keep this in mind when you consider engaging in illegal activity through a chat program.

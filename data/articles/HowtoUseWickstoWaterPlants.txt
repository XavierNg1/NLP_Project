 You can also wrap the wick around the pencil. Make sure it is secured and then set it aside for later use.
 If it is a large plant, you may want to ask a friend to help you, so that you will not destroy the roots.
 Thread the bottom of the shoelace or wick through the draining hole in the pot.


If you do not have a self-draining pot, use this opportunity to plant the plant you have just uprooted into a self-draining pot. Place some soil near the bottom to replace any soil lost from the original pot.
 Take care when you move the plant from now on. You do not want to tug hard and remove the wick.

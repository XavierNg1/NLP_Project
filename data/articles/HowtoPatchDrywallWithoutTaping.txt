 Once you have a 4x4 square drawn out around the hole, cut this out carefully. (Do this only if you have a small hole measuring about 2"x3").;
, Cut out a piece of sheetrock measuring 6"x 6".


With this piece of sheetrock (6x6) turn it over so the back of the s-rock is "up" and measure out the dimensions of 4x4 on the back side. Draw this out with a pencil, and then use a utility knife to carefully cut the back out without going all the way through to the front paper.
 Score the back somewhat deep, and leave the square in the center. You should now have the full 6x6 section with the rear scored out.
 The Sheetrock will try to stay sealed to the front of the paper, but will come off if you peel it. Do this to each edge, and when done, you should have what appears to be a full 6x6 section of S-rock on front. However. when turned over, it will have a 4x4 section of S-rock in the center, with 6x6 inches of paper on the front.
 You want it to fit tight. Shave any imperfections for that perfect fit.
 Wet the edges of the excess paper on your patch, and the edges of the sheetrock on both the patch and the wall hole, (this will help it bond later). Apply a very small amount of joint compound to the inside of the paper that will be facing the wall.
 You should now have the patch in place, and be ready for the joint compound.
 Use a broad knife.
 Allow this to dry and then sand smooth.

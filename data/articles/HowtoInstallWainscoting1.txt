 Remove existing baseboards, chair rails or skirt moldings. You should also remove outlet plates. Measure the linear footage of the room or wall with a tape measure in order to determine the number of panels you will need to purchase.


Allow wood wainscot panels to acclimate in the room where they will be installed for at least 48 hours. This will prevent expansion and contraction of the paneling from occurring after installation.;
, Establish a level line around the room for the top of the panels. Measure the appropriate height of the panels, up from the floor, and using a level as a straight edge, lightly pencil a guideline on each wall. A laser level will make this easiest.
 Use a stud finder tool, or gently tap the wall with a hammer, to locate the wall studs and mark them just above the level line.
 Apply construction adhesive to the back of a full panel and set it into place beginning in the corner of the room. Ensure the top of the panel is flush with your level line. Hold the panel in place and secure it with paneling nails. Try to anchor the molding into the marked wall studs whenever possible. Continue installing panels in the same manner, leaving 1/16 inch (2.54 cm) of space between each panel, until you arrive at the next corner.


The bottom of a piece can be sanded down or trimmed if there is variation in the floor and the piece will not fit. However, you should double check that the top level line was made correctly.
You will need to cut a hole for an outlet when you see that a panel will cover one. Cover the outlet in brightly colored chalk, line up the panel, press the panel into the chalk to get your outline, and then cut out the shape with a jigsaw.
 Measure and cut the final panel with a jigsaw to accommodate the appropriate length of the wall.
 Ensure the molding is flush and level with the top of the wainscoting. Again, secure each piece to a wall stud when possible.

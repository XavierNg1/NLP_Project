 How we think about eating and food is directly related to how we feel and behave in relation to food.Thus, if you change the way you think about food you can reduce your overeating behaviors.


Associate the idea of not overeating with a desirable outcome such as being thinner, healthier and more energetic.
When you have the urge to binge or overeat, stop yourself and think something like, “I can resist eating this. I am healthy, and I do not eat food that I don’t need.”

, By creating a positive image of yourself, you can overcome your body's desire to overeat and you can learn to associate self-control of your appetite with the dynamic person that you are.For example, create a mental image of the kind of person you want to be. In your mind, see yourself as an attractive, vibrant person who is in control of her appetite. Keep remembering this image when you are triggered to overeat.
 Mindlessness, or not paying attention, accounts for much of over-eating.We simply don’t pay attention to how much food we are consuming and so we can unintentionally overeat.


Eat smaller bites and pay attention to each small bite of food.
Eat slowly and carefully. Pay attention to how each piece of food tastes, and its texture.
It is very difficult to be mindful while doing another activity. So avoid eating while watching television, working, or driving.
 Impulsivity can lead to overeating.If you can reduce your impulsivity you can make better decisions about the food you consume.


Stop and think when you have an impulse. Identify the impulse. Think about alternative options of food choices or activities you can do besides eating. Perhaps go for a run or play a game.
Remind yourself of your goals and the consequences of overeating. Ask yourself, “Is this worth it?”

 The amount of food, or number of calories, your Chihuahua needs to eat in a day is dependent on its age and activity level. Your dog’s individual metabolism is also a factor, but since it is very difficult to determine, it is best to calculate the amount of food your dog should receive on the first two factors.


Adult Chihuahuas (1 to 7 years old) that are healthy and exercise daily need approximately 35 to 40 calories per pound of body weight daily.
Senior dogs (8 years and older), which likely have some health issues, need roughly 30 calories per pound of body weight a day. , Ideally, you want to feed your Chihuahua dog twice a day—once in the morning and once at night. You can adjust the exact times you feed your dog to create a schedule that works best for you as far as food and bathroom trips. For instance, the timing of their evening meal will affect when you dog needs to use the bathroom the next morning.


You can also choose to feed your Chihuahua only once a day, feeding them one meal at dinner time. However, this breed does best when they are fed twice a day., Generally, adult Chihuahuas should only be given snacks in limited amounts, and occasionally. It is best to use them to reinforce good behavior.


When looking for a manufactured snack, stay away from brightly-colored ones. Rawhides are also known to cause severe digestive problems.For homemade treats, offer baby carrots, blueberries, and raspberries. You can also give them plain white yogurt (regular, not low-fat) or mix some fruit in with the yogurt.

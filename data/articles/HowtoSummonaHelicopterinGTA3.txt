 After launching the game, have your console controllers or computer keyboard ready. Do not push any buttons and remain still right where your game character is standing. Do not pause the game or otherwise disrupt it.
 All you need to do is enter a specific set of cheat code, depending on whether youâ€™re playing the game on PS3/4, Xbox 360, or PC, in order to summon a helicopter.



PS3/PS4 - Press the following buttons on your controller in correct and exact order: Circle, Circle, L1, Circle, Circle, Circle, L1, L2, R1, Triangle, Circle, Triangle.

Xbox 360 - Press the following buttons on your Xbox controller in this order: B, B, LB, B, B, B, LB, left trigger, right trigger, Y, B, Y.

PC - Press the tilde (~) button on your keyboard, and then type "BUZZOFF".
 Right after typing in the cheat codes, the helicopter will appear right in front of you. Approach it and press the player-assigned "Ride Vehicle" button.

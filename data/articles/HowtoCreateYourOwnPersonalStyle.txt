 Like American girl dolls, Webkinz , water marbles, silly bands, strawberry shortcake, dogs, cupcakes etc.;
, For example, bows, peace signs, hearts etc.
 But, have a few close friends that you know you will never ever lose. Treat your friends with respect, share secrets with them, and share with them. Most importantly, always let your friends know how much they mean to you.
 So you can have friends with other people on "Youtube" and not just in school.
 Make them about the queen bees.
 Like: maybe that's what you think, buts it's not what I think, nor my friends.
 Let everyone feel equal.
 Tell people about them, and maybe offer to sell some.
,, Post up all the things you like on it, they can be from drawings, the internet, magazines etc. Then post the pinboard on your wall. You can also make a dream-board. That will have all of the things you want to happen in your life, on it. For example a big house, a family etc.
,, Don't let anybody run you down. Don't tear down your Justin Bieber poster because some pretty girl said that he was VERY lame. Be yourself, and have confidence in yourself, and where you want to go in life.

 If you get pulled over for a traffic violation, police officers have the option of giving you a written warning in lieu of a ticket. This is likely to happen if you have no previous traffic violations and the violation was not severe.;
, Read over your written warning. It will list the offence, the officer’s name, and the location of the violation. Depending on the state, it may also show the potential consequences for a ticket for your violation.
 Luckily, you don’t have any fines from your written warning. If you had gotten a ticket, this would have been different. Warnings are simply given to remind you that you can’t perform that action.


Written warnings can be recorded. Although they won’t make your insurance rates go up, they will come up if you happen to get pulled over again.
If you’ve already received a written warning, you’ll likely get an actual citation if you get pulled over for a similar violation.

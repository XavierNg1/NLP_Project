 This is by far the easiest way to access your email account from another computer. Mail to Web services, like mail2web.com, are not like web-based e-mail accounts. Instead they relay the unreceived messages from your server to a computer other than your own so you can access your mail from anywhere in world. Other popular options include hightail.com, myemail.com, and mail.com. Some services may require you to know the name of your server but mail2web.com does not., This will bring you to the website's main page.
 Occasionally, they may ask for a bit more information like your name but never anything more than that. These services should always be free and should not ask for more than your basic information. If they do, find another service.
 The Log Out option can be found in the top righthand corner of the display. Because this is not your computer, other users may be able to access your account if you do not delete your username and password.
 Your mail to web service will most likely prompt you to exit out of your browser and clear your cache after you log out of your account.
 This will clear your cache and ensure the security or your e-mail account.
 Remember that using this method with your POP, or Post office Protocol account, will only access the messages that you have received since the last time you checked your account. You may also access your messages through POP compatible programs like Mozilla Thunderbird, Outlook Express, Outlook, or Eudora.

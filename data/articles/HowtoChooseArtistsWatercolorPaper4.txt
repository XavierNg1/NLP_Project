 The spiral-bound kind are great if you want to keep all of your paintings together, or are traveling and want to keep an illustrated diary that includes your paintings. The glued ones make it easier to tear off a finished painting while it's drying and start work on another. They come in a range of sizes, usually from postcard-size up to 18 x 24" (45 x 60 cm).







Blocks contain 20-25 sheets of 140lb paper, glued together on all four sides. The advantage to blocks is that by having all four edges bound, the paper is less likely to buckle as you're painting. The thick backing board onto which the sheets of paper are bound keeps everything stable and makes it easy to hold the block of paper on your lap while working.







Sheets are a great deal if you want to try a paper without committing to an entire pad/block. You'll also end up switching to sheets if you work larger than 18 x 24", or want to use heavier-weight papers. You can buy most brands of 140lb watercolor paper either in individual 22 x 30" sheets, or in a package of 4-10.







Rolls are usually 44-60" wide and 10 yards (9.1Â m) long. If you love a particular paper so much you want to use it all the time, buying it buy the roll will be most economical in the long run. If you want to paint watercolors larger than 22 x 30", buying paper by the roll and cutting it yourself will be your only recourse.

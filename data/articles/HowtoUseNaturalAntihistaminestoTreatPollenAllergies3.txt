 Nettles, Eyebright, and Butterbur can be used in steam treatments if you have the dried herb. You will only need 1 teaspoon of the dried herb per treatment session.
 Stir the herb into the water, so that it is fully combined. You do not need the water to be actively boiling, just steaming.
 Cover your head with a towel and inhale the steam using both your nose and mouth. Do this for as long as you want to, but the longer you do it for the more your sinuses should be cleared out.
 Make sure you are careful not to burn yourself on the hot steam! Also, the first time you do this approach, take one breath and then step away from the steam. This is to test whether you have any reaction to the herbs. When you think about it, you are having an allergic reaction to a plant product and there is a chance you might react to this herb!

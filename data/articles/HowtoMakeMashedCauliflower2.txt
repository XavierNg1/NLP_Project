 Fill a large saucepan or stockpot roughly halfway with water and heat it over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, add a dash of salt to the water.


Adding salt to the water allows the salt the flavor the cauliflower as it cooks. You could add it before the water reaches a boil, but doing so will cause the water to take a little more time to reach its boiling point.
 Place the florets in the boiling water and cook, uncovered, until tender.The cauliflower should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.
 After draining the cauliflower, return it to the still-hot pot and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes.


Drain the cauliflower by pouring the contents of the pot through a colander.
Remove the pot from the heat while letting the cauliflower stand.
Cover the pot as the cauliflower stands.
 Add the olive oil to a small skillet and heat it over medium heat for roughly 60 seconds.


The oil should be glossy and hot, but not hot enough to sizzle.
 Place the garlic in the hot oil and cook for roughly 2 minutes, or until it becomes soft and fragrant.Stir the garlic frequently using a spatula as it cooks.
Remove the garlic from the skillet once ready.
 Add cooked garlic, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to the stockpot along with the cauliflower.


If your stockpot is large enough, you do not need to transfer the cauliflower to another bowl. It can be mashed directly inside the pot.
 Use this utensil to smash the soft cauliflower until it reaches a chunky consistency reminiscent of mashed potatoes. Make sure that the other ingredients are worked into the cauliflower as you mash it.


Use firm pressure and press the potato masher straight down into the contents of the pot.
 Mashed cauliflower is best enjoyed while still warm. Top with butter, additional pepper, or chives, as desired.

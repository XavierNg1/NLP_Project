 You can download these applications (e.g. Skype or Google voice) directly from their website. In most cases, the application is free, but you will have to have a credit card that you can use to purchase credit if you want to call a landline or cell phone.


If you have a smart phone, you can also download an app directly to your phone and call on your phone through the app.
 If you are calling to a landline, it will cost a minimal per minute fee to call. If you are calling another computer, you can do it for free.


Follow the instructions on the application you have chosen to purchase the credit.
 Enter the 10-digit number, starting with “1.” Then, follow with the area code (721), then the 7 digit number of the person you are trying to reach.


Some computer based calling apps have a dropdown box where you can select the country code of the place you are trying to call. If the app you are using has this feature, you do not need to type in the “1” again.
 Pay attention to the amount of credit you have left to ensure you can complete your call with the credits you have loaded.


Some apps may give you a warning that will allow you to add more credit during the call if you have saved your credit card information to the system.

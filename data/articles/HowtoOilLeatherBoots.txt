 First use the rag, dry the boots if wet, and then use a good brushing.


You can also use a dampened rag, but remember to dry your boots if they are wet.;
, Wait for it to dry.


Do not be alarmed if it does not all dry at the same time. This is common, and just has to do with the oil soaking into some places faster than others, not always being oiled enough. Just leave it be until it is all soaked in (however, if it is taking more than a few hours of time, you can rub it around a bit to speed up the process).
 It depends some on the product, but most leather boots should be supple and moist. This in turn will keep it in better condition and prevent faster wear, as well as leather cracking and/or breaking off.

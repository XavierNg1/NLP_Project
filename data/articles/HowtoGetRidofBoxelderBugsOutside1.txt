 A perimeter treatment is formulated for use around the exterior of the house and other structures. Spray one of these insecticides around all possible openings, including the entire perimeter of the home, attic vents, basement windows, cellars, windows, doors, siding, garden sheds, and garages.While this will not destroy all the boxelder bugs living in your yard, it will prevent them from getting inside. The bugs that pass over the insecticide barrier will also die, thereby reducing the population in your yard.
Concentrate on spraying the south and southwest sides of the house or yard.
Use a backpack sprayer or power spray rig to achieve maximum coverage. Direct the opening of the sprayer hose toward the area to be treated. Activate the spraying mechanism by pulling the trigger of the sprayer and apply the insecticide in a steady stream.
Pyrethrin-based are among the most effective types to use against boxelder bugs.These sprays are made from a highly poisonous compound found in pyrethrum flowers, and other chemicals may also be added to increase their effectiveness.
Do not use perimeter insecticides on your lawn. These chemicals will often damage your grass and other plants.;
, If you lack the equipment or if home treatment proves ineffective, call a professional exterminator to rid your yard of the bugs.


When you contact the exterminator, indicate whether you want him to prevent the bugs from entering your home or if you want a solution that will remove them from your yard completely. Perimeter treatment is more common, and if you do not specifically state your desire to be rid of the bugs completely, the exterminator may not take measures to remove them from your yard.

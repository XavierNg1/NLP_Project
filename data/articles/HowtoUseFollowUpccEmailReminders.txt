, The system works the same in Yahoo, Outlooks, Gmail, etc. It also works on any mobile email client.
 Type in when you want the reminder at Followup.cc, eg. monday4pm@followup.cc or 2weeks@followup.cc. Then type your message as usual, and hit send. Your reminder will be scheduled and sent to you when you need it.
 Compose your email as usual, then in the BCC field type in when you want the reminder @followup.cc. Send the message, your recipient will receive a normal email and your private reminder will be scheduled.
 If you want everyone on the message to receive a reminder, then put the FollowUp.cc email address in the TO or CC field. This will send your reminder to everyone on your message.

 Location matters dramatically when it comes to picking schools. These are questions you should ask:


Is it safe to walk there?
Would my child have to ride a bus?
Would I be able to get there quickly if there is an emergency?;
, If there several opportunities, like choir and band, then it is a good option. If there is nothing after school, then you may want to reconsider.
 Questions like the ones below are good to ask when thinking about schools:


Does this school have good sports that my kid likes or would like to be in?
Does it have a good high school or older programs he/she can look forward to?

, Is there is something like vaccinations or dress code that you can't afford, don't agree with, or don't have? If so then you cannot go to this school.
 If the price that you must pay for book fees and lunches may be too much for your price range, some schools offer reduced or free lunches.
 If they aren't comfortable with joining that particular school, then don't force them, but do try to persuade them.

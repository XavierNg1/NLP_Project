 Traditionally, softball players use what’s called the four-seam grip. This grip consists of the index, middle, and ring finger and requires you to grip the ball perpendicular to the seams, with your fingertips across the top of the “C” or horseshoe pattern. Your thumb should grip the seams on the underside of the ball below your index finger.


Always hold the softball with the tips of your fingers and avoid “palming” the ball. Palming occurs when the ball is situated too far back into your grip and results in loss of speed and control.
Holding the softball properly should result in a backspin when you release the ball. This is often referred to as “snap,” and gives you more control and better speed.;
, When you’re preparing to throw, the instep of your rear foot should directly face your target and your front foot should be aligned with your back foot. This stance puts your upper body in line with your target and results in more accurate throws.
 Your elbow should be at shoulder height and forming a right angle with your forearm in an “L” shape.


Keep your palm facing away from you as you prepare to throw to give your wrist more torque.
 Once you’re holding the ball correctly and in the right position, lead with the elbow of your glove hand while bringing your glove close to your body. Your elbow will point toward your target and your throwing arm should arc over it and release toward the target. Snap your wrist as you release the ball for extra torque and accuracy.


For longer throws into the infield, use the crow hop to gain momentum. Simply lead with your throwing-side foot, and raise your knee up high. Hop off your rear foot to help boost your knee upward. As your knee begins to drop, leave the ground entirely and repeat the process with your other foot, bringing it just as high. Make the throw as soon as your back foot lands.

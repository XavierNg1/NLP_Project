 Choose a bag that’s large enough to fit all your supplies, and preferably something that has a strap or handles for easy transportation. You’ll probably be bringing this kit with you everywhere, so make sure the bag is comfortable to carry and suitable to your taste. Consider a bag with a few separate compartments and pockets to make it easier to organize your kit.


A small backpack, a large makeup case, purse, or tote bag would all work well for your emergency kit.;
, No matter where you go, who you’re with, or what you’re doing, you should always have at least $10 to $20 in emergency money on you at all times, as well as some change. On top of having some money in your wallet, keep extra emergency money in your kit, preferably in a secure or secret zippered pocket.


Change can be used at a payphone in case your cell phone dies, for an emergency snack from the vending machine, or to buy a pad or tampon from the bathroom dispenser.
Even just $10 can be enough to get you out of a jam, whether you need a meal, cab fare, or anything else.
 Make a list of all the medications you take on a daily basis and write down your known allergies. This is in case there is a medical emergency and a doctor or nurse needs this information. Keep a copy of the list in your emergency kit. Update this copy whenever needed.
 Keep the medications together in a separate case or pocket. Don’t forget the medications you don’t take every day but need in case of emergencies; this could include:


Epinephrine injectors.
Emergency inhalers.
Antihistamines.
Insulin shots.
Eye drops.
 Always have enough supplies on you for at least a few hours of protection. Pack whatever product you prefer, such as pads, liners, tampons, or a menstrual cup. Consider keeping an extra pair of underwear on you as well.


These supplies are just as important even if your period hasn’t started yet. Instead of being caught off guard, you’ll be ready if it comes when you aren’t home.

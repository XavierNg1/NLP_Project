 You can use just about any type of fabric for this project. It should be about three times the height and width of your pillow., Lay the fabric down, wrong side up, on a flat surface. Set your pillow on top of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered., Fold the top edge of the fabric over the pillow and smooth it down. Repeat with the bottom edge. Make sure that the fabric to either side of the pillow is smooth., Smooth the fabric to the left side of the pillow down first. Fold the top edge down at an angle towards the center, then fold the bottom edge up to meet it. When you are done, you should have a "<" shape., Do the same thing you just did for the left side. Fold the top edge down at an angle, then the bottom edge. When you are done, you should have a ">" shape., Fold the left side down first, then the right. Make sure that they are still folded into points., A square knot is essentially a double-knot.Use the same knot as when starting to tie your shoes. Instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse them: right-over-left, then left-over-right.Keep the fabric folded into points.
 If you need to, tuck then inside the knot for extra security.

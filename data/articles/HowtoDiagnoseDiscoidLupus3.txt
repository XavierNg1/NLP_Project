 DLE symptoms may be made worse by exposure to the sun or other UV light exposure, so avoid spending time outside when the sun is out. Limit your sun exposure to time of the day when sunlight is not as intense, such as in the early morning or early evening.Use sunblock and clothing to shield from ultraviolet light.
Do not use tanning beds and donâ€™t sit next to the window at work.
Be careful around water, snow and sand surfaces that reflect ultraviolet rays.
 Topical corticosteroid creams are often used to treat DLE. Your physician will most likely start you with a high dose that you need to apply twice daily and then switch you to a lower maintenance dose. The change in dosage is thought to help prevent negative side effects of the drug, such as atrophy and red marks on the skin.Steroid injections may be useful to treat lesions which have become chronic and developed thick skin or which have not responded to topical steroids. Ask your doctor about this form of treatment as well., Antimalarial drugs are often prescribed as part of treatment for DLE. These medications are used either alone or in combination and include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and mepacrine.Other drugs that might also be considered, when antimalarial drugs, topical corticosteroids and intralesional steroids are not effective, are methotrexate, cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and azathrioprine.
The medication doses are determined on the lean body weight of the individual to reduce the potential for toxicity from the drugs.

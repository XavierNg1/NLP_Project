 Wait until the surface of your glass stove top is entirely cool before cleaning. Sprinkle baking soda over each burner circle (or the entire surface of the stove top, if desired). Be sure to add a thick layer of baking soda to cover all of the area you wish to clean., Fill a spray bottle with white vinegar. Spray the surface of the stove with the vinegar. Make sure that all of the baking soda is covered with vinegar and let the ingredients sit for 15 minutes., Using a clean, wet cloth, wipe down the entire surface of the stove. Re-wet and wring out the cloth as needed to fully remove the baking soda and vinegar. Let the surface air dry before using the stove., For stubborn food stains or scorch marks, use a magic eraser pad for cleaning. Wet the pad and gently wipe stains. To make cleaning easy, remove stains as soon as they occur to prevent them from caking onto the surface of the stove.

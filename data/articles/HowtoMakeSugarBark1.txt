 Line with parchment paper––this baking sheet is where you will spread the sugar mixture to create the sugar bark once it's melted. Set aside in readiness for use shortly.
 Place the cup of sugar into the small saucepan., Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves; the mixture will come to the boil., Brush the saucepan around the sides, above the line of the sugar. This prevents the mixture from crystallizing., Keep an eye on it but don't stir. When a rich, caramel color forms, remove the sugar mixture from the heat. Set down until the bubbles can no longer be seen before proceeding., Tilt the sheet to disperse the sugar mixture evenly across the sheet. It should be very thin, so shift the sheet around from each side., Once the sugar bark has hardened, it is ready for use. Break it into shards and place in coffee drinks or use to decorate a dessert that is just about to be eaten.

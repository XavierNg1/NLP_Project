 If you live in an area where there isn’t much within walking distance, consider riding the bus to meet your date at a restaurant or coffee shop. Plan your route ahead of time, and always make sure you are catching the correct bus. Public transportation is a great way to get around if you can’t drive.


Make sure you have your fare ready, depending on what the cost is in your area.
If you are going to meet your date, make sure you plan to meet at a specific stop or location, so you don’t get lost.
If you and your date are going to head out on public transportation together, try to take a more scenic route and enjoy the ride!;
, If your date lives far away, taking a train to meet halfway may be a good option. Offer to meet your date at a place that is in the middle of both of you, such as a restaurant or a coffee shop. You can also use the transit system to take your date to a more walkable area, if there isn’t much for you to do within walking distance of your home.


Make sure you know the route of the train you are taking and which stop you want to get off at.
Always check the train schedules ahead of time and plan out which train you will need to take to get home.
 Take your date for a scenic ride on a bus or train. There’ll be lots of new places and people to see. You’ll be able to sit and talk with your date, people watch, and cruise around the city. Choose routes that have good views.


Ride the bus or the train to the end of line, and then ride the same way back!

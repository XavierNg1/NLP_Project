 Pour the olive oil into a frying pan and place it over medium high heat. Heat the oil until it just begins to smoke. Don't overheat the oil or it will burn.
 Season them with salt and pepper, then place them in the hot oil. Cook each lamb shank on all three sides, for four minutes on each side. Don't cook the shanks all the way through; just cook them long enough to brown them and bring out their deep flavor.
 Place them bone-side up in the slow cooker among the vegetables, herbs and stock. Keep the pan in place, since you don't want to waste the drippings.
 Pour the cup of wine into the hot pan and let it come to a simmer. Scrape off the brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add the wine to the slow cooker after 1 minute of simmering., Cook them on high for 6 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. When the shanks are ready, they should easily fall apart when poked with a fork.
 Place each one on a plate and ladle some of the vegetable and wine sauce over each one. Serve with potatoes, vegetables or rice.

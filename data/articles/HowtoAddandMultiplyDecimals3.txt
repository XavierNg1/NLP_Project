Since you are adding, you need to set up the numbers with the decimal points aligned.

Make the numbers the same length by turning 4.25 into 4.250.

Add according to the standard algorithm. Ignore the decimal points for now, so that you are adding 4250 and 8598. You should end up with 12848.

Drop the decimal point into the sum. It should align with the decimal points in the two addends. So 12848 becomes 12.848.


Since you are multiplying, ignore the decimal point and set up the standard vertical multiplication algorithm. So, you will multiply 53×96{\displaystyle 53\times 96}.

Multiply as normal, finding the partial products and adding them together. You should end up with 5088.

Count the decimal places in the two factors. 5.3 and 9.6 each have 1 decimal place, for a total of 2 decimal places.

Place the decimal into the product. Since combined the factors have 2 places to the right of the decimal point, the product will have 2 places to the right of the decimal point. So take the product 5088 and imagine a decimal point at the end of the number. Move it 2 places to the left. It should sit between the 0 and 8. So, 5088 becomes 50.88.
 Miley has 8.5 yards of yellow fabric. Archie has 12.75 yards of yellow fabric. How many yards of fabric do they have all together?

The phrase “all together” tells us to add. This problem has three numbers, but you add them just like you would two numbers.

Line up the three problems vertically, with the three decimal points aligned.

Make all of the numbers the same length by adding a 0 in the hundredths place of 8.5. So, 8.5 becomes 8.50.

Add according to the standard algorithm. Ignore the decimal points, so that you are adding 1025, 850, and 1275. You should find the sum 3150.

Drop the decimal point into your answer. It should be aligned with the three decimal points of the addends, between the 1 and the 5. So, 3150 becomes 31.50. So, together, Stanley, Miley, and Archie have 31.5 yards of yellow fabric.

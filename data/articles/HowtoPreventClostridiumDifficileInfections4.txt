, If you develop signs and symptoms and test positive for Clostridium difficile it is key to stop your present antibiotics immediately. This will prevent worsening of the infection. Your doctor will have antibiotics to treat Clostridium difficile, which will most likely be different than the antibiotics you were on in the first place.


The general first-line antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile infections is an antibiotic called metronidazole (Flagyl).
Other antibiotic therapies that can be tried include Vancomycin or Fidaxomicin.
 Therefore, after receiving treatment, it is important to be on the lookout for any further diarrhea or other symptoms, and to seek medical help immediately if you suspect that you may have a recurrence.


Recurrences will again be treated with antibiotics that are specific to a Clostridium difficile infection.
Relapse may present within days or weeks, especially if your probiotics are not restored. The clinical presentation may be similar to or more severe than the initial presentation.
For people with multiple recurrences, there is a new therapy called a "fecal transplant" (a stool transplant) that is relatively new, but has shown success at effectively treating Clostridium difficile.

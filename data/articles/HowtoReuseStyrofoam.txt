 Try to use other alternatives which are more biodegradable. For example, when you can buy eggs in either cardboard or Styrofoam, choose to buy the cardboard-packaged eggs.;
, This way, you are not creating any more demand for Styrofoam products. If you have no packaging use coming up soon, take your Styrofoam peanuts to a nearby packaging store and donate them.
 They work perfectly. Also if you have huge planters it makes them that much lighter. If you don't have peanuts, just break up the formed packaging foam into your pot. It is messy with little beads going loose.
 Pure orange rind oil, d-Limonene, is known to work.

Pour biodegradable solvent into a large container.






Add Styrofoam to the container. The solvent will slowly break down the Styrofoam.






The resulting liquid will be very sticky and is perfect for use as a permanent glue around the house.
 They will usually accept free offers of your Styrofoam and re-use it for packing.

 This method works best if you naturally have wavy hair, since you won't be able to straighten it beforehand and you won't be adding to your natural curl. Apply a curl cream based on your natural curl type to give your waves a bit more hold.
 Use a micro fiber cloth or towel, since a regular towel is too abrasive on the cuticle of naturally curly hair and will cause frizz. Squeeze your hair gently to get rid of extra water.
 Use mousse or gel for optimal hold. For a more textured look, use a sea-salt spray.
 Most blow dryers come with a diffusion attachment that you can apply to the barrel to disperse the air flow.
 For the sections on top of your head, bend over at the waist and flip your hair upside down for easier access.
 Your hair won't need much tousling if you diffuse it-the waves will already be loose and natural-looking.

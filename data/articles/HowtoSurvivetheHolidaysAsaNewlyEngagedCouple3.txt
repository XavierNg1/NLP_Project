 In terms of events, locations, company, etc., there are likely components of every holiday season that each of you hold dear. As such, it’s important to talk with your partner about what each of you want to prioritize. You may find that one of you deeply value spending Thanksgiving with your family, and the other is all about family Christmas. In such a scenario, the holiday planning may simply take care of itself.And if it doesn't, you'll still have a better understanding of how to compromise.
 Even if the planning goes perfectly, everyone’s religious and political inclinations line up, and your first shooting expedition with your partner’s dad is injury free, you may find yourself missing your own family on a holiday you spend away from them. This is entirely natural, especially if you’re accustomed to spending all of the holidays with your own family.When it comes down to it, getting married is a big deal, and it means there will be lots of changes in your life. Remind yourself why you’re getting married in the first place, and try to enjoy a holiday with their family as much as you hope they will enjoy future holidays with yours!
The holidays hold sadness for some families, for instance if they are a reminder of absent relatives. It is important to inform your partner about anything like this in advance. Keeping secrets will only make the event stressful and complicated.
 There's no time of the year that's quite as romantic as the holidays. That said, they can also be emotionally tumultuous, with heavy social schedules, stressful travels, and egg-nog seasoned conversations. Make sure you and your partner get to celebrate the last holiday season before you make it official with at least a few moments alone together.


Be sure to tell each other exactly why it is that you're looking forward to spending all the rest of your days together. Be creative, and don't worry about being too sappy - especially while sitting next to the tree.

 A will can be a pretty simple, straight forward legal document, but it is essential. If you don't have one, you will want to have one drawn up.You can do this yourself or hire a lawyer. Make sure to specify the beneficiaries of your possessions and any financial holdings you may have. If you have children, your will should clearly state the person who will become their legal guardian.Make sure to name an executor. This is the person who will make sure that your legal wishes are carried out.
If you are terminally ill, you will also want to create a living will. This will give a designated family member or friend the power to make legal decisions for you when you are no longer able.
 Making plans can be calming and it may also help you deal with stress. Some people like to make the arrangements for the memorial service that will occur once they have passed away. You can make plans, and they can be as specific or general as you like.If you feel strongly about having either a religious or non-religious service, make sure to specify that. You can also make choices such as the type of music you would like to have playing during the service.
Make your plans clear to a loved one that you can trust. You can do much of the planning yourself, but you will need someone to actually oversee the process once you are gone.
 You may find some comfort in saying farewell to your loved ones. This is a very personal matter, and one that will naturally be on your mind. Remember, there is no one right way to deal with dying. You can die with dignity by dealing with the process as you see fit.One way to say goodbye is by having a conversation. If you feel you will become distraught, you can plan in advance what you would like to say. Remember, tears and emotions are normal.
Some people choose to write letters to their loved ones as a final goodbye. These can be read before or after you have passed.

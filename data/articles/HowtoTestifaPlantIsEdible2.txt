 Some plants that are poisonous look, smell and taste completely edible, but others provide signs that they aren't to be eaten by humans. Avoiding plants with these qualities might cause you to miss out on a plant that's actually edible, but it's much better to play it safe. Stay away from plants with the following characteristics:White berries.
Milky sap.
An almond scent.
Seeds, beans or bulbs inside pods.
Thorns, spines or hairs.
A bitter taste.
Grain heads with pink or black spurs.
Groups of three leaves.
 If you know what you're looking for, you're likely to find some plants that you recognize from the produce aisle of the grocery store. Do not eat any unfamiliar berries that you see unless you are 100% sure that the berry is edible unless you are willing to risk illness and death. Every plant you encounter in the wild should be tested according to the above method since some poisonous plants look very similar to edible ones. However, plants that look like the following common edible plants are a good place to start:Blueberries
Blackberries
Dandelion
Asparagus
Strawberries
Wild onion
Persimmon
Chestnut
Bananas
Mangos
Coconuts
Papaya
Taro
Cactus

, Seaweed is a nutritious plant source that is edible as long as it's harvested fresh from the ocean. Don't attempt to eat seaweed that has washed up on the shore. If you can wade out a bit and harvest some fresh seaweed, you'll have a good food source that provides minerals and vitamin C. These common seaweeds are edible:Kelp
Green seaweed
Irish moss
Dulse
Laver

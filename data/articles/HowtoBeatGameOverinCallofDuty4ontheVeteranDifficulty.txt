 When you collide onto the road with another car coming on the highway you should try to pick off all the enemies directly behind you in the first truck.;
, These guys will have at least two RPG's on them and the captain will signify these by telling you these. After you have defeated all of the trucks a helicopter will start chasing you and your squad. You don't need to really worry about this because the helicopter misses a lot. All you need to do is shoot the RPG at the helicopter and it will stay away from you.
 When you first look up, you will be dazed, then move forward and jump the two ledges. This is the hard part so if you want to win the easy way without killing any enemies this is the way to do it. When you get above the ledges if you look to your left you will see and red car and a crack in the ground with a hole in front of it. Go prone and crawl as far forward towards it as possible. When you do this the enemies chuck grenades at you ad they will bounce off of your body and go down the hole.

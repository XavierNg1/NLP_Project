 Put the magazines in the magazine carrier, if you have one. If your shoulder holster is designed to carry 2 firearms, put both in the holster.;
, It should be under your left arm if you are a right-handed shooter, your right arm for left-handed shooters, or both arms for double carry.
 Make sure the straps aren't twisted.


If your shoulder holster has shoulder pads connected with a strap in back, adjust it so the pads are placed high on your shoulder, near your neck, and not over the shoulder joint. Make sure they're even and centered back-to-front.



The holster should hold the weapon horizontally with the muzzle pointed behind you. The handgrip should protrude 2 inches (5 cm) in front on your left arm when it's relaxed at your side. This forward position makes it easier to draw you firearm, and prevents the muzzle from printing (showing an outline) on the back on your jacket.
If you're carrying your firearm vertically, the handgrip should still be forward of your arm. Weapons with long barrels should be carried vertically so the muzzle points at the ground.
 If you can't, readjust the straps until you can.


You may find you can reach the magazine carrier more easily if you adjust it so it's forward of your arm and tipped up slightly.
 Adjust the straps to keep your weapon and magazines snug against your sides without pulling on your shoulders. Tie-downs are optional.
 Make sure you can do this smoothly and quickly. If you can't, make further adjustments.

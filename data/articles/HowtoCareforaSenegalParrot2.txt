 Senegal parrots can make excellent pets, but that's only if you give them daily attention, quality vet care, a sizable cage, many toys, and a healthy diet. You'll also have to put up with a bit of noise and mess. Senegal parrots can live up to 50 years in captivity! So choosing a Senegal as a pet is a long term commitment., Never buy a parrot from a pet store or "backyard breeder." Look for parrot breeders in your area and pay them a visit. A reputable breeder will allow you to see the birds, and the birds will be housed in large, clean cages. Seek out breeders with that have been in business for a long time, and look for positive online reviews.You may also consider a rescue bird. Seek out bird rescue organizations in your area.
 If you keep a pair of Senegals, the cost will increase but you will have to spend much less time with them. If you're very busy or work often, a single Senegal is not for you. You'll need to give your single Senegal at least an hour of out-of-cage time each day. Pairs will need less attention, but if you want to form any bond with them, they'll need daily out time too.Single Senegals are rather clingy. They view you as a close friend, quite possibly their girlfriend/boyfriend.
If you work all day or travel often even a pair of Senegals may not be right for you.
 These birds are loyal, inventive, funny, silly, and lovable. If you can dedicate the time and energy to your Senegal parrot, you will have a faithful friend for years to come.

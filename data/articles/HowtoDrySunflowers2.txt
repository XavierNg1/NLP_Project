 Small, partially open sunflowers that have not fully matured are a better option than large, mature sunflowers since the seeds have not fully developed. As a result, the seed-filled center will not dry out and lose its seeds after being dried.

This method will help preserve the natural color of the sunflowers better than a standard air-dry method will. It is also thought to preserve the dried flowers even longer.
 Combine three parts borax with seven parts white cornmeal, stirring well to combine thoroughly.Both borax and cornmeal act as drying agents. The combination helps draw the moisture out of an away from the sunflower.
 Coat the sunflowers in the cornmeal and borax mixture, focusing especially on the cut stems and any notably moist portion of the flower.

If possible, place the cut sunflowers in a box and cover them with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of this mixture instead of merely coating them lightly. The more mixture you use, the more effective the drying out process will be.
Place this box in a cool dry place and do not disturb it for 10 to 15 days.
 Place in a dark, dry location for a couple of weeks. Once dry, carefully dust off any remaining cornmeal and borax before using the sunflowers for decorative purposes.

Most of the mixture should come off if you simply give the flowers a gently shake. If necessary, lightly brush your fingertips over the sunflowers to help remove the excess. Do not brush roughly or with an artificial tool, though, since the sunflowers are more fragile now and more likely to break against force.

 Unlike other fish, unagi is served warm instead of cold.
 Lightly dip your fingers in a bowl of water. This moisture helps the rice from sticking to you.,







Pick up a little of the rice and form it into an oblong shape.






Place the unagi on top of the rice, then position a strip of nori across the centre of the fish.






Pick the parcel up by pinching either side, then seal the two ends of the nori together.
 If you don't have it, local teriyaki sauce will also work.,

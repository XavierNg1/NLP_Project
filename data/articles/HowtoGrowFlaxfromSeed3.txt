 These species develop long and deep taproots that make them quite tolerant of drought. The long flowering stems will produce flowers at around 30 to 60 days (annuals) and wait the second year after planting (perennial) and produce those lovely flowers. Heavy rains or hail may flatten your plants but you can always stake and support them.


After flowering stops cut the plant down to the ground for perennial types.Annual species at this time should be uprooted and thrown away to prevent diseases from affecting and killing next years flax crop as these diseases can live in the soil for years. If you want to you can collect seeds from the tiny little brown "paper lanterns" and store them for next year in a tightly sealed zip-lock bag.
The only disease flax can get frequently is fungal and mildew. Place flax in a well circulated breezy site and check for plants turning brown, black and mushy.Flax does not take well to high humidity at night. Water plants in morning to prevent water on the leaves from turning into a fungal rot problem.
Several species of moth caterpillars use this group of plants for food and are not major problems. One called cutworm can sometimes kill young plants by just chewing on the only stem straight through.

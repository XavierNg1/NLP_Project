 This is a good idea if you notice dirt or anything else unappealing on the outside of the onion. You'll be removing the peel, so it isn't absolutely necessary, but it won't hurt anything.;
, Every onion will have a small clump of dirty-looking roots at the bottom. Hold the onion sideways on a clean cutting board and press a sharp knife down to carefully shave off the "button" of roots.


Try to cut only the roots. Cutting into the "meat" of the onion will release more of the chemicals that cause tears.Since the layers of the onion are held together at the bottom, this will also make it harder keep a grip on them later.
 Place your knife at the top (uncut) end of the onion. Slice the onion in two with a single clean rocking motion. You'll be left with two even-sized halves.


Immediately turn these onions cut side-down. This prevents tear-causing chemicals from being released into the air.
 With their cut sides facing down, drag the knife across the tips of each onion half. You'll now have two onion halves trimmed at either end.
 Lift the skin at the top end of the onion (the end you just trimmed) and carefully peel it down towards the bottom (root) end. If it breaks or tears, discard the torn-off piece of peel, grab another section, and start peeling again. Repeat for both halves.


You can use the tip of your knife to get the peel started if you're having trouble.
 At this point, your onion is peeled and ready to use. Leave both halves laying cut side-down until you start working with them to prevent tear-causing chemicals from being released into the air.


An onion can still make you cry after you've peeled it, so consult the section below if you'd like to learn a few helpful strategies for reducing your tears both during and after the peeling process.

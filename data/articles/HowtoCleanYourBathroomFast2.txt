 Your shower or tub is one of the areas in the bathroom that gets dirty the fastest. If you can get in the habit of cleaning it as you use it, you’ll have much less work when you clean the entire bathroom. If there is a ring of film around the tub or any marks on the shower walls or door, use your washcloth and warm, soapy water to remove it, and rinse with water from the tap. Don’t get out of the tub or shower without getting rid of that ring.You may want to leave a sponge or scrub brush on a shelf in your shower or tub to help with any stubborn spots that may pop up.
 It may seem simple, but putting away the items that you use in the bathroom after you’re done with them can help keep the space looking tidier. Empty surfaces appear less cluttered, and make it easier to clean. For example, when you’re finished brushing your teeth, put your toothbrush back in its holder and place the tube of toothpaste back in the cabinet or drawer.You may want to add some storage options to your bathroom to make it easier to put items away. For example, you may want to put a draw organizer in your vanity drawer to sort cosmetics, or place a caddy in the cabinet beneath the sink to store hair styling products.
 Just as you probably empty the garbage in your kitchen every night, try to establish the habit of clearing out your bathroom trash daily. That way, it likely won’t be overflowing when guests come to visit, and your bathroom will look neater overall.To make sure that you remember to empty the bathroom wastebasket, try to do it at the same that you take out your kitchen trash to establish a set routine.

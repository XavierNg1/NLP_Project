 The first supply to obtain is the bedspring as it will help you determine the size and shape of the flower pot. Choose your bedspring based on overall design scheme. Bedsprings are typically silver metal so you can either antique the spring for a unique look or you can build your flower Potholder and allow time and the weather to provide that antique appeal.


Make sure the bedspring is in good shape and can hold and accommodate the flower pot.;
, You will need a flower pot that can fit easily inside the smaller end of a bedspring so consider bringing your bedspring with you to the garden shop when shopping for the flower pot.
 The paint and/or glaze is optional depending on the kind of look you hope to achieve. You will need the glue to adhere the pot to the spring and make it a permanent fixture.

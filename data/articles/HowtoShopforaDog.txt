 In order to do this, you can use the Internet or a Yellow Book. This can be a general pet store or a place specifically intended for dogs and puppies.;
, The store is bound to let pets in, and you can shake or rattle the toy in front of your dog to see if they like it.
 If they are trained show-dogs, you might want to look for an advanced hoop or fence for them to jump and train in the backyard. If they are casual types of dogs, then you may want to consider a Frisbee or tennis ball.
 If they don't respond, chances are they aren't amused. If they jump for it or bark, then its probably a toy that suits your dog.
 What does your dog usually eat? If they are the beefy-lovers kind of dog, then you should get beef meals (such as Beneful) or meat-flavored bones and chew sticks. If they are the light, vegetarian kinds, you should stick with a veggie gourmet meal.

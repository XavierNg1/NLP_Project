 Babywearing is supposed to be easy and comfortable, and not every carrier works for every person, but there is a carrier for everyone. Some great resources are www.babywearinginternational.com and www.thebabywearer.com.;
, For example, if you have issues with back pain try to purchase a carrier that offers support over both shoulders rather than just one. Also ensure that your child is comfortable in the carrier. Check for red marks created by fabric digging into skin, constant movement of trying to get comfortable, and make sure that baby's rump is well supported in a deep seat (like sitting in a chair) in the carrier. This will make babywearing more comfortable for both parties involved.
 Some carriers are not designed for newborns or preemies at all, and some come with inserts or different directions for various sizes.
 This will offer discreet nursing while your child lays comfortable within the sling. Please be sure to pay close attention to baby's head position during nursing, and if baby falls asleep, gently adjust them to a more upright position to avoid asphyxia hazards. The Cradle position is great for nursing, but should only be used while baby is actively engaged in nursing.
 Do this for the best positioning. You should be able to tilt your head down and kiss their forehead. Facing out is not recommended because it does not allow for proper hip and pelvis positioning for long term carries. If your baby does not like facing in, look into hip or back carries!

, If your carrier does not have directions for forward facing or back carries, then it was not designed to do so and will not be safe for you or your child.

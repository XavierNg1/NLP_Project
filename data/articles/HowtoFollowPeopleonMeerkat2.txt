 Locate the app on your iOS device and tap on it. The app logo has a picture of a meerkat on yellow background.
 If you’ve used the app before, you won’t need to log in again. Otherwise, tap the “Log in with Twitter” button on the welcome screen.
 You will be brought to the Search screen.
 On top of the Search screen is a search field. Enter the name or Twitter handle of the person you want to follow, and tap the “Search” button on your keypad.
 A list of users matching your search will be displayed. Tap the plus button right beside the name of the one you’d like to follow. The plus button will turn into a check, indicating that you’re following that person.

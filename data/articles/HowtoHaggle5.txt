 Let the seller know if you don't have much money to spend.


I'm unemployed / a student / retired.
I only have (X) to spend this month. Can you make that work?

, Try to convince them to tell you how low they'll go, or at least start making concessions.


What's your range of flexibility on this item?If your competitor can sell it for (X), you probably can as well. (Make sure the comparison is reasonable; don't offend the seller with a comparison to a clearly inferior item.)

, If you appear in a rush, they won't have time to convince you to pay more.


I can pay you in full right now if you go down to (X).
I'm only around this afternoon.
 If they didn't want your item, they wouldn't be haggling for it.


I'm sorry, but I really need (X) for that item.
Any lower and I won't be making any money off it.
 If the buyer won't meet your current price, making a conditional deal will get them out of your hair and still let you sell the item if you don't manage to offload it for a better price.


I'm not willing to sell for that price right now. Come back half an hour before closing and I'll consider it then.I'm going to try to sell it at my price. Why don't you leave me a contact number and I'll phone you if no one's purchased it by the end of the sale?, You appear harder to convince if you claim the decision rests with someone else.


I'd love to buy this, but (my wife/my father) won't let me spend that much.
I'm sorry, but it's company policy not to give discounts.
(The owner/the company) sets the prices. Unfortunately I'm not able to adjust them myself.

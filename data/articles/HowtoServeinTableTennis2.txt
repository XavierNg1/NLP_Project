 Topspin is created by striking the ball with what’s called a “closed racket,” which means you hold the racket facing low toward the ground.These serves work best when they’re fast and hit the back of your opponent’s side of the table., Using a closed racket, brush the top of the ball in a quick forward motion with your racket. The ball will rise as it moves away from you and then curve downward., Backspin uses an “open racket,” which means you hold the racket facing up toward the ceiling.Backspin serves are also known as “under-spin” serves. These low, short serves can be super useful against players who like to attack the ball during the return., Using an open racket, brush the bottom of the ball in a quick forward motion with your racket. Keep the ball low and straight as it travels over the net., Hit the ball on the left to get it to rotate right, and on the right to get it to rotate left. This will cause the ball to bounce in those directions. These tricky serves can be very difficult to return, as your opponent won’t know which direction they need to run in to get the ball., Snapping your wrist gives you really quick contact with the ball, adding speed. This speed will add more spin to your serves, making your serves much more difficult to return. Practice developing this snap every time you serve.

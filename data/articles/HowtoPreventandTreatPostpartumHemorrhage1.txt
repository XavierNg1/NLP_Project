 Identifying and correcting the presence of anemia before child birth can go a long way towards preventing postpartum hemorrhage.


Anemia is a strong precursor hemorrhage, due to the lack of iron in the blood inhibiting blood clotting.
The effects of anemia can be managed by increasing your iron intake throughout the course of your pregnancy.
Using iron supplements and consuming foods that are rich in iron (green leafy vegetables with vitamin C) are a good way to boost your levels of iron.;
, If you are undergoing episiotomy, it should be eliminated because laceration and other forms of trauma can greatly increase your risk of postpartum hemorrhage.


This can only be done if the perineum is a limiting factor in child birth and delivery.
 You should make sure your vital signs are thoroughly evaluated and monitored before being discharged from the delivery room.


A sudden change in your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) can indicate that you are going through shock, which can be a complication of postpartum hemorrhage.
Doctors and nurses should make sure that all your vital signs are stable before rooming you in a recovery area or a general ward.
 Vaginal flow must also be monitored to ensure that you notice hemorrhage immediately.


A significant increase in blood flow is only the tip of the iceberg, revealing a tiny part of what is actually happening inside your body during hemorrhage.
 Active management of the third stage of labor is the best preventive strategy you can use.


This involves the administration of uterotonic medications immediately after delivery, controlled cord traction, and early cord clamping and cutting.

 Whether in class, at social gathering, or out in public, attempts to withdraw from everyone around you will only make you more noticeable. Lone individuals are much more likely to be noticed and remembered than a quiet member of a crowd or group. The better you “fit in,” the more invisible you are.
 When someone addresses you, respond politely and directly, and don’t avoid eye contact. Pay attention in class so you can answer a question if called on by your teacher. Avoiding spreading gossip and say only kind things about others.


There’s no need to engage in a detailed conversation with everyone you meet, but saying thank you to the cashier or bank teller will make them less likely to remember you than looking at your feet and not saying a word.
If you have an issue with someone, address it with them in person. Talking negatively about someone brings more attention to you than to them.
A good rule of thumb is to treat others like you would like to be treated if in their shoes.
 You don’t want to be the center of attention, but you also don’t want to appear to be avoiding it.Sit at a table near other people instead of a dark corner alone. You will look less like an outsider than just another person in the room.
Avoid sitting in the back or front rows in class. The teacher is more likely to call on you if you look like you are trying to hide in the back.
 On the bus or train, use your smartphone or bring a book. Wear headphones when walking around or sitting down. In class, take notes to show you are paying attention.

 Each piece of ribbon should be long enough to tie into a bow.









The sizes can vary if you want to create bows that vary in size for an asymmetrical effect.
Range the ribbon sizes from 6 to 10 inches (15 1/4 to 25 1/2 cm).
Choose ribbons with different colors and textures to create something more visually interesting.
 Knot each ribbon into a standard "rabbit ear" bow.









Depending on the condition your ribbons are in, you may want to iron them flat before tying them in order to create a smoother bow.
Double knot the bow at the center to create a sturdier bow, if desired.
Trim the ends of the ribbon after you tie them into bows so that they look even.
 Vary the lengths of twine by 1 inch (2.5 cm).









Make the first piece of twine roughly 15 inches (38 cm). Every piece you cut after that should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller.
 Thread each piece of twin through the backs of one bow, at the center loop. Tie a simple knot to keep the bow on the twine.









For extra security, consider double knotting the twine onto the bow.
 Tie the other end of each piece of twine to the wooden embroidery hoop.









Space each piece of twine around the hoop evenly. Note that it may be easier to arrange an even number of strands than an odd number.
Arrange the pieces of twine so that they ascend in height from longest the shortest. This creates a spiral-like appearance.
 Cut two pieces of twine that are about twice as long as the length of the hoop's diameter. Tie these pieces to the embroidery hoop, crossing them at the center.









Knot or double knot the twine onto the embroidery hoop to secure it on place.
The pieces of twine should be perpendicular to each other over the top of the hoop.
Loop one piece of twine around the center of the other piece so that they are joined together.
When it comes time to hang your mobile, hang it from the center loop created by your crossing twine.

 This mask needs to be big enough to cover the forehead and about an inch (2.54 centimeters) below the eyes. Measure across and down the person's face, then draw a mask shape based on those measurements.


You can also use an existing mask as a template.
You will be placing colored fabric across this mask, so make sure that it is tall enough.
 If you want to, you can add a slight curve or groove to the bottom-center of the mask for the nose bridge. Don't worry about the eye holes just yet.
 The strip needs to be long enough so that you can wrap it around the person's head, tie it in a knot, and have a couple of inches left over. It needs to be wide enough to cover the eyes, but without covering the green mask. What color the fabric is depends on what turtle the person wants to be:Donatello = purple
Leonardo = blue
Michelangelo = orange
Raphael = red

, Place the fabric strip across the mask, right where the eyes would go. Make sure that the fabric is centered, with equal amounts hanging off to either side. Once you are happy with the placement, secure the fabric to the mask with hot glue or fabric glue.If you are using fabric glue, let the glue dry before moving on to the next step.
 The easiest way to do this would be to measure the distance between the person's eyes, and then draw the eye holes on the mask.You can also drape the foam across your face, make marks where your eyes are, then draw the eyes out.


Make the eye holes almond-shaped.
 The easiest way to do this would be with a craft blade. If you don't have one, cut a slit in the center of each eye, then cut around the lines that you drew., If the fabric is loose around the eyeholes, secure it with more glue. For an added touch, cut the ends of the fabric strip at angles. You could also cut notches into them as well.

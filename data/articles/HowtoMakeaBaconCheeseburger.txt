, Mix the oatmeal, onions and ground beef together until the meat is thoroughly beaten. Roll the meat into a ball, then flatten it to form a patty.
 Turn the stove burner to high heat, put the pan on the burner, and place the patty into the pan. When the pan starts getting hot, turn the burner down to medium heat. Cook the patties for approximately 7-8 minutes on each side, until they're golden brown. Place another pan on an open burner, turn it on to medium and put bacon on the pan until it's cooked completely, about 15-20 minutes.
 Once the bacon and burger patties have finished cooking, place the cheese and bacon on the patties. Carefully place the patty on the hamburger buns then add the mustard, relish, ketchup, tomatoes and lettuce. Serve the burger when you're done assembling it.

 Wooden doors are much more likely to break than metal doors if they get rammed or kicked. If it is in your budget, take your old wooden door out and replace it with a sturdy metal one. Metal doors are not usually solid, but are paneled with metal sheeting.Metal doors are heavier, which makes them harder to kick in. Metal also doesn’t splinter like wood does.
 When a door is kicked in, it often breaks past the strike plate, which is where the door latches. A deadbolt adds more resistance. If you don’t have much experience with this type of work, you may want to hire someone to install a deadbolt for you.It doesn’t hurt to have more than one deadbolt. Add a second one if you already have one.
Installing a deadbolt requires that you drill holes through the door. You’ll then attach part of the deadbolt to the front and back of the door. Carve a hole in the door frame and then screw the strike plate into the frame.
 Remove your old strike plate. Buy a heavy-duty steel strike plate at a hardware store. If the new strike plate is larger, be sure to chisel out a larger place on the door frame. Use three inch (7.6 cm) screws to secure the plate to the door frame.Your current strike plate probably does not have three inch (7.6 cm) screws, but using longer screws makes the strike plate stronger.

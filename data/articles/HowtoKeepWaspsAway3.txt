 Pour two tablespoons (1 oz) of dish soap into a spray bottle of water. Shake the bottle to mix the solution up – it should get a little frothy. Stand as far away from the existing nest as possible and soak the nest with the spray., You can make one on your own by cutting the top off a two-liter pop bottle. Spray the inside of the bottle with a bit of sugar water, and replace the top of the pop bottle by turning it upside down in the bottom of the bottle. Tape the two pieces together and leave it out in your yard. You can also buy wasp traps in the store., This is especially important if you’re allergic to wasp stings. In that case, or if you’ve discovered a big nest, it’s best to call a pest control expert to take care of the nest for you.

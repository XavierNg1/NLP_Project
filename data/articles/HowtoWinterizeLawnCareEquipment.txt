 Preparing them for winter storage is a waste of time, if the following week, a warm spell has the grass growing again, but usually a lawn will go dormant after the first significant frost.;
, For a mower, this means cleaning underneath the mower deck, as well as around the engine compartment and any accessories (leaf bagger, drive gears, etc).  Don't spray water on engine parts that can corrode and cause problems later, or around the carburetor or air intake, doing so is just asking for trouble.
 Some recommend leaving the tank completely full to prevent condensation from forming in the tank, but storing any gasoline engine powered device in a shed or garage with a full fuel tank is not a safe practice.
 This will leave only a small residue of unburnt fuel in the intake and carburetor, which will be dealt with later.
  If any dust or debris has collected around the filter assembly, close the carburetor throat and use compressed air to blow it clean before proceeding.
 While an assistant pulls the crank rope (or operates the starter, if equipped) spray fogging oil into the carb throat so that it coats the cylinder wall, bore, piston, and intake manifold. Four or five quick shots of fogging oil and several pulls of the rope should do the trick. Replace the air filter with a new one, if needed, otherwise, reassemble it to keep trash and bugs out of your engine.
 Unhook the battery (if equipped) and place it on a trickle charger long enough to make sure it is fully charged. It is generally a good idea to store a lead acid battery where moderate temperatures are maintained, if possible, but do not store where the terminals can be accidentally shorted out, it can be knocked over, or directly on a concrete floor.
 Secure it loosely to prevent dust and debris from covering it, and park it in a garage or shed for the winter months.
